Besides engineering, it's one of the most valuable degrees you can get. Many companies don't care about you grades if you're in CS / Engineering, they care about your experience, intelligence, etc. I would strongly recommend working on a startup idea on the side and/or getting an internship in the semester (if no startup) or a full-time internship next summer. Grades are important, but honestly if you have around a 3.0 - 3.2 and you're doing a technical field and you got good startup / internship experience, you're much better than a 4.0 CS guy with very little experience, hands down.",1312329399

There is an incredible sense of helpfulness in the startup community and a pay it forward/back attitude.  When new entrepreneurs, or old alike, reach out for help, your first instinct is to help them because you know how hard it is to be an entrepreneur.  This is despite being super busy and drained yourself.  So, when you make time for someone, even though you may not have much time to give, it's quite a waste when they take it for granted.  It's not about holding a grudge, more about making a decision to help the people who respect your time and value it, and not wasting your time helping people who seem not to.",1312329144

I'm originally from New York, and I know lots of good engineers who grew up there, but quickly realized that you don't make anything more for working in New York versus San Francisco, Austin, or Denver.<p>Yes, you can afford a place in Manhattan on an engineer's salary. But it's going to be too small for a family, and if you want a bigger place you're going to need to do a long commute. Compare that with other cities where a well-paid software engineer is at the top end of the income ladder and can rent out a full house for what they'd pay for a 2-bedroom in NY.<p>(And yes, it's even a lot more expensive than SF. I've looked at apartments in both cities - while rents in SF are comparable to New York, you're still generally getting a much larger place for the same price. That matters if you have kids.)<p>Brooklyn and Queens are nice (if not that much cheaper for the areas near Manhattan.)

I've known folks who came out of school truly arrogant bastards and then after a few years of exposure to the 'real' word mellowed like a good wine into something great. And have known folks who were great when I knew them, and then discovered on re-connecting that they had lost their way. The short of it is, holding a grudge against a person's past misdeeds isn't really very productive. As a manager you give your employees annual performance reviews and advice on what they should work on, so if I've not 'known' someone for a couple or three years or more I reset all my specific expectations to zero to get a sense of the person they are <i>now</i> versus the person they were <i>then.</i>",1312327827

2839118,comment,2837905,2837905,3,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"I don't 'get it'.  Sounds like an easy question and not ""The Mother of All Interview Questions"".<p>But, for me, part of the answer is that the ""process"" has involved solving practical problems only in part with software, and some of the ""invention"" has been not really in the software.<p>Do the following examples count?<p>(1) A prof wrote a package for statistics for students and in the testing found that one of the operations was too slow and another one gave numerically poor results.<p>For the slow operation, looking, there were two loops, each that ran in time proportional to n^2. Using the existing storage in a tricky way, I converted the loops to (n)ln(n) which was then plenty fast.<p>For the bad numerical result, I used some orthogonal polynomials instead of statistics normal equations, and that solved the numerical accuracy problem.<p>(2) At a growing company, the Board wanted some revenue projections.  There wasn't much for ideas, so I got involved.  We knew the current revenue.  We knew the maximum long term revenue because of the capacity we had in mind.  Revenue growth was to be 'viral'. So, let t denote time in days with t = 0 the current time.  Let the revenue at time t be y(t). So, y(0) is the current revenue.  Let b be the maximum revenue.<p>From virality, the growth rate in revenue should be proportional to (i) the revenue from current customers y(t) and (ii) the revenue from the customers not yet served (b - y(t)).<p>The growth rate in revenue is dy(t)/dt = y'(t), that is, the calculus first derivative of y(t).  So for some constant k,<p><pre><code>     y'(t) = k y(t) (b - y(t))
</code></pre>
Solve for y(t) in closed form, select a reasonable k, and done.<p>(3) A company had a cute marketing opportunity and wanted to allocate marketing resources the best way.  They formulated the problem as a 0-1 integer linear program (ILP) maximization problem with, for a first test case, 40,000 constraints and 600,000 variables.  Seeing that no ILP package would take that problem as it was, they tried a genetic heuristic, ran for days, and quit.<p>I looked at the problem, saw an approach via non-linear duality theory and Lagrange multipliers.  So, the dual problem was to minimize a convex function approximated by some hyperplanes.<p>I wrote the software, and after 500 hyperplanes had a good approximation to the dual and a feasible solution to the original problem within 0.025% of the optimal answer.<p>(4) Another company had another cute marketing problem and wanted to allocate resources to maximize results.  The problem was integer linear programming again, but I saw that it was also a problem in least cost network flows on a network with integers for arc capacities.  So, use the network simplex algorithm and get an optimal answer quickly with the integer constraints honored for free.<p>(5) A software project was to analyze some data collected at sea.  I looked at the specification for estimating the power spectra and saw some problems:  For the low frequency resolution they wanted, they needed too much data.  To illustrate, I wrote some software to generate a sample path of a second order stochastic process with a known power spectrum, accumulate the sample power spectrum, and showed how slowly the sample power spectrum converged to the spectrum of the process.  This work surprised and pleased the customer, and we got the competitive software contract.<p>(6) In a project, needed to look at a few million numbers and end up with the, say, 100 largest.  So, go to classic heap sort, and start with an ascending heap of 100 locations that has the 100 largest so far and with the smallest at the root of the implicit tree of the heap.  So, given the next one of the 100 million numbers, one comparison with that root value says if that next number is among the 100 largest so far; if so, then replace the root value with the next value and 'sift' to rebuild the heap.<p>The worst case would be given the 100 million numbers in ascending order in which case the computational time complexity should be proportional to (n)ln(n) for n = 100 million.  Otherwise for large n the execution time should be only slightly slower than proportional to n (exercise:  for n independent, identically distributed numbers with a distribution absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure so that the probability of ties is zero, find the actual expected running time up to a constant of proportionality).<p>(7) A server reports numerical data on each of 10 variables at 20 a second.  You have data from three months when, from that data and more evidence, the server seemed to be 'healthy'.<p>Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to implement real time monitoring for this server that uses the data from the three months and also real time data.  Your solution will be a statistical hypothesis test with known, adjustable Type I error (false alarm rate).  Your work will necessarily be the world's first class of statistical hypothesis tests that are both multi-variate and distribution-free.  You need to show that your test is not 'trivial', and for that consider the classic S. Ulam result on 'tightness'.  You should also show that in a powerful sense, asymptotically the test is best possible in a sense similar to the classic Neyman-Pearson result.<p>Also, design and implement a fast algorithm for the computations.<p>Do such examples count?",1312327560

I think, as you said, there is a lot more to this than just bandwidth measurements.  For example, last November a bunch of DNS servers went down in Comcast's networks that essentially meant no Internet for the majority of people that don't know how to configure public DNS.<p>We're working to eventually get a much finer grain survey of performance (e.g. a neighborhood), by piggy backing on network-intensive applications (currently BitTorrent).  In addition to throughput, we're looking at things such as packet loss, latency (the last-mile in particular), time-of-day effects, as well as using traceroutes for underlying forward-path analysis.<p>My point is, if anyone has any ideas for other applications (something like Netflix would be great) to leverage, metrics to include, or advice, I'd be happy to hear them. :)",1312327187
