2839516,comment,2839137,2839137,20,0,law,,,"I really hope that this portends advances in other government agencies, as well. The judiciary, for example, is in massive need of an overhaul on this scale. Each of the 13 federal courts of appeals have their own methods for publishing opinions on their web site, and it's often difficult to keep track of opinions published in each. Additionally, the 94 district courts also publish opinions, so it's difficult to get access to those, without paying for an aggregation service (Lexis or Westlaw). Justia does a good job, as well, but they only provide pdfs of the opinions. We're also familiar with the PACER data mining issues surrounding Aaron Swartz, so it's almost impossible to freely access and analyze all of that data.<p>And then there are the state courts of last resort, intermediate appellate courts, and trial courts...each having their own way of publishing decisions. In short, it's often really difficult, if not efficiently impossible, to gain access to public records to perform high-level analyses on them. This is so unfortunate, because at our disposal right now are extremely powerful computers and amazingly robust algorithms that could perform really complex, revealing, and important analyses of litigated issues.",1312336492

I broke methods into a few classes, two of which are ""Block-Required"" and ""Block-Optional.""<p>I had to write software which proved a method optionally yielded, which isn't just undecidable, but <i>unrecognizable</i>.  For non-CS folks, that means it's actually <i>harder</i> than the halting problem.

I noticed that my own coding improved dramatically after I started working with others. This is due to several things: (1) competition and trying to be better than others, (2) once you work with several people, you take extra time to document what you are doing, which occasionally leads to you rethinking <i>how</i> you should be doing what you are doing in the first place, (3) don't know about you, but I am personally far more prone to taking ""shortcuts"" when working on my own (no one to embarrass myself in front of), (4) last but not least, when working with others, you can learn directly from others.",1312335195

When you have that answered, it makes everything else easier.  Your whole app becomes a direct path to your user's personalized ""ooh cool!"" moment.  Your front page shows a 1-2-3-ooh-cool! sequence.<p>It sounds like you're trying to help your users find people that like the same stuff they do.  The idea has got potential, but there's no ""ooh cool!"" moment in this app yet.  It'd be ""ooh cool!"" if I was somehow having a beer with the five users that shared my interests, but my options for hanging out with them are kinda limited.<p>One idea that occurs to me is to tell your users ""I bet you'd like xyz!"" where xyz is a song or a piece of art or what have you.  Then you could have them say ""Yup!"" or ""No, that sucks"".  This little interaction could be tied back to the people that liked xyz, and they could be informed of it when it turns out well.  This has two potential ""ooh cool!"" moments: a user sees something new, and if he likes it and clicks that button, then other users are somehow informed that others like their tastes.<p>Other misc notes: normalize shared likes by total # of likes, make ""follow"" buttons more prominent, and make the pages less static (some kind of live activity update would be good).<p>Good luck!

My motivation for using Rails was that it was what I knew the best. Luckily for me, the most time-consuming part was the front-end, not the Rails part, so I'm hoping my switch to Node will be relatively painless.",1312333458

I'm a woman, I used to write long business articles for magazines, and I'd often use a war motif for those articles (common thing to use a motif --  offers art choices and/or keeps the writer entertained). War just gives you lots of great word choices (""bombarded"" ""invades"" etc.)that seemed to go well in business articles, esp when you're looking at one company vs. another or a new one breaking into the market.<p>It's kinda like how you often see ""capitulate"" somewhere in an article about France (even if not related) -- it just works together ;-)",1312333372

RIM has killed themselves by trying to out-increment features on a handheld email machine all the while ignoring, or failing to perceive as relevant how both iPhone and Android were irreversibly changing the basis of competition.<p>RIM's only survival strategy is to stop playing catchup with me-too products that the market has already passed, and to offer something different leveraging their proprietary platform if possible, but satisfying and targeting a completely different market need, such as doing mobile social more elegantly or something like that. I'm in process of writing a detailed analysis of RIM's missteps that have enabled disruption, and why their current strategy is pointing them to oblivion.
