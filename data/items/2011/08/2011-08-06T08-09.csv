2853459,comment,2852380,2853006,4,0,crander,,,"Sure, but you are arguing for short-term spending vs long term capital investment.  Basically you are arguing that you don't need to get more sleep, you'll just have a red-bull tonight.  So the red-bull is better than getting more sleep in general.<p>If you take all the money (100%) from people who build and make things and give it to people who don't have jobs to spent, in the short term things will be bought and everything thing will appear stimulated.  In the long run your entire economy will collapse as your capital base erodes.  The basic Keynesian error is to not distinguish between purely consumptive (why don't create jobs to build ships, fill them full of gold and new technology, and then drive them into the Pacific and sink them?) and productive goods which actually build economic wealth and raise the standard of living.",1312621186
2853458,comment,2853390,2853390,2,0,jamesbrewer,,,"Contrary to popular belief, Americans aren't actually stupid. We just have a bunch of idiots running our country.\n Even Obama admitted that the American people should not have to pay for the mistakes of the people on Capitol Hill.<p>Personally, I think S&P's decision to drop America's AAA credit rating down to AA+ was the right decision. Someone needed to call us out on our bullshit. S&P said months ago that, to keep our AAA credit rating, we needed to raise the debt ceiling a develop a “creditable” plan to tackle the nation's long-term debt.<p>We managed to strike a deal that allowed us to raise the debt ceiling, but that's all we did. We have yet to come up with a way to fix our debt problems. The important thing is that S&P didn't say “Well they tried, so they can keep their credit rating.” Instead, they are holding America accountable for it's actions, which is what should have been done ages ago. Whats the point of having a “debt ceiling” if we're going to continue to raise it? We raised the debt ceiling 7 times while George W. Bush was president – that's 7 times in 8 years.<p>America could be the greatest country on Earth (I think it already is, but thats just my patriotism talking) if we stopped wasting money and came up with an effective plan to start tackling our problems one by one. We have a lot of work to do and hopefully losing our AAA credit rating will get the ball rolling.",1312621176

2853443,comment,2851470,2852808,3,0,chipsy,,,"You reminded me of an interesting thought. The industrial revolution involved advances in information only incrementally; we went from letter-writing to (eventually) phone and television. The new mediums were very unambiguously new platforms each time.<p>But now we have a set of platforms(computers themselves, the operating systems, the networks, etc.) for all digitally encodable forms of information. We keep building new platforms on top of these systems; and the rate at which the platforms appear is increasing; 10 years ago you could not do the kinds of trivially focused apps that have become today's cliche.<p>This is a point of fundamental difference from productivity advancements in the industrial era; better machines meant more resources mined, more goods finished and delivered. And communication remained expensive throughout that period; I can recall long-distance calls still being relatively costly in my childhood(80s, early 90s).<p>In contrast, better information implies doing more with less, in the physical sense of time and effort. Taken to its literal extreme we have Twitter as an example - a broadcasting medium without the formality and overhead of TV or radio.<p>And if our advancements from here on out are mostly based on doing ""less"" and not ""more"" physically, the whole way in which our economy is measured today is going to become increasingly wrong.",1312620676

To me, America seems to be in this situation, yet the anti-tax sentiment is so strong here that that stark reality is never addressed honestly.

Then Congress has only one knob to fiddle with, how much they want to spend.  By letting them decide completely independently how much they want to make we expose ourselves to the obvious outcome, that a lot more goes out than comes in, and that's never going to be properly addressed unless we take it on directly.",1312620635

Google wants it so bad they are willing to lose a lot of money now hoping it will pay off in future when everyone has Androids. Apple (and Microsoft) who cannot use this model (they don't dominate in ads or search markets) obviously don't like this.<p>No need to wait for the future, Andy Rubin and Eric Schmidt have stated that Android is already profitable, through advertising revenue.  That Microsoft and Apple can't compete with Google's business model is not unfair, it's business: they aren't <i>owed</i> profits, they must earn it.<p>In any case, you might as well say that Apple-Software ""licenses"" Apple-Hardware iOS for ""free"" and makes money from the App Store.  Is it ""unfair"" that the Android Market doesn't dominate developer attention like the App Store has?  And Microsoft in particular is trying to build its own search and ad presence, so they might in theory adopt Google's model; that they aren't successful enough to drop licensing fees is tough luck.<p>In any case, I'm not entirely unsympathetic to concerns that advertising-driven business models may cheapen software in the long term, but that this somehow justifies some pseudo-conspiracy to take down Android with patent litigation just flabbergasts me.",1312619907

I can have a billion shares, if I want, in a company that isn't worth anything at all.)   But, expect around what you'd get as a valley engineer working for an established company; $100K+ per year base salary, depending on location and experience, of course.<p>Really, if you have good experience and job prospects,  You probably don't want to be an employee of a startup without money. If you have good job prospects, insist on a reasonable salary /or/ become a founder.

I agree that Bush's medicare giveaway to industrial pharma was grossly irresponsible and that it has contributed a massive amount to the crater that currently is US fiscal policy. And I do not honestly know how people who consider themselves conservatives could support either that or the tax cuts, especially when the United States was on course to actually pay off its national debt.<p>Returning to the issue of social security, the statistic Fisher cites comes from Table IV.B6 of the trustees’ report, which is extremely conservative in its assumptions (assuming essentially zero productivity growth over the next 50 years) and thus - even at the worst - would require only a minor tax addition to permanently solve without reducing benefits.<p>I do not much like your suggestion that since the Republicans instituted tax cuts the surplus is gone and there's nothing we can do about it, but will add only that if Gore's proposal had been adopted (Republicans at the time were championing the terrible idea of dumping social security funds into the stock market while cutting top-end taxes), even the ""infinite horizon"" figure would be nowhere near where it currently is and it would likely be possible to reduce the payroll tax or increase benefits. And given all this, I don't know how to reconcile your claim that this is not a Republican problem with the fact you claim to be a rational fiscal conservative.",1312618412

Comfort over anything else.<p>On the other hand, this does open opportunities; Spain has one of the highest unemployment % of the world because of this; people want stable jobs and they want them provided on a silver platter, but there really is not too little work.
