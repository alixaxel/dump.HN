Let's assume for a moment the hypothetical student in this scenario is bright enough to tell the difference between literally describing a thing, and expressing an abstraction of it.<p>So basically then, the thing we're all supposedly getting in a kerfluffle about is that the example program in a hypothetical textbook that introduces the concept of inheritance is a cheap duck simulator. Ducks are a corny example, so I think it's fair to dismiss it as bland.  But talking about physical objects is a great way to introduce inheritance to a novice because inheritance is fundamentally about hierarchical abstraction (code simplicity and reuse, incidentally, are side benefits enjoyed by all methods of abstraction).  And what easier way to talk about hierarchical abstraction than the most accessible mental model already possessed by anyone who made it out of elementary school  the animal kingdom.  The easiest pedagogical metaphors to grasp for students without special knowledge are those that draw similarities to what they already know.<p>OO is about a lot of other things too. But concepts such as Dependency Injection, which was the meat of the grandfather rant, are IMHO more an outgrowth of dealing with the limitations of OO design than a topic so fundamental to objects and classes that they need to be discussed when you're still talking about fundamentals like these.  Are they good things to know about?  Definitely.  Will a student's mind be warped by basic inheritance example that imitates a taxonomy he already understands?  As long as the whole book isn't about duck modeling, probably not, and even then I'm not sure you couldn't teach <IQuackable> FactoryFactories with a little imagination.",1314068393

I'd suggest that if you are trying to prevent such errors with a coding convention rather than tests, that's a process smell.<p>Coding conventions don't <i>detect</i> errors, they just help to make them more obvious. For instance, if the variables had been named ""cake"" and ""slice"", it probably would have been a bit more obvious which side of the '-' sign each one should be on.<p>In any case, it's not an either-or choice between coding conventions and tests. A sensible developer will have both.<p>> In practice, I find it best to avoid non-commutative functions with two arguments of the same type.<p>I guess there's a silent ""..where possible"" attached to that? :-) There are many times where it's not possible, or at least not sensible; and having too many type conversions in your code can be just as bad for readability as having too few.",1314067494

I have a few questions...<p>> Without the earnings boost that comes from a college degree, these students are likely to struggle to pay back their student loan debt, setting themselves up for defaultin turn, hurting our economy even more. And at a time when people without degrees have higher employment rates, college dropouts are more likely to need government-provided social services like food stamps.<p>Has it been shown that the multiplier effect of a total of random college degrees is larger than the multiplier effect of food stamps we've all heard about?<p>> Of course, the majority of students don't drop out because they're lazy and don't feel like going to class. Affordability is a huge factorif you're working so many hours that you don't have time to study or go to class, quitting can seem like a good idea.<p>So students drop out because they can't afford school. Does this mean the loan amounts should be more? What about for degrees averaging higher incomes, thus graduates having a larger chance of paying off the loan in a reasonable amount of time?<p>Re: the actual billions figure... the PDF says they take their income estimates from the median income in each state of degree holders vs. non-degree holders and measure the differences, which range from about $8k-$12k. So while this is a decent indicator that ""degree > no degree"", it doesn't tell you what degree to get. Are the countless theology, english lit, and other ""soft"", ""artsy"" degrees really worth it? Or do corporations still frequently require any degree from anywhere to apply to be their drone, making such degrees possibly worthwhile for the income aspect? Would be interesting to compare the median incomes of different degrees to the median incomes of people with no degree.",1314067355

Meaning: you probably already grok it, but you _think_ you don't because it's Emacs, damn it!, it's supposed to be hard and complex and bend the fabric of space and time!<p>But its essence is actually quite simple: it's a toolbox for all things text. Not a _tool_, mind you; a toolbox. It _contains_ tools. Lots and lots of them. Oh, and it has funny keyboard shortcuts.<p>So here is Emacs in a nutshell:<p>1. ""find-file"" is a function;<p>2. you can ""M-x any-function"" to invoke it;<p>3. you can assign a shortcut like ""C-x C-f"" to any function;<p>4. you can define your own functions in the same language Emacs itself is written (i.e., you can really extend Emacs, not only call some simpleton API);<p>5. you customize Emacs' settings and behaviors by changing some variables (""please highlight the line the point is currently on"").<p>That's pretty much it. Yes, there is a mountain of functions and variables and modes that are complicated and interconnected and you _will_ spend some time configuring everything. But the gist, the essence, the core -- that's it. You've already grokked Emacs. Now you can learn one function at a time and extend your knowledge of it little by little. It doesn't have to be more complicated than that.<p>The modes? Well, remember, Emacs is a toolbox. Each mode is a tool, specialized in some area of the Great Forest of Text Editing. There's a mode that will help you save keystrokes (yasnippet); there's a mode that will help you write code in the language X (x-mode); there's a mode that will help you open files and buffers easily (ido, anything); there's a mode that will help you with your todos and prose-like text (org-mode).<p>Regarding org-mode specifically: you can spend weeks using only ONE shortcut, Shift-TAB, and already it will be extremely useful. Then you'll wish for some feature (like adding tags to headlines), and you'll find that it's already implemented. And that pattern will repeat, and repeat, and soon you'll be using lots of advanced features, and you won't even notice, because it'll have become a natural thing.<p>I hope this makes sense. And, just to be clear: I know a size does not fit all. I did not write this to say ""everyone should like Emacs, look, I proved it"". This is just my experience with it. I hope it's useful to someone.",1314066932

After all, we only ever (at the moment) handle exceptions for you, and so there is curiosity. Is it really necessary, my customer will ask. He considers, perhaps, that the proxy is some clever ploy, a small glimpse at our plans for world domination. A lovely thought, if only it were so. Developers in particular have a tendency to believe that what Proxino does can be done dynamically. They are mistaken.<p>In a general sense, what Proxino does is a form of global exception handling, a way to catch every exception that occurs within your Javascript. To their credit, our customers correctly suspect that some approximation of this can be achieved dynamically. For it certainly can. Here is a naive first pass attempt at such a global handler, no proxy required:<p>window.onerror = function(e){ console.log(e) }<p>Unfortunately, window.onerror does not work in every browser, nor on every piece of code. It will fail to catch some exceptions raised by elements of jQuery, and other similarly complex libraries. Its a simple one-liner, and it sort of works. But quite often, sort of is not enough.<p>With a bit more care  and a lot more code  a clever programmer can find dynamic work arounds for most browsers and most popular libraries. However in the general case, a global exception handler constructed dynamically is something of an elusive, asymptotic state. You are simply not going to get there. And this brings me to my point. Proxino is not interested in most. We want to catch, and tell you about, everything that goes wrong in your Javascript. Enter the proxy.<p>When a request reaches proxy.proxino.com, we lookup your existing code, parse it into AST form, and walk down the tree inserting special try/catch blocks within each function definition, as well as around the file itself. We then serve this instrumented file to your users, and handle every exception that occurs. Naturally, we have optimized this process for speed (with caching, etc.) but this guarantees us  and more importantly, you  complete code coverage. You will know about every exception.<p>Dynamic approaches are incredibly convenient in some ways, but in the general case they simply dont work. And so there is a Good reason for the proxy. Hope this helps.""",1314066454
