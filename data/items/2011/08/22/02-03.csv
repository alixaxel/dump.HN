Additionally: all people are the same, and have always been.<p>Even when you do not actively try to play for an audience which has exclusivist tendencies, your art (music) will invariably end up used in a very specific way. There are invisible relations of power behind most of the things that people do, art and music being no exception. In school, we were taught that it is not nice to be exclusivist, however that is not how the world works. Similarly, in school we were taught that desiring power is a bad thing, while it isn't in fact (as long as this desire is productive).<p>Take a simple example: a guy meets a girl (or the other way around) and asks her what music she listens to. Music taste is a way in which connections are established between individuals (connections between people have a lot to do with power so stay with me...). Now this connection will mean relatively little if the music that both the girl and the guy like can be commonly heard on the radio. The connection will mean <i>a lot</i> if the music they both like is relatively obscure. And it's not just music. Anything, really, that is rare <i>and</i> is shared between two individuals becomes <i>special</i> -- i.e. becomes a nearly fetishistic object signifying the commonality between the two individuals. It's very beautiful actually. And it's all based on exclusivity. Side-note: the ""commonality"" I am talking about probably has a lot to do with Shannon's entropy and information transferred between the two individuals.",1313981848

2911095,comment,2909490,2909881,0,0,oofoe,,,"While it is true that NewLisp isn't going to win any awards from either the Avant /or/ the Vieille Garde, I would argue that just because its philosophy is different from what you believe is most performant doesn't make it a bad language. Ruby's defenders should back me up on that...<p>As I understand it, scoping is handled by ""contexts"", which can be inconvenient if you expect every function to be a single standalone snowflake, but just fine if you`re tossing off quick scripts which don`t require hermetic degrees of encapsulation. You can also force scope by using 'let' or declaring private variables as arguments, among other things. Certainly Emacs Lisp seems to do OK with similar constraints.<p>As mentioned elsewhere in this post, the deep copy thing may not be as bad as you make it out to be -- certainly it's never particularly troubled me.<p>As for cons... It seems to me that cons is a rather obsolete construct, referring to a long obsolesced hardware feature. I can't get too unhappy about someone trying to make it more immediately useful in a modern context.<p>We've talked about what you don't like about it -- here's what I think NewLisp has gotten very much right:<p><pre><code>  * It's simple to use.\n  * It's small and self contained.\n  * It has a REPL and you can do introspection. \n  * It has conveniently and reasonably named built-in functions.\n  * It deals well with a UNIX-derived file system.\n  * It's easy to pick up and start using, but you can still do fancy stuff.\n  * The documentation contains worked out examples for every built in function.\n  * The main developer is very responsive and helpful.\n  * Trivially cross-platform with downloads, not compiles.\n</code></pre>\nI have found NewLisp to be very convenient for many of the problems I have applied it to. I have used it for everything from dynamic web pages to image processing to ad-hoc render farms. So, I certainly feel that it may be invaluable for someone who is interested in Lisp, but has been intimidated or discouraged by the ""official"" compilers and needs to get some real world work done.",1313981580

Caveat entrepreneur.<p>My answer to the poll (for these and most other legal documents) is that we produce a serious draft ourselves first, and then take it to a decent lawyer for review.<p>Our experience has been that asking lawyers (and accountants) to draft documentation from scratch is rarely cost-effective. If they aren't already very familiar with your business, you're just going to get whatever they can throw together in a couple of hours based on a loose understanding of what you do, partly because you're probably not paying for any more than that, and partly because they probably don't have enough detail from your preliminary discussions to produce something better anyway. Then you're effectively going to rewrite much of it yourself just to explain to them how things really work in enough detail to work with, and you're still going to go and see them again afterwards for fine-tuning.<p>Edit: We do, however, sometimes have a preliminary call/meeting with a lawyer to find out what sorts of headings we ought to be filling out and ask about any tricky areas so we have some understanding before we try to draft anything. But we still do the drafting ourselves, even if it's just a plain English but detailed description of what we want to say that the lawyers can work on later.",1313981422

You can live very, very comfortably in Beijing on about $2k USD per month, including the cost of a private tutor, food, entertainment, and travel.<p>That means six months in-country for less than the tuition of the Institute. Six months of daily use plus intensive study will move you, terms of proficiency, ahead of 90% of people that hold degrees in Chinese.<p>You could do something like this even in less westerner-friendly countries, and learn a million times more than you will at any language school -- there is absolutely no substitute for actual experience.",1313978550

We observe phenomena all around us, and if you try to describe what it is, and ask ""why"" enough times then you get down to the discussion of what frame of reference we use to observe the universe.  We have a body of knowledge, and we tack on new observations onto that body, occasionally the body reforms and the philosophy changes.  Every learner has a philosophy.<p>Philosophy is where the rubber meets the road in figuring out what our universe is.  Is matter a particle or a wave or other, it depends on your existing perspective, your philosophy.",1313978432
