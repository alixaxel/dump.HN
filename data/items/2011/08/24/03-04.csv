2919387,comment,2919095,2919266,3,0,spacemanaki,,,"I think the classic example of using anonymous functions is probably as arguments to map, filter, reduce, etc:<p><pre><code>  > (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x x)) (list 1 2 3 4))\n  (2 4 6 8)\n</code></pre>\nIn that case, the anonymous function doesn't close over anything. Here's an example where it does (from On Lisp):<p><pre><code>  > (defun list+ (lst n)\n      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x n))\n              lst))\n  > (list+ (list 1 2 3) 10)\n  (11 12 13)\n</code></pre>\nIn this case `n` is closed over.<p>Both of these ARE pretty trivial, but the point I'm trying to make is that anonymous functions in many cases just make some code a bit more concise and avoids the need for nested named functions, which I guess is common in Python where `lambda` can only contain an expression.<p>I'm reading On Lisp now, and there are some examples early on of functions that return functions. In those cases, the functions being returned are almost always anonymous, just because naming them would be kind of verbose and unnecessary.<p>There are other, more complicated uses, for instance closures can be used as a sort of crude way of making objects, and supporting hacky encapsulation, which is described in a lot of Scheme textbooks, like SICP: <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-21.html#%_sec_3.2.3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-21.html...</a><p>As for functional programming, it's a lot more than just first-class, anonymous and higher order functions. It also encourages or enforces pure functions: functions in the mathematical sense that do not have side effects, and always return the same value given the same arguments.<p>SICP is a good start, if you're curious about Lisp. It's a great book. There's other places too though, to get this stuff, if you wanted to dive into the Haskell world via Learn you a Haskell I'm sure you'd see some of what FP is about. I'm less familiar with it though.<p>edited for clarity and fix the SICP link",1314158051

The important thing is functions aren't special, they can be passed around (i.e. the are 1st class objects).<p>I actually can't fathom having to code in a language in which you can't pass functions around.<p>Call backs is my biggest use of function passing.  This is really, really huge.<p>Currying, decorating/wrapping functions<p>Replacing methods/functions at run time. Great for testing.<p>Putting them in data structures. Often dictionaries. Often to create more dynamic switch like logic.  dict[key] = func_that_handles_key, etc.  then later, dict[key](key)<p>Lots of data is code stuff.<p>Closures just make the passed functions more powerful / convenient as they capture their scope.  Which is often used (at least by me in Python) to create function factories that return custom functions.<p>A contrived example but a pattern I use often.  Logging object with warn, debug, error functions.  You could hardcode / boilerplate each of those functions but that is boring, tedious, and nonDRY.  So instead you create a function factory and use it to return anonymous functions, like so.  Python.<p><pre><code>  def log_func_factory(level):\n    def closure(msg):\n      print level, msg\n    return closure\n  \n  class logging(object):\n    debug = log_func_factory('debug')  \n    warn = log_func_factory('warn')  \n    error = log_func_factory('error')  \n</code></pre>\nWith real code I'd not repeat those assignments and instead use a loop driven by data.<p><pre><code>  for level in ('debug', 'warn', 'error'):\n    setattr(logger, level) = log_func_factory(level)\n</code></pre>\nBam, data driven code.
