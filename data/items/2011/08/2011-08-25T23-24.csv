Later I can earn credit by speaking to a _anything_-speaker wanting to learn english.<p>If you think through that system lots of cool ideas come out, especially if you attach a monetary value to the credit---like people only earning credit and cashing it out (tutors), or people only spending it, and injecting cash into the system (impatient/rich people).<p>Anyway, Verbling guys, you may have already thought of this, but if not, I've been thinking about it for quite a while, hit me up if you want to chat more about it.",1314316404

2926816,comment,2925735,2926062,2,0,m0nastic,,,"I disagree that being less shitty than the other shitty certifications is a vote for getting a CISSP.<p>Whenever people ask me if they should do it, there are pretty much two instances where I recommend it:<p>1.) You work in corporate security (maybe a CISO, or work for an internal security group within an organization) where you will actually have to deal with security across the many domains that the CISSP covers. Depending on where you work, it might either be required or strongly encouraged. In which case, I'd say, knock yourself out.<p>2.) You're looking for a job. There are a lot of places that list it as a requirement for a job, as it's one of the few things a recruiter or HR person can flag a resume for. Now, you might say to yourself ""I'd never want to work for a place where they actually considered having a CISSP a requirement"", to which I'd reply ""Good for you, you've moved along the path of security zen"". But the reality is, people need jobs. So if you need a job, and this is something that could get you a job (even a job that grizzled security veterans would sneer at), have at it.<p>Infosec is a young industry (birthed from a very anti-corporate community), and there isn't anyplace that any large number of people consider authoritative enough to offer a certification that isn't considered laughable. That may change in the future (it'd be nice), but I wouldn't bet on it.<p>If you're really just looking at getting a CISSP to get a job, however, I think you'd be much better off becoming a PCI QSA. You'd pretty much never be out of work. Weigh that against what doing PCI for a living does to your soul. Everybody needs to make that decision for themselves.<p>So the plus-side of having a CISSP is if you're looking for work, and the downside is attracting the ire of the security community (which may or may not bother you, depending on where you hang out at nights and on weekends). Also having to pay to keep it current, and not associating with any evil hackers (while at the same time having to submit CPE credits for attending conferences put on by evil hackers).",1314315608

That means I should get 1% right? No. I should get 1% <i>this year, starting immediately.</i> But wait. My 1% has only a very small chance over ever turning into money. That means I need, say, 5-10 percent to compensate for that. Don't know many startups willing to give someone 5-10% for a $10k salary cut? Neither do I. Maybe I'm too conservative.<p>Or, if you want the short answer, I'd say between 0.25% and 5% is normal to go along with a 20-30% salary cut. That's what I've seen, at least. YMMV.",1314315567

Please email us at support@likeness.com as you have more thoughts, especially about where Ness does and does not work for you.<p>With regard to only teaching Ness by rating restaurants 4-5 stars, this is a great point, especially for the first 10 ratings.  There are a couple particular ways we address this today:
1) Which restaurants you pick tells us a lot.  Did you rate hole in the walls vs. expensive places?  We have spent a lot of time working on our collaborative filter to address this.  Wikipedia has a good article for a starting ground on this, and the papers that came out of the Netflix Prize are great [<a href=""http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKor.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BellKo...</a>].
2) On the personalize page, there are multiple stages.  One of them is to confirm that the system is correct about places you don't like, which is obviously also very informative.
3) Sometimes, as with your Chipotle example, we won't be right.  Telling us where we are wrong is particularly helpful in correcting the system, which in some sense gives us more information that confirming what we already know.  Think of it of correcting a person, who misunderstood what you like from examples you gave.  In a metaphorical sense, this is like providing results that have more entropy.<p>-Jeremy

2926748,comment,2925865,2925865,1,0,danenania,,,"In my experience, you could make a similar argument about going to college for business vs. actually understanding anything about business. A lot of recent grads I've encountered don't know much beyond buzzwords and overly abstract theory. College also seems to frequently have the unfortunate effect of instilling overconfidence and a sense of entitlement. That said, if the goal is simply to get a job, college is clearly the path of least resistance.<p>Personally, I'm glad I didn't get a degree, or at least that I didn't follow the common path of high school-college-entry level job, even though it has made life more difficult at times. It cut me off from the easy route of getting some comfortable, dull job at a big company and becoming stagnant. Instead I've had to carve out my own path and I think the experience and confidence I've gained from that are worth a lot more than a degree. Frankly, not one of the clients I've worked with has even asked me about a degree. When you have solid work you can point to and enthusiastic references, whether/where you went to college becomes completely irrelevant. If a company won't hire me for a job I'm qualified for because I don't have a piece of paper, it seems  to follow that they <i>are</i> likely to hire unqualified people who do have that piece of paper, so it turns out that their filter actually works out a lot better for me than it does for them, and I'm happy to be filtered.<p>I also don't buy the notion that without college you won't be 'well-rounded' or 'generally educated'. When I was in school, I always felt like I had a lot <i>less</i> time to devote to reading and really learning because my days were filled by tedious work and usually dull classes. Going to college isn't what makes you well-rounded and educated, it's a thirst for knowledge and the time to fulfill it.",1314313804
