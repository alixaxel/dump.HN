2885873,comment,2885367,2885367,170,0,orijing,,,"All of the comments here attacking Warren Buffett's authenticity, suggesting that he should put his money where his mouth is and write the Treasury a big fat check, are missing the whole point.<p>Services provided by the government are public goods. It's blindingly obvious that a single person cannot pay for those public goods. Just Buffett's own contributions, no matter how much he donates, will not be enough to solve our budget issue. It's called shared sacrifice because it's meaningless unless everyone participates.<p>It's like the neighborhood park (i.e. medicare/social security): Everyone wants one, but nobody wants to pay for it. In steps the neighborhood's rich kid (Buffett), who suggests that all the rich kids pitch in to pay for the park. If that happened, everyone would be made better off, but one kid alone isn't enough.<p>This is a very canonical problem of public services provisioning and funding. It's completely naive to sit back and suggest Buffett tackle the issue himself, because we all know that's ridiculous.<p>Open your eyes. The problem is not Buffett's to solve. But he recognizes that there is a problem.<p>Apologies for the harsh tone, but it baffles me how members of Hacker News can think so naively. The attacks on Buffett are utterly unfair and unjustified. We should all have an open mind and try to understand the proposal.",1313391551

""The federal government funds roads and airports that we all enjoy using. The feds pay for health care for the poor and the old. Our tax dollars pay for intrepid military personnel who go out and kill angry foreigners (in most cases) before they can arrive on U.S. soil and kill Americans here at home. For a non-profit organization of its size, the federal government is surprisingly efficient. Most federal employees work in big box-like office buildings, not in $300 million monuments to an architect's ego. George W. Bush gets paid only $400,000 per year, less than half of what a lot of university presidents earn.""[1]<p>I personally have a somewhat less charitable view of effects of military action, at least the military action during my lifetime, but I do think that most of the personnel involved do believe that they are doing the right thing, and those other things, roads and healthcare and stuff; those are pretty great to have.<p>Now, I'm too lazy to dig up non-greenspun references, but it seems that many non-profits serve up rather nice salaries, for rather inefficient work[2]<p>[1]<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20090217002255/http://philip.greenspun.com/materialism/early-retirement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20090217002255/http://philip.gree...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2010/07/27/where-your-charitable-donations-end-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2010/07/27/where-your-cha...</a>",1313390439

This leads to a whole bunch of <i>really</i> nasty reaction side-products, on top of whatever cutting agents the distribution chain has added to maximise profits.<p>In any of these discussions, it's considered traditional to present Paul Erds[6] as an example of productive amphetamine usage, so I will :)<p>On the topic of therapeutic index (therapeutic dose / ld50 dose), caffeine is probably one of the highest in my list above, with an LD50 of ~150mg/kg over a short period of time, and a productive dose being of the order of 100-1000mg/day depending on tolerance.
