2884432,comment,2882356,2883470,1,0,kamens,,,"@rubergly handled the drilling comment well, so I'll just quickly add:<p>1) We do want kids to learn lessons at home so that teachers are freed up to do more project-based learning and...well...teaching (instead of lecturing). This doesn't mean the world falls apart if kids aren't watching videos at home. As @rubergly says, computers in the classroom allow for individualized instruction and solid data, which humanizes the kids' experience by helping teachers address individual needs.<p>2) On the school front -- there are lots of ideas floating around when thinking about the future, but I can assure you that our primary focus is exactly what it says on the website: ""providing a free world-class education to anyone anywhere.""",1313355560

2884423,comment,2883820,2884289,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"> propaganda, especially of the Goebbels sort, is directly opposed to the pursuit of widespread thinking and big ideas that this article is promoting.<p>The problem I have with the article is that many of the ""big"" ideas that happened during past history were only big and influential because they were absorbed by vast numbers of ill-informed people. In other words, it wasn't so much that an idea itself was big, but that most people didn't have alternative sources of information and therefore were ripe material for absorbing the given idea. Totalitarianism thrived on persuading people through clever control of the (new at the time) mass-media channels to believe into this or that idea.<p>> nationalism isn't a big idea in the same sense that communism or western democracy are.<p>You are equating ""big"" with ""well-intentioned,"" which I believe are different things. There can be no doubt that nationalist ideas had a major impact on modernity, from Nazism to Balkans to post-colonialism. Regarding tribalism, it can take many forms, not just nationalism. One of the channels which the early USSR used to spread communist ideas was precisely tribalism. Russians were imagined as good and communitarian ""by-nature"" while people from Western countries were portrayed as more mean-spirited and selfish.",1313355163

2884416,comment,2882356,2883470,1,0,rubergly,,,"The current model is that 20-30 kids who want to be moving around and interacting with each other are forced into seats and restricted from moving for hours while teachers talk at them until they get distracted and zone out the teacher to think about other things. And then they go home with an assignment to complete which they may or may not do depending on how motivated they are. When Khan Academy flips this, they make much better use of the situation. There's no reason for everyone to be lectured at together, but there's every reason to allow students to interact and work together while solving problems. There's very little motivation to go home and complete a rigorous assignment when you can be playing outside or watching TV, but watching a couple 10-20 minute videos is enjoyable and completely digestible.<p>Personally, I believe that the act of working through problems is often more important to learning and development than watching or listening to lectures explaining how to work through problems. If a student's conditions at home are so unstable that they cannot concentrate on watching a single video, then they are clearly never going to be able to put a reasonable amount of effort into homework assignments in the normal education system. I would rather they fail to watch Khan videos at home and interact and explore exercises in class than listen to lectures in class every day but never put those skills into practice because they fail to do homework at home. However, yes, availability of computers at home is an issue. It would be great if Khan Academy were the cure-all for education and would be perfect for everyone, but this is never what has been claimed; unfortunately, for the time being, Khan Academy is not a viable solution for those without computer access.<p>I'm not sure if the phrasing of <i>drilling exercises</i> was supposed to imply something negative, but the goal of KA's exercises is not to drill students on a question until they can answer it as quickly as possible (this is what I think of when I think of a drill). The goal is to allow students to explore and advance at their own pace, proving mastery of a concept covered in a video and then feeling confident to move onto a more advanced topic. We try to make the exercises as modular as possible (which may make them outwardly resemble drills), but we do this so a complex problem can be broken down into many smaller and easier problems. Instead of making a staircase with huge steps that would take a giant to leap, we're making a staircase with small steps; that way, everyone can advance at their own pace.",1313355037

For me BASIC, C, and Simula was Perlis languages, but none of them has features completly unique to them, but I learned new concepts from them. On the other hand Java, Python and Lua were not, because I had encountered their core features previously, and learned little from them for that reason.

The article talks about saddles with relief cutouts or depressions, to make sure no pressure is put on the perineum. Saddles with cutouts are fine--even better than normal saddles for some people. Noseless saddles, on the other hand, address the problem entirely wrong. The tend to produce an uncomfortable position for long rides, as the nose is important for bike handling.<p>Back to cutout saddles, a cutout only helps if the saddle is heavily padded. When the padding compresses, you don't sink from your sit bones into your perineum. Another option is a firmer saddle.

If you do, feel free to donate for that cause.<p>I can't think of a good reason to subsidize mail. If people live where mail delivery is expensive, they should have to bear the cost. This would cause them to conserve their mail use. Instead of getting mail once a day, perhaps they should receive it once a week, or once a month. Maybe they could pick it up where they buy groceries. Maybe they could just use email or phone. Maybe they would get less junk mail. It's hard to tell how they would adapt if they had to pay market prices. But they would adapt and that's a good thing. It's not a good thing to pretend that delivery costs 40 cents when in reality it costs 40 dollars. And it is unjust to <i>force</i> people who chose to live in areas where it's efficient to deliver mail to subsidize people where it's not efficient.<p>Also, if subsidized rural mail service is something the taxpayers want to pay for, they could just as well subsidize private carriers.<p>In short, I don't see any good reason why the USPS should have a monopoly on mail service, any more than it should have a monopoly on email, or fax, or telephone, or TV or any other means of communication.",1313354642

I work with software that supports business processes, manage information and facilitates interaction between humans and machines. In that field (if it is even meaningful to speak of such a broad category as a single field), knowing how to write the most efficient sorting algoritm is fairly close to worthless.<p>I'm sure that if you work at Google, where crunching big data is key; or in a company like Microsoft or Apple, where applications are much closer to the hardware; then these things do matter. But I propose that a major part of software development happens in a space where such things are irrelevant or at least very rarely relevant.<p>Regarding my outsourcing remark, let me clarify a bit. What I mean to say is that while the stuff that is close to the hardware might take skilled workers, it does not require cultural skills. For example, I would suggest that it's a lot easier to outsource a hardware driver than it is to outsource a workflow engine for an order process. For the latter, you need to be close to your users and you need to understand the business you're modeling.<p>Mind you, I think it's fine that we teach this stuff in universities - it's good background knowledge to have. But as a practical skill, I question its value. And in a job interview, I would suggest to test the skills that are actually needed in the relevant job.<p>Oh, and I didn't choose my name; My parents did.

Morally, there are still active debates on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, scope of the government, and cloning.  Everything else is about efficacy, and what actually works.

But i'm not so convinced that if you want to start a tech startup or work for one that College is the most important thing.

The cop didn't want to look at the photos or try to make him delete them. Just because you feel like you are being detained doesn't mean you are.<p>I am a photographer too.
