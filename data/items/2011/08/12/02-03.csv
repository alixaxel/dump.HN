And the content of the innovative parts of most scientific papers are not covered by patents. Open source software is another thing that makes software patents useless for the purpose of disclosure; the value it could bring to society is hugely inferior to the value achieved by open source software + academic publications, and the cost is hugely superior.

I think what you and others are trying to say here is that if you're against software patents, you <i>should</i> be against all patents, but that's substantially different. It's taking an invalid rhetorical shortcut of assuming the other person has no good reason to make the distinction, rather than actually asking whether he does.<p>As for ""some"", you may be right, but I'm hard-pressed to think of any worthwhile software patents. Really, the fix for software patents is probably to reduce the term and vastly increase the requirements for novelty rather than eliminating them altogether, but on the other hand I really don't see much downside to simply disallowing it completely. Maybe I'm missing it, but patents don't really seem to be a requirement for software innovation.",1313116729

Those few trusted alphabets would probably include Greek, Cyrillic, and Latin, all of which have similar or identical characters with different Unicode code points.<p>2. The goal of Unicode support, localized domain names, etc. is for software to be equally easy to use for all languages, rather than to favor some languages over others.<p>That said, it might be advantageous to have a locale-specific approach, so that characters not used by the current language will be highlighted.  But, that could be seen as hindering the ability of sites in one region to reach users in another region, doesn't work well for text that includes multiple languages, and malware writers will probably find a way to mark their characters as expected anyway.<p>Edit: also, the two words ""get displayed"" paper over a vast amount of complexity in the way operating systems and applications display text.

2875731,comment,2873795,2875669,1,0,dpark,,,"While I ended up arguing a lot of tangents, my original point was that the title diminishes the standing of the anti-patent crowd.  Whether ""linked list"" is taken as a generic term that describes a whole class of data structures or whether it's restricted to just the basic ""linked list"" types, the title is misleading.  The patent does not cover the basic linked list types nor does cover the entire the entire class.<p>This patent is ridiculous enough <i>without</i> exaggeration.  I believe that the patent system is broken, but making misleading claims about frivolous patents weakens the arguments.  The truth is already ridiculous enough.<p>As for your comment about ""excessive infighting over apparently trivial concerns"", I wish I could dispute that.  I feel that geeks as a group tend to be pedantic jackasses, and I'm often guilty of that myself.  It does hurt our credibility as a whole.<p>By the way, your interpretation of multiply-linked lists is correct.

2875722,comment,2873795,2874320,2,0,xilun0,,,"I agree there is a risk of misinterpretation as in ""all kind all linked lists have been patented, here is the patent"" and for this reason, it maybe would have been better to get an even more precise title. By i'm technically still fine with the current one. The claims (both in the application and in the granted patent) barely talk about traversing the ""primary"" or the ""auxiliary"" list which provide another sequence (well, providing the same would be... useless), not any kind of tricky algorithm like efficient multiple simultaneous sorting or i don't know what, not even a plain and boring insertion is covered!<p>This is a special case of traversing multiple linked lists, which is a basic technique. I actually even hesitate to say it is a technique, or at least to distinguish this technique from the very same technique of using a single linked list, because I don't think I could ever come up with a plausible justification for why anybody previously knowing how to use one would not be able to use two.\nThe restriction making this a special case is that all lists contain the same set of elements. Given the claims, that restriction is unnecessarily narrow and have no technical effect. So the only thing that distinguish this patent from a patent on a particular (but still 100% basic) use of single linked lists, is the phrasing, and the empty (still given the context) emphasis on the fact there are not one, but two, or even three lists.<p>So despite the fact that basic singly-linked lists + limited to one list by element would not be covered by this patent even in the parallel universe where it would be considered valid (and while we can note that on the contrary, prev/next linked list would), given that it only claims (with many more sentences) that if you have two lists, you can traverse one, or you can traverse the other, i will continue to argue that it covers linked lists, maybe under certain conditions, all right, but those conditions are insufficient to mandate the precision that this is a modification of linked lists, because it is not a modification, it is just about the basic traversal of multiple plain classical linked lists.<p>(Also, one a side note, I found it cute how the claims are structured, like if the author thought there was a possibility that prior art could be found for two pointers but not three.)<p>Edit: About the inflammatory part, it might as well have been even more inflammatory by being even more descriptive. Somebody has patented traversal of linked lists.",1313115766
