Like loosing 100lbs in like 3 months (it ""could"" happen, but it isn't typical) or gaining like 50lbs of muscle in 3 months, etc. The book outlines how he did it - what it doesn't go into too much is the fact that he had that muscle, then lost it, then gained it back. So the argument is that his muscle was just rebuilding itself and that is easier.<p>The point is not to take everything literally - if you follow his slow-carb diets & exercise even slightly you SHOULD loose weight - you probably wont lose 100 lbs, but you could. Most people healthily lose 1-2 lbs per week and with this you could certainly do that. I'm 6""5 & 300 and I lost about 20 lbs in the first two weeks doing it, although that is fairly consistent on any real extreme change I do for eating healthy.<p>You'd understand when you read it that it isn't a step by step to get from point a to point b, but rather information to help motivate/guide you from your own point a to your own point b... in a sensationalized manner.<p>(don't get me wrong, I liked both books)",1313629191

The problem is that I'm terribly shy and have always had a really hard time meeting people and making new friends, unless I'm forced to be with the same group of people for long periods of time. I'm working from home now so I can't meet new people at my workplace. I don't drink. I'm pretty quiet in general. I really need to fix this about myself because it's going to hold me back forever.<p>Do you know of books written for the nerdier crowd that give step-by-step guides on how to overcome my shyness? I want to know specifics on how to small talk, what to talk about when meeting new people, etc. I know the basics of what you're supposed to do and what you're supposed to talk about generally, but that doesn't help me because I tend to tense up and shut down in those situations. I need specific suggestions, like an instruction manual or a script, that I could memorize and follow over and over until I get to be more comfortable. Like the hacker's guide to being social.<p>I know that I won't become outgoing just by reading a book. But I do need some sort of help (and I think therapy is a little overkill). I'm already looking for hacker events I could attend in the area to get out of the house. For example, I'll be at the Hackers & Founders meetup in San Jose next Thursday. It would be nice to figure out how to talk to strangers by then, because the thought of it gives me sweaty palms already.<p>Thanks for your help!<p>EDIT: I've read Dale Carnegie's ""How to win friends and influence people"" and most of it I already knew or heard about.

2897473,comment,2897277,2897277,1,0,ristretto,,,"I am often under the impression that many philosophers take linguistic constructions such as ""meaning"" and ""morality"" to be entities that can exist on their own, outside functioning brains, while on the other hand they claim to be materialists. They strive to find a way to make logic (syntax) produce meaning, forgetting that semantic meaning is all about context, emotion and behavior shaped by millions of years of evolution. Philosophers do care about complexity (they care about everything, it's their job), but their metaphors are always about metaphysics or notions of some kind of ""x-liness"" that, like an ""elan vital"" will give meaning to the soulless constructions of mathematics and physics (chinese room, waterfalls, qualia).<p>The paper gives numerous examples where a philosopher could use complexity theory, but doesnt go so far as to make any conclusions, thus showing that comp. complexity is actually useful for these problems.",1313626520
