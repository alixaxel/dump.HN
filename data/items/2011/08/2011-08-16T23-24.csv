None of them.</i><p>Do you have data that indicates that contributes to RSI?  My personal experience is that trying to ""sit up straight"" and maintain ""good"" posture is the fastest, most direct route to wrist pain.  Like, less than a half hour.  By contrast, if I slouch my body, my wrists can maintain a graceful positive curve (not straight or bent back) and I can comfortably code or game for hours (though I try not to sit in one place that long, in general).  As a side benefit, this also puts my eyes at a better angle when I'm using the laptop screen.",1313538747

However, it was not until last year that I eliminated the pain completely.<p>The solution was simple strength training. Not weight lifting (I think that was a major contributor early on.)
