Doctors are not required to accept Medicare.  They choose to do so.  They choose to accept the rates Medicare offers.  When one party offers an amount for a second party's services, and the second party accepts, they have just established the market rate for that transaction.<p>This claim also conveniently ignores the fact that insurance companies do the same thing.  Check over a medical statement from your insurance company some time.  You'll see where the doctor billed $300 for ""nasal deconfrabulation"", your copay was $25, and the insurance paid $125.  Total due: $0.<p>> <i>He's also neglecting to make a real comparison of the services that private health care provides vs. Medicare. Sure, private insurance premiums may have risen faster than Medicare spending during the '90s, but Medicare wasn't even paying for prescription drugs (a huge cost driver) until Part D was implemented in 2006.</i><p>The status of Medicare in 2006 seems to have little relevance to Medicare today.  The first question is how much Medicare spends <i>today</i> per client vs how much private insurance spends per client, on average.  The second question is how coverage differs in these scenarios.  How does Medicare compare to the average insurance policy?

That would tend to spur innovation and patent disclosures, which is the whole point of the patent system.<p>No. The coincidence of timing is a second-order consequence of the fact that smart people when faced with problems with similar requirements will produce similar solutions. In some cases the requirements are so constrained that not only will the abstract ideas be identical but so will the concrete implementations of those ideas (e.g. write me an optimal 8x8 IDCT for machine architecture X). It is absurd that any reasonably smart fellow who happens to tackle a problem first should be granted a government monopoly on his ideas.<p>If the goal is public disclosure of knowledge then assuming the problem has any wider relevance it will soon enough be revisited by other similarly smart fellows, so there is little incentive for the discoverer who happened to be first to closely guard his secrets. The gain to society for granting the monopoly in this case is that the knowledge might be disclosed a little sooner than otherwise. The cost is that other and sometimes even smarter fellows cannot develop those ideas further without a license, not even in the context of pure research, never mind business.<p>That hardly spurs innovation. And as for that, it was never the original purpose of the patent system but is rather a latter-day tacked-on justification for it, but let us suppose that is its principal purpose. Do you see that happening? It's certainly not working in the software world.
