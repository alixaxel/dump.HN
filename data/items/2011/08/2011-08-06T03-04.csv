If anything is likely to condition the median person into scraping the minimum necessary requirement it's drawing attention to how far ahead their smarter peers are. Smarter peers who have more outlets for demonstrating their aptitude other than dwarfing the average test scores, and who are probably smart enough to realise their test scores are a poor proxy for real life success anyway.<p>Skewing the scoring still doesn't make exams resemble real life; one doesn't analyse their successes in percentage-points-from-perfection. If we did, most people would have a serious inferiority complex. Interviewers who screen out unexceptional candidates are normal; those who waste insufficiently exceptional candidates time <i>repeatedly</i> proving they're not creative or excellent enough for the job might even be considered sadistic.
