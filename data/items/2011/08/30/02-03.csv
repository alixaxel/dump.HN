The world is a brutal ""eye-for-an-eye"" place -- has been and will always be.<p>Terrorism has impact not only in the number of people killed, but also (1) probably much larger economic impact (people minimizing travel or any other activities that involve risk, even if they are not conscious they are doing so because of terrorism), (2) acts of terror that go unpunished will usually raise the position/status of the terrorist who committed or organized those acts in the internal power hierarchy he's embedded in (that's how fame, or rather ""infamy"" works), which in turn could lead to an extremely precarious and expensive situation of having to deal not just with a lone terrorist group but with an entire terrorist government, (3) if there is one thing most people want from their governments, it is protection against external threats, and failure to act can be perceived as failure to protect, which in turn will increase risk-avoidance and thereby have an economic impact (see first point).<p>Saying that nothing should be done when terrorists strike is like telling a kid who is being bullied to simply ignore bullies and expect bullying to stop -- it's something that's never said by someone in the position of being bullied, but always by someone who is not impacted by it. In addition, such a statement rests on the false premises that (1) bullying is mostly harmless (it isn't), and (2) that bullies are primarily interested in seeing a response from the bullied kid -- and that they are not bullying him/her for some other purpose (such as scapegoating, or deriving pleasure from the act of bullying itself).",1314671885

So if you've got a business where the average number of support requests per user are dramatically less than 1.0 per user per month, then it can work out, but I suspect there's a proportional support load to those SaaS systems that you're looking at where it's closer to, say, 0.5 per seat.  If you lower the price beyond $9/month, then all of the sudden your profit evaporates.<p>It's non-obvious until you run the numbers, but it goes something like this:<p><pre><code>  Support Person Salary		$60,000.00\n  Fully Loaded Employee Cost	$90,000.00\n  Per Hour			$46.88\n  Support Requests / Hour	6\n  Cost / Request		$7.81\n</code></pre>\nThat's actually why we removed our $9/month plan.  It was just hard to get excited about helping someone out when you realized after the first mail you were going into the hole for such.<p>The interesting thing for where Bushido fits into that is that in some ways it'd be pushing things towards utility pricing (the same way a lot of the cloud sort of stuff has done) -- i.e. the cost of supporting a software stack would be proportional to the cost you generate further up the chain, rather than based on some metric of an ""average customer"".",1314671359

It's making an arbitrary line of what can be communicated<p>I agree with you that the incomprehensible alien form is pointless, but as soon as we have a common frame of reference, we can drill down to defining right and left. All you need is four points: Point A is 'up', Point B is 'down', put your viewing position so that Point C is between you and the line AB. With A being 'up', Point D is on the left side of the line AB. Whether you use stars, a mountainside, a tree, galaxies, or jellyfish, that's all you need - but you still need a common point to refer to.<p>I think a better way of phrasing the problem would be: You have a communications conduit to a parallel universe and we only have the ability to speak through it. The alien understands us but has no prior concept of right and left. We can't point or refer to bodies in our universe as they can't see them, but apart from that, all physical rules are the same and they have the same level of science knowledge as us. How do we tell them right from left in this instance? We can get the concept across with left- and right-handed molecules (though DNA may be out as they may not have it), but how to indicate <i>which</i> is left and right in verbiage only, I'm not sure.<p>Phrased this way, you don't have to do silly logical twists to have the alien living in our universe yet still somehow preventing them from seeing the same things we do.",1314669692
