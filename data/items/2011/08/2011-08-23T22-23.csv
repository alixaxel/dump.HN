2918700,comment,2918317,2918643,3,0,aloneinkyoto,,,"But that is exactly what is counterproductive about it. Because it forces you to make assumptions about the people you interact with. Have you asked all of your friends wether or not they might find your family photos interesting or not? Do you think there is no value in being exposed to things that is beyond your comfort zone? I might be a 25 year old party animal that doesn't care shit about family life. But seeing the odd family photo or two in my feed now and then might perhaps be good for me? And I might even enjoy it, even if I don't want to readily admit it to my self. There is also the dimension of making the social realm more ""democratic"". In the sense that it is a good thing if people are not intentionally excluded from social contexts. It helps create a more tolerant society and more robust and flexible social networks if the interaction in the networks are less clustered (something a hacker, with knowledge about how the internet works should be able to appreciate).<p>The somewhat technical explanation is that what Google is doing is implementing something very similar to ""Social role theory"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_Theory</a>), which emphasizes social roles as the defining characteristic used to understand social interaction. While Facebook rather is implementing something more akin to ""Symbolic interaction theory"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_interaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_interaction</a>).",1314139938

The project is called Webkit2, and features a Javascript interpreter that runs in a separate process, and thus is able to safely execute Javascript on iOS. This model, btw., is inspired by the multi-process architecture found in other major browsers.",1314137115

granted, twitter's culture is more open to following strangers than facebook. my experience on Google+ has been a nice blend of the two extremes, so far.",1314137072

If 39 pick A and 40 pick B then you'd need a larger sample size to overcome the margin of error. Of course at a 95% confidence interval any result even in excess of the MOE is pure chance 1 of out 20 times.<p>What I'd do is split your customer base into 3 groups of 50% 25% and 25%, test each 25% and then apply the winner to the 50%.",1314137015

Look at the people, the product, the market and traction to make your decisions.<p>Do you like working there? Are the founders fully involved? Are the customers happy? Is it a great product in a growing market?<p>Series C doesn't mean a company won't succeed; they could easily be on the growth path and using additional capital to finance expansion. Don't write them off prematurely but do your due diligence as well :)",1314136945
