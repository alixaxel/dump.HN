Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, think, and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillence coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame?

A strong correlation like that ought to survive Bonferroni correction.<p>> Even if we could do a randomized trial, it probably wouldn't be ethical.<p>What is unethical is <i>not</i> running a trial. We don't know anything and what we do know is frequently falsified, no matter how confident we think we are. This is the whole point of 'evidence-based medicine' - there are countless treatments where people went 'oh it'd be unethical not to use this awesome treatment' and made snide jokes about randomized testing of parachutes. But nicotine has many benefits (<a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Nicotine#performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Nicotine#performance</a>) and it's not clear to anyone who was not raised in the 20th or 21st century without the benefits of indoctrination that tobacco is bad <i>on net</i>. This is why we do trials. I am reminded of one quote on the topic:<p>> 'One day when I was a junior medical student, a very important Boston surgeon visited the school and delivered a great treatise on a large number of patients who had undergone successful operations for vascular reconstruction. At the end of the lecture, a young student at the back of the room timidly asked, “Do you have any controls?” Well, the great surgeon drew himself up to his full height, hit the desk, and said, “Do you mean did I not operate on half the patients?” The hall grew very quiet then. The voice at the back of the room very hesitantly replied, “Yes, that's what I had in mind.” Then the visitor's fist really came down as he thundered, “Of course not. That would have doomed half of them to their death.” God, it was quiet then, and one could scarcely hear the small voice ask, “Which half?”'<p>And besides, are you seriously trying to defend the last 70 years of bad epidemiology with <i>one</i> example which it is not clear even matters to the statistical question?<p>> If we followed the author's advice where would we be?<p>We wouldn't have pro-smoking people pointing out the absence of randomized trials and ambiguous animal results, a respected statistician like Fisher pointing out the curious correlations undermining the case for causation, or the smoking industry able to cast doubt and delay regulation for decades.

They did this by taking the RNA out of some HIVs and replaced it instead with a sequence to look for a specific antigen on the cancer cells.  Then they took the HIVs and introduced them to the T-Cells and let them get infected.  Since the original nasty RNA wasn't present, it won't replicate, but it will make some T-Cells that target the antigen on the cancer cells.  After reintroducing to the patient, their immune systems then pick up from other signals that we don't full understand that some T-Cells are attacking this antigen, so it should make more of them.",1313108928

This is why I believe that the university system is the first credential employers look for, graduation means that you can solve problems and you are able to manage yourself, when nobody is there holding your hand.<p>That said there is a back door for computer programming that lots of other fields don't have, that being, you can get very good in your mothers basement. You don't need access to expensive equipment like oscilloscopes and function generators like you for EE or access the hospital if you are training to be a doctor.<p>But form what I understand you if you go this way you will need to be really good, and have a lots of experience or get lucky and land a job where your can apply your skills and build on them.<p>From my generalist view point here, if you want to be a player in the tech industry you need to be doing it as your hobby too, and further look at every opportunity you get to push to learn more, expecially off hours, when you are not getting paid.<p>With respect to making money doing something the wordpress thing is really easy to do, once you get an understanding of html, css, and programming in php you can do some pretty powerful stuff. This is a valuable for lots of companies that don't have a web presence. So if you are going to do it then, build your own site, and use it a testing ground for new things that you see as neat and find on the web.<p>And finally, whenever you get the chance help others do it! Open source your projects, let others build off your projects, help them when they ask you about it, understand other peoples projects and add value where you can. You will learn a ton and get the chance to provide knowledge to others.<p>Good luck!",1313108211
