I love HN, and I wouldn't want to use my real name here. Same with most forums. But pseudonyms have no place in social networking. As Zuckerburg figured out from watching MySpace unfold, having Internet-only ""friends"" is sketchy, unfulfilling, and kind of dangerous; the mainstream wants to use the internet to connect to their real-life friends. That was the principle behind Facebook, and that's what Google+ is trying for.<p>There is still a segment of people that likes talking to anonymous strangers.

Although it no longer formerly exists, there are analogues and the influence is still there.  It is ingrained from birth that you study hard, get into the right university then reap the rewards.  Beijing locals I talked to were puzzled by the idea that government workers in the west could get in trouble by accepting gifts and favours.  In China, that's the main reason you would follow that career path.<p>This doesn't lead to a very entrepreneurial culture, although there are many who will still try to start their own business.  Then you start to hit the barriers discussed in the article.  Another barrier you can hit is that if you start to become successful, the government will appoint a party member to your management.  Further, if you are in certain fields, the government erects tax and regulatory obstacles that will create an advantage for state-owned enterprises.<p>It's unfortunate... there are enough in the under-35 age group, who might actually break out of the old culture and innovate.

I'm entering my senior year of high school and have been thinking a lot about colleges and what I want to study. I've always enjoyed math and science so I figure I'll probably end up in some sort of engineering career. Additionally, I've been teaching myself Python and really enjoying it; I try to read programming books and write programs for an hour or two each day.<p>I'm wondering what you all would major in if you had the chance to redo college knowing what you know now. I'd also like to know what your opinion is of CS as a major. Is a CS degree useful for learning to write code better, or does it make more sense to focus on some other engineering field and learn to program on your own to be more well rounded? I'm a little worried that getting a CS degree would give me less options than, say getting a mechanical or electrical engineering degree and learning to program on the side.<p>Thanks for reading",1313865171
