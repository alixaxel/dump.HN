2845289,comment,2844747,2844972,4,0,exDM69,,,"That is true.<p>There was a lot of programming language research in the 1970's and 1980's that is not really used in mainstream programming languages in these days.<p>A good collection of this material can be found in Simon Peyton-Jones' book ""The implementation of functional programming languages"".

2845277,comment,2844059,2844557,5,0,lucasjung,,,"It's funny that you say this, because prior to the adoption of fiat money systems, class-warfare leaders agitated for decades (centuries, even?) in favor of a system of fiat money, because they saw fiat money as a way to reduce wealth inequality.  The logic goes like this:<p>1: In general, poor people borrow money from rich people.  Interest payments on these loans is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich: an <i>increase</i> in debt inequality.<p>2: Fiat money is much more subject to inflation than commodity money.<p>3: When inflation occurs, the real value of debts is reduced.<p>4: By adopting fiat money and the accompanying continuous inflation, a situation would be created whereby poor people could borrow money from the rich, use it to create wealth for themselves, and then effectively pay back less than they had borrowed.<p>I'm not saying they were right, I'm just describing their ideas.  I find the whole situation ironic.",1312451394
2845276,comment,2845094,2845094,2,0,rednum,,,"I hoped for some interesting read, instead the article could be summed up in 3 sentences:<p>Python, Ruby and Scriptol were created by starting with ergonomic study and user survery. Java, C# and Scala by repeating old habits of some programmers. The syntax of latter three languages sucks - it's full of cryptic symbols, including semicolons, and it's based on C which doesn't make sense today.<p>Ok, so what is this user survey? In some ways it is the same as repeating habits of people - when you are doing a survery people will tend to vote for habits they have from programming languages they use. Even my friends who are just CS students (so shouldn't have bad habits from years of coding in the industry and seem to have more theoretical approach) are afraid of languages that resemble Java too little. I'm not saying this can't be done correctly, I think that this article simply lacks of content on methodology of gathering ideas for new PL and doesn't answer the question in the title. It would also cool to read what scriptol's authors did to make the language suit users' needs better.<p>Also as far as I know scala and javascript has the same attitude towards semi colons - they are no obligatory. I'd say that scala has more 'new' ideas than Go and JS [1]<p>[1] think pattern matching, actors - I know they are not actually new, but it seems to me that scala can become 'most mainstream' among languages that implement such features",1312451383

2845266,comment,2840519,2841844,1,0,tomelders,,,"I think you're making some huge leaps of imagination there. It seems your starting with the assumption that laws can only introduce red tape and slow things down. While this is certainly possible, it's not inherent. It is absolutely possible to draft rules, or policies in such a way as to reduce red tape. Take for example Van Halen's policy on M&Ms<p><a href=""http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp</a><p>While not in the political sphere, it demonstrates perfectly how a well thought out policy can reduce complexity while still delivering results.<p>Any attempt to argue that this has no bearing in a political context serves only to illustrate a complete and utter lack of imagination. <i>Once people know the M&M trick, it becomes useless... but M&M's are one example of that technique. Next time, it could be Alphabet Spaghetti with all the A letters removed.</i><p>Also, what new training would be needed in order to work with modern browsers? People who need training on how to use a modern browser require training of a completely different sort. Since when did ""borderline-retarded"" become our baseline?<p>Accessibility laws here in the UK have actually made development easier as it has created an environment where developers have a much bigger input in the design process as they can cast an expert eye over concepts and raise concerns at a very early stage. This isn't about removing features, it's about building features that work properly.<p>Nor is it reasonable to class IE8 as a modern browser. IE9 is almost there, but I don't think IE can be classed as ""modern"" until IE10.<p>Nor do you understand me right. I don't want to shift my time time burden onto anyone, I want to do more in the time I have. IT departments make the call on what browsers their users can use, so it's reasonable to shift some of the <i>support burden</i> onto them.<p>Any talk of ""internal systems"" that depend on ActiveX and the like demonstrate a lack of investment in technology. Why should we (the human race) be anchored to the past by people who are unwilling to invest in the future, despite reaping the benefits of other peoples investments. It stinks to me. Browsers are free. Modern browsers are easier to support. modern browsers are more secure. Modern browsers increase productivity. Modern browsers have low system requirements. There's no real excuse for not using them.<p>But lets carry on as we are. It's been working crap so far, but let's soldier on at a snails pace. With any luck, we'll be able to stop supporting IE7 sometime around the point we all retire. And heaven forbid we explore any new angles on how to push things forward, even if it's just out of pure interest, because that's wrong... apparently.",1312451048

I mean, if you know who the other bidders are, that would affect your strategy, removing some purity from the auction process, wouldn't it?<p>But, maybe you feel I'm sidestepping your real issue, so let me make another point:
In any situation where companies might collude like this, they're effectively creating a cartel. Say, in the case of the employee salaries that you mention.<p>The problem with a cartel is that there is always an incentive for a member of the cartel to violate the agreement.  For instance, if MSFT, Apple, Facebook and Google agreed to cap software developer salaries, then Google (or one of the others) has an incentive to secretly violate that agreement to get the best employees, right?<p>Pretty soon the cartel falls apart, or the agreement has no effect.  The stronger the agreement, the more incentive there is to violate it.<p>Further, imagine if they were successful and kept salaries below a market rate-- this would give a huge boost to any of their competitors who were willing to pay market rates, right?<p>They'd only be shooting themselves in the foot by doing so, driving the best employees to other companies.<p>This is why cartels don't really work, or at least aren't sustainable for very long.",1312450341

One of which involved solving the visual glitches that appear in online games due to the high latency of playing over a modem.  This patent involved a lot of timing issues, and was pretty narrow.<p>However it was claimed on slashdot that we ""patented the idea of online gaming!!!!""<p>Later, in a discussion list, they claimed we'd patented the idea of IRC!<p>People seem to presume that patents are on ideas, and that people are patenting really obvious ideas.<p>In the case of the patents I've been involved in, that is not what has happened.  In fact, the portrayal of what was covered by the patent didn't match the patent at all, and it is clear that the people putting forward those patents as examples of bad patents were, frankly misrepresenting them.<p>Every time I've seen a bogus patent claim and actually read the patent, I've found this to be the case as well. (I don't remember the linked-list example, so haven't read that particular one.)<p>I'm not saying that bogus patents don't exist. I'm sure you can get things by the examiner.<p>But the system has a solution for this-- if your patent is bogus then it won't stand up in court.  If prior art exists, then you run the risk of spending a lot of money, only to have the patent nullified when someone presents prior art. (And I mean real prior art, not the kind of stuff that people claim is prior art, like the claim that IRC is prior art for solving clock jitter in 3D online games)<p>The patent system, as with anything else that relies on the meager US court system, is expensive... but there is no need for reform, that I can see, as all these allegedly bogus patents would be quickly thrown out if they really were as obvious as is claimed and if there really was the abundance of prior art, as is claimed.<p>Google is certainly capable, both financially and intellectually, of getting a bogus patent thrown out.  There's no reason they should be calling on the federal government to intervene with a political ""solution"" on their behalf... unless they know that there isn't actually prior art and the patents are, in fact, legitimate.<p>In fact, I think googles call for reform is an admission that the patents aren't bogus after all.<p>Edit: I didn't change the text above, but want to clarify- I'm responsible for some claims on one of these patents, though not named as an inventor (I didn't realize the significance at the time.) For the other I am the sole inventor, but it hasn't been brought forth as ""bogus"" in a public forum yet, though, for those who don't read it carefully, they could easily make the claim.  This is why I'm being vague about the specific patents.  Previous experience on Hacker News tells me that if I wasn't vague the topic would turn to how those patents are so obviously ""bogus"" (to people who haven't read more than the headline)... and well, frankly my name is on them.  I really don't to be discriminated against in business for having a pr-intellectual property position.  The current climate makes that fear seem pretty legitimate.",1312449769

It should be much more ingrained in the culture that management, even more than programmers, is a ""resource"", and exists to provide services to the working class and to make its life easier.<p>For entrepreneurs it's not an unusual mindset to think that the owner is the one who empties the wastebasket, but I very much doubt this is common in the corporate world. It should be, not because emptying wastebaskets is a worthwhile thing to do, but because it encourages the ideology that management is there to pave the way between the people who work and what they have to do.",1312449712

I love my job and work crazy hours, but I struggle with burnout regularly, and often need to disengage from work for periods of time in order to recuperate.

I would argue that people with 'harmonious passion' are simply less passionate about their work than the 'obsessives', which allows them to 'turn off the switch' so to speak.<p>As a side note, it is probably fairly difficult if not impossible to objectively measure passion, so I guess it is pretty pointless to debate any of this in the first place.",1312449661

Producing anonymous/pseudonymous content is fine, but how can I, as a consumer of that content (reader of reviews) can make sure I can trust it?<p>+ offerring users the protection they want from entities bothered by the content you produce. This can range from the extreme cases of freedom of speech, minorities, sensitive issues (medical, sexual orientation) to the more trivial examples of bad reviews for restaurants where the owners might track you down.<p>+ incentivizing the production of high quality content and discussions (see the quality of YouTube comments for a case of user generated content gone wrong :-) ).<p>+ making it easy for users to deal with this identity complexity. Understanding that even though you are logged in with your GMail account you are posting as a Nickname, understanding what others can or cannot infer about you.<p>It's a complicated problem full of tradeoffs any way you want to go.
