Take a look at the Vitamin R help docs - it reads more like a self-help book than a software manual, which I really appreciated.

Anyways heres a possible performance improvement for a very long string:<p>Assume the string is stored as a linked-list (so removing characters from the middle of the string is cheap).  Then remove duplicates from the string during the initial traversal (keep track of unique characters that were removed as duplicates in a hashtable).  After this single traversal the character in the head node of the remaining linked-list will be the first non-repeated character in the original string.<p>Note the string must be stored in the linked-list initially... if we're responsible for moving the string from a theoretical array w/ billions of elements then we have to traverse the string twice just like the original algorithm and nothing is gained.<p>Please clarify the ""usually in the middle"" part of your question.

Like my EE professor (who spent the war years building $100 radar jamming tools that rendered million-dollar radar sets inoperative) said, the odds are stacked in favor of the jammer.<p>A crude example is a ham-radio fox hunt.  A radio is hidden somewhere in a pre-agreed area and teams of foxhunters are set loose once the fox ready to go.  If the fox is exactly one transmitter and its power is steady, it can still take the better part of an hour, for example, to locate a fox hidden within a one block area.<p>So increase the ability of the trackers, say with doppler direction finders mounted on roofs.  Now the jammers can do the following things to continue to wreak havoc.<p>1) Vary the power in 3db steps, perhaps in a loose random fashion.  Fox-hunting techniques include rotating an antenna and pinpointing where signal strength peaks.<p>2)  Using carefully time-syncronized jamming boxes, scatter three or four of them around the area and have them turn take turns being on.  Or have two out of three on in some overlapping way.<p>3) Combine 1&2.<p>4) Oh, make them mobile.",1313112488

I understand that as the CEO of a startup with $42 million he has to sound like he knows what he's doing, but surely anyone reading that statement would have serious reservations about either using the product or investing in the company.<p>Or perhaps he's an MBA-type who thinks that deep pockets have to mean competing in every single ""hot"" tech space, instead of excelling at one thing first. Even the giant companies he cites didn't stick their fingers in so many cookie jars: Apple had the iPod, Google had search, and Facebook had interactive college directory. That they are competing now is only possible because of their earlier mastery of a narrow area. And yet, perhaps because of their lofty ambitions, Color is a data mining company without data, and a photo-sharing company without anyone sharing photos on it.<p>Please don't ascribe this to any bubble. Sometimes, the best intentions of a group of talented charmers can fall by the wayside for a variety of reasons. Perhaps they got carried away by dreaming about what they would do with Facebook's data, or Google's algorithmic prowess, or Apple's UX process. Perhaps they just couldn't connect.
