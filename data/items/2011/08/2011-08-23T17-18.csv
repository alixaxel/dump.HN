Certainly there's instances of <i>some guys</i> treating women ""very poorly"", and there's plenty of instances of <i>most guys</i> treating women <i>differently</i>, but your assertion just seems way, way off. Unless your definition of ""very poorly"" is incredibly different than mine.<p>"" Even here in the liberal Bay Area I encounter lots of guys (who vote Democratic) treating their wives and girlfriends like chattel.""\nFirst, is political stance really indicative of ability to treat (ostensibly) loved ones well? I find this a bit hard to believe. Jerks are jerks, regardless of political leanings, and I don't think either party is without plenty of them.\nSecond, what do you mean by chattel? I'm going to be a little pedantic an say that the ""ownership"" implied by a marriage is actually a good thing. It's bidirectional, voluntary, and symbolic. I know that's not what you meant though -- so if you're meeting ""lots"" of men who treat their women like slaves or livestock -- well, I don't want to visit the clubs you go to, I guess.<p>""If us guys don't become gents, the trend will continue.""\nThis was the icing on the cake, though. Do you really believe that women were treated <i>better</i> in the past? You're implying that there will be less women because their treatment is getting <i>worse</i>.",1314122391

But obviously, this 1997 article doesn't nearly cover the bases on all the other things you have to do correctly to not end up with trivially breakable cryptography. A lot of those things weren't even known to the public in 1997.<p>An even more important point is that Zimmerman is talking about cryptography implemented in its strongest, safest venue: data at rest. As implemented by most developers today, crypto ends up in a far more exposed venue: one where a server holds a secret key and uses crypto not to protect a file but to enforce policy. Despite being the 2011 common case for crypto, this is a far harder scenario to get right, because adversaries can devise ways to query the key-holder to learn things about the plaintext, ciphertext, and behavior of the system as a whole.<p>My advice: don't trust crypto at all outside of TLS, GPG/PGP, and SSH.

Approving, hosting, and marketing all those free apps comes at a cost that adds up.<p>By contrast Apple likes to mark up hardware at 100% over bill of materials. That is to say if $300 worth of components goes into an iPhone, Apples wants to sell it for at least $600. The major exception to this is the iPad which Apple takes less to keep pressure on the competition.<p>Regarding iAds, I believe iAds was suppose to have sold around $65 million worth of ads for the initial launch.

WebAPI is about device integration which is <i>compatible</i> with WebIntents.
