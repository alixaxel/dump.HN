Productivity is going to decrease as communication issues arise. People at motorola will probably get annoyed at being dictated to, always being wrong for misunderstanding directives, and want to move on (like I said above will take Google for all they can while they do it).

Same goes for Rewards/Miles/CreditCard, etc...<p>4. ANY account/service in which I'm active and you have a feature that you somehow KNOW I'm going to want/need -  Notify me immediately.
