Your comment draws a completely different picture.<p><i>I can’t juggle. I definitely can’t juggle multiple clients and serve them well on the thin time margins I’m keeping. I’ve always failed when I tried. I know my limits. I don’t want my reputation and talent to take me where my integrity can’t sustain me (and it will, if left unchecked). It damages my rep and renders my talent meaningless in the grand scheme of client services. “He’s real talented, but he doesn’t do what he says” is a massive failure unless my goal is to be known as an unprofessional, out of work, real talented guy. I’d rather serve one client to the best of my abilities than multiple clients simultaneously, mediocrely.</i>",1314496233

So, in Lucid, if 3.6 is still supported by Mozilla, that is the version still on maintained (you know, for consistency...thing thing most people here are railing against).<p>However, as soon as mozilla drops support for 3.6, the latest supported version is installed. This happened for Lucid, as I understand it.<p>This is a sane policy, IMO.<p>If, however, you are on Lucid and want to run a different version of Firefox, it is rather trivial. You can find it in  Ubuntu Software Center after adding a repo and install it. This is NOT what most non-technical people want to do, however, and that is why the policy makes sense IMO.<p>And, I agree, FF auto-upgrading itself to 6 is nice on OSX and XP, but that is a Mozilla thing, not Linux.

2933053,comment,2932355,2932961,2,0,jahmed,,,"Yeah I agree, the rough approximation is Wal-Mart selling loss leaders to drive other higher margin sales. In the case of Google, we see they ""sell"" Google Docs for free to create network effects (and to erode the lock in of Office) and to cross promote other Google products. This is controversial but is hardly new in any industry.<p>Yes I agree that after a company gains market power there is an incentive to raise prices but I dont think there are many (any?) examples of Google switching a free product to a paid one.<p>You missed the point, Google isn't evil. Yes they make it difficult to compete but thats what successful companies do. The difference is Google does it by making simple disruptive products and prices them at their marginal cost. Google isn't a monopoly by any definition. Google isnt the single seller in any of their markets, Google doesnt compete in a market with high barriers to entry and Google isnt a price maker. Users (advertisers and internet service consumers) can easily switch to competing products and avoid Google entirely.<p>Google is powerful yes, but they create value by helping their users keep their money.

2933048,comment,2931598,2931598,3,0,anon5,,,"We can at best <i>hope</i> that it is going to turn out well, in the end.<p>Anna Hazare is being hastily compared to Gandhi. Before this he had good credentials, i.e. was fairly well known in India, but he was just one-among-many-equals (not even first among equals) of social activists.<p>The positive though is that, the three most important people around him, also have got good credentials. Okay two at least (Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal). About the third - Mr. Bhushan - not much was known earlier.<p>Arvind Kejriwal in particular had worked very hard in the activism space, being one of the key guys behind acts such as RTI. (It may interest the HN community more, that he happens to be a product of IIT in India - the most reputable tech institution over here. )<p>But this sudden burst of 'I-want-results-now' sort of hyper activism. Has left an admirer like me <i>confused</i>  at best. Confused, as to whether the good guys indeed are still on the right track. Or have broken down.<p>Broken down, akin to a website owner, who after years of toiling to build traffic the clean and hard way, have suddenly resorted to black hat SEO. \n(If the analogy is not obvious, I mean, just like dirty and unethical SEO, may be easy to build traffic. Similarly <i>fast to death</i> is an easy way to build frenzy. Not easy always, but easy once in a while, and this technique was being applied the first time in front of new TV media).<p>And just being good people and having good intentions is not enough. You have to be a lot careful with these things. As they say 'With power comes more .....'.<p>Want to recount an anecdote to make a point: Recently I had a reason to visit a village in northern India. I won't polish my words here - The experience was ugly. The village was very dirty. The people ultra lazy. Open drains all over the place smelling bad. People just sitting idle. Houses in the state of decay, but no body is working to rebuild them. Electricity comes only in the night, that of course is not their problem.<p>My family and me had planned to stay for 2 days there. But had to rush back the same day, as I could not simply just  get myself to use the dirty toilet there. (Call me whatever - snobbish, unfeeling, uncaring, etc. but I am being brutally honest here)<p>So a thought occurred to me. That its not <i>corruption-freedom</i> they need now urgently. Its basic education (for their kids) and perhaps some inspiration (and some training also won't hurt) in life to get up from their haunches and start doing some <i>work</i>.<p>I may sound like a right wing capitalist here. But that's just a label, and my anon status gives me the liberty to write freely. And BTW,  in general I am left leaning for various things - have followed Paul Krugman's writings for past few years. And also, I am a big fan of the Mahatma Gandhi. (I needed to say this, to give my fellow Indians, a background of where I am coming from. So before even you start getting to abusing me, please at-least bother to understand me)<p>On the matter of abuse, I feel sorry for Manmohan Singh our PM. People just don't have any broader perspective. And can just so easily be swayed from one side to another. Not long back - i.e. until about two years back - he was being hailed as a great person, who ushered India into liberalization of the 90s. Which allowed the GDP to become 8% from and liberated it from the Hindu growth rate of 3-4%. And allowed a great Indian middle class to emerge, etc. etc.<p>But now, the very same people, are just after his blood all the time. I was almost fearing that the poor guy does not get a heart attack, from so much pressure, while every body else is worried about Anna's health (no disrespect to him either).<p>Now on corruption: People don't even see the irony of what they are saying and supporting. In the past two years lots of scams have been uncovered - CWG & 2G-spectrum-allocation the most prominent of them.<p>IMO two things that were most instrumental for the uncovering were: 1) The RTI (right to information) law passed only few years back and 2) the CAG reports. Powerful personalities went to jail (still are in jail) and many others still live in fear.<p>So is that a good thing or a bad thing? Meaning, will people would have been better off if these were not uncovered or are people better off now that they are in fact uncovered.<p>The least the uncovering of these scams tells, is that the system is working. So one would expect that people will work towards empowering the current set of things (laws/institutions) which have proven that they are very effective. And not indulge in hyper-activism, the outcome of which is at best unpredictable. Even enact more laws, who is stopping.<p>But no sir. We want some more blood. And we want it now. So what, if the movement or agitation, call it whatever you like, shames India into looking like a Arab country. (Some lunatic journo, surely compared this with an 'Arab Spring' ... I almost heard him. )<p>Silent evolutionary things, are much more powerful, than a revolutionary change. The latter also can be helpful. But people leading them have to be sure. Really really sure. I honestly am still confused, at best. I still don't doubt the intentions of Kejriwal and Ms. Bedi. I hope they are guided well by their inner beings...<p>And did I miss an Obama like orator, to articulate the government's perspective on things.<p>EDIT: No disrespect to Arab countries either. My remark is only intended for the rulers (kings) of those countries, which have obviously been abusing the populace, who have now very bravely gathered the will to fight them.",1314495686

Unless you argue that home buyers are systematically better at accounting for inflation than bankers, of course.<p>Stranger things have happened. Bankers have been wrong before. You could say that home sellers were right when banks who loaned money to buyers were wrong in 2006. I think inflation is likely to be higher than most people think, because there's no politically possible solution to the government's debt problems other than inflating our way out of it, despite its previous record of being a reliable debtor. If I'm right, that will mean that home buyers are indeed systematically better at accounting for inflation than bankers (or more like they will turn out to accidentally happen to be right).<p>At any rate, if the cost of renting is close to the cost of buying, as it is in my town (it's about the same here except that you don't have to fix the roof, etc, if you're renting), then even if I'm wrong, I won't lose much money as a new homebuyer in the next year or so.<p>>The problem with buying a house is that it's a massive bet on your local labor market.<p>That depends on your job. If you're have some specialized job or you're in a small town, that's something to think about, but lots of people have jobs for which they would never have to move. Even if that is an issue, it also depends on how comfortable you are with being a landlord, and how many people you know who would make likely good tenants.",1314493334
