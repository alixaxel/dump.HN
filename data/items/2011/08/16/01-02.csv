2889477,comment,2877563,2887525,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"The core of the simplex algorithm, and the key to its considerable power, is a cute application of elementary row operations selected to improve the value of the objective function.  That's the 'algebraic' part.  There is a cute, and significant, geometric part:  The collection of feasible solutions is an intersection of finitely many closed half spaces and, thus, is closed and convex.  The set has finitely many extreme points.  At each iteration, the simplex algorithm starts at an extreme point.  The elementary row operation causes the algorithm to try to move along an edge that improves the value of the objective function.  In case of 'degeneracy', the algorithm can execute algebraically but stand still geometrically, but there are techniques to do the right things in this case.<p>So, the core really isn't Gaussian elimination for systems of linear inequalities.<p>For more, LP and the simplex algorithm are surprisingly powerful:  Part of the reason is, for a huge range of optimization problems, taking a local linear approximation and then attacking that with simplex is often the best technique known.  There are also surprising connections with combinatorial optimization and some classic NP-complete problems.  What LP and simplex do on networks is also surprising and powerful; e.g., there simplex takes on a special form based on spanning trees.",1313459665

This is demonstrably not true.""<p>I'm exaggerating, but, still there is a reasonable point here.  CS is about some 'science', and call that the mathematical part where we have some solid material worth being called 'science',  For the rest, call that 'computer practice' or some such.<p>The upside of my view is that for some serious progress we're going to have to use some serious methodology.  So, I'm proposing if not mathematical physics envy then applied math envy.  Applied math didn't take on how to design the display lights in a scientific pocket calculator although without the lights the thing wouldn't work.<p>My view is not the most extreme:  Last year I communicated with a CS prof whose position was that CS is looking for the 'fundamentals of computation'.  Hmm ....  It sounds like he believes that the P versus NP question should be right at the top of the list, and I don't.  I'll settle for anything that is solid and a contribution, even if small, to the 'science' and not just to current practice.<p>LIkely many people here know the current state of programming language research much better than I do.  If that field has gotten nicely mathematical with some solid material, great.  The progress from Fortran, Cobol, Algol, Basic, PL/I, Pascal, C, C++, etc. was pragmatic and important and of enormous value to the economy but not much progress in a 'science' of programming languages, and that progress, with poor methodology, has slowed as we might have expected.<p>Maybe I'm saying that, in 1920, if we wanted a really good airplane, then maybe we should set aside the wood, linen, and glue and go do some aerodynamiocs calculations, discover Reynolds number, and discover that those really thin wings were a mistake.  Or, observational astronomy was just a lot of curiosity until Newton came along and made progress in understanding the universe.  The practical chemists had discovered a LOT, but by applying quantum mechanics they made HUGE progress.<p>If we are going to make the huge progress we want in computing, then history suggests that we can't be just pragmatic and that ""theory is under-rated"".  We can't expect that chemistry will do much to help CS, but the obvious tool is math, to turn CS, the science, part into some applied math.",1313458742

Of course he wouldn't.<p>I still read Gruber everyday- he has a lot of interesting things to say about technology in general and Apple in particular. But it is increasingly hard to take him seriously about any story related to Apple's anti-android litigation, because he seems to have abandoned any attempt to present the situation fairly, to the point where he has really become a rather naked shill for Apple.<p>I am typing this on an iPad 2.
