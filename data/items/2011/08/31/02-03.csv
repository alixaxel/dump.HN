2944057,comment,2943309,2943309,1,0,Joakal,,,"An official letterhead letter be a cheap way to demand reimbursement. The letter can say ""<person> wishes to cease employment and requests reimbursement for $<amount> for <work> by <date>. Please avoid delays otherwise there may be further costs."" The employer can then settle to avoid further costs for both sides. I don't believe that such demands mean you are required to take them to court. So, it's like a legal bluff.<p>That said, the work you gave them belongs to you unless you stated otherwise (look through your logs). If the employer uses it, then you can send them an invoice for a license to use your IP with a notice that there'll be annual charges starting <date>. The employer will want to come to you for a full IP release. Otherwise, send an overdue notice then later send the unpaid invoice to collections after the overdue date if the employer refuses to pay.<p>Or release the code/work to GitHub or similar. You own the code (unless waived otherwise).<p>Note: The employer sounds quite charming to you, you'll need to plan out what to do before meetings including attempts to 'understand your plight' for lower but legally binding settlement (eg undesirable $100 reimbursement). But most important: stick to your objectives, not theirs. Maybe bring someone who can provide strong support which you can say they are present 'as a witness'. Maybe take a look in seduction ;)<p>IANAL, you should seek your own answers from someone more local at least. There's many ways to go about it like I listed above.",1314759486

That is to say, libertarians believe that the initiation of force is immoral, and thus use of force against the initiators is just, but only sufficient to mitigate the crime.<p>When someone steals your laptop, they are initiating force. In doing so, they give you the right to use methods, such as  this software, to recover the laptop.  But that right only extends to recovering the laptop, not to unnecessarily violate the privacy of the thief.   While the thief does owe the laptop owner compensation for the crime, this is something that is determined via court, not by the victim of the crime.<p>So, yes, you have the right to hack into your laptop, turn on the webcam, collect evidence necessary to locate and recover the laptop, but you don't have the moral right to exploit the thief beyond that.<p>I remember the Defcon presentation had some privacy obscuring bits for the thief when he took nude shots of himself in the shower.  That's appropriate.  Shaming the theif by showing their face is reasonable, but only if you know they aren't an accidental victim.  Sharing the thief's nude photos with the police or with any unnecessary third parties, where the they are not necessary for recovery, is a violation of privacy.<p>At least morally.

Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and are also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.</i><p>COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING<p><i>The purpose of this course is to study the components of computing systems common to most computer architectures. In particular, this class is meant to introduce data representation, types of processors (e.g., RISC V. CISC), memory types and hierarchy, assembly language, linking and loading, and an introduction to device drivers.</i><p>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING<p><i>The purpose of this course is to provide a general survey of software engineering. Some of the topics covered include: project planning and management, design techniques, verification and validation, and software maintenance. Particular emphasis is on a group project in which a group of 4-5 students implement a system from its specification.</i><p>-----<p>Also, I'm supplementing this with Stanford, MIT, and other schools' free coursework and various online tutorials/books.

The downside, of course, is that people in the front quickly run out of overhead space while there is still plenty of room in the back.
