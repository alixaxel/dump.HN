To use the jargon of evolutionary biologists who think about such things, it would drive noncooperation into extinction.<p>I don't think this works.  Although co-operating works great for the majority, that just means it allows a few to 'cheat' and get the biggest payoffs.",1313373587

I view it as extreme form of insight rather than a measure of IQ, although a high IQ helps. I like to think of genius in terms of perspective and thus measure it by how rare and valuable a perspective is.<p>Your level of insight/understanding will vary from one domain to another. A financial genius like Warren Buffet sees how the financial world connects in a way that few others do, but that insight/understanding doesn't necessarily mean he'll see the connections that an artist sees and yet you might say that both are genius.",1313373171

2885106,comment,2884684,2885022,6,0,corin_,,,"It's definitely not a case of avoiding boasting in my case - and not because I'm a modest person, but because I'm the exact opposite, and I would have absolutely no problem shouting from the rooftops about how awesome I am based on IQ tests if I felt that to be something worth boasting about.<p>The thing with IQ tests is that it measures a very specific type of skill, and to use that to define intelligence is insulting to an awful lot of people.<p>The two people who own my company, who I work for, don't have degrees, they're not particularly mathematically skilled, and I don't think they'd do particularly well on an IQ test - not saying they'd get a terrible score, but they wouldn't come of as mensa candidates. And yet they're too of the brightest people I know, they've done amazing things in their careers and I have a huge amount of respect for them.<p>My dad is another person with a not-great IQ, and yet in my (admitedly biased) view he's the cleverest person I know Whether it's when he's buying/selling stocks, or betting on horses, or working out taxes, he can do it all in his head at a crazy speed - not with any education, just because maths is easy for him. But that's not why I think he's clever. He's clever because of the way he's lived his life and the decisions he's made, many of which have made me insanely proud.<p>I on the other hand have a high IQ, I did well in school with no work (well, I dropped out at 16 because I was bored, by ""did well"" I mean stuff like the fact that I got an A* GCSE in French at 15 even though I can't, and couldn't then either, speak French). Sure, it can be useful to be able to float through in areas where that kind of intelligence is useful, but it sure ain't everything.<p>My point is that there's more to life than one very specific set of skills, and to think otherwise is narrowminded and big-headed. Not big-headed about having an IQ, but about thinking that your high IQ makes you better than someone with a lower IQ.",1313373045

Doing that might almost be understandable, at least if the person doing it had (a) no better income options, (b) few personal scruples. But going to the trouble of taking the money just to piss it away on some random charity does <i>not</i> constitute, as you say, ""getting a high per-hour return"" on one's effort. In exchange for destroying $650, all Sam got is the warm fuzzy of knowing he's ""done something nice"" in giving to charity. Offset with the cold pricklies of knowing he's ""done something rotten"" in stealing money from others for a use the donors didn't intend, it's at best a wash. He inflicted a cost of $650 on others without them <i>or him</i> receiving any compensating benefit!<p>Which brings us back to the analogy: A committed vandal could <i>easily</i> do $130/hour worth of damage to random companies or people with minimal risk - if, as Sam did, they had no intent of personally profitting from it. That's what Sam was: a vandal, more than a thief. Like the teen who throws a rock through a window when nobody is watching or destroys bathroom fixtures.<p>An awful lot of what makes civilization work is our tacit agreement to the code immortalized by Wil Wheaton: ""don't be a dick."" The fact that you <i>can</i> do something nasty and damaging to other people doesn't mean you <i>should</i>. The fact that in some circumstance it's particularly <i>easy</i> to steal from others doesn't give you a moral obligation to do so; quite the reverse.<p>Some people are very trusting. They might leave doors unlocked or purses unguarded. They choose to go out in public without armed guards and trust that a random stranger on the street isn't going to be a mugger or rapist or kidnapper.<p>When somebody who is especially trusting gets taken advantage of by someone unscrupulous, people generally find that <i>especially</i> worthy of criticism.
