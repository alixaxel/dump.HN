But as far as ""comfortable living"" goes, the average $90,000 salary in Silicon Valley, minus the high California tax burden, does not provide ""comfortable living"" when a run down 3 bedroom home costs on average $860,000, vastly above the ability of said $90,000 wage earner to afford. It barely provides sustenance living. This is why many of these average paid developers have 3-4 hour commutes from far away, and others are living packed 5 to a room, and few are able to attract a mate.<p>This is completely a different topic from the discussion though so I'd prefer not to continue with it, if you would like to, it would be best to start a new thread.<p>Developers in many other parts of the country can live comfortably with an average wage.

On the other hand, there are a few NoSQL solutions built using Java: HBase, Neo4J, Cassandra.<p>In some cases, JVM Hotspot optimizes code on-par with C/C++. I don't know much about D performance. If the speed improvement is not night-and-day for projects other than being mentioned above, and if writing readable code is much better in Java, I'm not sure if we should compare C/C++ vs Java.

In what area? horizontal vs vertical scaling? developer's productivity (or team performance) scale? performance? speed? Erlang seems to excel in a niche area (in a positive speaking).<p>What about Haskell/Ada, how are they safer than Java? Do they have better type-systems? handles NULL better than Java? Bulletproof from developers? detect more bugs?<p>Keep in mind that Java ecosystems have grown and matured a lot since 2004. The tools and libraries are staggering. Most of your concerns are no longer relevant except ""eats memory like candy"" in most Java desktop apps.

Best practices in most cases, pragmatics when needed, hacks when the world ends tomorrow.<p>Companies chose Java for varieties of reasons and yes, one of them is the available pool of talents. I'm sure we all have heard the old phrase ""enterprise developers"". Some of them are bad, while others are quite sharp when it comes to the typical enterprise stack.

If you do need to push one, maybe to synchronize your work and home computers, tell your teammates that the branch you pushed is private so they dont base work off of it.<p>You should never merge a private branch directly into a public branch with a vanilla merge. First, clean up your branch with tools like reset, rebase, squash merges, and commit amending.""<p>I'm wonder how people address cleaning a private branch that has been pushed (when your goal is to get its changes into master cleanly). Rebasing the private branch is pretty much out of the picture since it has been pushed (unless you don't care about pushing it again). I can see some ways of doing this:<p>1) You could do a diff patch and apply it master, then commit.<p>2) You could checkout your private feature branch, do a git reset to master in such a way that your index is still from the private, then commit it. Ex:<p>currently on private branch
git reset --soft master<p>Now all the changes from the private branch are changes to be committed on master. This is easy, but it puts everything in one commit.<p>If you wanted to do a few commits for different, but stable points, but you already pushed the private branch and can't rebase it, you could instead do ""git reset --soft"" on successive points in the private branch commit chain, committing to master as you go.<p>If you wanted to reorder commits from the private branch, I guess you could rebase the private branch (which means you can't push again since you pushed it already), then do the tactic from the last paragraph, then ditch the private branch cause it's no longer pushable.<p>Does anyone have better ways of putting changes to master for private branches that have already been pushed?",1312178875
