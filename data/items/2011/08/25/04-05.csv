I know that for all positive x, 0^x = 0. That it pops up to 1 at the origin means the thing is not smooth so drawing lines isn't going to help us.<p>Plotting z = y^x could be interesting but we're going to see asymptotic behaviour at x = y = 0 (when going in the x direction).

They replaced GameStop's functional, DOS-based POS and adopted EB's slow, windows version. The transition was terrible, and the company seemed deaf to the complaints that holiday lines were getting longer and longer as they added features to an already slow and bloated system.<p>I quit and returned to school a couple years after the merger, it was the right decision, of course.<p>I loved my time at GameStop.
