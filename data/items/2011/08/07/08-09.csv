The government is about ensuring a framework of freedom for its citizens to operate within, and if the citizenry refuses to be productive or healthy there's nothing the government can do about it.<p>Do you support alcohol prohibition? Alcohol leads to much more damage than even smoking from an emotional and psychological perspective.<p>What if, one day, the government decides that people who buy Japanese cars are a danger to themselves since they are costing the American car companies so much money by refusing to buy home-grown goods? The people just don't have the foresight to understand that buying Honda today means depression throughout Michigan tomorrow. Shouldn't we protect people from that eventuality by ensuring that they only buy domestic vehicles?<p>How far do we take this? Why do we believe that the politicians have such a heightened sense of foresight and such impeccably unselfish motives? I don't vote for people so they can do my thinking for me, I vote for people who I think will best represent important core principles, like retaining individual free exercise of conscience (like the choice to buy American or foreign cars, even if it will cost Michigan a lot of jobs).<p>The attitude that we need the government to protect us from our own decisions is in fact extremely dangerous and insidious. Old people survived for thousands of years before the implementation of social security -- if the industrial society doesn't support old people well enough, we have to tweak it so that these things work instead of doing these grotesque hacks of taking > 10% of an average person's salary every year to pay to support your grandpa's RV tour of the US.",1312707543
2856232,comment,2856095,2856194,3,0,WarDekar,,,"That's great if the businesses purchasing Groupons are aware of this and know how to use the deals to their advantage.  The problem comes when Groupon doesn't care about the businesses they're selling to at all and push sales that actually hurt those businesses.  It's great for Groupon's current revenue, but it's horrible for their long term prospects- there are only so many small businesses you can screw over before they all realize it isn't a good deal for them, and Groupon's business drops off a cliff.<p>And I'm not excusing the small businesses here- certainly they should do their own homework and determine whether doing a Groupon deal is a good business decision for them, but when Groupon sales people are pushing these things like crack and pressuring businesses into buying what is an obviously negative value deal, they (meaning Groupon) won't get good referrals in the business community, they won't get repeat customers, and they'll run out of 'users' to exploit.<p>From all accounts it seems sales reps at Groupon have no interest in helping their customers come up with deals that actually make sense and are only interested in volume because they get commission bonuses- this is not a long term business model.",1312707518

2856225,comment,2856095,2856095,14,0,patio11,,,"Groupon is a legitimate business, which sells a real product for real money, in a manner that attempts to generate value for customers in a two-sided marketplace.  It is an exceptionally risky business, like every other startup that aspires to the trajectory of ""Go from nowhere to selling a billion dollars of product in two years.""<p>It is entirely possible investors will get burned in an extraordinary fashion on Groupon.  It is also possible they will end up with money hats.  Capitalism happens.  If capitalism happening to you would negatively impact your ability to feed your family, do not buy stock in Groupon.  (Do not buy any individual stocks, either.)<p>With regards to their accounting practices: I'm agnostic as to whether any particular treatment of another company's numbers is maximally reflective of the interests of third-parties wishing to invest in them.  That said, have you noticed we are not exactly a paint-within-the-lines industry?<p>Heck, even answering very freaking simple questions with intent to be maximally honest while complying with all regulations gets very difficult.  For example, when do you think you can recognize revenue for selling someone $10 for 1,000 gold coins if they then immediately spend 500 gold coins on a Sword of Dragonslaying?  If you have not read about this specific case before, I guarantee your first three guesses are wrong.  Or, to pick an example near and dear to my heart, what <i>exactly</i> is getting sold when you take $29.95 from a customer and mark their account as Registered?  Is it real property?  If so, where is that property sold?  ""The location that a customer takes delivery"", swell: do they ""take delivery"" at my business or at my server or at their home address or at their place of work?  Is it perhaps not a real property and instead royalties?  Is it a fee for a service?  Oh, that depends on whether customization and support is offered: how much support is support?  Answering emails is support if I make changes to the product on the basis of them?<p>I have given tax offices on two continents head-explosions just with the accounting for BCC.

That's at odds with the proposition behind many specialty stores and boutiques (eg vinyl records, hair salons, upmarket clothing, etc).<p>Groupon as a standalone business just digitizes those local coupon books that used to come in the mail or be sold at bulk for ten bucks or whatever.

So when Win7 came out and was not bad (perception wise), all those who held out were happy to update. It's possible the Win8 updates won't be as popular because Win7 (like XP before it) is good enough that there is no compelling reason to upgrade.<p>But even assuming it does do 300 million in 2 years - poll your favorite developers; what is the time frame since win7 was out that they are willing to do a ""win 7 only"" release? (no vista support, no xp support)?

Then you say:<p>> Existing maintenance and filing fees clearly have not been enough to prevent large numbers of frivolous patents.<p>But this does not support your earlier assertion - the existing fees actually _support_ a large number of frivolous patents, because the value of a patent is (potentially) infinite, whereas the cost is known, and not prohibitive. The existing fees were NOT designed to curb patents -- they were designed to make it profitable for the government.<p>> Any IP tax would have to be quite a bit larger than fees existing now to be effective.""<p>My proposal addresses this perfectly.
