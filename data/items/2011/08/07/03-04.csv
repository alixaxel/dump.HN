2855702,comment,2855397,2855503,4,0,nhebb,,,"B) Shorten the term of patents for software. IIRC, the current term in the US is 20 years - basically the lifespan of the internet to date. Software innovation turns much faster than that. A patent term of 5 years would allow serious patent filers to capitalize on the R&D, while providing too short of a term for patent trolls to get a return on investment when acquiring mass amounts of patents.",1312689496

Linux is much bigger than him now. The whole point of the list is ""In the areas where these people are considered 'important', who could I totally piss off and not see too many negative ramifications?'"" I just don't see Torvalds wielding the kind of power or influence to really make or break a person/business.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to besmirch Linus, I think he's pretty awesome. I'm just saying, after thinking about it some, I understand why he might be on this list.<p>And I don't know that I would call git innovative, <i>per se</i>. git wasn't the first dvcs, and it's not substantially better than some other systems (mercurial, for example). git's prevalence today is purely because it won the popularity contest, plain and simple (being Linus project certainly helped!). On top of that, while git may be a big deal for developers, git's importance to the world at large is <i>tiny</i> -- frankly I'd argue that github is more important than git itself.",1312689082

2855688,comment,2855156,2855666,1,0,halo,,,"From what I believe, Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 will be the same OS which runs the exact same apps, only with different UIs for different screen sizes/aspect ratios. Branding then becomes irrelevant: they are literally the exact same OS. No different to iOS for the iPhone and iPad, or Android running on phones and tablets.<p>It doesn't have to mean bloat either, assuming Windows sufficiently is modular. Just don't include or load the Win32 subsystem. The ARM version doesn't have backwards compatibility anyway.<p>Windows 8 should be out within the year, and given that it's an extension of the PC market it shouldn't be too late.<p>If Microsoft can pull it off successfully, it should hugely improve their mobile prospects by allowing them to use their dominance of the desktop. Buying an application once and having it work on your phone, tablet and desktop (and potentially console) is an incredibly compelling selling point that would overcome WP7's current marketshare problem. It would also make it much easier for Microsoft to introduce features: do it once, and get it on every platforms for free. It's a very forward-looking idea.",1312688940

Linux is very much still relevant in the server world and in the mobile and tablet computing world (android).

2855681,comment,2855397,2855503,2,0,troyastorino,,,"If software patents were abolished, companies could still have protection for their software on the basis of copyright law.  Copyright owners have the right to control distribution and adaptation, which would cover the legitimate intellectual property rights that companies should have over their software, and could eliminate the frivolous patent suits that are such a waste of resources. This of course would depend on what early cases would establish as a basis for what counts as copyright infringement, but hopefully it could be interpreted in a narrow enough fashion to provide protection for people's software while eliminating the threat of baseless suits.",1312688658
2855680,comment,2855397,2855503,5,0,jonmc12,,,"Really, we should be free to invent.  Option B should be that if an inventor can show a clean history of evolving an idea, it should be allowed to freely enter the market.<p>Ideas evolve over time, and the originate from something.  Perhaps if inventors were willing to register their invention documents through a set of steps mapping to something like the Technology Readiness Level (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level</a>), then they could be eligible for immunity against patent based litigation.<p>But lets say this certified patent wants to protect its IP on the market through litigation.  In this case, the inventor could first request certification of the invention in question before any further legal action occurred.<p>If we could create a certification process that is less than $2000 or so (about the cost of a provisional patent including attorney fees), it seems feasible.  This system would seek to encourage a regulated invention process that filters new inventions from even being eligible for litigation.  This allows for inventor insurance in a sense - keeping a capped cost for protecting certifiably original ideas while encouraging original invention and discouraging the incentive behind patent lawsuits.",1312688656
2855679,comment,2855397,2855522,5,0,Cushman,,,"I like this idea. We've grown too attached to the notion of ""intellectual property"", thinking of ideas as things you can own. We should get back to the purpose of IP: subsidizing the creation of new information, which by nature belongs to no one but benefits everyone, with a limited monopoly on its reproduction. If you aren't using your monopoly, then no one is benefiting, and you shouldn't have it.",1312688607

So we'll give Zuckerberg credit for launching his online social directory for college students just as the social-networking craze was getting underway.
