First of all, like any true Marxist would be first to tell you, there is no ""true Marxist"".<p>The reason being that people are still in doubt, was Marx preaching for a sudden proletarian revolution (so, no support for the bourgeois economy and social doctrines, and under this light Keynes is as far from Marxism as Adam Smith himself), or for a gradual improvement of the workers' living conditions, followed by a voluntary surrender of power by the bourgeois middle-class to the lumpen-proletariat?

2872048,comment,2871918,2871918,2,0,melvinram,,,"For those not able to go to the site, here is the Google cache version:<p>--------<p>There are over 600 million credit cards in circulation that accounts for 1.5 Trillion dollars in consumer spending. An estimated 115 million card holders carry a balance on their credit cards every month, also known as the revolvers.  These cardholders are the sweet spot for the banking industry that generate over $30 billion dollars a year in interest and fees. - Source<p>If youre like me and pay off your credit cards every month, we are known as the deadbeats to the credit card companies.  Deadbeats are consumers who avoid interest and fees by paying off their balances in full every month, rather than paying the minimum payment and carrying a balance.\nWhy it Pays to be a Deadbeat<p>Credit card companies can automatically increase your interest rate if they have any reason to believe that the risk of being repaid by the customer has increased.  This means that if youre accumulating too much debt on your credit card or if you fell behind on any other obligations such as a mortgage or a car, this is enough reason for them to increase your rate.  This practice is called the universal default.<p>Lets say for example you have a Chase credit card at a 6.9% interest rate and a Citi credit card at 11%.  It was the holiday season and you went out to buy gifts for friends and family.  You charged all the gifts on your Citi credit card and went near the high credit limit that was available.  As a financially responsible cardholder, you promptly paid off the balance in full the next month.  A few days later, you receive a letter in the mail from Chase stating that your interest rate is being increased from 6.9% to 19.9%.  It doesnt make sense does it?  Banks are allowed to increase your interest rate at any hint that you may be a high risk customer.<p>Usury laws were designed to help protect consumers from lenders who charge high interest rates.  However, major credit card issuers are based in states without usury laws.  Lets take the example from above.  If you have a Citibank credit card, take a look at where theyre located. South Dakota. If you have a Chase credit card, youll notice that theyre located in Delaware.  So what do these two states have in common?  These two states have no caps on the interest rate they can charge consumers!\nWhy Creditors Love Revolvers<p>Besides the obvious that revolvers pay only the minimum payment and generate huge profits for credit card companies, creditors understand that its difficult for someone to change their spending habit.  A consumer who recently filed for bankruptcy is a prime target.<p>Nearly all debtors stated that they had received offers for credit in the first months following their bankruptcy -Source<p>Frequency of Credit Offers Per Month in First Year after Bankruptcy  Source<p>Average	14.56\nMedian	10\nStandard Deviation	29.35\nRespondents	339<p>So why are families fresh out of bankruptcy such an ideal target?  Its hard to imagine someone to dramatically increase their income in the first few years out of bankruptcy.  Just because someone filed for bankruptcy doesnt necessarily mean that theyre more financially responsible.   People in financial distress are more likely to carry balances, exceed their credit limit, and use cash advances (which carry higher interest rates).  So what now?  New bankruptcy laws prohibit consumers filing for bankruptcy within 8 years; this means 8 years of minimum payments to the creditors!  The banks have just hit their Sweet Spot!<p>How to go from a Revolver to a Deadbeat<p>By now, who wouldnt want to be a deadbeat?  I can write an entire article on how to save money and pay off your debts.  Off the top of my head, the single biggest advice I can give you is to live within your means and start a budget.  I know it sounds lame, but I challenge you to create a monthly budget and stick with it for at least 3 months!   Anyone who is overwhelmed with debt and on the verge of default, there are realistically only a few options: credit counseling, debt settlement, and bankruptcy (if you havent already filed within 8 years).  You can go to Debteye to get a free debt analysis if you feel youve dug a hole too deep.<p>Ill end it on this note:  Congratulations to all the deadbeats out there!",1313052813

I was a sporadic recreational smoker about 15 years ago, we bought marihuana one gram at a time and that gram would last us a weekend. Maybe the difference is in THC content; I bought in the Netherlands where quality is generally high and THC concentrations relatively high in higher-end varieties, from what I understand (I don't have experience with foreign varieties to compare it with). Then again, our usage customs are different from elsewhere in the world, too; we rolled joints out of tobacco and only sprinkled on some marihuana.

Almost all of my clients insist on seeing examples of the candidates code before interviewing them. I review the code first myself to ensure I am sending someone worthwhile.<p>2: Just because someone doesn't list python on their resume, does not mean they wouldn't be a great python programmer: If you have the wealth of Python experience you are claiming and were applying for a Python Dev role would you really not alter your CV to reflect your relevance for the role? That would be lazy and counter-productive giving an instant indication of your attitude.<p>3: Just because someone has never programmed in python before, does not mean can't be the best candidate for the job. If you would say I'm unqualified to drive a ford because I've been driving toyotas, you'd be laughed at, wouldn't you? That is a ridiculous analogy. There is absolutely zero difference in the machinations of driving a Ford over a Toyota whereas there is a significantly larger learning curve for someone making the switch from PHP to Python. Couple that with the fact that if a Techinical Director insists that candidates have commercial experience in a particular language as their current workload doesn't afford them the opportunity to wait for someone to come up to speed then I am going to insist on commercial experience in that particular language. A more appropriate analogy: Would you let a lawnmower mechanic rebuild the engine on your Ferrari?<p>4: ABC: Attitude, Bandwidth and Confidence: Typical, sales jargon. You can have the greatest attitude in the world, that doesn't imply that you are going to be a great programmer. In fact, I find the majority of highly skilled programmers are inherently introvert and humble.<p>I appreciate your intention is to provide an alternative perspective but the bottom line is this: I am <i>very</i> good at what I do. I have developed a significant reputation in the real world as well as here on HN as being a recruiter who takes a different approach to the business and my clients continue to come back to me as I consistently send them top quality candidates. I know what I'm doing & if I were to apply your advice I would be undoing a lot of the great work I have accomplished to date. My advice to you would be to stick to doing what you do best and leave me to continue doing what I do best.",1313049616
