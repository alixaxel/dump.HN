Yes and no.<p>The very lowest-energy-threshold fusion reaction <i>is</i> deuterium-tritium, so must research tokamak reactors use that. The JET[1], ITER[2], et al.<p>But tritium is both expensive and excitingly dangerous, (It's an alpha emitter, which is ordinarily harmless, since the alpha particles aren't energetic enough to penetrate skin; but it's a radioactive <i>gas</i>, not a solid, so you can inhale it and get all sorts of amusing cancers) so real amateurs prefer Deuterium-Deuterium fusion, and the kind of fusion reactor that that produce the higher energies needed to accomplish it, known as fusors[3].<p>D-D fusion <i>does</i> produce neutrons, you are correct. But the PF reactor is a pulsed device, with a tiny coil size: it doesn't make many neutrons, and it produces them for seconds at a time. This guy has been checked out by the NYFD, and they've signed off on the project. If it was a power reactor, neutron emission would be a problem, but it's not, so it ain't.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_European_Torus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_European_Torus</a>

You have to get a tenuous wisp of hydrogen (the reactor in this particular experiment was running at 10 mTorr, or 0.0013% atmospheric pressure) very, very hot, and keep it away from solid matter, which is millions of degrees of colder than the fuel plasma, and will suck all of the energy out of the reaction.<p>You shut off the containment coils, and tremendously hot plasma ions leap away from each other, instantly stopping the reaction. If the reaction somehow ""runs away"", which it absolutely can't, then it brushes the walls of the vacuum chamber, poisoning it with cold metal ions, like injecting lead shavings that have been chilled to absolute zero directly into your heart.<p>If our magical ""runaway reaction"" somehow overcomes this, and melts a hole in the vacuum chamber, then the atmosphere rushes in, both freezing cold and at intolerably high pressure, like the North Sea flooding into the hull of a submarine resting on the ocean floor.<p>Fusion reactors don't melt down, or explode. At all. It just can't happen, much like how a Yugo rear-ending a garbage truck in Brooklyn doesn't instantly consume all of New York City in a gasoline fireball.<p>It is indicative of the great difficulty of both starting and sustaining a fusion reaction that the only fusion reactions which produced more energy than they consumed, that have <i>ever</i> taken place on Earth were powered by <i>atomic bombs,</i> and still only ran for fractions of a second.",1312342429

Taking a step back, remember that with an octree, contiguous areas require less tree depth to fully describe them, so open empty space (sky) and consistently filled space (uniform material underground) require much less data.

Like MacVim is line-based, and when you scroll or resize the window, it moves in ""chunks"" of one line instead of whatever pixel-precise position you drag the mouse to. And using mac-standard ""command"" key shortcuts instead of different modes (for vim) or control-key ones (emacs). [Yes I know that can all be customized in vim/emacs, just talking about out-of-the-box]. Also the ""project pane"" in TextMate is very mac-like, whereas in Vim you have NerdTree which is totally text-based (in the sense that it's like ""curses"" graphics-via-ascii-characters as opposed to icons and lines and non-monospaced-fonts), or emacs which gives you the buffer list at the bottom (if I recall). And I was never able to figure out how to get a project-wide search going in Vim. Also, the window chrome, which I guess you could classify as ""shiny"", but little things like that do appeal to a lot of people -- same reason people like the shiny and smooth macbook hardware vs. more boxy windows laptops.<p>Not saying this is objectively better, just trying to answer your question. And of course I understand there are tradeoffs between polish versus flexibility. For example, the Mac editor Coda is super-duper shiny and maclike, but it's way too inflexible for my personal tastes, so I wouldn't use that. But something like TextMate seems to hit the sweet spot for me and a lot of other people.",1312340830
