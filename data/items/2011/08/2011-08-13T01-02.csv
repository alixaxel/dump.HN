For example, if we want to scientifically manage steel production in a way that maximizes steel output per given cost, then we need highly skilled statisticians and logistics supply-chain people in charge. Presumably it's possible to develop objective tests for someone's skill at statistics or supply-chain management (that's why we have technical education, right?), and then put those skilled people in charge, rather than someone like Brezhnev. Or, if you want to develop electric cars, then put the country's top engineers on the project, rather than someone who happens to be the brother of the oblast governor's wife.<p>(I'm not sure I actually believe that. But I'm not sure I believe the market answer either, since on the scale of large companies, there are so many factors involved, that luck and timing more than skill tend to be huge ones determining who ends up in top management positions of successful companies.)",1313200614

No affiliation with the site or anything.<p>#1: ""Based on the URL, I went to the site with a preconceived notion of a new site. It seems to be a link sharing site, primary geared towards tech-oriented folks. It appears that every item is contributed by a user. There is some sort of voting/points system that probably helps determine which items the community deems important.<p>Upon further digging in, I discoverd that the 'new' section includes recently submitted links to various blogs and sites. Therefore, the main page (which had submissions with comparatively higher points), must list articles that have risen higer in ranking.<p>I was not able to relate to a lot of ""Titles"" of the submissions (for e.g. What is Django??).<p>Anyways, looks like a clean, neat, garbage-free site geared towards a particular niche. Easy to navigate, clutter free, and overall simplistically well designed.""<p>#2: ""First impression: It looks like a bare bones message board, or just a meta collection of hacker and/or programming message board threads and articles.<p>After clicking around: It's really just a blog filled with links to articles of relevance to those in the programming world (and slightly beyond), but allows the user to comment on the articles within the site, rather than on the external link sites. It's like facebook article commenting though it appears as though you can register and comment somewhat anonymously? It is somewhere in between a blog and a messageboard in that way.""<p>#3: ""I like it. Would be great if the search is in the main header""<p>#4: ""It is way too wordy and overwhelming. I don't like reading emails that are so chock full of info that you feel you have to reserve another time to read it. There didn't seem to be many articles that I would be interested in reading either. It takes me a very long time to get through emails every day, so this is not something that I would consider checking out on a frequent basis.""<p>#5: ""I have spent some time on internet forums in my teenage years though most of them were not as niche as this one. The orange colour is a bit off putting. Based on the stories on the front page right now it seems the site is for programmers and people in the computer industry or in startups. Oh well. 
However the page has a couple of interesting stories: one from slate about writing fast caught my eye. The interface seems a lot like reddit. Signing up is easy (thank god for no email verification or captcha).<p>Digging around a bit just confirms my initial hunch that the site is basically for programmers and startups. Not something I might spend a lot of time on. Maybe if there is a section specifically for general interest stories i would.<p>Overall the site looks simple and easy to use. But not my cup of tea.<p>On a side note, I had an ex boyfriend who spent a lot of time on the site.(He still does!!).

  It remains in the same state and is not turned into uranium 233, 
  which happens only if thorium is sufficiently super-heated
  to generate a fission reaction.  

</code></pre>
It says that thorium has a lot of energy, not that they can extract it: (in the middle of the article)<p><pre><code>  Because thorium is so dense, similar to uranium, it stores
  considerable potential energy: 1 gm of thorium equals the energy
  of 7,500 gallons (28,391 L) of gasoline Stevens says. 

</code></pre>
And the explanation of how it works doesn't make any sense: (at the beginning of the article)<p><pre><code>  The key to the system developed by inventor Charles Stevens,
  CEO and chairman of Connecticut-based Laser Power Systems,
  is that when silvery metal thorium is heated by an external
  source, it becomes so dense its molecules give off considerable heat.

As somebody who taught himself CSS first and HTML second, at a later age, with a master plan, I advise you to learn javascript to the hilt, and have a complete tooling shop. You could also use to learn about other structured document types besides HTML. Keep an eye on the avante garde. Set some goals. Javascript enabled, choose your next adventure: the way of canvas, webGL, svg, and the great growing mass of libraries for browser graphics and interactivities; or the way of software architecture, and crack Node.js and familiarize your self with all its modules; learn networks and databasing. You can maybe do both, eventually. Either one will allow you significantly to experiment and invent, and/or become involved in IRL collaborations. You have nothing but lots of time to become a craftsman, to build a people network, interact with the growing base of young adults gearing up to inherit a galore of industry overdue for innovations. Maintain a simple life.  An occupational cycle of learning and practice is as good as it gets. Read everything. Become an apprentice and glean some hard-won knowledge ahead of time itself.
