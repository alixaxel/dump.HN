It's an idea that can be disproved, and may have been disproved: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/hologram-universe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/hologram-universe/</a><p>The essay you linked to is Deepak Chopra-style quanto-babble with little content that can actually be translated into something meaningful in the real world. Indeed, one must ask the question, if ""reductionist"" scientists are so fundamentally wrong about everything, then how come they can so successfully predict so much? Is there some physical experiment that can be run that this will produce better predictions for?<p>So, I'd say the relationship is that Hawking et al are doing science, and Talbot is using their work as the seed for his internal random number generator.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle</a>",1312163975

2830304,comment,2828822,2830171,5,0,carbonica,,,"> Can you comment on the differences/advantages of ripper, compared with RubyParser?<p>Absolutely! To provide context, what got me working on Ripper was my undergraduate thesis: Laser, a Ruby static analyzer, written in Ruby. It targets Ruby 1.9 only. To find out more, check the github: <a href=""https://github.com/michaeledgar/laser/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michaeledgar/laser/</a><p>My comparisons will be to the latest version of Ripper (the one in 1.9.3).<p>1. RubyParser only parses Ruby 1.8.x code - this was a dealbreaker for me, but won't be for some.<p>2. Ripper is C, primarily - it's actually just a separate set of action routines brutally hacked into the normal Ruby grammar file. This also means the code for it is pretty inscrutable. But, it's very fast and is integrated into the actual parser. It should grow with the language by design. However, bugs have shown this isn't as reliable as it could be.<p>3. Ripper does not provide comment nodes for any nodes - RubyParser provides them for def, singleton def, class, and module nodes. I had to reconstruct this manually using the lexer stream for my purposes, though I get the added benefit that I can attach comments to many nodes (but not all). See the code here: <a href=""https://github.com/michaeledgar/laser/blob/master/lib/laser/analysis/annotations/comment_attachment_annotation.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michaeledgar/laser/blob/master/lib/laser/...</a><p>4. Ripper is a true AST, in fact it is closer to a concrete syntax tree sometimes, which makes working with it a bit harder. RubyParser has more friendly output, but goes too far in the other direction - it infers semantic information for you, sometimes (imo) quite egregiously.<p>4a. Constant literals - from numbers to regexes - are returned as objects, with no AST information. The ruby parser does this internally to save some execution time, but I don't believe that's appropriate for a general-purpose parser.<p>4b. It adds :scope nodes inside class, module, and def nodes, to indicate closed scopes. They don't need to be there - they aren't part of the syntax, they're a property of how you interpret the syntax as a Ruby program.<p>4c. The worst offender is if you parse ""begin; rescue Foo => x; end"", it actually <i>inserts</i> an assignment ""x = $!"" into the rescue block. This is well beyond an AST.<p>5. Sometimes RP's output is a bit inconsistent in the number of child nodes for a given node. For example, the :rescue node in ""begin; foo; rescue; end"" has two child nodes. In ""begin; rescue; end"", it has 1 child node: just the :resbody node. A proper tree would have at least a nil node for the begin body, but RP elides it. This means if you see a :rescue node, you have to always check the first child node's type before you can do anything. That's why consistency is important.<p>6. RubyParser doesn't pick up errors as often, and as far as I can tell, doesn't report them at all. For example, parsing ""def foo(x, x); end"" in Ripper will give you a ""param_error"" node. I'm not too happy with the exact reporting style, and I've blogged about it (<a href=""http://carboni.ca/blog/p/ripper-plus-How-Ripper-Must-Change"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carboni.ca/blog/p/ripper-plus-How-Ripper-Must-Change</a>), but it at least notes the error so you don't have to, as a parser should in this case (as it's a parse-level error). RP doesn't note it. If you do an invalid global alias: ""class A; alias $foo $1; end"", RP just ignores the node, whereas Ripper will report it with an :alias_error node.<p>All told, RubyParser is a nice library and it's important to have an all-Ruby option out there. But for me, Ripper is far more appropriate from a theoretical and practical standpoint for a large-scale project.<p>Edit: grr, my formatting wasn't saved twice now.",1312162914

No, of course not, because money doesn't make you a better developer, just as paying existing public school teachers more doesn't make them any less severely incompetent.<p>However, if you want to attract more productive people in the first place, you have to pay them more money because there is a competitive environment.

It seems like in your experience they also went by the title ""Programmer"", which I agree is a gross misnomer. Besides that, I think the most important thing to realize is that at banks, <i>non-technical people run the show</i>. The technical people are at the disposal of their non-technical overlords, and thus they spend their every waking hour implementing terrible specs like ""do {some incredibly specific task}, and make it fast."" Even worse, they are far down on the ladder of responsibility; a ""banking programmer"" has no feel for the big picture.

But whatever, their MBA overlords don't care about the means, just the ends.<p>To make another broad generalization, ""Traders"" at an HFT firm are predominantly go-getter CS majors from top schools. Thus, if they have an idea, they implement it themselves. Any delegation of duty is done with strict specs, and bugs or terrible design in the finished product <i>will</i> get noticed. Incentives abound for writing good code: scalability/genericness is rewarded (have something that averages $1k trading symbol XYZ every day? You're a millionaire if it generalizes to many symbols), speed is rewarded (just the nature of the game), and bugs should lose you money (otherwise they are just unknowingly optimized around).<p>tldr: banking is like you describe, but there is plenty of quality in the HFT world.",1312160868
