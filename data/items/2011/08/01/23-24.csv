I've lived in Massachusetts (and New Jersey, California, and a bunch of other places that like to call themselves the ""worst drivers""), but everywhere I go, it seems apparent to me that road conditions and layout account for the huge majority of deviations from place to place.<p>For example, in New Jersey there are a ton of highways that don't have onramps (or about 15 feet of it). Because of this, there are a lot more (I mean a LOT more) collisions on the ""onramp"" and people generally are used to swerving in front of 65-mph traffic from a complete stop.<p>In California you have just as many people (or maybe more) who swerve in and out of lanes at unreasonable speeds, but since there are so many lanes and since they're all so fantastically wide, that sort of behavior doesn't get punished as it might, say, on the Mass Pike or the Garden State Parkway. At the same time, city roads in California (at least in OC) tend to have much higher speed limits. This causes a marked increase in fatal collisions at these types of intersections...not because the people are inherently more aggressive, but because the roads shape their behavior.",1312241639

2834967,comment,2832603,2834120,4,0,derefr,,,"To put it another way: scientific positivism allows one person, working alone in a laboratory, to discover something fundamentally new, by simply ratcheting along in tiny increments from what has already been discovered. This can be goodsomething new inevitably gets discovered over timebut it also has a fundamental weakness, in that most scientists toil in obscurity with the public never understanding the relevance of their work, and thus never applying it outside their original domain.<p>I'm not sure the output of scientific positivism <i>can</i> be well-indexed, to the point where anyone can find all the relevant pre-existing work they could build upon in their own: as there is no one big point where something new is discovered, but rather a lot of little facts and confirmed/refuted hypotheses that snowball until a meta-analysis of several studies can actually say something for certain, there's no one thing for a scientific expert system/communications tool to return to you. I expect, to have such a thing at scale, we'd need an actual human-level AI that ""read"" and understood the significance of every study in every field, and could see all the cross-correlations.<p>Before the advent of scientific positivism, though, we had a sort of ritualized science, where we would get large groups of people all studying one thing or another, out looking for proof or disproof of whatever particular thing they currently believed, leaping around wildly in hypothesis-space rather than just edging forward and taking whatever facts came along. There would be scientific belief ""movements,"" in the same way that there are artistic ""movements."" Because it was ritualized, science was able to be made an entertaining talk of at the time, similar to celebrity gossipeveryone would have their own opinion on whether the currently-researched belief held true or not, and would debate it constantly, increasing public awareness of the subject; a ""named hero"" scientist would later come with a sweeping experiment and prove one or the other group right, and would be heralded by that group and have some unit of measure, chemical element, or heavenly body named after them.<p>Ritualized science didn't necessarily advance human knowledge ""as a whole"" very quicklythe iterative assembly-line process we have now seems to work quite well for thatbut it did seem to get each new scientific fact thoroughly embedded in the public consciousness, because of what is basically good <i>social game design</i>. Perhaps we need some more of that, some hybrid model where scientists <i>can</i> still be ""heroes"" with ""rivals"" in the public eye, entertaining and informing in conjunction and raised up with social status, rather than simply workers for government grants raised up only with citations in journals?<p>As a screwy tangent: perhaps this could even be a facade on top of current science, a sort of staggered release of scientific knowledge in high-assurance bursts, with the rest of the ""development"" going on in some scientific ""closed alpha"" where the public wouldn't be constantly bombarded with overzealous summations every time the ratchet was turned (basically a justification for Yudkowsky's ""Bayesian Conspiracy."") When a scientific hypothesis was made theory, it would be handed off on stone tablets to a researcher well-trained in rhetoric with a nice-sounding last name, and they would become, to the public, ""the one who discovered the theory of X."" Only the conspiracy would know that it was the work of thousands.",1312240835

But I do not have statistics.<p>2) Try it out with some market research!<p>3) Any sort of matching is going to fail if the data is not reliable. If I truthfully put 1.8m. Someone puts 1.9m when they're 1.7m. How do you determine that my input is true? Especially that since due to OkCupid, everyone is now automatically assuming the person is actually ~0.2m shorter. So if you put me and the other person together. The 1.9m person wins?<p>4) I can't tell if you have a plan for this. But a website that depends on a feedback loop seriously needs to overcome it somehow. Even PlentyOfFish for all the errors when I registered, I still tried to use it.",1312239992

Who is underwriting this insurance andmost importantlyis it still valid for hosts who are technically breaking the law of their city/county/state?<p>2. Are we sure this policy wont make these situations <i>more common</i> or targets for fraud? I'm thinking of bank heist movies where they always say ""don't worry, your money is insured by the federal government"" ...<p>3. What about guests? If I were to guess, I'd say the next big AirBnB scandal will be ""guest attacked by host's dog"" or ""guest slips in host's shower, breaking rib"". Who's going to cover that?",1312239730

Your text boxes look like buttons, probably due to the dropping of a hard border, the centred label, and the use of the unconventional yellow colour. This is a situation that's only made worse by the fact that the actual ""Sleep On It"" button looks identical to the text boxes, except for its background colour. Why would you make two widgets with entirely different uses look the same?<p>The entire site feels cramped. The layout of the actual entry form is frankly bizarre. Why would you wedge a check box in between two text boxes?<p>There's more, but I'm too lazy to keep going... take this back to the lab.",1312239688
