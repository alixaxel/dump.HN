The approach that we use is that when things are published they automatically have a 'dev' release record for that version for the user that published it (so they can test) and individual versions have to be promoted ultimately to 'prod' for 'everyone'. The version you see is basically the most recent version released to your context (basically you and/or what machine you are on).

I read about the Nazi era in germany, and why homosexuals were much less likely to survive than jews.<p>The answer was, ironically, due to how liberal Germany was about homosexuality in the 1920s.  Many gay people came out of the closet, there were magazines and national organizations to support various groups of gay and lesbian people and their interests.<p>When the nazis came to power, they went to the offices of these magazines and groups and got the lists of all the members, and then they went and systematically executed every one of them.<p>Now, we don't live in a nazi regime, of course.  But there are many, much less severe, things that can be done to people, from employment discrimination to harassment.<p>The old saying, ""On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog"" describes a feature, not a bug.  It lets dogs participate with people, without fear of being harassed by cats, or whatever.

That's HN's decision and I respect it.  In this case I don't particularly care to know your real name.

I feel that if ""darklajid"" commented on one of my posts there it might negatively influenced a real life friends' decision to also participate.  People who do not interact with strangers on the internet find it easier to do so when the person they are interacting with is using their real name.
