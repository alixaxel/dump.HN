I reserve Forbidden for cases where the client needs to authenticate.<p>EDIT: Actually, I see that the spec says that authentication should do nothing to fix a Forbidden error, so you might be right. Unauthorized is for authentication.<p>Perhaps this is what buro9 means about overloading error codes, but the rest map so cleanly on the errors that it's hard to ignore them. You can't very well return 200 and say ""There was error X"" in the response.<p>Maybe we should use 418?",1312642786

The rest just flows.<p>The current iteration of the tooling with EF4.1 and nuget is a good improvement.<p>Some of your questions:<p>> Is it the cost?<p>Windows servers, Visual studio licences and some SQL server licences can add up. Some small startups couldn't afford it, but MS will ""make the first one free"" with bizspark. Big companies won't sweat it.<p>> Performance issues?<p>Nope, asp mvc is quite performant. That's one thing that's easier in a compiled, strongly typed language.<p>> Frustrating development environment?<p>Nope. VS2010 with resharper, nuget and nunit is sweet. As long as you have enough memory.<p>> Lack of a Hacker community?<p>Not completely lacking, but may be smaller than with other environments. But there should be user groups, conferences, etc. It may depend on where you are.<p>There are lots of resources for you to read, official docs on msdn, stackoverflow, blogs, and .net geeks on twitter, etc.",1312642678

 So, yes, you should be worried. Especially if the market keeps going down.
But there is a ray of hope. The new rules tweaks from the USCIS give people like you a lot of breathing room. You can sponsor your own H1B visa if you build your own startup and have a board that has the ability to hire/fire/manage you. The American Immigration Lawyers' Association (AILA) is still working on understanding the tweaks, and there won't be much clarity until a few visa applications are approved or rejected based on the new rules. So, it will take at least 2 months to get clarity. Start looking for jobs through your professional network (build one if you don't have one), and start looking for a good immigration lawyer.
