2426469,comment,2413058,2414035,1,0,jiry,,,"> Haskell and Scala are closest in that they're strongly, statically typed with Hindley-Milner type inference
> Haskell has the most sophisticated type system--by far, I think it's fair to say<p>HM is a type system first, and that means is a logic system.  HM is a logic that is deliberately kept relatively weak in order to allow full inference.  Scala is not HM and never has been - it's much, much more sophisticated and so Scala uses a form of type inference not based on HM.  Haskell '98 is HM plus a tiny bit (and yes that tiny bit does mean that the occasional type annotation is required).  GHC Haskell is HM plus a ton more and so there are a lot more GHC Haskell programs that need some type annotation.  The people behind GHC Haskell have done a good job of carefully adding type system features that don't totally break the model, though, so you rarely have to annotate much unless you love playing in advanced type land.<p>I would hesitate before saying GHC Haskell is more sophisticated ""by far"".  It's not at all obvious that that is so.  I'd want a type theorist to spend some time with the two core logics to determine which one subsumes what parts of the other before making that call.",1302321583
2426468,comment,2425823,2426399,1,0,dougabug,,,"The cost of maintaining your own tools is quite high, as is the expertise required to maintain them in working order. It seems to be that the inexperience or lack of skill which leads to shared equipment getting ruined is due to the fact that extremely sensitive equipment is being handled by students and junior scientists with little engineering background. The same argument could be made for the value of having your own servers. The scientific equivalent of a datacenter, would necessarily entail staffing of highly qualified, experience personnel. Such expertise would undoubtedly be costly, but it would be amortized over a large amount of equipment.",1302321494

2426462,comment,2425762,2426176,16,0,ams6110,,,"33HP in an electric vehicle is actually not as bad as it sounds.  Most of the horsepower needed in a vehicle is to overcome inertia (e.g. starting from a standing stop) and electric motors can output full power at 0 RPM unlike an internal combustion engine.  So a car driven by an electric motor would not need a clutch or transmission, which eliminates a significant inefficiency in the drivetrain.<p>Internal combustion engines and electric motors are also not rated in the same way.  Electric motor HP is ""rated"" horsepower (what it can produce continuously without overheating; generally it's capable of more for short periods) while internal combustion horsepower tends to be ""maximum"" horsepower and there are a lot of different ways to come up with a number, some purely based on calculations and some on actual measurement.  So unfortunately HP is not an apples-to-apples number between electric and combustion engines.",1302321175

Obviously one site only gets so far for SEO links, but if a site is popular enough then it is very worthwhile to have links from it. My company runs a number of websites, PageRank 4-6, and we have had multiple requests from SEO companies to buy links on our sites (which we obviously turned down).<p>If they all created one site and posted links from it, they would gain very little as Google would a.) detect that it is a site full of SEO spam and b.) realise that no-one actually reads the site, so the value of its links would be very low anyway.<p>However, if your site becomes popular, which Google will judge based on a number of things, such as other sites linking to you, then your Google PageRank will go up. With a high PageRank, suddenly you linking out to other sites will become useful for SEO purposes.<p>There are already plenty of SEO copywriters whose job it is to find popular websites and offer those websites pieces of content in return for a specific text link. They could see your site and start using it regularly, essentially turning it into an SEO content farm, generating SEO value not for you, but for all the websites these SEO people are working for.<p><i>""This issue however has been tackled by hundreds of other sites who also have similar issues, like bots creating accounts and posting comments with links.""</i><p>Yeah, that problem is, for the most part, a non-issue, it's not hard to eradicate that, 99% automatically and 1% with human moderation. But actual SEO copywriting is very real, I have a few friends who are paid to write web content purely for SEO purposes. They could go and get a job creating content for one site, their writing isn't terrible, but instead they look for a site, they write content for it in return for a link - one person might write an article on gaming, an article on software development, an article on politics and an article on medicine all on the same day.<p>And that's the kind of problem I can see, it would happen like this:<p>1) Site becomes popular<p>2) SEO people see that it is popular, and that therefore Google will care about links from your site to other sites<p>3) SEO people start writing content for your site, which includes their links<p>4) The majority of your content is no longer <i>really</i> user generated. It still is, technically, but all the users generating it are SEO copywriters.<p>Now, if that happens, there are two possible end results, and I'm not sure which is more likely. The first is a possible good result - the SEO writers get the links they want, they give you good content, your readers enjoy consuming that content, and everyone is happy. But the other possibility is either than Google/etc. start to see your site as a content farm and punish you in their rankings (which could lead to the SEO copywriters disappearing and your content drying up, as you also lose traffic from readers) or search enginges don't care, but readers stop visiting your site because the SEO content isn't good enough - that would lead to less visits, less links to your site, and the same negative result.<p>So, conclusion, not saying you definitely have a problem, and if it did happen, it might not end badly for you. But certainly something to think about. While I wish you all the luck in the world, I'm also slightly hoping this happens because I'm now very interested in what the end result actually would be.",1302319244

Searching the databases owned by ISI/Thompson-Reuters and friends, again for a fee.<p>Sure, a ""Github of science"" wouldn't turn anyone's basement into a cancer research lab, but it would mean that a lot of researchers at less-affluent universities would finally have full access to the literature of science.",1302318866

Indeed, most of these things are probably shared in one way or another.<p>And you're correct: The trick to encouraging open source science is not to focus on the social networking tech -- that will be ready when you need it -- but to first attack the problem of doing quality lab work on the cheap. That's where the bottleneck is.<p>The biggest problem with shared facilities is the tragedy of the commons. In engineering -- or machining or woodworking or cooking, for that matter -- you quickly learn the importance of having your own tools. It only takes seconds to ruin a good tool. It only takes seconds to contaminate your cell culture, or your neighbor's cell culture, or an entire room full of your department's laboratory mice.<p>And mailing your samples off to a distant ""virtual"" lab is fine if you're studying disposable samples, or inorganic samples, or samples that have been permanently fixed and preserved on a glass slide. But living cells ship poorly even when you're allowed to ship them at all, and animals ship even <i>more</i> poorly than that. So often you've got to live <i>next door</i> to the equipment you're trying to share, and that's still expensive.",1302318798

Physics largely seems to have this figured out via arXiv.org, but funding for molecular / biology / medical research is heavily dependent upon publication record.

2426378,comment,2424849,2424849,32,0,srean,,,"This brings fun memories. Are Google t-shirts still a sought after commodity at Googleplex ?<p>The way the distribution worked was that a small cabinet used to be replenished by some 50 odd t-shirts at some random time in the week. Those who wanted a t-shirt (definitely all interns, but not sure if it was limited to them alone. More on this shortly) ran a manual poll or a select loop on that cabinet. If the word spread that the cabinet has been replenished there would a mad rush. It was not that the t-shirts were like no other, but the artificial scarcity made it fun to get one. We interns definitely fought for it like a trophy. The more prized ones were the Ts for women. Good gift for your girlfriend. My personal favorite was the Wienberger T. It was not Googly enough to attract unwarranted attention.<p>The vibe the t-sirts created was quite opposite of ""here we all wear Google Ts"". It was more like, ""I got one and you didn't"", a fun competition to humor each other with.<p>Soon some Googler figured out that one could set up a webcam to monitor that cabinet. The ip address of that cam was publicly distributed. I suspect a fair number of people really wanted these t-shirts because the cam would always clog up on the traffic, to the point of being almost useless. That's a shame because someone wrote an application to compare consecutive frames from that cam so that it will send out a message once it detected a change. Its a bit tricky, you do not want it to trigger whenever someone walked passed that cabinet. Particularly so because it was right on the way to the cafeteria. So one had to average out the frames so that any change that persisted roughly for the amount of time that is required to stuff the cabinet triggered the system but not others. A low-pass filter for t-shirt stuffing.<p>Not sure if anyone wrote a predictive model to figure out when that t-shirt cabinet will be stuffed. But I would not be surprised if anyone did. The culture inside seemed just right for these kind of things.",1302318017
