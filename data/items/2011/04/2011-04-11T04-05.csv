2431451,comment,2431006,2431338,11,0,patio11,,,"All sites rank ""artificially"", since search engines are incapable of measuring quality or relevance to a searcher's intent and instead rely on proxy signals like links and similarity to keywords on a page or in a link graph.  Good SEO concentrates both on making sure that your content creation does not interact poorly with the 100%-guaranteed-to-be-artificial way that search engines perceive your website, and on strategic issues in shaping how you create and communicate value in such a way that it will actually be found by people.  For example, if you routinely create long essays with metaphorical titles, you need to be told by your SEO guy that search engines don't do metaphors well and searchers don't typically look for them, so they need to be retitled to be more fact- or benefit-oriented.  (This is a lesson that the traditional media learned, and it required absolute bloodletting in the newsrooms to get it across: ""Studio Flutters As Swan Soars"" used to be newspaper best practice, for web writing it is now ""Strong Black Swan Opening Weekend Did Not Help Studio Stock Price."")<p>More broadly, this attitude is like the reflexive engineer distrust of marketing, believing that product quality excuses all sins.  It doesn't.  If your product sounds scary to a user, and she avoids trying it because of that, you fail to create value for her.  You need to communicate that your product is not scary.  If that requires a photo of a woman with a headset then it is your <i>duty to your customer</i> to put that same woman with a headset stock photo that everyone uses so that she feels comfortable enough to experience the life-changing benefits your product has to offer.",1302497637

Yes yes OSS bla bla bla. However, why are companies not pursuing cent? its free. Hell its orders of magnitude cheaper than RH.<p>The answer is ""freeware"". Cent is freeware. When you need THEIR support, its freeware. When you want a feature, its freeware. When you want someone to spend an hour looking through forums and give you an answer to your problem, its freeware. So many large companies see the value of getting Red Hat.<p>In the end freeware works just as well as OSS, adware, etc. Its just a different business model. In many cases it makes sense, in many its useless.<p>Heres an interesting one though. It strikes me by surprise. League of Legends uses a freemium business model. You play the game, earn IP to buy characters/runes. You can pay money to buy the characters faster. You can pay money to buy skins, which offer NO ADVANTAGE. So basically there is zero crippled functionality when not paying them, However they will plow through your money much faster than WoW ever would if you want to keep up with their very fast release of characters (1-2 per month) especially if you are a casual gamer.

2431408,comment,2429962,2431245,1,0,seldo,,,"I understand expanding into adjacencies as a sensible mode of growth for a company with mature products -- so Google obviously expands into different types of advertising, and AOL into different types of content, and Apple into new form factors of portable electronic devices.<p>But I think the critical difference is that those are <i>new</i> products by old companies, and specifically products where they can use existing expertise or technology and apply it successfully. So Microsoft's expansion into search makes no sense because they hate the web and have always sucked at it. Facebook's expansion into real-time made no sense because the whole value of their stream was its curated nature.<p>Of all of the examples of bad expansions I mentioned, the suggestion that the contributors of WordPress create a ""WordPress lite"" that is simple and Tumblr-like actually sounds on the face of it like the best of the bunch. But in my opinion, Tumblr's primary advantage is not its interface (though that's a big secondary feature) but its community. Tumblr provides a built-in mechanism for content discovery and distribution, and is insanely viral -- the only way to comment on a post most of the time is to reblog it to your own tumblr.<p>For WordPress to create a Tumblr-like ""WordPress Lite"" would involve far more than merely stripping down the interface. They would have to completely rework WordPress.com to provide a centralized identity and content-distribution mechanism. Not only would that take them far away from their core competency of building single-instance software, but as Tumblr is demonstrating, building such a platform is technically very challenging.<p>My point is not so much that WordPress should not attempt such a project. They're smart -- maybe they could pull it off. But such an expansion is by no means a simplification of their current software; it is in fact a significantly harder problem.",1302496767

The main difference is that Vimeo uses a higher data rate than YouTube: ~2.6Mbs vs ~2.1Mbs -- about a 20% difference.<p>Then there's the source. First, Most Vimeo content is produced by creative professionals so the content itself is meant to look amazing. In contrast, YouTube does bulk video, most of which is homemade. Vimeo looks better on content alone.<p>Second, the Vimeo video is directly encoded from the creator. YouTube's creative content tends to be commercial work posted via distributors and agencies. It's likely that the content shown on YouTube has been encoded twice - first by the creator for the distributor, then again by YouTube's uploader.<p>There's other things. It's probable that Vimeo is using 2-pass encoding, allowing for more accurate VBR. It takes longer, but looks much nicer. YouTube users want speed, so one-pass may be standard.",1302496730

Great teachers, materials, and facilities could not be found except at the expensive schools.

Instead of expensive textbooks, Wikipedia provides better information for free. Instead of recitation hours in a classroom, students are tutoring each other online or testing themselves with flashcards.<p>Traditional educational institutions are being left with a shrinking value proposition.
