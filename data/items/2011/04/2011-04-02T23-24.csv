I flippantly make remarks that ""I have found the cure for CF and it is a video game!"" and stuff like that.  I continue to wrestle with how to simply and accurately convey what I've accomplished (in terms of getting myself well when doctors claim it can't be done), why I believe it generalizes and is replicable, and why I think an improved information delivery system is The Answer rather than some ""charity"".  I think at some point charity to help pay for costs involved in getting well will have it's place but first some serious in-roads need to be made into ""mind share"" -- into convincing people that a completely different way of viewing the problem is essential, more essential than money, drugs, etc.<p>I've spent several years talking to people on online forums and working on getting my head wrapped around the issue.  I think it's important to find the ""skeleton""/framework of it to hook people but it's important to not over simplify.  I'm not really planning on seeking investors, at least that is not part of my mental model at this stage.  But I think you need to find a) a means give sufficient background info before the actual pitch and b) a really good analogy/metaphor to help bridge the communication gap.

However, the problem of looking at data and saying that copying happened is one of inference; if I posted exactly the same comment you just wrote, I could have independently come up with your copyrighted comment, and hence own the copyright, but the much more likely explanation is that I copied your comment, and so judges and juries infer copying from similarity that they believe is statistically unlikely.<p>So if person A generates a random string from the uniform distribution, and communicates it securely to a trusted person, B, who XORs the string with your comment, and A shares the random string with the public, while B shares the XORed string, technically only B commits direct copyright infringement, because B created a derivative work by XORing, and broadcast that work (copying). If done properly, no one could prove which person was A and which was B however. In practice, however, it is likely that if both people acted with intent to distribute the work, they would both be at least secondarily liable.",1301787634

I'm dubious.<p>* First, there's not much evidence that the person we're talking about really owes a dime to Delaware. He set up a C-Corp (!), which apparently owes some corporate tax, but that doesn't make him personally liable. So, despite choosing the most complicated conceivable way to incorporate in the US, he can probably still just walk away.<p>* Second, does the UK have an LLC or S-Corporation equivalent? That is to say: is there a structure you can use to get pass-through taxation (business proceeds taxed once, as income) instead of corporate taxation, <i>and</i> have a shareholder structure that allows you to grant equity to employees? Because that is exactly the structure most pre-VC and bootstrapped startups want.<p>* Third, the US doesn't have the UK's system of rules requiring qualified directors; for instance, a bankruptcy in the US can't prevent you from being a principal in a company.<p>* Fourth, isn't it more expensive to incorporate in the UK than it is in the US? It costs under $100 to get a liability shield to do business under in the US. What's the equivalent UK cost?<p>* Fifth, and finally, aren't the laws in the US simply more business-friendly than in the UK? UK employees need to be given reasonable notice or compensation prior to termination; the UK is also not an ""at-will"" employment regime, making it harder to fire and thus harder to hire employees.<p>The UK is, from what I've read, the best of the business regulatory regimes in Europe, and the rules don't look <i>onerous</i>; they only look marginally more annoying than those of Delaware. However, I think that by looking at the weird choice made by one blogger (a full-on C-Corp), you might have gotten a distorted idea of what the regs in the US actually are.",1301787052

Autoweek also stated that their car died down well before the 220 mile range and went into a reduced power mode.<p>Moreover, Top Gear isn't the first to point out mechanical or electrical problems on a Tesla (couple examples below).  The car itself was delayed because of such problems.  And I along with most people also be worried if some fuse controlling my brakes was busted.<p>And in the episode, they don't hail fuel-cells because they go further without a charge, they hail them because they fit with the model of car ownership that we're used to, allowing you to drive however long you want and just fill up intermediately.<p>Perhaps I had a poor choice of words, but I certainly understand <i>what</i> Tesla is claiming.

And yes, its an up hill battle, which I'm sure the internal combustion engine faced, while trying to oust horses for a viable mode of transportation.

Which seems to be what Tesla wants to answer, electric cars can go fast to.\nBut this lawsuit seems like its disingenuous, more like they are playing off a couple social issues for their benefit. 1 ""Environment"" is an emotional trigger second only to stuff like racism and sexism level stuff, its got some emotional appeal just by saying the word, either for or against. So claiming foul on someone who is notoriously pro fast powerful cars, who inherently isn't going to like commuter based cars, really nails that emotion. 2 Taking it to the media, to hit a full scale marketing campaign about it, years after it happened, to help fuel that emotion and go after the media justice that seems to easy to do, like O.J. we all ""know"" he did it, but was proven innocent pretty much. Enough press coverage to one side, and we all start forming our own judgments. I think these are dirty tricks, that only add fuel to the opposition's fire. Like the scientists who were busted with bad data on global warming. Regardless if the position is true, getting caught doing dirty tricks, is going to make you look bad regardless, doing more harm than good.
