It's easy to imagine that it should have been able to get this growth, watching Facebook, and I think this is tantalizing, both to investors and people inside Google.<p>If it can't, it will go the way of Microsoft. What is that way? That way is the way of IBM. What is that way? Billions of dollars in earnings, dominant market positions carved out, buy over build technology decisions.<p>So, yes, it's nice (for some) to imagine Google doing it 'again', but they don't have to do it again, I wouldn't say. Just like Microsoft getting crushed by Google really just ended in Microsoft's growth slowing, and their earnings increasing, Google getting crushed by FB, or some new wunderkind is unlikely to evaporate all those billions of dollars in cash, assets and projects.",1302940736

Chrome's single major differentiator is that it's fast. If you asked the average person what's different about Chrome they probably wouldn't care so much about the robustness of the html5 or css3 support they'd say that it's fast.<p>Microsoft can attack on that front very aggressively. So they're taking the one thing that most people know is different or special about Chrome, and saying, 'IE is faster. Faster canvas, faster svg.' Seems like a great strategy to me.",1302940559

Its actually a lot of work to wrap that... given the impedance mismatch.  Perhaps this is the same reason microkernel operating systems have won in theory but not in practice - interfacing to 'the real world'.<p>Comparing Arc and Scheme [both of which I really enjoy] to the Javascript / node.js 'environment' ... it seems Node.js is more amenable to real work.  Its a less expressive / powerful / elegant language - but via Node, Javascript melds beautifully with the async IO model of the OS and gives superb primitives for developing TCP/http services.<p>Maybe its not the breadth of the libraries available, but the smoothness of the bridge between the language and the real world.<p>Geeks who apply their smarts and learn something about social interaction do get laid [ to abuse my analogy ].",1302940207

I've had job after job in my time that required me to be at the office early, and I needed to wake up at the last possible second or else, I'd go back to sleep. Finally, I realized that just like there are some people who are left-handed, people's sleep schedules can and do vary. So what I would do were I in your situation is instead of seeking to ""cure"" the fact you aren't a morning person, accept it and look for people like us, and jobs that don't require you to be at work before noon.

benefits are amazing since sunshine helps with the creation of Vitamin
D, and everyone needs Vitamin D. Since PG is a certified dietician and
also a Medical Doctor (MD), he truly understand how to stay fit and
healthy by maintaining the amount of Vitamin D he gets every single day.

on this topic...<p>His secret, of course, is running Y Combinator. Being the face of Y
Combinator means he can sit in a windowless room all day and still get
