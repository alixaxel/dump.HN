It is an open-ended question and I want to know what do you think.<p>Intentionally or unintentionally, do you rate an arbitrary programmer by the language he/she uses ? For instance, do you give more credit to a kernel developer (let's say he/she uses assembly and low-level C) than to a web developer (HLL and frameworks) ?<p>Let's consider the following stack :<p>--   Generic Applications (Web and Non Web) -- Level 3<p>--   Libraries and Frameworks -- Level 2<p>--   Drivers / Compilers -- Level 1<p>--   Operating Systems -- Level 0<p>I believe it is correct to make the following assumptions :
1 - Consider an <i>average</i> generic application. Let's forget the difficulty of scaling Web applications like Google, Amazon, Twitter and Facebook.
2 - I know that you can have gurus in each layer of the stack. Let's consider again an average programmer in each layer.
3 - Ignore the time needed to study/use a framework (e.g. Spring, Ruby on Rails... Django). This is important because I am expecting comments like : ""but a compiler developer doesn't know framework XYZ"").<p>Do you think that a programmer from one layer can do the same work as the programmer in the layer above? I'm positive that the same does not happen in the opposite direction. If so, do you think he/she deserves more <i>respect</i> than programmers from the top layers?<p>I'd really like to know the opinion of different people. For instance, in a company, do you feel that distinction/separation ? What about compensations? Do you think that a kernel developer earns more than a Web developer?<p>Edit : Problem with line feeds.",1303984522

Where as usenet was only better for privacy reasons and speed. Now for me it is better in almost every aspect.<p>Really obscure things. Torrents with such things will have very few seeders/leechers and take a long time to download anyway and never max out bandwidth. With usenet older things were deleted and had to be uploaded again. (Anything older than a few weeks) These days the retention is getting close to three years.<p>Release times were in favor of torrents. Now the time difference is but a few minutes, some first via a torrent and other via usenet. The fastest of course would be via IRC/FTP.<p>I spend around $100 a year for usenet access and am unsure the costs of a seedbox. I never have to worry about upload ratio and am not sharing files with anyone else. The primary means of people getting caught for copyright infringement. I also download at the full speed of my connection at all times. Also that connection is encrypted so the ISP can't even see what I am getting. I often get about 500GB a month. I pay about a penny and a half per gigabyte.<p>One feature that wasn't available to me when I switched was what utorrent had which others may have had as well. RSS downloading of torrents. Was very handy with setting up tv shows and acted very much like a internet tivo. Now I use sabnzbd and sickbeard for such things.<p>The only thing I still like about torrents is the way it handles errors. It will check the data as it downloads and discard and redownload a section of data needed. With usenet, my client will download all of it and then verify the parts and if there are any errors, it'll auto download the needed par files to repair the damage and then extract the file. Such things aren't needed with a torrent.<p>One good thing about usenet is that if you have the proper client you can basically stream from it. As the .rar files are downloaded and extracted one by one in order. With torrents parts of the file are downloaded randomly and does not lead it self to be streamed.",1303984092

For Immediate Release
SAN JOS, CA, APRIL 28, 2011  Yes, there is a free lunch! Monitis, the award-winning provider of the worlds first all-in-one systems monitoring cloudware, said today it has launched Mon.itor.Us Mobile, a mobile Android application. The new application will offer users a full range of global and local web server monitoring functionality at no cost.
Mon.itor.Us Mobile is so convenient for system administrators and webmasters, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. Now they can instantly perform their systems monitoring tasks from anywhere. For example, they can check server performance, add new server uptime monitoring or analyze system resources utilization.
Avoyan added that the mobile app is available for download in Android Market. Mon.itor.Us Mobile will boost productivity and give system administrators and webmasters freedom and flexibility. 
Monitis offers both Android native and Web-based mobile apps. The Web-based version works for iPhones, iPads, Blackberrys and Windows mobile Smartphone.  A native version for other platforms also will be available soon. System administrators and webmasters can use them off-site to monitor:
	Website uptime and load time from US and European checkpoints
	Server resources such as CPU, Memory and Storage. 
	Network devices
	Website traffic 
Usage of Mon.itor.Us Mobile is free and unlimited  similar to its parent service Mon.itor.Us. IT pros can monitor an unlimited number of URLs and servers. They can also use the new tool to access free reports on the status of their monitoring efforts. Mon.itor.us Mobile also offers rich, real time charts and performance data views. In addition, Mon.itor.Us Mobile performs all monitoring tasks, such as adding and changing monitors, managing notifications, etc. 
Thats the difference between Mon.itor.Us Mobile and our competitors mobile client: We offer a free full-service monitoring mobile app, while other monitoring services focus only on reporting and notification via mobile apps, added Avoyan. 
Mon.itor.Us Mobile supports a variety of global monitoring protocols, including HTTP,  HTTP Secure, FTP, Ping, DNS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP and MySQL.   
About Mon.itor.Us
Mon.itor.us is the world's first free all-in-one Cloud-based server monitoring service, providing both external (measuring application uptime and end-user experience) and internal server resources monitoring (tracking used disk space, RAM, CPU, traffic).  Mon.itor.us is faster and cheaper than even open-source monitoring software, as there is no need to setup and maintain a monitoring server. Mon.itor.us is a part of the Monitis family of monitoring applications, providing professional, premium all-in-one monitoring services  integrating application performance with backend infrastructure with cloud monitoring.<p>About Monitis

""An accompanying perspective makes a separate suggestion: the fundamental unit of sleep may be a single cell. When an animal is sleep deprived, individual cells are more likely to take themselves offline. By chance, that will eventually start producing the clusters that produce local sleep events.
