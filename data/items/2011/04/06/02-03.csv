It is never good when I first feel like crying out in rage that there are none of the promised comments, then only realize where to find them after reading your explanation a few times to pinpoint the info (I'm a product of the internet, read very sparsely :P)<p>My suggestion is to make it more obvious where the comments are, or even to parse them out of the HN page and display them in your own way.",1302058751

If you're using PKs just note where your dumped tables leave off.  When ready to roll to prod just put up your maintenance page, export from production your dbs into csv files again, but now from the PKs upward (this saves considerable time, you could always do the whole db again but wouldn't recommend it), import (add) the missing data and voila - a migrated DB.

Conventional game consoles usually push the limits of graphics when they're first released. The iPad didn't push graphics when it was first released, so Apple had a lot of room for ""easy"" GPU improvement with the iPad 2.

It turns out there are over 14,000 city employees in the City + County of SF. For a population of under 800,000 . Wow. And in last years election, they were pushing hard for a ballot initiative that would have slapped an additional tax on hotel rooms.<p>There is just too much bureaucracy in this city. As revenues have gone up, the bureaucracy has ballooned. The City's annual budget is $6 Billion; and yet they can't find the $300K to support the SF Botanical Garden?
