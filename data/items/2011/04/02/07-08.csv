The professor thought it was shady tactics and and a violation of his privacy.<p>Frankly, I've worked in a state University (Florida) and these request are very common. The Professor can't complain here, state employees from the governor all the way down to the lowly secretary can receive such request.<p>I many cases these things are vital, for example the media makes heavy use of these and this is why I think they are important and should be kept. State employees need to be better informed about this because that should affect how they use government ressources. Your work email should be strictly for business.",1301728113

My brother has been using python since last four years, so i asked him how should i start.\nHis answer was simple ""Learn it by doing"". Stumbling with different ideas for a week i came up with a simple idea to write a script that collects publicly shared videos in facebook (I love viewing videos shared in facebook). I have been programming since last 8 years but this was first time i wrote a script in python.  I got very excited when 20 lines of python script collected thousands of videos shared in facebook. Next day i shared my script and results with my brother. He was really excited and i asked him to help me to extend the project to collect the interesting videos shared in social media. After the iterative process of learning and refinement of idea, we built <a href=""http://lolzwow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lolzwow.com</a>.<p>My idea of learning python by writing simple script that collects videos evolved into a complete site that collects and features Funny, Amazing, Inspiring and Interesting videos shared in web. On top of all i learned Python (one of the most beautiful language i have encountered so far)<p>By sharing my story, I want to say<p>1) Start with simple idea that can be converted into computer program<p>2) If you have someone who knows about python, ask for help<p>3) If you have any questions that confused you, join python IRC on freenode. From my experience, I can say people in python IRC channel are the most helpful people that i have encountered in any IRC channel. I really love  python folks out there in #python channel.<p>4) Learning by doing encourages you and highly reduces static friction that every people faces when learning new thing.<p>If you don't have prior knowledge of programming I suggest to go through Introduction to Computer Science and Programming video lectures made available by MIT OCW\n<a href=""http://bit.ly/bdRzad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/bdRzad</a>.<p>Good luck.",1301727732
