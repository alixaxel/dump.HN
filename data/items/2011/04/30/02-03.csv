2499761,comment,2499456,2499650,2,0,T-R,,,"That's the difference between distributive and integrative negotiations. The tactics listed in this post are mostly for distributive bargaining, which works more when you have some set pie that you're dividing up (it's a zero-sum game), as opposed to coming up with out-of-the-box solutions, and particularly if you don't expect to have to deal with the other person again. Part of the beginning of a negotiation is figuring out which path the negotiation is going to go down. Textbooks on negotiation cover both - distributive approaches just make for better ""quick advice"" and ""self help"" content, particularly since advice on integrative approaches is a bit less actionable.",1304132191

Consider a salary negotiation for a entry-level software engineering position. Both parties know generally what the range could be. In Arizona, it is roughly $40k to $100k. That's a fairly big range. The first offer always narrows this range. If the applicant said he was looking for at least $50k, then the employer would magically be right inline with that (assuming their willingness was at least that) when they may have well had an expected range of up to $80k.<p>If the first offer is wildly favorable for the receiving party, you generally hear ""that's about what I was thinking too.""

Very possibly, they may have even bigger ""social networking"" ambitions for the service after the purchase, which may further necessitate such stringent clauses.<p>Besides, if one cared much about that sort of thing, chances are that they wouldn't stop using Delicious <i>now</i>, because they would have already stopped using Delicious when Yahoo! bought them, for similar concerns over privacy and agreements.",1304129667
