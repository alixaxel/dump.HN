It's not a ""hacking"" law, but a ""fraud and related activity"" law.<p>It refers repeatedly to situations wherein a person ""accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access""; the law doesn't care if that access was gained through technically impressive means (sophisticated cracks based on zero-day exploits) or mundane means (an employee misusing access).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html</a> , ctrl-f hack.

In the long run you'll be better off if you use these a little bit (any more and your start pissing people off), but the focus needs to still be on simple things like leverage, BATNA etc.<p>A lot of these ploys are becoming far too well known as well. For instance, nibbling seems to be in every negotiation book ever and it's really obvious when someone pulls it.<p>As a side note I continue to not understand people who don't like making the first offer, the evidence against it is very flimsy and it lets you frame the conversation. It only fails miserably if you accidentally come in under what the other party was expecting. Research should allow you to avoid that and in all other cases you'll get a slightly better deal.<p>Possibly the most important part of looking at lists like this is working out how to counter them rather than how to utilize them yourself.",1304128707

It's not as arhictecture-dependent as assembly but the last time I looked you couldn't generate the same LLVM on x86 and x86-64, say.  Has that changed?<p>It looks like PNaCl aims to ""solve"" this problem by using 32-bit-targeted LLVM... including 32-bit pointer alignment.  It's not immediately obvious how portable this would be to some hardware, and more importantly I'm not aware of any plans to support anything other than x86 and ARM initially (well, and x86-64 using its ability to run 32-bit code as far as I can tell).

Rail guns are their new sought after variants.<p>The famous bunker-busting smart-bombs circa first gulf-war were fin stabilized old tank barrels packed with explosives. It is their weight, owing to the high density metals used in the barrels and their small cross section (and hence extremely high terminal velocity) that gave them their extreme penetrative punch. Enough to pierce through tens of layers of strengthened concrete, each several feet thick and explode with devastating effects underneath. It was very important that they did not topple in flight though. So stabilization was critical.<p>Even the modern anti-tank weapons are essentially glorified darts, but much, much heavier. They kill tanks by sheer kinetic energy alone. They have been found to be harder to defend against, compared to other variants like HEAT that penetrate tank armor by the use of a high speed, dense jet of liquid metal, or HESH which are sort of like cow-pies made of high explosives that set off spalling bending moments inside the tank 'hull'.",1304128281

2499602,comment,2497360,2497360,1,0,obvanon,,,"All of you people wondering why people often talk of ""seeing God"" and other mystical experiences while on LSD, here's the thing:<p>for the most part, those experiences are false<p>However, we tend to associate the parts of our life that are more contemplative with the religious or the supernatural. That is why the _descriptions_ are often religious in nature. That is, however, a limitation of our culture. Because we have traditionally delegated those states of mind to the idea of religions, of Church, of God and so on.<p>LSD will tear you apart and put you back together and you will be better for it. However, even if it was immensely important for me, do not take LSD, even if for this reason alone: it's illegal. I regret my LSD times for that reason alone. I think society is wrong in that regard, but I still like society and I am willing to put up with it being wrong once in a while.<p>If you want to experience the whole mind-bending experience, go study Philosophy. Read the complicated, boring, dreary stuff. Read Kant and formal logic and everything you can put your hands on. Whatever little thing LSD may have done to some people, Philosophy will do to you a thousand fold. It's the harder path, but it will give you skills that you can control at your will, and it will make you better in every area of your life, permanently.<p>Philosophy is the whole book to LSD's Cliff's Notes.",1304126236

Anything else will easily lead to issues that may not be debug-able if you aren't already familiar with your target.<p><i>Enhancing an existing language. e.x. Objective-J, Stratified JavaScript.</i><p>Both of these enhance an existing language by creating a interpreted scripting language that gets compiled down by the original language. I wouldn't classify these as a source-to-source compiler imho.<p><i>Performance. e.x. HipHop for PHP.</i><p>HipHop is indeed a good example and I stand corrected there. The slight difference is that this is specifically targetted at creating highly optimized C++ to be compiled for quicker execution. In a Ruby-to-PHP example it's certainly not going to add performance gain and is a silly idea - but as I said, I didn't think about a valid execution like HipHop in my initial blanket statement.<p><i>Quickly building new languages.
