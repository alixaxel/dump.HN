Fighters learn to fight by sparring with each other in very controlled settings.  The first time they have a situation where the other person is trying to hurt them in earnest is in the ring.  ""Ring rust"" (the equivalent to actual course play, playing in front of people, etc.) does play a role but it's a vastly smaller role than the actual techniques which can be learned in isolation.<p>There was a famous pro golfer who said he used to hit golf balls on the course until he got to the green and then take the ball and move on.  There was no reason for him to practice the greens because he could do that elsewhere.  Isolated training seemed to work for him.<p>tl;dr I think you're putting way too much value on playing in front of people and putting all the techniques together.

When studying, I would stop and close my eyes and see if I could ""repeat back to myself"" what the key points were of the last couple of paragraphs or so.  If I couldn't, I would re-read it.  Before exams, I would review my notes and such but I never ""crammed"" for a test.  I found that making sure I really got it as I went along meant that some review was helpful but cramming was not necessary (and I suspect cramming where you get hopped up on caffeine and hardly sleep and all that is probably counterproductive).<p>I also was good at taking tests.  If you aren't good at that, do some googling.  Taking tests is not just about measuring what you know.  It's also a skill you can develop, especially tests for something like University where you tend to run into some of the same formats and such over and over.<p>Best of luck.<p>PS if you need my advice credentialed:  I graduated high school STAR student, National Merit Scholarship Winner, state alternate for the Governor's Honors program and was inducted into Mu Alpha Theta in 11th grade (the earliest you can be inducted).  I got other academic awards in college, though I remember them less well and, well, dropped out and went and did other things for a long time because college wasn't my highest priority. (I dropped out in part to go figure out who I was other than an obnoxious brainiac -- being one of the top students at the high school I attended while the rest of my life crashed and burned was not a healthy experience for me.)<p>I'm kind of a snob who enjoys tearing apart poorly put-together arguments written by folks who have a PHD.*  Call it an obnoxious hobby.  I try to be less obnoxious than I used to be.  I don't dislike PHD's per se.  But those folks who are jerks about it and think they are so superior to everyone around them because they have a PHD and think they can then put out any old crappy unsupportable opinion because we are supposed to kowtow to the letters behind their name, yeah, those folks tend to end up not much liking me.  (Blame it on my father, a high school drop-out who taught at a college for a time while in the Army and who used to take glee in correcting the spelling, grammar and punctuation of notes sent home by college-educated public school teachers.  Right is right, regardless of your credentials or lack thereof.)<p>* Or other credentials.  It's just an example.",1302684624

How many people really know and use 100% of the C++ syntax these days? Many companies actively enforce a strict subset of the language, and who even cares about C++0x? In my humble opinion C# pretty much jumped the shark when they started adding things like partial classes.<p>There's lots of things wrong with Java, but I think a worthy successor should at least keep that 'less is more' mentality.<p>If you want a feature-rich Java though, you can always try the KSL: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/groups/compiler/ksl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/groups/compiler/ksl.html</a><p>edit: by the way, I'm not saying Java > Python, just that I prefer clean languages.

2441255,comment,2440931,2440931,3,0,Shengster,,,"To give some background, I'm a graduating senior at a top CS university in California. In the past year I've managed to maintain a 3.8 GPA while taking 5 courses per quarter, but I would highly advise you (since you seem to be an underclassman) to not take 6 to 7 classes a semester.<p>My reason for doing so was because of an outstanding job offer that I accepted the year before that begins in June. Otherwise, I'd likely be staying one more quarter to graduate and take a lighter course load.<p>Here are a few reasons why I don't think overloading yourself with classes is a good idea:<p>1. You wont learn as much.<p>What I've noticed from taking this many classes is that you have a lot less time to devote to studying than many of your friends. Because I had to prioritize my time, I would often skip supplementary reading that would really have helped me understand the material we covered in class. In addition, I rarely went to office hours (computational theory was an exception). I did well in my exams because I studied what I thought was going to be on there, but after the quarter ended I realized that all the supplemental reading I could have done would have given me a lot more insight in the topics we learned in class.<p>2. You wont have any time to have fun.<p>You'll have to turn down a lot of offers to do fun stuff with others. Hack-a-thons, parties, etc., are thrown out the window. You just wont have the time to sacrifice to do these kinds of things. I studied approximately 40 to 50 hours a week on top of the time we spent in lecture and discussion. I didn't have a job though (had to quit my on-campus research job to study).<p>3. You'll have less time to complete projects and study (especially finals).<p>It becomes exceedingly difficult to keep up with projects and study for midterms or finals (especially finals). Last quarter we had a 3 week long OS project dealing with user-level threads. Because of my time constraints and deadlines for other classes (designing a CPU for my computer architecture course), I wasn't able really work on the OS project until 3 days before it was due. I managed to complete it, but it really wasn't an enjoyable experience due to the pressure. This was a common story for me all quarter. YOU WILL ALWAYS FEEL BEHIND.<p>Don't take multiple project classes unless you're a better hacker than your peers and can finish assignments significantly faster than others. I'd go against astrofinch's advice and say that you should always start on programming assignments as soon as possible.<p>4. You'll burn yourself out.<p>By the end of the quarter, I really wanted to give up. My reward for designing a 5 stage pipeline processor along with a dozen programming labs between my other project classes was 5 finals within a week. I had to pull all nighters that entire week AFTER pulling all nighters the previous week to finish my quarter-end projects.<p>5. You'll hurt your GPA if you don't know what you're doing.<p>I was extremely lucky to do well in my classes. If I messed up on my finals my grades would have been extremely poor. Unless you really know what you're doing, and you're confident you can be successful under this kind of pressure, taking too many CS classes at once will make your GPA suffer.<p>6. Your physical condition will suffer due to lack of exercise, sleep, and stress.<p>I always felt better if I had time to exercise everyday, but oftentimes, I'd skip out on my weekly routine, and I'd feel like crap throughout the week. Unfortunately, I'd always be catching up on sleep so I never got a chance to hit the gym.<p>In conclusion, the wise thing to do is to take less classes and do well in them. Take the time to hang out with other students, go to office hours, and read stuff that interests you from class. Unless you have a really good reason for doing so, you shouldn't be subjecting yourself to 6 or 7 classes a semester. You really have to be motivated.",1302683090

Karma and such are technical solutions, which are tools and have their uses but the problem here is one of culture, it is a people problem.  And people problems aren't readily resolved with technical solutions.  One factor here is growth:  It has grown too fast to absorb new members at a rate which allows for inculcation with the culture, so the culture is being damaged.  Another is ""popularity"":  Comments are ""worse"" because you have a higher number/percentage of people who are not as educated/savvy/cultured/whatever.  Punishing people for simply not being as well-developed won't develop them -- or, more accurately, will develop them in exactly the wrong way and actively encourage that which is reviled here.<p>I'm getting tired of howling into the wind and beating a dead horse.  My thoughts on such things are essentially ignored here while everyone who is respected (mostly technical sorts, who all want a technical solution to a people problem) rehashes how to manipulate the people with some new technical solution.

It's not about the amount that you can live with, or what you think you need but about appreciation. I was such an idiot earlier: this whole angle was anything but clear to me.<p>Early in my career I never asked much and I was quite happy with what I got because I didn't spend that much. All my salaries were big enough compared to the previous salary that I didn't even think much about the fairness of it all. Given also that as a programmer I was still enjoying better than the average national salary and still better than my dad.<p>But eventually I realized that the only tangible way a company can truly appreciate a good employee is biting the bullet and by paying him a bigger compensation.<p>Even if he doesn't need it.<p>In the previous job I stayed for five years. Year by year I started to wonder when will they give me a raise: I still liked the job and I was considered a good programmer. I was already approaching the senior status earlier, but they reworked their career plan and bumped seniority forward into the future. Of course, seniority would have meant some standard increase in the salary. It took me those five years to determine my own value and at the end of it, I left at the brink of my five-year review that turned into an exit interview in promptu.<p>It wasn't about me physically <i>needing</i> more money: it was about me deserving being paid more money for my skills and experience, about my employer actually acknowledging their appreciation towards my contributions.<p>These days, I enjoy about the double of the average salary in my country. Quite a considerable increase! I still don't <i>need</i> all that money which has allowed me both to voluntarily work part-time and to also invest part of my earnings monthly. But now I feel like finally receiving each month the appreciation I never got in the previous job. Given my skills and experience, I'm being paid much closer to my market value now and that is what matters, eventhough I still live a small life and could easily live on my old salary.<p>Job markets are like any other markets: the correct price is not the cost of production plus some profit (or employee's cost of living + some more) but an arbitrary agreement between the smallest amount an employee will accept and the highest amount the employer will pay, an agreement that makes both equally happy.<p>The next time I'll negotiate a salary, I will have a request ready for an amount that is high enough that I won't be in a hurry to get a raise, but which is hopefully within reasonable limits depending on the job. In the case it's too high for the company, I'm willing to scale back the salary <i>along with</i> my monthly hours, linearly.<p>But my value per hour remains the same.
