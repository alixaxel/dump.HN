That way anyone could become the equivalent of a root CA, but your value would only be as good as your reputation / integrity.<p>Trusted entities, like the governments, could vouch for the keys of their agencies - or other governments.<p>Friends and Family could vouch for each others keys, businesses for their partners... etc etc.<p>Unlike PKI, PGP would enable counterparties to establish their identiy by having many validating partners (paid and unpaid), as opposed to the one single root CA that is available.<p>As well as bringing the source of trust closer to the relying party (really, I live in Australia, who the hell is Comodo anyway?), the network of trust that would result could be articulated in the browser in many different ways.<p>eg: 25 of your friends and 600 businesses agree that this is the identity of Visa.<p>Twenty years ago this wouldn't have worked. But today, we could use the root CA SSL system to bootstrap a network of trust that becomes independent of the old hierarchy.<p>I hope all that makes sense.<p>[1] eg: certificate revocation, or even the user removing the root CA from her own key store.",1303260316

The group of organizers were, how to say it, ""theorethical nerds"", some of them in their way to be professors (two of them are in fact professors today). Big egos too.<p>I was no more a student at the time so I didn't join the contest, but I commented about it to my girlfriend because I had read about Corewar before and found it interesting. My girl was a student and she liked so much what I told her, that she decided to compete herself.<p>I can say that when she is obsessed with something, as she got with the contest, she doesnt stops at anything. So in less than a couple of weeks she had serveral 'strains' of working bots each with different behaviours and abilities. Until the last minute she was testing which were her bests programs to compete.<p>So, the day arrived, and the more or less 10 MALE ppl at the competition saw my girl, coming with no one but 3 (or 4) programs. I wish I could have been at the event because my girl beat them all and with all of her bots. They even disqualified one of her bots because it almost always tied (was a replicator)<p>I don't think they learned not to underestimate a confident blonde girl, but the contest was conveniently forgotten and Corewar was never mentioned again at the place :D.",1303258963

Most people 'get' that light is an electromagnetic wave, and of course Maxwell tied the two together quite elegantly.<p>The clever bits will be these two:<p>1) Is there a material, either natural or 'meta' in which the structure can convert a fraction of the light passing through it into a magnetic field. If so, and the light is modulated, you can induce a current in a conductor. Could be useful, could be a parlor trick.<p>2) Can you run it backwards? Which is to say if you generate a magnetic field of the proper type and orientation in the presence of such a material, can you convert the magnetic field into light? If so what frequency? What coherence? Does this paper provide the foundation for a LAAMR (Light Amplification by Amplified Magnetic Resonance) (no, its not a pun on 'lamer' :-)<p>I expect if you can create the latter you could probably get a Nobel prize (or at least share it).<p>Am I the only one who enjoys finding out we're wrong about some long held scientific beliefs (in this case the magnetic influence of light)",1303258240

2464739,comment,2464213,2464541,8,0,mahmoudimus,,,"It is worth noting there's a difference in the base64.b64encode function, vs the default MIME Base64 codec on strings[2].<p>Per RFC2045[1]:<p><pre><code>    (Soft Line Breaks) The Quoted-Printable encoding
    REQUIRES that encoded lines be no more than 76
    characters long.  If longer lines are to be encoded
    with the Quoted-Printable encoding, ""soft"" line breaks
</code></pre>
Due to the insertion of these soft-line breaks, encoding is not the same, as you can verify yourself:<p><pre><code>    import os
    import base64
    import unittest


    class Base64Test(unittest.TestCase):

        def test_long_string_base64_decoding_and_encoding(self):
            byte_seq = os.urandom(500)
            mime64_encoded = byte_seq.encode('base64')
            self.assertNotEqual(base64.b64encode(byte_seq), mime64_encoded)
            self.assertEqual(base64.b64decode(mime64_encoded),
                             mime64_encoded.decode('base64'))


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()

Decoding, as you can see above, is fine. This makes a difference when encoding a really long string in an HTTP header.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt</a>
