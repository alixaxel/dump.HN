It's something like a rush to grow up.<p>But, personally, I think that it's not worth it in the long term.

It's learning.<p>Once you're on the outside, life is different. You worry about paying the bills and the choice of how you spend your time in the work environment is typically restricted based on what someone else says (unless you do your own startup).<p>I could dig deeper into it but I want to take these students, shake them by the shoulders, slap them across the face, and tell them to stay 4 years.
