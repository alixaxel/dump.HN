In order to have good ideas, you have to let your mind wander, and that means in addition to the good ones, there will also be plenty that are unrealistic or silly, but they all supply wood to the fire. It <i>is</i> possible to work hard, stay focused, and have ideas churning at the same time.",1303034165

I run around the same path every time (a 3km trail) and try to enhance my performance while evening my pace, so I'm pushing myself. Yet there's a long straightaway where I often start to feel it come in as some sort of positive dizziness creeps in my body and mind (I feel 'lined up' with myself like every part of me is focused together), and the next thing I know I'm 1km later, with a much faster pace than I could expect and a feeling of smoothness and easiness.<p>I can assure you that it is just as discernible in programming, but I suppose different people experience it with different intensity on the same activities.",1303033354

2455848,comment,2450260,2451582,1,0,lloeki,,,"Many. At work I'm one of the few that have to get in the zone to do any meaningful amount of work. They mostly seem not to require much effort to start working on anything. Also, multitasking does not seem to make such a hit on their productivity as it does for me. Maybe they have a sort of zone too, only much less pronounced and thus not noticeable to them.<p>When I'm not in the zone it seems like I'm grinding compared to them, like I'm walking in a swamp. Yet when I'm in, I work at what seems like stratospheric speeds.<p>Sometimes the zone happens when collaborating on solving a complex but rewarding problem, or an involved yet insightful discussion. When this happens, I feel 'offseted', like I'm on a different flow of time. My brain churns away, evaluating solutions, and I can almost hear the colleagues mind slowly ticking. I seem to have computed how every path of the conversation tree will unfold, which questions they will come up with and which conclusion they will reach. It's terrible because in that case I can subtly nudge their thought flow in one direction or another, making them reach a given conclusion faster. Everytime I feel like performing some dirty Jedi mind trick. Most of the time I refrain from doing so and adopt a maieutic approach to let them reach their solution by themselves, only cutting dead branches around.<p>The zone is a wonderful, timeless moment when experienced alone, but every time third parties are involved it's a frightening experience. It's also a bane of sorts, because I'm utterly improductive without it.",1303032421

2455846,comment,2454725,2454829,6,0,michael_dorfman,,,"Exactly.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Candyland is the <i>best game ever</i> for children of a certain age.  I went to great lengths to import a copy here to Norway, and my 4 and 5-year-olds absolutely love it.<p>The time will come, soon enough, when they want a game that requires them to make decisions, and plot strategy-- and when that day comes, there are plenty of such games to choose from. (My two older daughters both jumped straight to  chess when they got to that stage.)  But right now, game playing is about the social aspects.<p>In fact, prior to the arrival of Candyland, my five-year-old (then four) would make us play board games without any rules.  She'd roll the dice, and move the pieces around randomly, and have us do the same.  <i>That</i> was the part that was fun.<p>Lately, she's gotten into card games, and her favorite at the moment is a game of her own invention, called ""Stop and Go"".  You divide the cards equally among the players, and each player has a stack, face down.  When it is your turn, you turn over the top card.  If it is red, you stop.  If it is black, you turn over another card, and keep going until you hit a red card.  The first person to go through their whole stack wins.  No strategy, no decisions-- from a game theory standpoint, it's the same as a lottery drawing-- but that's the beauty of it.<p>EDIT: for clarity.",1303032380
