2429469,comment,2428746,2428951,5,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> 30 years experience doesn't mean much if it's the same year 30 times.<p>Your quote is apt, but it cuts both ways. Using the same old tool indefinitely, even when newer tools can do the job better and much faster, might be foolish. On the other hand, learning to do the same task over and over again using different tools, each only a modest improvement on the last, might also be foolish.<p>In the case of your C+CGI example, I would agree that it makes sense to prefer any of the more modern ""scripting"" languages, which typically have both good library support for networking protocols and much more powerful integrated string handling than C.<p>On the other hand, there is little offered by any mainstream language ecosystem today that can't be achieved at least reasonably proficiently using tools from the .Net world as well (ignoring the obvious limitation of having to run on a .Net platform).",1302443823

2429465,comment,2428746,2429311,3,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> If I were to launch a startup, should I go with the ""cool shiny powerful"" language, or should I stay with the boring verbose language that I know well?<p>I think the danger with this decision is that we tend to get a ""grass is always greener across the street"" mentality. I have yet to find a programming language that has no serious warts.<p>Certainly different languages have different warts, and thus suit different jobs better. However, just because we haven't used a language enough to appreciate its warts, that does not mean we will not discover them to our cost at exactly the wrong moment in our new project.<p>Moreover, with newer or more recently popularised languages, there is sometimes a tendency for the community to bury its head in the sand. Some defenders might claim that we ""just don't understand"" if we identify a serious shortcoming. Sometimes the individual or group that defines/specifies a language will have a blind spot and make seemingly arbitrary decisions that we don't agree with. In contrast, with longer-established languages, the shortcomings tend to be well-known and acknowledged, and the emphasis in the community is often on sharing the most effective workarounds or alternative techniques.<p>Obviously these generalisations aren't necessarily universal. We find helpful people in otherwise intransigent communities and awkward people in otherwise helpful communities. Still, I have seen the pattern repeat over the years for many different languages as they evolve from the Newer And Better Thing to a mainstream tool and ultimately to an older tool that is superceded by the next newer and better thing.<p>When I'm choosing the tools for a project, I usually favour the middle of that spectrum over either extreme. Out-of-date and underpowered is bad, but tried-and-tested is good. YMMV.",1302443420

You can't read it without the appropriate technology and a power source, it can't be easily lent to another person, can't be resold, and lacks all of the physical qualities that make a well-designed book readable, such as paper quality and typography.<p>The advantages of ebooks are that they are easier to carry, can be purchased instantly without a trip to the store, and are never out of stock.<p>It's the convenience of ordering that has made them popular, but customers aren't idiots. They know that printing, binding, shipping and storing books is expensive, and that those costs are reflected in the price. When you remove all of those elements, they expect the price to go down as well.<p>How is that so hard to understand?",1302443393

Scala / Clojure seemed more interesting, and I focused on them.<p>I've only tried a small ""create-your-blog-in-15-minutes"" Grails tutorial, and it was actually quite effective. I haven't revisited it since then. Thinking about it, my Groovy avoidance is absurd, and I WILL look at it again with an open mind. I remember ""dismissing"" Groovy a while ago, after reading a few articles raving about Scala being the next JVM language. I think it was quite dumb of me actually.<p>A colleague of mine used Grails to build a small issue tracker for a client, and he loved it. The only drawback, according to him, were some of the plugins: when the default plugin configuration wasn't what he needed, it was sometimes hard to change it. Since they were open source, he simply forked them / hacked at the code / submitted patches to improve them. These drawbacks are expected, though, since the language is still young, and plugins will mature.<p>Spring Roo also looks interesting, for those who want to keep using Java. It's inspired by Rails / Grails, and uses code generation to speed up development: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/interviews/roo-ben-alex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/roo-ben-alex</a>",1302442924

It's a given that the court will hear your case. Period. And it's only because you as the patent holder want to assert your rights, regardless of whether that particular case is good or bad for the economy at large, and for society.<p>By contrast, an antitrust complaint like the one TurboHercules brought against IBM (many months after the initial - even if then not yet totally specific - patent infringement threat) is lodged with a regulatory agency that doesn't have an obligation to follow up. They can always say there's no public interest in what you complain about. In that case, you could try to bring an antitrust lawsuit, and then you just satisfy some basic criteria and a court will hear the case. But if you ask an antitrust regulator to act, the regulatory agency will look at your complaint and its merits, and will compare it to other complaints and their merits, and will then decide to pursue only the most important issues, i.e., the ones that the economy at large, and society, have the greatest benefit from.<p>Depending on the jurisdiction, the antitrust regulator will either have to go to court at some point (unless a case is settled before) or, such as in the EU's case, the regulator may be in a position to impose remedies and fines, but all of that will be subject to review by a court of law if the affected company appeals.",1302441896

I was on wompt and conovore the other day when all of this was going down and people were sharing their startups and many seemed very far along.<p>They way I see it YC adds the following value:<p>1. Operational Help (incorporation, UX, UI etc)<p>2. Strategic Advise (PG/JL/HT and others)<p>3. Cohort Batch (fun,fun,fun, we we we so excited)<p>4. Alumni Network<p>5.

How about a ""why I'm not buying this"" box? As a onetime publisher myself, I would have loved to know WHY people didn't buy, not just the fact that they didn't.",1302440633
