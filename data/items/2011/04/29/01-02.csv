I'm not saying that there aren't other ways to get such mentorship, I'm saying that right now traditional publishing companies are the only ones providing it effectively at scale.  That's why I said, in my original post, that one of the requirements for disrupting the publishing industry is to come up with a new system for helping new writers grow.

I personally would even prefer typing ""15 min"" or ""1 hr"" to trying to scroll through all that.<p>It would also be great if this pulled automatically from Google Calendar (or any iCalendar) to fill events.

You can stick ""linux"" and just about any task in a search engine -- ""linux command line"" and the task if you want to find command line apps -- and find good tutorials.<p>Many will tell you that you don't need to learn the command line to use Linux any more, and they're right.  You do need to learn it to be really good at Linux, though.  It's not as scary as you may think!  Type ""man foo"" to find out what the command ""foo"" does and how to use it.  Pretty much everything has a man page. :)<p>The command line can be easier to learn that GUIs in a lot of ways, because telling people what commands to use is so much more straightforward than trying to explain what the icon they need looks like or where the right button is.  Also, there's a Stack Exchange site dedicated solely to questions about Linux and Unix at <a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unix.stackexchange.com/</a>  I like it better than the Ubuntu one - <a href=""http://askubuntu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://askubuntu.com/</a> - personally, because the unix/linux site has more of a ""here are the standard tools, and how and why they work"" tone, while the ubuntu site's tone is more like ""here is how to accomplish that task without having to learn more about the system than you absolutely have to"".  Both will get your task done, but the former will challenge you to learn more.<p>Edit: I almost forgot to add -- grab an IRC client (Xchat is good for beginners) and start chatting on the freenode.net IRC network.

You don't get a hangover from cannabis use.<p>Maybe my tone conveyed otherwise, but I was really just curious as to why it was easier for the (parent, parent, parent) comment to keep using caffeine in a different form if he didn't enjoy drinking coffee.<p>I guess I'm still surprised at the ease of which people can ween themselves off of what I would call large doses of it.

I fucking despise Facebook as much as anyone else, but I am finding it a little difficult mustering up sympathy for any business or blogger whose business is impacted disproportionately by losing their Facebook page.<p>It's like programmers who build their entire business around a company's API. When the company decides to drastically alter the terms of use of that API, it's catastrophic for the programmer's company. It's terrible for the hacker, yes, but ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" is a cliche for a reason.",1304039236

It wasn't that bad -- the object files just needed to have sections that had particular size restrictions, names, etc. Nothing too tricky.<p>I don't recall the hardware being too separately encumbered. Sony Research provided all of the early adopters with significant technical specifications about the hardware itself, though admittedly much of it was documented in Japanese and this is ~10 years before google translate.
