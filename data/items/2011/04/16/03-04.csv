Mod_python did not exist, asyncore was the only thing you had to do async callouts so that you did not block the thread, etc.  There is a reason perl was considered state of the art for serving web pages at this point in history.

It's taking a transport stream format based around a buffering model... but as far as I can tell, completely ignoring the actual buffering model itself.  Instead of working within the MPEG buffering model, it simply makes some arbitrary restrictions on the size of each chunk, which doesn't make any sense.<p>2.  Aggravated by 1), the latency of the system is horrible.  Good luck using ""HTTP live streaming"" for anything that needs less than 5 seconds of latency, let alone 0.05 seconds.<p>I can implement a videoconferencing system in RTMP.  I sure as heck can't do it with ""HTTP live streaming"".<p>Now, does it work well for some use-cases?  Sure, but it's definitely not a replacement for all aspects of RTMP.<p>(Also, obviously as you mentioned the link is biased, but it's actually not even relevant to your post: it's comparing Adobe's software to Microsoft's software, <i>not</i> comparing protocols.

The utility of the money he was receiving did not change; he was still able to perform the exact same happiness-increasing things with it, but now he's suddenly unhappy with it.  This is entirely irrational.<p>> Of course the time is intricately tied to the amount of money it is worth, otherwise why bother?<p>I said nothing about the time; it is happiness that should not be so intricately tied to money.  Selling my time may not be my greatest desire, but if I'm already happy with the price at which I'm selling and find out I could sell for more, my happiness can only decrease if my happiness is intricately tied to money.<p>> Then your market value might be higher than mine because I'm not willing to.

2453053,comment,2450856,2450856,7,0,nsfmc,,,"I understand the desire for structured packages, but even in languages like python that have 'the python way' or what have you, there are still plenty of packages that don't quite fit. This isn't a problem with python, it's a largely philosophical/religious issue that has much to do with the idiom or mindset of the package (or likely the maintainer) at hand. But still, i don't see this as a problem that <i>javascript</i> has to address rather than say, a problem that <i>libraries</i> have to address.<p>You see this all the time in even jquery packages: are they $.pkg.method(elts) or $(elts).pkgmethod() or is it $(elt).pkgmethod(spec) or .... and so forth. Part of it is a matter of taste even if sometimes it goes against 'the jquery way.' Again, this is so religious that it's often not even worth fussing over.<p>Blaming browser vendors or our ecma overlords for package standards seems like a bit of a straw dog because <i>javascript</i> isn't a package distribution mechanism, it's a programming language. If you want to build <i>apt/npm for browser js</i> via require.js+jquery or your combination <i>du choix</i>, then by all means, but this isn't a failing of the language just as brew failing to install mutt is <i>not</i> a failing of ruby.<p>Certainly, there's bound to be some overlap in packages, but this happens everywhere and who cares? underscore+jquery seems like a strange example especially when the two are <i>complementary.</i> If the goal is to have a ""lightweight core"" with ""components that deliver specific, isolated functionality"" i mean, aren't we there <i>right now?</i> And for where we're not, as mentioned by other commenters, coffeescript and friends certainly seem to be fighting the good fight.<p>I'm all for innovation, but i could do without ""enterprise javascript"" (isn't that was es4 was and, i mean, i'm not exactly losing sleep over <i>that</i> decision). For proof positive that we're already getting the 'roll your own' strategy, check out the modernizr 2 beta (or, the less modest jq-ui).<p>If the point of modern js is that people are working together and optimizing, then yay!! but if the point of modern js is that we need to abide by some static discipline where each function only accepts a single spec object and conforms to some require.js loading protocol then, umm.. thanks but no thanks.",1302923542

2453043,comment,2450973,2452738,6,0,shasta,,,"I think the reason that S-expressions haven't gone away is mostly because of the way they mesh with macros, but anyway the sub-optimality of S-expressions as a syntax wasn't a part of my argument there (I don't like them, but I don't hate them).  In that quote, I meant there that all code, even S-expressions, is a human readable expression that defines the thing you're interested in.<p>Note that it's considered poor form in Lisp to make a square macro that multiplies its parameter by itself.  That should be a function.  Why?  Because numbers have the structure you want them to have.  A function that takes a number and multiplies it by itself is just simpler than a function that takes an expression for a number, and pastes it together with an astericks and then returns that to be evaluated.  And because the function has a better structure than a macro, it's more composable.<p>The thing is that this same situation exists with most other uses of macros.  In a language with staged computation and maybe a little well tamed syntax extension, I think there would be no place for macros.  You can do better.",1302922816
