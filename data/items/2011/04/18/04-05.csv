In the ""revert a revert"" article above, the problem is that merging a topic branch doesn't cause the first few commits on it to be applied if those commits were already merged but then reverted -- the revert has no effect on the merge. This is precisely because every commit object, since it includes it's parent's sha1, uniquely determines a history of changes, and commits in that are in both ancestries don't get re-applied.<p>In Bram's example, you have the opposite problem -- two commits are semantically the same but were made independently and have different sha1s. If Linus were drawing this diagram he would label them B and B' (and so on... there's a lot). To git, B' is totally different so a merge applies the change ""again"". If the other person had noticed this and reset their branch to the first B, the merge would be a fast-forward.<p>IMHO, the Don't Do That should apply to creating those commits (by cherry-picking, or not rebasing duplicated work) rather than merging. Not because such commits are morally wrong or something like that, but because git intentionally (""the stupid content tracker"") doesn't handle them well. That's the tradeoff of the nice object model.<p>Our git workflow at my job is pretty messy and does run into this sort of stuff. I'd love something just a <i>little</i> more darcs-y, like say grafting together the two branches in the second example that arrive at the same content (without having to manage a local grafts file separate from the repository), but that opens many other cans of worms that I'm sure I'm not intelligent enough to deal with.",1303101484

My guess is that such a demonstration might be possible -- cheap gene sequencing, plus extensive statistics, yields a lot of deductive power -- but I don't know if it has been done already or not, and maybe I'm wrong and it's going to be impossible to do conclusively.

As some other poster said, this will further enlarge the node community and result in even more/better/faster utilities, libs, fixes etc.<p>Look at it this way, Enterprises are stuck on Windows and their devs don't have a choice about that... but they <i>can</i> influence the development platform that their upcoming projects will run on. Many of those will be <i>highly</i> tempted to break out of the ASP.NET routine. Maybe server-side JS for most is just a shiny toy... maybe they don't ""get non-blocking IO"" or will resort to old learned threading/concurrency patterns when they shouldn't... but who cares?<p>Also think about server-side products. FogBugz, HelpSpot, SharePoint ... all provided not just hosted on the cloud but often requested to be installable by admins locally or in a private company-owned/hosted ""cloud"". Basing future products in those categories on NodeJS will require smooth Windows support to achieve wider acceptance and adoption.<p>You cannot tell enterprises to change their corporation-wide OS policy... but if you can <i>run</i> your stuff on it, you don't have to embrace the whole rest of the MS stack, they don't care about that one bit.",1303100915

If it comes down to an arms race, they can't win more than extremely temporary victories. If they could, they'd have completely stopped filesharing over Bittorrent, IRC, AIM, MSN, Skype, HTTP, email, Usenet, various P2P services like Kazaa and Limewire, ... and so on.<p>If they start blocking/interfering with the protocol (like Comcast injecting RSTs into suspected torrent connections), you can just encrypt the entire transport layer and randomise the ports. People were configuring their firewalls to drop the falsified RSTs from Comcast.<p>If they blacklist hostnames, there's a near limitless number of them that can be generated. The client can precalculate a domain and ping it at a given time for instructions the same way botnet clients work. The government can't register/block every possible domain name that will be generated. Another alternative: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_flux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_flux</a> There's nothing illegal about having a hostname resolving to an IP.<p>> Especially if the software is open source, as Bitcoin is, all the knowledge of the inner workings of the protocol is public knowledge<p>This is also true for GPG, ciphers like AES/Twofish/Serpent, etc. Openness does not necessarily imply weakness.",1303099247
