So by having the wheels on a bike rotate oppositely, you're actually making the gyroscopic effect even stronger.<p>I think Ars is pulling from this article, which isn't about staying upright but is about the self-correcting steering of a bike wheel (i.e. the fact that you can ride hands-free.) <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6027/339.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6027/339.abstract</a> -- in which case the conclusion is correct and likely due to the geometry of the wheel.

I generally (heck even wholeheartedly) agree with most of what is being said, however I'll take some small issue with a couple of things.<p>While the comments about .NET and Java are more than fair, things are starting to improve (albeit slowly).  The new WCF REST bits that are up on Codeplex and are actively being developed by Glenn Block and his team look quite promising.  I've also been working with a nascent .NET framework called Nancy (<a href=""http://github.com/thecodejunkie/Nancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/thecodejunkie/Nancy</a>), which is extremely lightweight, very extensible and inspired by Sinatra's syntax.<p>Second, I'll agree that in general right now implementing proper Hypermedia support seems like more pain than gain.  However, my experience so far is already indicating places where having hypermedia support would make things easier on me in terms of client development.  The challenge is finding a convenient and reasonably DRY way to build in hypermedia support into my API.  So while I don't care that my API isn't fully REST, I still think there is value to be gained in exploring the 'harder' things like hypermedia.",1303096189

Most of the criticism is because their activities are worsening the situation where they are trying to help.

A compiler is simply a translator from one language to another. The result of the program is the result of an interpreter running the code, not the compiler. Deviation from correct output in the compiled code is not only not allowed, it is deemed a bug in that code.<p>The unique part of different compilers is not the output of the compiled code they produce but the compiled code itself. All compilers should produce code that produces the same result if they are taking in the same input, by definition.",1303095885
