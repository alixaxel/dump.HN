2460389,comment,2459884,2460135,5,0,lsc,,,"google and facebook have requirements for data center reliability that are, ah, quite a bit different from most of us further down the food chain.  My understanding is that google has some data centers that simply run on outside air with no provision (other than just shutting the whole damn thing down and routing traffic elsewhere) for days when outside air is too hot to use.<p>When you own the application stack, and when you are willing and able to handle failures at that level, there are all sorts of optimizations you can do;  optimizations that are not possible if you have a bunch of individual boxes that can't go down.<p>Even amazon's SLA tends to focus more on the ability to bring up new nodes rather than saying anything about the longevity of your existing nodes.<p>As for rackspace, you have a point;  they are in a space where uptime on individual servers matters.  However, judging from their prices and their scale, they have industry-leading levels of margin, and they get this margin, in part, through having a good reputation.  I bet that the reliability hit they'd take trying something new is large enough to scare them away from trying much anything radical in this regard.   Every sysadmin knows that you take a reliability hit whenever you change anything, even if it's a good idea in the long term, and how long that reliability hit lasts depends largely on the complexity of the change.<p>Now, I'm not saying that oil immersion is the right answer;  we've seen it talked about, tried, and we've seen it fail many times;  It's got lots of problems.    Someone has got to implement it well, and then make the required parts standard before it will catch on;  something that is almost as difficult as implementing it well in the first place.<p>But the fact that google and facebook don't use it does not mean it's not useful for people with different data center requirements.",1303156721

Well, it seems to me that if the majority was genuinely dissatisfied with their country being a part of the union, they'd petition for a referendum, the government would be obliged to hold the referendum if enough people petitioned for it (certainly if the majority wanted it), then once the referendum is held, the people would vote against staying in the union and presto - they're no longer a member.<p>So why didn't something like this happen in any of the member countries?

Right now, it'd be much easier for me to find cheap squarfootage than cheap wattage.<p>Unfortunately, there is something of an inverse correlation between the cost of squarefootage and the cost of bandwidth;   especially at the small end of the scale, bandwidth is /extremely cheap/ here in the caltrain corridor of Silicon Valley.  Squarefootage is /extremly expensive/  so you are partly correct.<p>The thing of it is, though, there's fiber along nearly all railroad right of ways.  Now, getting that fiber off of the railroad right of way and into your data center, that can be a rather large capital expense, and often when you get out in the boonies there are fewer players in the secondary markets; less competition means you pay more per unit bandwidth. But the ongoing cost, especially if you use a lot of bandwidth and can bypass most of the middlemen?  might not be that high.<p>Even in Silicon Valley, where bandwidth is cheap and squarefootage is expensive,  power is even more expensive.   With a very small increase in capital cost I could make my own servers 8x more space efficient;  with current power costs?  most data centers won't let me go any more dense than I am now, so there's no point.  (Depending on the cooling system the data centers use, it can be harder to deal with one really hot rack than two racks that are each half as hot.)

The only reason you can train a dog, and the reason that dogs were ever successfully domesticated in the first place, is that they have an inbuilt desire to be cooperative and to submit to the authority of a more powerful ""dog"". The dog is happy when you're happy with it, and sad when you're angry at it. Making it obedient is thus a fairly simple matter. Try that with just about any other animal (especially any other large carnivore which could seriously hurt you if it wanted to) and you'll be out of luck.<p>Humans are actually similar -- we have <i>some</i> sort of an innate ethical sense, though human ethics is a lot more complicated than dog ethics. We're smart enough to realise that our own short-term best interests may be served by acting in a non-ethical manner, and we've evolved all sorts of defence mechanisms to cope with this fact, including the moral outrage and desire for revenge which we feel when we see someone behaving non-ethically.<p>So in conclusion, while you can't necessarily engineer ethics into a mind, you can hard-wire in the structures necessary to <i>care</i> about ethics.

Actually, the name used for the application used to access the Web -- a browser -- tells a lot about how it was intended to use: to ""browse"" the resources, not to execute them. Could you imagine what desktop development would look like if you were limited to using just some sort of file viewer to program for it?<p>Each Web application is, actually, two completely unrelated Web applications. One is executed on the host and is preparing the data for the Web server to serve; but there is another, which is running in each of the users' browsers, only connected to the former one by asymmetric pairs of requests and responses. Even if it consists only of HTML (and CSS), it still has code being interpreted and evaluated on the client; ajax apps only emphasize this.<p>So it's not Web development that is broken; in fact, it is a miracle how what was created by the developers to work around the fundamental limitations of the platform, which was never meant to be one.",1303155166

I think I first read about it in, of all things, ""How to think like Leonardo da Vinci"" many years ago. The trick is to drop all of your personal desire in <i>being right</i>, and instead adopt a sort of state of constant curiosity. Put less effort into defending your views, and more effort into trying to learn something from everyone and everything around you.<p>I was a conservative Republican. Now I'm closer to a liberal (I prefer ""progressive"") Democrat. I used to be a climate ""skeptic""; now I think the majority of the science behind the theories is solid, although there's certainly a lot of room for more research. I've flipped on some things several times; the important thing, to me, is not my opinion on them, but whether I'm still open to new information in the field. For example: I used to believe that wind farms were a subsidized waste because all of the energy costs of production and maintenance must eclipse the energy they produce, especially when half of them don't seem to be turning ever. Then I got curious at how the numbers actually worked out, and found that, in terms of EROI, they seem to be one of the most efficient sources of energy we've got. If something else comes along that presents new information, I like to think that I'll be open to re-considering my opinion on it, because mostly, I'm intensely curious about what the truth of the issue really is -- even if I never discover the ""truth"" about it.<p>It's taken me a while to change my thinking this way, and I still haven't gotten it 100%.

I know I've caught myself thinking ""How will this Tweet or that FB update make me look to my friends/followers..."" - hardly a parallel of how one lives and presents themselves in the unpredictable, variable real world.<p>This, in my mind, is the product of the conflicting forces of exaggerated significance / insignificance - the intense crafting of our online personalities.

I currently run 3 dedicated servers, 1 load balancer, a SAN and a NAS.<p>It was only by accident that I came across EC2 from another post detailing how to create a proxy using EC2 to access the internet. Quite a revalation as I do love the EC2 platform and how flexible it is. I have signed up to the Windows instance to check it out to make sure it does everything I need it to.<p>It turns out it does do everything I need it to but I am a little afraid of the hidden costs. With my dedicated servers, I pay an amount a month and thats it. With EC2 I have worked it out and we will save money but I always feel like I am missing something in the config and if I went full scale with it they I am going to get stung.<p>Whats everyones experience with services like this?

A person with average intelligence can learn the syntax and basic idea of a language in a day.<p>I believe the question they really want an answer to is, ""How do programs work?"".<p>If you really boil down the initial appeal of programming, it isn't Python/C/PHP/Ruby, it's learning how to make the things that those languages are associated with. People are fascinated by programs that can sync files between computers (dropbox/Python), share pictures on the internet (facebook/PHP), or cause your computer to run (Linux/C).<p>I think the best way to help somebody with this question is to find out what it is about software that fascinates them, then suggest a language/framework that facilitates that.",1303154491

We call them ""grandkids"".<p>So lets assume in 10-20 years something descended from IBM's Blue Brain (simulating cat cortexes) leads to something that is analogous in intellectual range from a dog to an elephant.<p>Most people will agree that dogs and elephants are pretty damn smart. Dogs are able to perceive human emotional states, understand some language, do work for people, and fit nicely into our social structure. Elephants aren't that close with people, but are highly intelligent, have active internal emotional states, and even grieve for their dead. In some societies, people and elephants have worked together for thousands of years.<p>In both these cases, we have a long history of working with other intelligences of varying scales for thousands of years. In general, if you don't mistreat them they turn out to be socialized pretty well. Its only when you mistreat them that they learn to fear and hate you. The same is true for people.<p>So as @aothman said in another comment in this thread, AI researchers are just trying to get their projects to not fall over. There's no thought of ""engineering ethics"". This problem is going to be solved one little bit at a time. Artificial neural architectures are going to more and more sophisticated over time. But there is a key difference between the underlying architecture and how you go about training these new minds.<p>If you raise them well, then most of these angels-on-a-pin discussions are just that, meaningless.",1303153422

If I had to guess, if predator drones gain the ability to ""decide"" for themselves whether or not to fire their missiles, it will be built on a system of complex rules, and not because they're ""intelligent"". Pota<i>y</i>to, Pota<i>h</i>to? Maybe.
