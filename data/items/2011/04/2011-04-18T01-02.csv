Sme of them are great, some of them are just OK, lots of them are bad ideas. Mostly, you can't reliably tell a truly great idea without a working example. My contention, and the view that I see expressed all the time in here, is that the idea _without_ the execution would have been worthless (and I suspect Larry wasn't the first only person to have the same idea, but much like the Winklevosses, anybody else who thought of it got out executed by Larry, and Larry succeeded I. The execution, not the idea.)<p>Yeah, you need an idea. But ideas are not that hard to come by.

To me, concurrency is only in the programmers mind. That is, a programmer writes concurrent programs with different threads of control, say, one to process the user input, one to process the network packets etc. In reality, the multiple threads of control could really be running SEQUENTIALLY. That was the case when there was only one core. Remember, pthreads predates multi-cores.<p>Parallelism is something more concrete, it REALLY exists in the real world. A programmer could just imagine and write a sequential loop, but if the compiler deemed it to be really parallel, it could really run parts of the loop in parallel. Of course, a programmer could write a concurrent program, as in, multiple threads of control, and the system could really run it in parallel, say on different cores of a multi-core processor. So remember, concurrency is abstract, parallelism is concrete.",1303089732

2457589,comment,2457307,2457540,3,0,HenryR,,,"Multiple threads of control aren't necessarily parallelisable. Consider a language runtime for which every thread takes the same global lock on the interpreter, and therefore prevents two threads running 'simultaneously'. You have concurrency but no parallelism. Such things happen in the real world.<p>So you might argue that concurrency is necessary for parallelism, but it's not sufficient.<p>Concurrency, to me, is about expanding the set of sequentially-equivalent executions of the program which are considered 'correct' according to the operational semantics of the programming language. If you just have one correct sequential execution, then there isn't any concurrency because you would <i>have</i> to execute sequentially to enforce the one correct ordering.<p>For example, consider this snippet:<p>1. a = 1\n2. b = 2\n3. print a to file1\n4. print b to file2<p>For most realistic language semantics there's no dependency between lines 3, and 4, so it's ok to execute in the following orders:<p>1, 2, 3, 4\n1, 3, 2, 4\n2, 1, 3, 4\n2, 1, 4, 3<p>and others. There <i>is</i> concurrency there, and if the runtime cannot detect or leverage it quite often the processor will with out-of-order-execution and pipelining.<p>However, the simpler snippet:<p>1. a = 2\n2. b = a * 2\n3. print a + b<p>Doesn't have any obvious concurrency (ignoring that in this case the compiler could optimise away the assignments and additions into a single statement). 1 must happen before 2, which must happen before 3. There is only one 'correct' sequential execution, and therefore there is no obvious parallelisation achievable.",1303089606

Anything you learn there is already 10 years out of date, and anything ""new"" you learn will be useless by the time you graduate. Seriously.<p>If you MUST go to college, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get a CS degree. Go for finance, or liberal arts, even bio or chem, or some course of study where the instructors have a clue and have actually done something in that field.<p>I can't tell you how many BS/CS and MS/CS grads I interviewed that couldn't code their way out of a paper bag because they spent their college years writing compilers or some other such nonsense.<p>Get into a hot startup and listen and learn. The first six months will provide you with more experience than you'd get in a PhD program at any university (short of MIT or Stanford).<p>Cheers!",1303088471
