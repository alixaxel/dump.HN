Is it wrong to consider some type of approval process or ""hey we noticed you haven't sold anything in 6 months"" filter?<p>Edit: to add to that, one area I think Etsy should increase their focus on is in fine art (photography, paintings, prints). Sites like 20x200 are doing well and I think it would be good for Etsy to have an area of their site dedicated to getting good, curated art on the walls of people's homes.",1301983190

2409882,comment,2409411,2409411,3,0,Osiris,,,"I'm a self-taught programmer also, as many others have mentioned.  I believe a CS degree can certainly be a launching point for people passionate about programming and computers.  I actually did a year of CS before switching to a humanities degree.  Part of it was I got a little scared off by some of the complex algorithms that came in the second year and I didn't have a good foundation.  I ended up teaching myself PHP and VB.net.<p>In my profession, I ended up becoming a ""technology guru"", including some development.  But as the only developer I never have had anyone else to lean on for expertise or support.<p>I think that for a self-taught programmer, having (good) mentors is probably a far more effective way to learn real-world development skills than a CS degree.  I feel, for myself, that I would thrive in a development team where I could learn for co-workers and receive criticism and correction for my work.<p>Without that outside influence, it's hard to know if what I'm doing is really the best or even a good way of doing it.<p>I think every developer needs a mentor, and that's what I feel I missing most.<p><i>(P.S. Does anyone out there want to be my mentor?  I am looking for a technical co-founder for a startup idea I'm working on)</i>",1301982946

2409840,comment,2409411,2409411,15,0,phamilton,,,"I'd say that programming falls into two categories.  I don't quite know how to describe them, so here are two examples:<p>1) Your average database/object driven application.  There is user input.  This translates pretty directly to output.  There may be some interesting algorithms in between, but it's pretty much UI programming.<p>2) Solving difficult problems.  A logistics routing application.  The bulk of the code is based on graph theory, reducing the problem perhaps into smaller segments that can be solved in different ways.  The UI is just the surface.<p>There is a need for both types of programmers.  The first type are increasingly graphic designers who decided to learn PHP or some similar situation.  There are tons of great applications out there that really aren't that complex (except when scaled to extreme proportions - ie Twitter).  Wordpress, Gmail, even Microsoft Office isn't terribly complex (at least, the 90% of it that everyone uses).<p>The second group seems to be a bit more selective.  Applications like Dropbox, which need to route data in the most effective way, or Adsense, in which profit needs to be optimized in choosing what ad to display as a page loads.  These are complex problems, with complex solutions.  That's where O(n) analysis is important.  That's where an understanding of graph theory and established algorithms is critical.<p>While these two groups aren't completely exclusive, I'd say many self taught programmers find themselves in the first group.",1301981893

Right now, for many if not most Americans at least, college is an unsupervised extension of high school. It's treated that way not just by patrons but also their parents and administrators. The requisite maturity just isn't there.<p>Interestingly, historically, there's usually been a war or famine or other hardship that has forced people in their late teens to grow up quickly. Is our society really better on a macro level for the ease that teenagers have now?<p>Additionally, schooling after a few years as an apprentice is extremely helpful in that you have a familiarity and context about the field and can instantly filter the busy work from the useful information. One may also be in better financial condition by that point, making loans less necessary and ultimately saving the student a lot of money.<p>Personally I plan to encourage my children to do something else for a few years before they enter post-secondary education (if they plan to do so at all).",1301981240

My dad is a 58 year old fire fighter, he couldn't have been any less of a ""computer person"" yet he emails, manages his iTunes/iPod, and can stalk me on Facebook with ease (too much ease in fact when it comes to FB). And to top it off, he has done all this on a.... Windows PC, I type that without a shred of irony but many will read it as such.<p>Face it, ATMs mostly run a custom UI on top of a Windows kernel, Police cruisers all have laptops attached to the dash, the US Postal Service will be out of business sooner rather than later because email and by extension the PC has been for ""normal people"" since the turn of the century. Anybody who hasn't interfaced in someway or another with a PC (regardless of OS) at some semi-regular interval over the last 10 years probably won't discover a need to now just because of the increased portability of the tablet form factor.",1301981239

Maybe they're just terribly motivated by the urge to get out from under years of backlog. I even signed up for their Peer2Patent program.<p>I suppose that Google can't -not- get involved in this arena given it's sheer size - in regards to profits and influence - but whether they live up to their model of ""Do No Evil"" is another question all together. Not that they're evil, just that I think you can't grow a company past a certain size without becoming a least a -bit- totalitarian. I understand ambition and the passion to innovate but at some point it just seems like these huge company's don't just want part of the pie but the whole thing. Make no mistake, Google and Apple are engaged in an epic holy-war for every facet of your daily attention, so - regardless of what people's opinions are regarding Google and their take on patents - we know they'll play this game.<p>Actually - just thought of this - what about...patent credits or something? Kinda like how large companies are only allowed to pollute up to a certain ""credited"" amount. I know they can buy pollution ""credits"" from other companies that don't use them, but I guess that model wouldn't translate -exactly- because it could potentially punish companies with a high rate of innovation. Or is that the ah-ha here? That a company can realistically only innovate and invent to a certain point, while IP moves grossly exceeding that amount can be thought of as abuses thus incurring credit penalties. Yea...I like where I'm going with this....",1301980881
