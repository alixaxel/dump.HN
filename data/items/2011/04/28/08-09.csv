In fact, it probably would have never been created: its predecessors, like Babelfish, would have died first.<p>Translation is <i>format-shifting</i>.  It is no more illegal for me to translate a movie from German to English than it is to convert it from a DOC to a PDF.<p>What <i>would</i> be illegal is if I paid for the movie, translated it, and then <i>distributed it for free</i>.  The mere fact that it's a derivative work does not make it any more ""mine"" than the original, and thus it's just as much piracy as me distributing the original, untranslated version.  Similarly, converting the movie from an iTunes MP4 to an MKV will not make it any more or less legal for me to redistribute it.<p>The legally dubious part is distributing <i>just the translated script</i> (i.e. subtitles), but not the movie itself.
