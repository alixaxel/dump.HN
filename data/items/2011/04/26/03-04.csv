The goal wasn't to actually get him to prove himself, but rather to show him that he no longer was a good fit so he could make the decision himself. On Friday, I said the following:<p>""I'm concerned that something is seriously affecting your ability to be productive with this startup. You and I both know that you aren't accomplishing what you're capable of. So instead of letting this grow into a problem I wanted to talk about it and see how I can help. I'm also afraid I haven't communicated my expectations reasonably. I'm sure you can understand my concern since this our entire lives right now. I don't want you to feel like you're trapped or forced to do something that you're not interested in. You know by now that doing a startup takes more than a 100% dedication. If you feel like you have lost some passion for it, then I want you to pursue what you are 100% passionate for. I won't have any problem at all because I know how hard it is to feel like you would be letting someone down. If I'm completely mistaken, then I want to be clear about my expectations and give you a week to make sure that you want to pursue this. [Outline expectations]. This is a decision I can't make for you, so I want you to think about it and starting Monday you can start to see if you're still interested.""<p>On Sunday night, he resigned without me having to ""fire"" him.",1303790319

Attention seems almost random.<p>I am convinced that Netflix will one day be studied as one of the most astute business strategies of the ""internet revolution"".  IIRC, Hastings wanted to do streaming from the beginning but recognized that (1) the bandwidth wasn't available widely enough yet and (2) licensing content for streaming distribution required being a big player.  He wanted to be sure he was well-positioned to be the dominant player when #1 (bandwidth) resolved itself and wanted to be big enough to achieve #2 (licensing deals).  Doing DVDs by mail, while perhaps not as good of a business, achieved these goals.  IANAL, but I think major laws would have to change to prevent Netflix from buying DVD titles and renting them by mail, so he could operate without the permission of the big boys.  This strategy also had the interesting property of being a viable business until bandwidth improved (presuming, of course, that the cable operators did not do what I suggested!).<p>What remains to be seen is whether the studios will still take kindly to this sort of disintermediation.  That they did not take earlier action to control this distribution channel is perhaps as big as a mistake as that made by the cable operators.",1303789600

2483919,comment,2479865,2479865,4,0,strlen,,,"As somebody born in former USSR, this is why Russia will _never_ have a Silicon Valley. I refuse to ever consider living in (even temporarily), visiting or doing business either in Russia or with a Russian company in the United States (how do I know they won't come after my relatives?). When I got to the United States, I realized that I'd rather sweep the streets in the United States than be wealthy in Russia.<p>Rule of law (vs. rule by decree), freedom are deeply engrained in American and ersatz-British (UK, but also Canada, Australia, Ireland, etc...) ethos. A pupil on a school yard, when confronted by a teacher screams ""it's a free country, you can't make me"". People feel entitled (I am using it in a dictionary definition, in the positive sense of the word) to freedom, to human rights.<p>This isn't the same way in Russia: elders would frequently tell me ""the place for people who want freedom is in jail"". Philosophy was taught in an entirely different way in university: my parents were surprised when I told them that Plato and Hegel (who taught that real freedom is the right to submit to an absolutist state) were considered fascist by my (American) professors. Their anti-democratic (in the greater sense of the word, which encompasses not just elections but also concepts of minority rights, free speech and the like), anti-freedom theories were taught as being more ""advanced"" than philosophies of Locke and Kant.<p>To be fair, there are many abhorrent and brutal ideas in the American ethos as well, but they're token compared to the Russian/Soviet ethos: compare for example, Russian behaviour in Chechnya with US behaviour in Iraq or Israeli behaviour in Palestine. As another example, it's shameful that United States is even publicly debating torture, but in Russia torture isn't an abstract debate about ""ticking time-bombs"": it's something that you _expect_ to happen to you if you're arrested. I remember a neighbour recounting how, when he was found publicly drunk, the police patrol put him on the trunk of the car and struck his liver and kidneys with a truncheon to teach him a ""lesson"".<p>United States, Canada and England are blessed, historically. Russia had been occupied by Mongols, ruled by tyrannical czars (who styled themselves after Mongol Khans and Byzantine Emperors), ruled by the worst tyrant known to man (with an intercession of Nazi Germany rule, during which heavy racist propaganda was further imprinted into the popular ethos). You can't expect this backdrop to produce an environment in which the next Google will be built (there's a reason Sergey Brin didn't stay in Russia to build it!).",1303789592

It is typically not available as a handle for a board that has been around a while.  I tried to sign up for HN as Michele but it was already taken.  My default if Michele is not available is to add a faux ""last name"" of some sort but that tends to lead to very long handles which can be annoying.  So, to avoid the long handle syndrome, when Michele fell through here, I opted to use initials of a familiar handle that felt to me like a real nickname.<p>However, I kind of expected that to be too short and to be rejected (nevermind that I already knew that pg goes by pg here) and was still in the mindset of uppercase first letter followed by lowercase second letter so it wound up looking like a feminist title rather than initials.

2483877,comment,2482123,2483624,3,0,thwarted,,,"<i>A single, 250GB HD seems a bit ""lite"" for a server, even for one that does mostly processing.</i><p>I've found that 250GB is way overkill for a machine that does mostly processing.  Consider web servers, which need a copy of the code (which hopefully isn't over a gig), and the operating system install for a server should fit in under 10GB.  The bulk of the data they'll be processing will be in remote services like databases.  If you have a decent logging infrastructure setup, where you regularly ship all logs off the machine, you need enough storage space for the logs for the rotation period -- if you ship them off immediately (say with scribe), you need enough local storage for the period your aggregator is unavailable (which can be minimized by having even scribe log aggregation load balanced).  If these machines are in clusters and you can survive with some of them being out, you don't even need RAID on them.  It's kind of unfortunate that the smallest drive you can buy leaves it 80%+ empty, because I have a feeling that drives that were smaller and not optimized for speed and capacity, but still use modern technology, might be more reliable.<p>We've taken to putting smallish SSDs in our load balancers and other machines that don't need a lot of local storage, since having fewer moving parts (now the only moving parts are the fans) is a power-usage and reliability win.",1303788578

If you and three friends want to take up that skydiving offer, you need to coordinate outside of Groupon, agree upon it, and then everyone trusts that the others made the purchase.<p>Now imagine doing this on Facebook where you could potentially (no idea if they have this functionality planned, but they should) purchase the skydiving offer with a provision such as ""only settle the charge on my credit card when three of my friends also sign up"".  It would get posted to your wall as ""John Smith signed up for skydiving at 50% off and needs 3 more people to join him"".  Then Jane Doe also signs up and your wall now reads ""John and Jane are going skydiving and they need 2 more people to join them"".  If Facebook did that, it could be huge.<p>Additionally, Facebook credits cost 30% commission to the vendor.  Groupon charges 50% commission for their deals.  Assuming that the commission structure for Facebook Deals uses the same percentage and there isn't an additional fee on top, it's more financially appealing for merchants to sign up with Facebook over Groupon.

You're just paying your provider to employ people that are capable of fixing these problems instead of in-housing them.<p>By and large, if you manage physical, owned infrastructure the same way you manage cloud resources.  That is: automated configuration, monitoring, and deployment.  The vast majority of the time it's the same process.  You just need to make sure that your instrumentation is sufficient to notice when things aren't running correctly and remove machines from service until someone can figure out what happened. This could be in the form of an outside tech or in house support.
