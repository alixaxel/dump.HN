2418621,comment,2418388,2418528,4,0,sabalaba,,,"There's essentially two major types of fraud that could occur with this system that we've thought of.<p>1) Seller fraud, bogus items, imprecise descriptions, etc.  This is relatively easily prevented with our reputation system as it stands. A user will less likely to buy if a seller has a negative reputation, and hopefully that provides enough of an economic incentive to prevent seller fraud.<p>2) Money laundering (Malicious Molly creates two dummy accounts and makes a purchase on one and moves the money towards the other)<p>This is a big one.  One of the things we were thinking about regarding this is to analyze payments and see if there is suspicious activity (multiple recently or nearly registered accounts all making purchases around the same time/date range and then the money being pulled out would be a strong sign that the behavior was money laundering.  But that's more of a payment system problem.<p>3) Buyer chargeback fraud (Malicious Mark makes a purchase, receives the download, and then calls his credit card company up to reverse the payment.  Mark has the good, the payment gets reversed (it's difficult to dispute digital goods) and Mark has the money & the product.<p>There's not much that can be done with this one from a technological point of view, however, we have considered creating a user reputation system that could let sellers rate buyers' behavior. The reputation itself is vulnerable to a sybil attack, but that vulnerability is a yet unsolved problem (if we are to maintain the ease of use in creating an account).",1302162775

Largely because there were preconceptions about programming that I had to unlearn before I could learn them.  Continuations essentially require that you descend to a level of abstraction below structured programming and think ""what is the computer actually doing"", and then re-ascend the abstraction ladder with a new way to structure that.  Monads require that you understand typeclasses, and typeclasses require that you think in terms of sets of types and the relations that govern them; it's not enough to import familiar OOP concepts.<p>A bunch of papers use such obtuse mathematical language that I couldn't hope to understand them without a grad degree in math.<p>OTOH, reading something like Lisp in Small Pieces (or even SICP) <i>now</i> is considerably easier, because I'm familiar with the basic concepts.",1302162423

You can still talk to most people every day, you can gather them all in one room, information flow is unrestricted. But staying under 25 people means for most companies that you are stifling growth.<p>Once you get above the magical 25 people threshold, you'll find that it is simply impossible to manage the company effectively using a completely flat structure. Also, you'll discover a lot of new problems you never suspected existed before: you'll need internal PR, for instance, as people in one part of the company won't know what people in other parts are doing. There will be myths to dispel, growing animosities, lack of direction.
