The sentence could mean the speaker or author thinks sentences must be concise to be clear.<p>The ""concise"", like the ""clear"", in ""Writing clear concise sentences"" is a restrictive adjective, primary to the meaning of the sentence, with all words spoken at the same pitch. Clarity and conciseness are orthogonal. Perhaps there's a slight pause between clear and concise, which could be shown with a single comma.",1302062335

In addition to the strong type system Haskell is purely functional which means the compiler can reason pretty strongly about an applications side-effects.  I'm not sure Erlang or Scala can really compare on either of these things (though I am not an expert on either of those languages).  The last big thing I can think of is that Haskell is ""lazy"" which means it only evaluates values as they are needed, this aspect has its upsides but also many downsides.

2413774,comment,2413058,2413698,5,0,pjscott,,,"The place where I've seen Haskell really shine is parsing. Parsers are remarkably easy to write in Haskell, thanks to Parsec and its various spinoff libraries. For example, here's a minimal HTTP request parser that Bryan O'Sullivan wrote by essentially translating part of the RFC into Haskell:<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/bos/attoparsec/src/tip/examples/RFC2616.hs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/bos/attoparsec/src/tip/examples/RFC261...</a><p>It's 54 lines long, pretty trivial, and here's a really cool part: it parses incrementally on strict bytestrings, so you can just do raw socket recv calls and pass the chunks of input to the parser. Similarly, I wrote a parser for the subset of YAML that beanstalkd uses (as part of the hbeanstalk client library), and it was just 11 lines of code. It's very impressive.<p>(The concurrency and parallelism stuff is also notably slick, but I haven't had as much occasion to use it. Haskell's aversion to side-effects really pays off sometimes.)<p>By the way, you're right about the Haskell community being friendly and welcoming -- as you yourself demonstrate. :-)",1302059723
