I got an Evo 4G and was so appalled by the battery life -- clearly nobody in their right mind would ship the product knowing how poor the battery life is -- that I did a double take and sold the 4G and bought an iPhone 4.<p>I'm actually rooting for Google.  I'd just like to see them take the overall usability and build quality a lot more seriously than they appear to be taking it.  It's completely absurd that carriers are installing things like a clock with hands which prevent the phones from being instantly upgradeable when a new version of Android is released.<p>Android gives carriers a lot of perverse incentives, most of which they appear to be following quite religiously.",1302242363

Your algorithm is basically:<p>1) Read a line from a stream, parse it into an integer.\n2) Do a little math.\n3) Convert an integer into text and print it to a stream.<p>In Python, (1) and (3) are implemented in C. For Common Lisp, (1) and (3) are mostly implemented in Lisp.<p>Beyond that, (1) and (3) will completely dominate the runtime. (2) is probably just a couple of dozen CPU cycles, but the print and terpri will involve flushing stdout, which will involve a system call which will be thousands to tens of thousands of CPU cycles. Depending on how the stream is buffered, the read-line will likely involve a system call as well.<p>Basically in this test is just measuring how quickly the program can sit and wait for read()/write() system calls to complete.

The advantage of this approach is speed.\n  2) It could be going through looking at the raw data on the hard drive, and search byte-by-byte for the magic headers at the start of every image file.  For example all GIF files start with GIF87a or GIF89a.

Granted, it doesn't explain why the Android version makes such a poor showing, since I'm pretty sure Android has equivalents for a lot of those elements.<p>There are, however, so many possible reasons why Android versions get the shaft that it's nearly impossible to say why any given pair of apps are so different in quality. It could be that it's easier to find iOS devs that really care about UX and polish (lots of self-selection going on here, similar to Mac/Windows third-party devs). It could be that a company asks their iOS dev to knock out an Android version, when they're not competent at developing for the platform. It could be that the folks in charge of getting mobile apps made for their company just like iPhones more (not a stretch, given demographic differences) or see them as more hip or marketable and funnel more money that way. Or, it could be that, after spending lavish amounts of money on the iPhone app and seeing it not set the world on fire, they scale back to merely ""establishing a presence"" on Android instead of making the same effort.<p>A lot of these behaviors wouldn't surprise me, particularly from companies whose primary business is not creating software.",1302240816

2422583,story,,,2,3,lunchbox,"Ask HN: challenging Google/Bing search problem",,"TL;DR: Google and Bing let you search for certain binary files like pdf, doc, and pptx; is there a way to search for lesser known binary file formats?<p>Details:\nI am researching several computer programs, and would like a random sample of ~100 real-world files made by users of each application. For example, I'd like to get a bunch of  .pub (Publisher) files, .vpp (Visual Paradigm) files, .eap (Enterprise Architect) and .vsd (Visio) files.<p>Google and Bing index a few popular binary file formats, so I can do searches like this:<p>mySearchTerm filetype:pdf<p>mySearchTerm filetype:doc<p>mySearchTerm filetype:pptx<p>However, they don't support these lesser known binary formats in the same way. As a result, searching for these other file extensions yields many fewer results; I suspect there are way more files with that extension on the internet, but they are just not turning up on my search. Maybe files with a proprietary MIME type are ignored by the search engines.<p>Also, many of the results are not in the file format of interest; they are just regular web pages that happen to have that string at the end of the URL. For example, searching for filetype:eap returns www.facebook.com/rachel.eap, which is not what I am looking for in this context.<p>My next idea was to search for a string that occurs in the binary file if I open it in a text editor. For example, Visio *.vsd files tend to have the string _VPID_ALTERNATENAMES buried in the binary. But that approach didn't work very well.<p>Any ideas on how I can achieve the goal?",1302240680
