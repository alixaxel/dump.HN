Imagine your co-worker gets up for a 2 minute bathroom break (or you had 2 minutes in the boss' office alone, or at an associates house, etc) - what could you do in 2 minutes? Sure you could try to install a keylogger but this requires some knowledge, prior preparation and is susceptible to detection. You could copy off his private work but this is slow, not much you copy in 2 minutes.<p>Knowing this security hole, within seconds i could easily copy one small file (or upload it to crate, or just write down the machine hash or upload it to codepaste etc etc) and know i now have <i>all his private files - for life</i> - and not just files now but all future possible files (or at least until he changes his password; but how many people really do that regularly?).<p>Checking that 2 machines aren't using the same key would at least notify you that something had happened, although it may occur too late to secure your existing files.<p>Another option is tie the key with your IP address, and when a new IP address is detecting you need to enter in your credentials to get a new pass.<p>I think at least some hashing with create a unique computer stamp (username, OS version, mac address, processor hardware name, etc) would go a long way in making this more secure; it's not perfect (these things can be faked), but it certainly stops Johnny Amateur Hacker in gaining access to his friends/co-workers/bosses private files.",1302254220

As for the .dev TLD trick - that's a little harder, as OS X 10.6 has support for flat files inside /etc/resolver/* which the name of the file indicates what configuration/settings to use when resolving that domain. As such, they just drop a file named 'dev' in there and tell it to look to localhost on a custom port for DNS resolution. Then they run a mini DNS server on that port to resolve .dev domains to localhost.<p>Probably the only way to do something similar to this for linux would be to run a name server of your own on your box and add a custom zone configuration for the .dev TLD and recursive lookup for anything else.",1302254164

I used it for a while now and am building an ongoing review: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/892043"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/892043</a><p><pre><code>    PLUS\n\n    - You never have to attach it to the computer, not even for software upgrades\n    - Call quality and reception is sometimes better then my iPhone\n    - The dashboard or home is really nice with widgets and shortcuts (like wifi settings)\n    - Regular mini USB cable, although iPod cables are pretty common now too\n    - I don't really feel like I miss any apps, and most standard apps are done very nicely\n    - Some stuff is really smart like having a 2 second delay for locking after the screen dims down\n    - Most of the time it feels pretty fast\n    - I feel like I have more insight in the device (which is good because I'm geeky)\n    - I like how I can for each app see what they are allowed to do and disable stuff (like background syncing) in the app manager. Although I never do anything with it.\n    - The Firefox browser is actually really nice\n\n    MINUS\n\n    - It feels like an actual computer doing background stuff sometimes\n    - Battery life is a lot worse (~50%), especially with syncing turned on\n    - It charges reaaally slow, or maybe as fast as an iPhone over normal USB\n    - The browser gets really slow with large pages\n    - There is no easy way to see what Android version you are exactly running and see a changelog\n    - If you're somewhere with speakers, the is a bigger chance on a iPod connector then a jack-jack\n    - For running, the earphone jack on the bottom is not handy with an armband\n    - Wifi reception seems actually worse then my iPhone\n    - Couldn't find a snooze function on the default alarm\n    - Taking a call while running (with music) was ridiculous, i ended up having to reboot the phone\n    - It seems the browser has a lot of problems when switching networking (wifi to 3g etc.)\n    - Phone itself feels a lot cheaper then an iPhone, but still decent\n    - The camera is extremely shit and audio with movies is a joke\n    - Overall it feels way less polished (unexpected delays, stuttery animations, weird redraws)\n    - I feel like I have no control over which app is running until I go into some task manager. I think they only keep running when it makes sense (navigation, mp3)\n    - Wifi receptions is worse then an iPhone, and most apps (like the browser) are really bad at dealing with bad network connections.\n    - When the phone gets stuck (mostly in maps or the browser with lots of js) the only way to reboot it is to peel out the battery. Eek!\n    - Flimsy USB cable/connector are really frustrating when you need to make a call while charging\n    - A actually have to travel with a phone charger on me again\n    - It feels like app updates are available sooner/more often on iOS\n\n    SUBJECTIVE\n\n    - I like the look of the icons and most Android base screens\n    - I hate the Android font, a sort of thin Verdana</code></pre>",1302253798

2423035,comment,2420090,2420090,2,0,quique,,,"Thank you all for the comments, questions, and feedback... it's not about me, Dave McClure, any individual designer in residence or even 500 Startups, it's about creating an ecosystem of great designer founders and designers with specialized talent in the startup game.<p>And we want more but the startup designer path is broken. Just look at the thousands of responses on Quora for hints... I don’t even have to ask and bet that many of your companies are looking to hire a designer.... but the problem is, designers are being taught outdated education, not being mentored by other startup designers, and there’s intense competition. If you think the problem is bad here, it gets worse globally.<p>We see this trend growing as more consumer startups are succeeding because of replicable methods for great core product idea discovery and continuously well executed user experience, not just pretty pixels. In fact we’ve invested in a number designer founders including Votizen’s Jason Putorti, ColourLovers (also YC), WorkersNow, Slideshare, Forrst, Foodspotting, Punchd, MotionMath, Visual.ly...<p>So the question is how do we create more designers like Jason Putorti, who not only have the more traditional visual ability to make things look pretty, but more importantly have the engineering and development skillz along with business sense to effectively launch startups and be successful.<p>This begs the follow up question, so where do these great designers go? Many of my top designer friends are at agencies and big tech companies where they hone their craftsmanship and are respected. However, too few take the leap to venture out on their own and become founders/leaders, even when they get frustrated being mercenaries and trading their time for cash that doesn’t scale...but some actually risk leaving the cush job...<p>Like consultants from Adaptive Path. On their website they actually embrace designers like Jeff Veen who sold his company to Google and Ryan Freitas one of our mentors, who sold his company to AOL. So how can we create an environment for folks like this to take the entrepreneurial leap...<p>They can take The d.fund path. We aim to remove this activation barrier with hand pick designers from top schools, tech companies, freelancers, even globally, to help foster a new generation of designer founders. In the process we also will create more designers available for hire and develop specialized design consulting for startups as a means to train and stay alive, not an end.<p>We’ve been growing up & to the right with hand picked and filtered designers by being radically collaborative with other groups and internally teaching our own design bootcamp and curriculum inspired by the Stanford dschool, Janice Fraser’s LUXr and the whole lean startup movement. We also plan to host an even better WarmGun conference to bring together more designers and developers later this year in NYC...<p>More top designers are joining our community everyday because it’s not about Dave, me or any one designer in residence...it’s about a scalable designer ecosystem that is committed to helping produce designers that solve meaningful problems in our world, not one trick ponies & pseudo attention sucking innovation...<p>Many of you may have seen the YC post that got thousands of views about how it’s like the Marines...which makes me wonder what happens when you combine an empathetic Jedi Designer with an elite Marine Hacker...I think you get an amazing force of real innovation....<p>So, help create the best path for startup designers by joining us and not just investing at least $50k in a designer founder to participate in our next accelerator batch in Mid May, but more importantly... provide the education, mentorship & especially engineering skills to make the startup designer ecosystem healthy & sustainable...",1302253775
