You could certainly get around this by setting up a separate local 'dev-show' environment, but if you are going to all that effort you really could/should just set up a dev version on a vps/cloud server.<p>If you are talking to someone interactively, chances are they are another dev, which means they really don't need to see your environment running, they should be capable of using their own.<p>Also, in this thread I really feel people are exaggerating the level of effort to set up a 'showable' environment on a cloud instance. For rails as an example, I can go from server launch to a running app with db in less than 15 minutes (easily) with manual config and I really doubt I'm the exception here. Remember, this is a 'dev' environment still, your apache/nginx config doesn't have to be airtight, it just has to work for the single user you are showing it to (all defaults on everything is going to work at least as well as the built in rails server).<p>Not to mention the fact that if you aren't thinking about automating deployments yet, it's a really good investment of time and would work just as well for this case.",1303350696

2469153,comment,2466731,2466912,6,0,Tiomaidh,,,"I am <i>very</i> new to Clojure and only semi-experienced in CL, but I ran into a problem today that left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. I had something like:<p><pre><code>  (defn foo [bar]
    (let [whatnot (+ bar 3)]
      (frobnicate whatnot)))
  
  (defn frobnicate [quux]
    (println ""Hello"" quux))

</code></pre>
And it threw an error, since frobnicate hadn't been defined while it was dealing with foo. But I didn't know that. And using and commenting out my (ns spam.core)--and trying various compilation incantations with SLIME--were confounding variables such that the call to frobnicate sometimes worked if the ns call was removed and you held your nose right. Finally I gave up and posted to Stack Overflow, thinking I'd jacked up my namespace somehow. Instead they told me to either move frobnicate's definition to be above foo, or else declare it.<p>It never <i>occured</i> to me that a modern, not-low-level well-received language would have this limitation. And I feel like I'm part of the target demographic for Clojure. I'm an experienced Java and Python coder.  I know and like Lisp. I'm interested in learning a new language. And I did what I thought I was supposed to--I read the list of differences between Clojure and other Lisps on the official site. I read a tutorial that concisely addressed Clojure syntax, data structures, special forms and so forth in a way designed for people who already knew how to program.<p>And there's a lot of things I like--better data structures, the lambda reader macro, the judicious use of brackets to avoid paren soup, Java interop, and more things that I'm only discovering as I gain more experience.<p>But I'm still kind of in shock about having to declare methods.

A sizeable portion of the Java community had a massive allergy to them because they'd previously been burned by C++ templates.  Of course there was the typical language war response ""you're just not smart enough"", but no matter how many times the people railroading it in protested that Generics weren't templates the facts remained:<p>They looked like templates<p>They had lots of funny little side effects and gotchas (just like templates)<p>Nobody really understood them, and even if they did, nobody could explain them.  See also:<p>Class Enum<E extends Enum<E>><p>In other words, it looks like a duck, it quacks like a duck (etc).<p>It is entirely possible that with different syntax (not the C++ style angle brackets) and different keywords (extends in the above example is clearly different from the normal extends in an object context) there would have been less cognitive dissonance from the C++ refugees and less pushback.<p>But ultimately what it boiled down to was this: the JCP (java community process) was a massive failure because you couldn't vote against things.  You could only vote yes, no was not even an option, and abstentions were ignored (and therefore useless).

If you do incorporate, someone suing you is actually suing the company - the company is liable and only in specific cases can you be personally liable.<p>The second part is that incorporating typically puts out the terms of your arrangement with your friends - right now, if the hosting is in one person's name, they could essentially be the sole owner of the company (unless you had a lawsuit over IP, or something like that).

Moving programs from C: to D: will often screw up registry settings and other crap like that. On OSX and Linux, thanks to a single root filesystem and symlinks, this model might work better. Furthermore, I have to manage moving files back and forth. This is a problem algorithms should take care of and no OS does this yet.<p>Secondly, a lot of people are saying the Momentus benchmarks are terrible. This seems obvious. Any standard benchmark does not take advantage of a large read cache. You have to use some sector of data over and over again in order for the drive's algorithms to put it into the SSD cache.

We usually stick with the same pair for about a week and rotate among our 10-man team, though each person has areas they're more proficient in. We use Skype for VoIP (though Mumble works better in some cases) and IRC for chat.<p>I haven't done much in-person pairing, but I think the main difference is not having to share a keyboard. Each person can use a system they're comfortable with; no fuss about dvorak vs qwerty, Kinesis vs Natural 4000, standing desk vs sitting, or Ubuntu vs Macosecks. It does mean you need to use auditory cues to indicate who is in control of a given session. The biggest drawback is probably that you can't share a web browser over SSH, but since we are doing backend coding it doesn't affect us.<p>For me it's been a huge win.
