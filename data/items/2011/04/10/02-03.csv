2428682,comment,2428123,2428622,17,0,wtallis,,,"I think the conspiracy theories, etc. were certainly bothersome, but they were far from overwhelming. It's important to keep in mind that basically nobody is in the business of following and publicly reporting on Microsoft's money trail, so in recent years we've only had weak evidence for their ties to SCO and their influence over the ISO standardization of OOXML. The myriad other possibilities probably were never investigated enough to have a chance of leaving the crackpot realm. We're left with only shreds of evidence, like certain lawyers being shared by everybody trying to undermine the GPL with a lawsuit, and Novell's IP being bought by a consortium that Microsoft put together.<p>To me, the greatest immediate loss is her reporting on Sony's legal activities. Even Ars Technica has not gone to the level of depth that PJ's analysis has, and I don't think anybody else has been diligent about tracking what Sony says in prosecuting Hotz vs. defending against the class action. There have also been several occasions where PJ has been the one to dampen sensationalism by not taking the legal filings at face value (eg. the accusations that Hotz had fled the country, or that Sony had a smoking-gun match for his serial number and IP address).",1302404088

2428659,comment,2428216,2428216,5,0,trotsky,,,"I am cursed with the affliction of seeing both sides in many situations. Sam is without a doubt right, in that an attack on the users of pow, presumably being small in number, is unlikely. Thomas is also right, in that a situation like this is almost the epitome of low hanging fruit to an attacker with the means and motivation to attack someone installing pow.<p>I think both parties need to be cut some slack. Sam is in a position where he's just trying to get some things done and make it easy on the user to run some great software. Laudable, without a doubt. Thomas is in a situation where he sees the evil that men do, and just wants to point out a tweak that could potentially head off problems for people wanting to opt in to said great software. Also laudable, without a doubt.<p>Where I will come down on one side is the release of gosh, which is difficult to interpret as anything but an attempt to mock one of their positions. The adjective theoretical is perhaps one of the sticking points. The problem here is that the transformation from theoretical to actual in terms of a threat is unfortunately just a couple of hours of coding on my part, and I say this with full knowledge that most participants at HN far exceed my skill level. I would use bog standard tools, all of which are already installed on my laptop - even though I am not in the habit of doing such things. For a myriad of reasons, the least of which being industry health, it shouldn't be necessary for me to pull an Eric Butler in the next few hours for this topic to go from theoretical to actual threat.<p>At the heart of things, there is a disconnect between those in the security industry and those who aren't. If you attempt to be totally secure you'll find yourself in a recursion loop that never exits. If you attempt to just get things done, you can find yourself employing practices that are quite simply horrifying to those who are stuck in said recursion loop. If you attempt to take a moderating view, 9 out of 10 times you'll find yourself agreed with yet your suggestions will mostly go unfollowed. Until some common exploit comes about, at which point those same 9 out of 10 folks will mention that this vulnerability has been known about since the beginning of time.<p>In my view, we all need to meet on some common ground. Sure, if you don't have http-->sh executions going on there are still 10^10 other attack vectors out there. But for right now, that's more or less the only solution the security industry has to offer. Keep plugging away at low hanging fruit. It raises the bar.<p>Bottom line here is that Thomas doesn't seem like too bad a guy to me, and I doubt he's looking to tarnish the reputation of a great piece of software. But he's bringing up a good point that is refreshingly actionable. It's an opportunity to make things just a wee bit better with a minimal amount of disruption. I'd suggest that you mock it at everyone's peril.",1302403320

But without the benefits of a monopoly, people don't actually choose Microsoft phones, at least not in comparison to Android. All they can do about that now is try to force you to use their products.That's in a way what a monopoly is.<p>People did not choose Android because it was open or because it was Linux. They choose it because the devices had multitouch capacitative screens(same as the iPhone) and ran on non AT&T carriers while Windows Mobile devices had resistive screens forcing use of a stylus and were not touch friendly, didn't have proper GPUs, suffered fragmentation etc.  Windows Phone 7 is a total ditching of the old paradigm and a fresh start, but it came quite late and is facing an uphill battle against the network effects(yes, the same network effects that a monopoly or duopoly entail). If it was around when Android started, it could've been a very different market now, regardless of PJ's ramblings about monopolies. The new Windows phones are actually not bad compared to Androi but are missing many features. How can she declare victory for Android when WP7 has been barely out 5 months yet?<p>Interesting to see that she sweeps under the carpet things like Apple filing patent lawsuits against Android phones, and Jobs insinuating that Android is for porn. I sometimes feel that she plays to her primarily anti-MS audience, especially to keep things interesting to them after the SCO case ran out of gas but at the same time cannot criticize Apple too much even if deserved since that would anger the pro-Apple portion of the crowd.<p>In short, while the legal analysis was great, the bias, witch hunts and paranoia got too overwhelming once the SCO case stopped being interesting and it was the time that I stopped reading it regularly and I've seen some people who share this sentiment so I am not alone on this. Microsoft is definitely not an angel, but to obessively see it as a devil behind everything is a bit too much.",1302401182
