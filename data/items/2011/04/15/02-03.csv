Had the controller actually been sleeping the entire time, and the pilots followed the automated systems, it's entirely possible that they would have been ok. In addition, the equipment failure/downtimes severely limited any operator's situational awareness.<p>It's one of the cruel ironies here, that a completely passed out controller likely would have lead to a better outcome.",1302836382

The intent of this is to inject some sort of individual identifier to a server, which could be in the form of an ID number that is read by a boot script in your gold image, but other useful scenarios that would work would be to inject the root password you want or to disable root login entirely and inject an ssh public key file for a non-root account.",1302833312

2449214,comment,2447256,2449106,12,0,silencio,,,"> Let's see you write as much about having used a ""really nice chopstick""..<p>Even though I think you're splitting hairs (I think the omelette and knife examples work well) I can write about a really nice pair of chopsticks: the ones I'm using right now to eat my pasta for dinner. They're not fancy, I think I bought the 5 (pair) pack for less than $10. But the weight of the metal is just perfect. Not too heavy, not too light... just slightly heavier than a wooden disposable pair of chopsticks. It's a very rounded square shape with small grooves on the tapered end to give you enough purchase to grab pretty much anything while not getting in your way and being difficult to manipulate because of edges or overall slipperiness. There's nothing ornate about this pair, which makes it easy to clean and to pair with random sets of my modernist spoons and forks. Unlike the stereotypical huge plastic pair of chopsticks at Chinese restaurants, the heavy flat metal ones that fatigue my hand at Korean restaurants, and the wooden pair that splinters that comes with my takeout, this is perfect.<p>Okay, so I went there. But I'm not kidding, I really do mean it about these chopsticks.<p>> Make it easier to type on an iPad? I don't think that's going to happen<p>Really, that is the only thing I compare when I'm shopping for an iOS ssh client. Ease of typing all the keys I need in an ssh client makes all the world of difference on a screen as small as an iPhone, while it may not be as big of a deal on iPad. Plus, Prompt works out-of-the-box just fine with my bluetooth keyboard that I've seen, unlike iSSH and some other alternatives, so that's already made the $5 well worth it to me.",1302832969

Two months ago, about 55 of 60 servers actually came up in ORD. Others were inaccesible or hung. Not even hard reboots helped. We had to kill them and start new ones.<p>I've had a total of 2 EC2 instances die on me. I admit my usage of the two providers is quite different. The stuff on EC2 is shorter-lived.

Honestly, I've taught at least 5 developers PHP in about half the time it would normally take using a framework than without. The same applies to any other language.<p>It's easy to write your own framework, but I can almost guarantee you that it will have more bugs than any of the larger, open source frameworks out there. They may have their chinks, but those get largely fixed and tend to benefit the most people. Using a well-known, and well-tested, framework means you have access to a greater pool of developers, and they don't have to learn the idiosyncracies of something you've written because you could.<p>And while I am in the process of writing my own framework (see <a href=""https://github.com/josegonzalez/git-php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/josegonzalez/git-php</a>), I still prefer using someone else's framework. It's nice to be shown other ways of doing things.<p>""If you know LANGUAGE well, it's almost as efficient--possibly moreso--to program your own minimal ARCHITECTURE framework.

Rackspace customers are more likely to be classically architected n-tier web sites/apps and AWS customers are more likely to be fully ""cloud architected"".<p>The result of this difference is that a Rackspace cloud physical host is not going to be as heavily taxed resource-wise (at least on average).  Add to that the cpu burst by default versus cpu cap by default and cpu is definitely the one area where differences will be widest.<p>One thing I will say though, and many may disagree with this, but I have yet to see a benchmarking study that I'd trust. Real world operating performance of a server is just a very complex thing and any attempt to distill it down to single parameter comparison is going to compromise some element of that complexity. I can show you comparison studies that show any of the cloud providers to be better than the others, including AWS, Rackspace, Linode, Joyent, etc. So take these things with a grain of salt.",1302832829
