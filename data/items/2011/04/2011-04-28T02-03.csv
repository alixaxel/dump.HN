They're monitoring accounts accordingly and didn't seem to think canceling was necessary.<p>If the companies really believed the numbers were compromised they will send out new cards automatically. Like I said, it's happened to me before. I didn't have any suspicious activity or anything. But some company I did business with reported a credit card breach so my bank just sent everyone in the breach new cards with little letters telling them ""you got owned, but no worries here's your new card.""",1303959434
2491913,comment,2491624,2491794,1,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"While I agree, the thing that jQuery does, and this was outlined a long while ago in a presentation is that different browsers have different behaviors sometimes for some of the most simple things. Querying is one of those, and the list goes on. Sometimes there are just browser bugs! Frameworks like jq and others ensure a consistent behavior between different browsers.<p>Also note, native browser calls will always be faster. JQ gives you some major power though. It is always best to optimize the big parts of your performance with jq and other frameworks getting the logic correct, then these micro optimizations can be made, including this iterator and your this.checked. However for a general use case, this iterator is exactly what people need as it solves the 70% case.",1303959432

In particular, I think that there are two events that value must survive in order to be demonstrated real:<p>1: End of severe information asymmetries (going from private to public--i.e. an IPO--will typically do this).<p>2: A crisis of confidence.  A crisis of confidence can temporarily depress the market valuation of something with real value, but the fundamental underlying strengths will drive the price will recover as the crisis abates; inflated value will not recover in this manner after a crisis of confidence because the crisis will have served to expose the fundamental underlying weakness.",1303959385

If they can gin up a reason to add a $5 annual charge to every subscriber's bill, that's an extra $500 million to the bottom line.<p>Many customers won't notice a bogus charge like that. A few will silently gripe, figuring it isn't worth their time fighting. A few will complain to AT&T. Nobody will need to go to arbitration to get their $5 back, because AT&T will give it back if they're persistent. Even with maybe ten percent refunds, AT&T will have stolen away $450 million.<p>Class-action lawsuits definitely have been abused in the past and consumers often don't fare that well (whee, coupons) but the ""arbitration"" alternative doesn't give companies any incentive to treat customers fairly.",1303959380

The local database contains timestamps of when your phone downloaded the information. The global database only contains a list of access points and approximate locations of those access points.<p>That way, when your phone sees an access point it can look up in the database (locally or globally) and see if this access point has been pinpointed, if it has it will be another tool for your device to provide you with a proper location.<p>In other words: animating the points in your database will show the first time your phone downloaded information about a specific access point, which will give you a trail of your movements (to a certain extent limited by the factors mentioned above).",1303958514
