2479692,comment,2479399,2479399,8,0,acabal,,,"Sometimes I feel like the only person who doesn't think that data portability is a right.  After all, when you willingly hand over your data to a service, say Facebook, you do so with the assumption that you've read their terms and conditions, which probably don't include data portability in your favor.  You're exchanging your data for a service they provide--social networking--and is it really your RIGHT to force the business to build special software to then transform your data for export at your whim?  Sure, it's icing on the cake if they do so, but I really feel like calling it a ""right"" is somehow demeaning the word.  If you don't want your data stored in Google or FB's servers, just don't use them--just as if you wouldn't use them if you didn't agree with any other part of their TOS.<p>Take my own business, which is a social network for writers.  Imagine someone coming along one day and complaining about their right to export the writing they've posted, and their personal profile, and hey, while we're at it, all of their private messages in a nice XML hierarchy, and why not an annotated list of the critiques they've written, because it's their data dammit!  The cost to develop that kind of system because someone has the idea in their head that it's some kind of new-fangled digital Right-with-a-capital-R would put me behind for months.  Sure I'll delete your data if you leave, but if you don't want my data stored on only my servers, then don't use my site.<p>Edit: This could easily be framed as a consumer-damaging argument.  I suspect that many of the people who support data portability ""rights"" are also the sort of people who support anti-DRM campaigns (which I do too, for the record).  But if you have the right to demand your data back from a company at any time, why shouldn't the company have the right to demand its own data back from YOU--music, books, movies?

They set policy, and sometimes directly tell people what to do - but, more often, they tell people who then tell other people what to do. If a conspiracy is going to involve the top of the chain - and it should be pointed out that the VP is technically not in the chain of command - then it's going to involved dozens, if not hundreds of others if the conspiracy is actually going to do something effective.

2479662,comment,2479174,2479174,4,0,Tangaroa,,,"Tangential to the subject, I recently attended a presentation on educational video games by Keith Devlin of Stanford's H-STAR program. The main point that I came away with was that too many ""educational"" games break the immersive experience of a video game. An example Devlin gave was of an arithmetic game where a math equation was drawn onto a monster, and the player is expected to solve the equation before the monster clubs him. As soon as the player sees the math equation on the monster's belly, he is no longer playing a video game; he is doing a math problem.<p>A couple of counter-examples might be Civilization and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego, where the educational aspects are so well integrated into the game that one might not consider it an educational game unless it were advertised as such.<p>Most games are educational in a way: they teach you something about their in-game universe, and the player has to recognize and learn patterns to win the game. The trick is to make a game where the patterns teach the players what you want them to learn without breaking the immersive experience that makes players want to continue playing a video game.<p>MIT's Vanished looks like it is doing well if it has produced 4,000 forum posts from 5,000 users (actually, the count is up to 37,500; you don't need an account to see the forum, although the comments are still hidden).

I've worked with the big consulting firms, and I've worked with companies who were selling dynamite products.<p>There's so much for me to say it's difficult to limit the scope. Most of this was dead-on.<p>For me, I find the services sector to be a huge weight around my neck. Yes, those in the services sector look longingly at the product guys and get easily seduced over there, but the story is a bit deeper than that: if you're in services, you either scale by adding people, increasing rates, or adding something else to the mix. Running large groups of people may be fine for some guys -- I've never been a fan, at least in the services environment. Quality is always an issue, as is divided loyalties. Prices can only go so high, so you're left with either hiring more folks or selling a product. That's the situation whether your Andersen with a huge workforce or Daniel Markham with his mom-and-pop consulting shop.<p>I know the people running the 50-person shops, the 500-person shops, and larger. It doesn't look like so fun from where I sit. Every person you send out to help somebody is a potential stick of dynamite waiting to go off and ruin your reputation. Clients say they want one thing but actually need something else. Any time you have lots of people, you have lots of headaches: sickness, death, family issues, personality conflicts, life values conflicts, etc. As you grow, either in income or in people -- or worse, in both -- the government gives you more and more hoops to jump through. Meh.<p>So the allure of products is not limited to the big guys -- there are logical reasons why anybody in the services business needs to augment their income.<p>But the core of his thesis is correct -- products are a completely different world. What looks like an easy switch is anything but.",1303678880
