2417987,comment,2415243,2417361,1,0,jnw2,,,"``Lead On!'', by Rear Admiral Dave Oliver, Jr, 1992, claims otherwise on pages 50-51: ``On the day of interest, while operating at a deep depth, the digital-readout depth gauge on this ship stuck at a few feet shallower than the desired depth.  As the submarine was not quite as light as the crew thought, the ship slowly drove itself deeper and deeper.  No one recognized that the two other depth gauges were slowly creeping downward, correctly indicating that the ship was going deeper.''<p>There's a description before this of how 44 psi is 100 feet, and some of the depth gauges showed psi and others feet, and how the standard procedure had been to have the ballast tanks trimmed light, forcing a down angle to maintain depth.<p>The book continues ``We made several changes in submarines as a result of this incident.  For one thing, we don't trim light and run with a down bubble anymore.  If the ship takes a down bubble now, except during transitory conditions when the submarine is changing depth, then something is wrong.''",1302144962

Take SQL standard, relax transactional requirements from ACID to BASE, add functions for searching in columns, add a note that execution of queries with Cartesian product may be extremely slow (with Map Reduce or other parallelization technology. Let the database vendors compete in that field). I recommend book “Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce” by Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer book for further reading on how to implement relational joins with MapReduce.\nDML and DDL will be changed substantially, though.

I think especially for people who just want their database to work, having to worry about which of the storage engines you should be using for MySQL would be a headache.  With Postgres, they focused on one storage engine and making it work as broadly as possible, and I think that is the right way to go about it.  In addition, administration + configuration is really nice, the community and mailing lists are active and helpful, and the performance has been great for our usage.  We also use it heavily for geospacial stuff (using PostGIS), and I think Postgres is ahead of MySQL for that.<p>I'm sure there are places online that do a much better job comparing them, but from my experiences with Postgres I would have no reason not to use it for any relational database needs.",1302143522

Yes, in principle we do known the fine structure constant to something like 9 orders of magnitude both experimentally and theoretically.<p>However, when would you use the pi = 3 approximation? Certainly not when you're in front of a computer, or if you were preparing some experimental results for publication. But, if you're in the lab and need to quickly make some calculations, or just to see if something is feasible and worth spending more time on, pi = 3 isn't so bad.<p>Example, measuring the fine structure. Sure, you can predict where these energy levels are supposed to be to probably whatever our error on knowing the mass of an electron is. And because you know the fine structure so precisely, you should be able to make a very accurate prediction on where that is. However, throw most of those digits out the door, because a lot will be hidden behind doppler broadening.

Sure, free spectral range probably lets you get down to about MHz region or so, but the doppler broadened linewidth is probably an order larger than that. Which brings us back to, you've got these experimental errors, why care about 9 digits of precision if you just want a quick and dirty calculation to get things set up?<p>Anyways, that's all he's trying to say.
