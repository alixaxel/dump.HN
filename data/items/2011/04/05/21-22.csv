2412919,story,,,2,2,bayleo,"Google and the Customer Service Myth",,"I think this deserves its own discussion as it isn't _directly_ related to the Google reorg.<p>As far as I can tell Google never received any complaints on their _customer service_ until the release of the Nexus One. It seems like tech journalists everywhere immediately pounced on Google's poor customer service for the device, despite the hardware being produced by HTC and the network being provided by T-Mobile.  Since then, people seem to have latched onto the zeitgeist and extended the label to Google Apps, Gmail, and even core monetary products like AdWords/AdSense which I would argue do have sufficient customer support.<p>I don't fully understand why we, the generally technocratic crowd on HN, are doing this.  Google, like every company, has finite resources, so the more they focus on customer support, the less focused they become on polishing & innovating. They have a pattern of taking an everyday product (like an email client) and making it so commonsense/easy-to-use that it no longer needs customer support. I assume this is why Gmail was in beta for so long.  It was simply a disclaimer slapped on a fully-developed product that there wasn't going to be reps standing by to take your calls.  It's almost as if they're betting that things like a word processor are becoming so quotidian that the product won't need to be supported; a bet I would not take them up on.<p>I almost expect these sort of criticisms when I'm reading something like _Wired_, but I would think HN would have different priorities when it comes to customer service.  Think about the last time you downloaded a piece of software; did you chose to download the stable version, the beta, or _the nightlies_?  In other words, when given the choice would you choose a technically superior product or one that is better supported?",1302040789

2412904,comment,2411902,2411902,57,0,grellas,,,"The principles listed here are sound and helpful. If you follow them, your writing style will undoubtedly improve.<p>But do not adhere to them as rigid rules or you will suffer in your ability to express yourself. Passive voice exists for a reason. Long words can add variety, rhythm, and color to your prose. Elongated sentences can help give your writing a flow that a mere parade of short sentences can never hope to achieve, not even after a thousand rewrites. Or not. All such items can be misused as well, and the books are replete with bloated forms of expression used by lawyers, politicians, educators, administrators, and the like who would not know a simple word or sentence even if it stood before them doing somersaults. The key is to know sound principles for clear and concise writing and then to apply them with a rhythmic ear for balance in your forms of expression. That means, yes, use passive voice, long words, and flowing sentences as needed to add grace to your prose but always with the baseline in mind: that is, to communicate in ways that are clear and concise and that people will readily understand for your stated purpose (formal style for formal settings, casual for casual, and whatever fits for anything in between).<p>I note all this because, years ago, I consciously and diligently set about to attempt to master writing and stumbled upon the rock of ""simplicity"" during such stretches in my learning process where I had assumed that <i>all</i> one could do was follow such rules. Any attempt to apply such rules one-dimensionally is a mistake, and you will regret trying it. Follow sound principles, by all means, but not dogmatically.<p>The other major keys to good writing are depth of language skills and extensive reading. No one will read your work unless you have something helpful to say. You get this by working hard to develop your skills, and lots of writing (and reading) is vital to this process.",1302040519

I've never been able to make much use of OpenCourseware because it doesn't fit my learning style. Don't get me wrong, I'm not holding anything against Khan academy. But it's quite impressive that it will eventually cover all the material in university that I had to pay to learn.<p>There is a huge collision that's about to happen: increasing costs for post-secondary education; a middle class that will no longer be able to afford said post-secondary education for their kids; and free, quality, ubiquitous educational content like Khan academy. I'm not quite sure how things will play out.

Most schools here (private ones included) give rather significant scholarships. You don't even need to apply for most cases: they just base it off your SATs and essay, and they usually give more if you go tell them about your circumstances.<p>I was actually one of the first ones in my country to get approved for such a large amount ($60K+ for five years (bachelors+masters)), and it helped that my dad was an employee of that bank. However, it was a really long process and many people were very dubious. My dad actually had to go all the way up to the CEO of the bank in order to get the approval, and those people were constantly behind my parents all this time checking up on my progress. Needless to say, it is <i>very</i> important that you not slip up.<p>But this was five years ago, and I've heard from my parents that a lot more students are been approved now after the banks saw its not that big of a risk. All in all, be prepared for a lot of bureaucratic hassle.<p>My recommendation, in retrospect, is that it is not generally worth it. You can learn more from the classroom videos MIT and Stanford have put up, and if you participate in open source projects, you can pick up the programming idioms and practices fairly well. Take advantage of what the internet has to offer. Most companies, atleast from what I've seen on HN, value your github commit log more than your degree as it says more about what your interests are.",1302040126

2412841,comment,2412559,2412559,1,0,chuhnk,,,"What is your definition of an app server? A aws ec2 instance? I think understanding the throughput of a rails application is very simple. Rails is not thread safe so to concurrently serve 10 requests you must be running 10 processes. Thats not to say you will serve 10 reqs/sec, it depends on how quickly the application responds.<p>The key is knowing where the bottlenecks lie and what gives you the greatest gains for the least amount of optimizations.<p>Run unicorn for your rails apps. It runs in a master/worker setup in which the master distributes the requests to workers. Benchmarks have shown it to be much faster than competitors. In saying that you may want to look into phusion passenger lite 3.0. I have not seen any clear benchmarks against unicorn so I cannot give a definitive answer but have heard good things.<p>Make sure static content is not being proxied through to your rails apps. You'll be wasting request processing on js,css,jpeg and gif in rails where it could be done by apache, lighttpd, nginx or even varnish if you'll levelled in some caching. A bigger advantage to that is to serve the static content from a second domain from a different web server so that parallel connections are made to retrieve that content.<p>Enable caching in rails so that classes, views, etc are in memory. It'll help to not have to reload a class or view every time a request is made.<p>Look to find the most efficient templating engine for rails. Erb was 3 times slower than erubis last time I checked.<p>Are you IO or cpu bound? Run top and vmstat. If you are IO bound then cpu utilization will be lower and its most likely wait on the db. This could be for any number of reasons. Rails is notorious for selecting everything. Limit your queries, select on fields that are required. Index columns that are used in your where clauses and on join fields. If your entire dataset does not fit into the buffer pool then your mysql might be hitting disk which is orders of magnitude slower than ram.<p>Set noatime on all your servers so that file access times are not updated, huge performance differences. Can be done on your database server too.<p>I hope some of that helps.",1302039304

2412744,comment,2412577,2412577,2,0,chapel,,,"There are a lot of reasons why app sales on Android aren't as stellar as on iOS, but I feel many people see it as a failure of Android as an OS. This is wrong, because as an OS, Android has been a complete success, and shown that giving people options is a good thing.<p>The main reason Android app sales suffer so much is really two fold, the Google App Marketplace isn't as well crafted as the Apple App Store. It is much better than it used to be, but is missing things that give rise to huge sales. The other issue I believe lies with who is actually using Android phones. If you take a look at iOS versus Android, you have to take into account that most people that buy one or the other tend to stick with their said choice. With that in mind, that means with iOS capturing a large if not majority stake in the more advanced user base, ones that don't mind spending money on apps, means apps on iOS are purchased more often. Android on the other hand has a similarly devoted crowd, but it would seem the majority of Android users are actually feature phone converts. These people aren't as likely to spend money on apps, add to that the App Marketplace not being as good as it could be, you are left with users that don't purchase apps much or at all.<p>I think time will change this, but it definitely is something to consider when developing for each platform. I doubt iOS will continue to pay out in spades like it has previously, as more and more apps flood the App Store, it will just be harder to compete with incumbents as they will have a foothold on their particular app's functionality.",1302037692

Some were less functional (ie arcane data structures), others were basics of programming that anyone should know like the back of their hand (pointers, data manipulation etc).<p>2) When self-teaching, you tend to pull together bite size chunks of important info necessary to solve a particular problem rather than building a solid foundation. If you're completely self taught, you'll miss 101 level theory points that may help you later when tackling a known problem that has a solution or is nearly impossible. That said, in self teaching myself, I've cobbled together quite a bag of tricks as well as the resourcefulness to pull up any info I need to solve a problem and absorb it quickly. I've yet to meet a problem I couldn't tackle just because I wasnt a ""CS Educated Programmer"".<p>Through the course though, the biggest takeaway for a non quant type like me was breaking problems down into discrete parts solved and tested by logic loops (read: thinking like a computer). The basic structures and solutions to problems involved I still use today when I program for the web.",1302037546

2412716,comment,2412331,2412671,1,0,ktsmith,,,"Some people might be able to figure this out before applying but most probably wouldn't as a lot of that type of information isn't publicly available. More importantly, if I can figure out what compensation (equity/salary), travel, work, etc that I can expect from an employer then what in the world do I need hustlebee for? If I've determined all of those things I've probably been in contact with the company already and would be best served by applying directly rather than having some percentage of my potential compensation funneled off to a recruiter.<p>I'm also confused as to how this will ""get an employer's attention without having to do the recruiting dance."" This is pretty much exactly what it's like working with any recruiter. You submit your information to the recruiter, the recruiter contacts companies for you or tells you want available jobs there are and then contacts those you are interested in. From the employers side you have relationships with recruiters who send you over resumes and CV's that are supposedly filtered by relevance and qualifications.<p>Could you clarify why you feel you offer some benefit over other recruiters to both those looking for work and those looking for employees? So far it seems like you are collecting less information and not doing a skills match which is less than most recruiters I've gotten applicants from have done. For the employee you are saying that you just send on the application. Where is the added value outside of the ""I'll accept an offer if I get one"" checkbox?",1302037468

But those jobs aren't worth anything like a minimum wage to the employers, so if they weren't unpaid, the jobs simply wouldn't exist. For people looking to get a job in the industry after graduation, their best shot is to get an internship in college, do a great job and meet lots of people, and parlay that into an offer.
