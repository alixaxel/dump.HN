2453037,story,,,11,13,leslieMichaels,"Ask HN: I have a startup idea! What do I do next?",,"Hi hackers,<p>I'm sort of in a pickle, and I'd like your advice. My mind is bubbling and overflowing with this great idea for a startup, but I don't know how to proceed. Here's a list of some things I have to sort out:<p>a) I started working less than a year ago. This is my first job out of college, so I'm hesitant to just up and leave. Not to mention I have very little business and corporate experience.<p>b) I have a CS background, but I only took one web design course in college and found it very difficult in a completely different way from CS.<p>c) I don't have friends who are software engineers <i>and</i> interested in doing a startup. My closest friends, with whom I actually want to work on this, are all liberal arts majors and on the other side of the country. I could find some random people, but I doubt I have enough experience to lead a team. (Also I'm an extremely indecisive person, which is terrible for that sort of role).<p>d) I am like the opposite of what VC's look for in a startup founder. I don't sacrifice my well-being (sleep, meals) for anything. I've never pulled an all-nighter (on the other hand, I've never had to because I don't procrastinate). I cycle through my projects and interests every few weeks or months as I get bored with one or really obsessed with another. In short, I like to dabble. But I'd really like to be the other kind of person. :D Help?<p>e) I could work on this project on the side in addition to my job (what I'm sort of doing right now), but if it turns into anything, it would technically belong to my company. Does anyone have legal advice on that front? Like at what point should I definitely leave or risk getting sued, etc.<p>f) I could present this idea to the relevant departments at my company (it's pretty related to what they do), but they move...so...slowly and have their own priorities. I might get really frustrated seeing the whole idea get mangled by bureaucracy and company-focused priorities (e.g. emphasis on company reputation rather than user experience, etc). I accept that, if I'm going to work on this with anyone else, I will have to compromise and negotiate some of the original ideas; but change for the good of the product is acceptable, whereas change for the good of the company could be detrimental to the product. (Btw, I'm totally painting a bad picture of my company, but overall it's really awesome. In fact I don't know of a better place to work... except maybe a startup).<p>So that's my situation, more or less. I feel justified posting it here because I think it's pretty typical of aspiring startup founders or people who visit this site because it's awesome. Thanks in advance for your input.",1302922664

Experienced C programmers feel much more comfortable using UNIX/gdb.<p>That comment is insulting, impossibly overgeneralized, and counterfactual, all in one. Heck, I'd be hard-pressed not to put a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger before trying to work with gdb and anything multithreaded, and for anything more than doing an autopsy on a core dump gdb is still user-hostile and obnoxious. Visual Studio is _so_ much less of a hassle than trying to pore over obfuscatory gdb backtraces.<p>I pay for a personal license for Visual Studio because it lets me get my work done without wasting my time.

From what I understand, major/towered airports often have crews working the ground at night (due to the low traffic), towing planes, etc, and communicating with the tower over their own frequencies. Not expecting an unmanned tower themselves, they could easily try to ""wing it"" as best as they could to get their job done.<p>Sure pilots can avoid each other on the normal control frequencies, but the situation on the ground could be unexpectedly dangerous to ground crew/vehicles, especially in a night landing.",1302920235

That's like asking why a corporation's value is tied up in its stock. A poker player's account balance <i>is</i> his livelihood.<p>You can sit at some tables with $100K. It's very easy to 4-table. Moreover, it's very easy to have a 10-buy-in swing. This means that at a bare minimum, a legitimate player has at least 15 buy-ins on any given site, and he damned well better have another 15-25 somewhere else (cash, other sites, etc.) if he doesn't want to risk blowing his entire bankroll (going ""busto"").<p>The players with these kinds of balances are part of a very tight-knit community that is largely centered around 2+2. FullTilt and PokerStars both have representatives that post there. It is basically to the poker world what Hacker News is to the tech world. If even one player's money was seized for an undisclosed reason, the major sites (which make money hand-over-fist daily from rake) would lose a lot of faith, and their entire business model centers on their customers' good faith.<p>There were a few people cheating before on UltimateBet and AbsolutePoker. Thanks to the aforementioned community reconciling various players' hand databases (each hand can be logged), they were caught and both of those sites lost a ton of business.",1302920192

I think your comments about aligning motivations is universal, and applies regardless of whether or not a services is sourced.  My position is the illusion of ""control"" by assigning tasks to full time employees is almost never worthwhile in light of the enormous costs and risks of putting someone on your payroll.  When a disaster strikes and you're caught empty-handed, you'll either be firing an employee, or firing a vendor.

The higher your stakes, the higher your hourly rate.<p>Where do you keep your cash? If your business deals in dollars and cents, you probably keep it in a bank account. Your clients pay you, making its way into your account, and you pay bills out of that account.<p>Poker players do all their business with their poker accounts. Rakeback sites deposit directly into the accounts, player transfers are often used to facilitate real-world transactions between friends, and things like concierge service can even be provided by the poker sites themselves.<p>For a poker player, their online accounts are both their cash and their capital. There's really no way around having a large amount of money tied up on these sites if you're a high stakes player.<p>And it's not irrational. These sites make so much money in rake every day that it would never make sense for them to run off with everyone's money. At least not until the government steps in, seizes their cash, and threatens their business model when it's not even clear that the act of hosting poker games is against the law.",1302919565
