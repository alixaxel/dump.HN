It's not an agency of the police (or part of the govt at all), so the exception to child-porn laws that permits police to view such photographs in the course of an investigation doesn't apply. Thus, if the law were to be applied as written, it should be strictly illegal for IWF employees to have accessed many of the sites on its blocklist. So either they haven't done so, and their blocklist is of questionable accuracy; or they have done so, and thereby committed a crime.<p>Fortunately for them, the government supports the IWF and has no interest in prosecuting them.",1303048732

2456090,comment,2454725,2454725,1,0,midnightmonster,,,"Really excited about Dungeon Adventure. Going to have to sort out how to make it run well with multiple children controlling the heroes. Mostly, how not to be biased in dealing out monster attacks to the heroes. Possible monster 'strategy': attack whoever just attacked you. If you weren't attacked, attack whoever dealt the most damage to your monster buddies in the last roll. For when the monsters have initiative, make the order of the heroes walking through the dungeon significant--whoever's in the lead gets attacked first, giving them the opportunity to collectively decide to put the healthiest guy in the front, or let one person keep the protection ring in exchange for always taking the lead, or put the weakest in front to watch him die (or trade him out for a new hero) or whatever.",1303046546

In my personal experience, this is an iron-clad rule.  If I read ""before"" bed, even if the material is fairly dry, my brain kicks into gear, and all sleepiness disappears unless I'm seriously deprived at the time.  And I don't generally have much sense of time passing when I'm absorbed, so I've had many experiences of slowly realizing that the room's appearance has changed (and there are new noises) because the sun is up, and the birds are going nuts outside my window.  And the 2-hour drive I have to make that day (or whatever it may be) is going to be painful.",1303046529

There is little distinction between an idea and a vision. A vision is just a fully fleshed-out idea; a collection of ideas: some inspirational, but many technical, economic or sociological.<p>I understand why the meme gained traction: too many people put everything into just one inspirational idea and never put enough effort into the execution of this idea -- the community wants to distinguish themselves as superior to these people so we attempt to tell them off and posture about execution in order to prove to everybody else here that we 'get things done'. But is talking about it really the way of proving that? Are we taking this concept too far merely because we want acceptance in the community?<p>All you need is to have a good idea, some supporting ideas about how to turn it into a business and to put a lot of effort into its execution. The rest of the article about a vision went into what was needed but not having ideas is not the way of going about this. You want to have some disruptive ideas as part of your execution.",1303046474

With the caveat that all business models are pie in the pixel sky until they aren't, the idea we've been building toward is this:<p>Membership is free. A number of themes are free. Other themes are not free, and are $5 (or less) each. (Tumblr does themes this way and we like it.) You can use any theme you buy for as many of your events as you like.<p>We are not clear if people will simply buy each theme as they want it or will buy credits to spent on themes ala iStock and Envato marketplaces. The credits model seems to have a lot of advantages. With credits, you could also <i>gift</i> the themes to friends for occasions, which is nice.<p>We will likely also have a premium membership model that lets you upload video, create slideshows instead of having a static main image per event, and gives you archival cloud storage of your original uploads.
