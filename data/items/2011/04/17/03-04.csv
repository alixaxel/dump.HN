2455521,comment,2453988,2455426,3,0,nerfhammer,,,"Deflation is almost invariably a sign of economic distress. This can easily be observed historically.<p>By the way the term I think you mean is ""quantity demanded"" with respect to price, ""demand"" is invariant to price.<p>Under deflation average income decreases. It's not like everyone is suddenly richer. Your employer gets less money, and so has to pay you less, or lay off a portion of their workforce. The price of labor is a price like any other.<p>Assuming a fixed money supply, hoarding currency will cause  deflation. Hoarding currency takes money out of the money supply. Saving by making investments is different; the money is still participating in the economy. Deflation discourages investment in useful activity. If you can earn a 5% rate of return just for already having money, why bother with a investment could return 5% or less?",1303012667

2455512,comment,2454348,2454882,1,0,Aqua_Geek,,,"> They're not trying to make development harder but they're not trying to make it easier either.<p>Agreed. There are so many things that can and <i>should</i> be improved upon. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for iOS 5.<p>> They won't put the effort into fixing developer pain points if the only practical outcome will be more mediocre apps.<p>I think you're being a little too cynical. I prefer to give Apple the benefit of the doubt. After the whole Xcode 4 mess, I get the feeling that there's some disconnect between how Apple uses the tools and how the community at large does - a gap I hope Apple works to eliminate.<p>> At the same time, the marketing dept. is milking their leading app count for all it's worth, so they won't be doing a purge.<p>Yeah - totally agree. They'll never do a <i>direct</i> purge (ie ""Hey, your app isn't selling, so we killed it""), but I'm holding out hope of my other suggestion of their using a price schedule to ""encourage"" developers of low-sellings apps to pull them themselves.<p>> Rather, I think they will work on more ways for the cream to float to the top, like the ""genius"" feature of the app store<p>It's a hard problem to fix, and I imagine we'll see some good breakthroughs in this area in the next year or so. I'm genuinely curious, though, about how your experience with the ""genius"" feature has been. To me it seems to just recommend random apps from similar categories; most of the time, I walk away thinking, ""No, I already bought an app to deal with [x/y/z] - I don't <i>need</i> a second."" Given the amount of info Apple has on me (app, music, and movie/TV show purchase histories, age bracket, metro area, etc, etc), I'm surprised that their recommendations are not better.<p>> and on raising the quality bar with their own apps like Garage Band and iMovie.<p>I think they've definitely succeeded with this one. After seeing apps like that, it really makes you want to push the boundaries and really up the quality of your apps.",1303012217

He's talking with the snide condescension of one of the world's top researchers in the field. Or, rather, he's not putting effort into communicating to people who don't have some background in PL theory and some familiarity with many of these arguments.<p>Professor Harper typically spends two lectures in his undergraduate PL class developing the idea of dynamic typing, and then demolishing it.

And don't have other interesting offers. Furthermore, Chris Dixon's quote wasn't (as far as I can tell) talking about recruiting interns, but recruiting employees and that's an entirely different ballgame in my opinion. These companies don't have money to offer employees or interns, but they will offer equity  to employees. What's the chance a company will offer any form of equity to interns? So you're suggesting that rather than ""immediate compensation"", their compensation is that they have a couple months experience at a successful company? That's much less compelling than what employees are getting (a much greater experience and some equity).<p>Not every company needs interns, and if you can't afford to pay them, maybe you don't need them quite yet.
