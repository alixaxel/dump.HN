Go to your phone's backup folder.  On this Mac, it's ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/[big random string here]<p>Once you're in that directory, grep for the file that contains the sqlite database by looking for a text string used only in it: 'grep appLaunchCount *' works.  You'll get one result.  Pop that baby open with a sqlite editor - I use MesaSQLite, myself, but it doesn't matter which.<p>In the database's Scalars table, you'll see three columns - key, daysSince1970, and value.  For each day in the last couple of weeks, and for each app you've used, there will be the following keys:<p>-- appActivationCount.com.[app name here]<p>-- appActiveTime.com.[app name here]<p>-- appBackgroundActiveTime.com.[app name here]<p>-- appLaunchCount.com.[app name here]<p>The values are the number of times the app was launched & activated that day, and how long the app was active in seconds.  Not 100% sure on the difference between appActiveTime and appBackgroundActiveTime - perhaps the latter involves the app actively doing something while in the background?<p>There's a bunch of other data in that file as well, but that's the stuff relating to frequency and length of app usage.",1301716777

It's what the movie studios and theaters have been banking on to compete with the quality of home theater setups, not an increase in 2D image quality. Caring about the unique look of film compared to digital while trying to increase the quality is why directors like Christopher Nolan like the IMAX format, but shooting with 70mm film is not only expensive but unwieldy because the cameras are huge. Sort of like what bulky 3D cameras were like before James Cameron forced the invention of a new one for Avatar.",1301716327

Clearly, there's a lot of ""information"" missing from a black-and-white film. But filmmakers still use it when they want that feel. Same with the way CSI colors everything blue. Sure, it loses a lot of color info and distorts the gamut etc. but it has a particular feel <i>because</i> of that. So, sometimes (maybe even most of the time) you want a smoother picture with more motion information. But sometimes you want something that feels choppier. Example: <a href=""http://revision3.com/filmriot/warfilm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://revision3.com/filmriot/warfilm</a> There's a short film at the beginning that demonstrates the techniques they're talking about, with commentary starting about 5:00 in.

In written or printed mathematics, the expression −32 is interpreted to mean −(32) = −9, but in some applications and programming languages, notably the application Microsoft Office Excel and the programming language bc, unary operators have a higher priority than binary operators, that is, the unary minus (negation) has higher precedence than exponentiation, so in those languages −32 will be interpreted as (−3)2 = 9.

This is a good point; many skilled engineers target Windows and .NET with great success. In that case, having a Windows development environment makes sense.<p>However, it sounds like the organization in question was not deploying to Windows - from the article:<p><i>...it seemed to me that most of your development happens on Windows (though it’s almost needless to say that you deploy to Linux)</i><p>I won't judge you for using Windows over Unix (even though I prefer Unix), but I will judge the choice of using Windows for development when you are targeting Unix. I have had this experience, and it was a Management decision - <i>not</i> an Engineering decision, and it resulted in significantly less productive work environment. Given two opportunities that are otherwise equal, I would definitely choose the company that develops on the same platform that they deploy on (assuming we're talking about Unix or Windows - there are obvious exceptions in the embedded world).<p>One caveat: It is common for an organization to use <i>both</i> Windows and Linux for different tasks. In that case, the choice of development environment is more complicated.<p>Either way, I'd say that the candidate should have asked up front during the interview, ""Why are you using Windows for development, and could I use Mac/Linux instead?"", instead of judging them based on what seems like a lack of information.

If not, the bribe-expecting government workers will keep you waiting till you are ready to hand over the bribe. I didn't realize it was illegal to give a bribe in India, so I guess I can't even admit to having done that - which is ridiculous!<p>When I needed to get a document in India (in a more rural area), the young government official, who I assumed was above all this corruption, kept telling me to come later (when there were fewer people around) and had me go to a nearby Xerox shop to get copies of a document. While I was going there, the official called the guy at the Xerox shop and told him to tell me how the process works. Suffice to say that I gave something and apparently that wasn't enough, so I had my mom visit him the next day and he made a comment that I hadn't given enough. My mom just smiled, picked up the certificate (which was in front of him) and left.<p>On the other hand, reporting an official is still a bit scary knowing that him or his partners-in-crime can <i>accidentally</i> mess up any of the other official documents and since most of the documents are still on paper and not digitized, it could throw you down into a deeper hole. Unless a massive campaign against corruption is introduced, I dont see this problem going away anytime soon.",1301714176

If you play your cards right you will make them up manyfold. Neither does their loss cause immediate exposure to competitors. Early-adopters who left apple, or reddit, or google usually scattered to the winds, spreading out over lots of competing services.<p>Peter Drucker said the goal of a company is to create a customer.
