2464715,comment,2462642,2462642,1,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The central problem is lack of incentives, or misaligned incentives. It has relatively little to do with the character of the developers. Developers are generally not stupid. Many of them could learn to be better designers, and they could certainly learn to <i>consult</i> with better designers. But why should they?<p>If software is sold based on a checklist of features then it is more important to build ten ugly features than one beautiful one. If software is sold based on beautiful demos then it pays to make the demo awesome but skimp on the corner cases. If software is sold based on gorgeous screenshots and icons then the median icon or screenshot will be gorgeous, even if the app itself is missing or broken. (Even the broken iOS apps have beautiful, beautiful icons.)<p>If your company has so many layers of management that the feedback from end users never makes it back to your desk, you'll generate designs that please your management.<p>If you're at a bootstrapped startup, searching for product-market fit, it pays to design incrementally. Even if incremental design is the wrong approach for the problem, it still pays to design incrementally, because a better-designed app with no market is a disaster. That means that there are many theoretically possible designs that are difficult or impossible to achieve in practice.<p>The trick to improving the design of software is to figure out how to make it pay. A major enemy is the rate at which the landscape changes. Computing still changes so quickly that there's a premium on disposablility. The jury-rigged contraption built of metaphorical duct tape may be barely usable, but it's cheap and quick to build, and in a year nobody will care: They'll have traded it in for the next model, or the platform will be obsolete and everyone will have to move, or <i>you</i> will switch jobs (perhaps by selling the product to Cisco) and you won't care anymore.",1303257316

2464706,comment,2459884,2460693,2,0,lsc,,,"oh yeah.  I completely didn't write about the problems with oil immersion.  Well, I'm far from an expert on the matter, but the idea does come up from time to time, usually with some home built thing or another. Now, 'water cooling' comes up more often than full-on oil immersion, but usually you talk about using non-conductive coolant, so 'water cooling' in the worst case is oil immersion.   I mean, you will occasionally have leaks.<p>The primary perceived problem with cooling with a liquid is that leaks suddenly become a really big deal.   That's what'd scare me as an operator.  what happens if there's a leak?   I mean, air cooling systems usually have enough redundancy that even  big holes in air pipes aren't going to overheat anything, at least at the nicer data centers, and the chiller fluid is far enough away from the servers that in the case of a leak the worst case is that the data center smells like mold for a while.  (yeah, I've worked in some smelly data centers.  no fun.  But it wasn't a threat to our servers.  the A/C was redundant, and there were drains.)<p>There are other problems, I think, with how the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of oil differ from the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of air,  but really I know so little about that subject that I can't speak intelligibly about the problem.<p>Also, those racks look big, like they hold a bunch of smaller servers.  what happens when I've got a hardware problem with one server and I've got to pull it out?  do the remaining servers run okay?  how do I work on the dead hardware?  can I set it up on a test bench?  will the dust in the room get in and clog up the works?  will I need to test it in some smaller tank of coolant?<p>Then, after that, you have the same problem as any new and unique system.  Standard parts.   We weren't born yesterday, we've all seen (and most of us have been burnt by) blades, and we all know that if you put yourself in a situation where you can only buy parts from one vendor, you get fucked.  So once you solve the problems of oil immersion, you then need to standardize the set up.<p>But yeah, like I said, I'm no expert at oil immersion, so some of these may be wrong.  However, these are the sorts of things operators worry about when the subject comes up.<p>Also, the idea of using standard coolant in and coolant out plugs on every server, you know, water cooling style, so every server would need water blocks on every hot part rather than just submerging the damn thing is far more common.",1303257001

In essence, yes, bit.ly is storing the entire document on their servers anytime anyone shortens a hashify.me link.<p>Think if it like the difference between the postal service letting you know there is a package that you can go pick up at the post office, and the postal service giving you a package at your home or work that cannot be opened until you go to the store to buy a box cutter, but you have to bring the package with you.<p>The first example is cheap, since you only receive a pointer or link to where the package is, but you have to do all the work to get it. The second is not cheap, since if the package was a bed from Ikea (for a random large example), the postal service (bit.ly) has to deliver the package to you, and then you have to go somewhere (hashify.me) while carrying that package in order to see what's inside.",1303256906

The only way to improve yourself is through learning, which is done outside of the comfort zone. When you get scared or uncomfortable, your Ego works to push you back into that comfort zone. By countering that force, trying things you're not sure of, you learn. In the longer run, you expand your comfort zone, and become capable of more.<p>This of course doesn't mean ignore fear, but analyze the risks you will take, decide what are acceptable risks that still make you comfortable, and then wholly commit to a path of action outside of your familiar comfort zone.",1303254019
