2461406,comment,2460499,2460499,1,0,aba_sababa,,,"I'm not sure that commoditization is a bad thing. I'd argue that education hasn't been commoditized enough. Imagine if all universities started running themselves like honest-to-god businesses by pleasing the consumer and creating great products. There would be competition, prices would go down, and the quality of the product would go up. Unfortunately, higher education is one product that paradoxically doesn't need to please its users.",1303178048

2461404,comment,2460499,2460499,1,0,fecklessyouth,,,"After reading HN comments, I've come to the conclusion that, education bubble aside, you all went to really shitty schools. I can tell because of the emphasis on the degree and technical skills, one of which is useless and the other of which can be gained from other sources. I've learned very few technical, ""useful"" skills in my schoolwork, outside of external clubs/networking/training I've done through my school. And I would have dropped out first semester if my education's biggest reward was a diploma--my school is basically unknown outside my state.<p>By these criteria, my education sucks. But it's been the best decision I ever made. I think that in these reoccurring debates, HN is overlooking a broad, challenging, great books-based liberal arts education like the one I'm in. By refusing to teach ""technical"" skills that are better learned on the job anyway, and instead actually building the strength of the mind, for the sole sake of, as John Newman said, the sake of it, liberal arts places itself in the unique position of external to  current industry trends. They'll teach you to learn, and leave the technical training to you once you graduate.",1303177987
2461403,comment,2461067,2461373,6,0,artmageddon,,,"Private pilot here(I don't fly jets but I've have been trained in instrument flight rules so I can talk about the chart). It simply depends on how well the various approach plates(i.e. the diagram shown) or other things are shown on the map, and if multi-touch zoom is supported.<p>If they are, then this would be awesome. It would beat the crap out of having to flip through a book to try to find that one specific approach plate. Typing a few alphanumerics and having all the frequencies show up is so much nicer than flipping through Airport Facility/Directories.<p>In addition, you can look at plates or airplane sectionals and see that there are a number of items printed in small type and multiple colors that pilots have to contend with. If you want an example, try <a href=""http://skyvector.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skyvector.com</a> . Someone with flight knowledge can tell you what each of the symbols and colors represent, but that's exactly what we deal with up there(even single-propeller folk like me).<p>I highly doubt the iPad will be much of a hindrance to that. What I fear the most is:<p>1) Pilots who rely solely on an iPad[1] and forget to charge it, leaving them without the information needed when the battery goes(assuming they also don't have an alternate power source to charge the iPad).<p>2). The brightness(adjustable, of course) interfering with night vision. Lit items(instrument panel) are kept to a minimum in the flight deck because of the constant need to be able to keep a watch on other airplanes. Of course, pilots <i>do</i> need to turn on a light to read the plates when it comes time to land, but wise pilots will carry a soft light for reading the plates. Not sure how the iPad light affects it.<p>If I owned an iPad, I would definitely be interested in this app.<p>[1] Pilots who do this, without having any alternative source available in the flight deck are heavily frowned upon.",1303177878

As a non-technical co-founder, you really need to learn some code and it really isn't that hard to get started!  I also like how you don't trivialize coding, though, as you can get in over your head pretty quickly and need to pass things off to a ""real engineer"".

There are a lot of skills that can be learned via self-study if one is willing to go beyond books, but the problem is one of certification.<p>Living in Beijing, I regularly meet people studying Chinese on their own as well as those with 4 year degrees in Chinese, often from prestigious schools.  Most of the best speakers I've known have been hobbyists who are interested, rather than people who simply followed an academic track at an institution.  However, with no certification, it's a bit tough for some fully bilingual self-taught people to get the nice translation jobs.  I won't name any names, but I've seen some high profile work done very poorly by a PHD who had credentials to get it.<p>Other than foreign languages, writing in one's own tongue is also not largely linked to an expensive 4 year university.  Neither are business, popular music or theater.   I would also say that math is largely vulnerable to self-study.  I've made considerable progress in the visual arts just from my own efforts and youtube.<p>Other than extremely expensive research sciences what else requires a university to learn effectively?",1303177793
2461400,comment,2457478,2457478,2,0,jdietrich,,,"A basic principle of bicycle framebuilding is that if you think you understand bicycle dynamics, you don't. Frame geometries that should ride perfectly develop terrifying handling problems in the metal. Frame designs that are unridable in theory turn out to be relatively practical - perhaps the oddest example of this is the Python recumbent, which steers in the middle, drives at the front and has no handlebars[1]. Bicycles that are self-stable and balance on their own aren't necessarily good to ride and vice versa.<p>Making sense of bicycle dynamics is particularly bewildering because they are such a natural and direct extension of the rider. Learning to ride a bicycle is a completely subconscious process and what your body is doing runs counter to what your brain thinks is happening. Most people who ride bicycles believe that they steer in the direction of a turn, when in fact the opposite is the case. A child who learns to ride a bicycle with training wheels actually takes longer to learn to ride on two wheels because of this - they have to unlearn steering before they can learn to countersteer.<p>Bicycles are <i>weird</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.python-lowracer.de/geometry.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python-lowracer.de/geometry.html</a>",1303177788
2461399,comment,2460445,2460958,1,0,sukuriant,,,"It's not the finger-sized icons that are the issue. What makes it very similar to the iPhone are:\n* the general smooth, rectangular shape of the phone, including a large, center button below the screen<p>* a color-coded section of four buttons at the bottom of the screen that take up the whole space and include ""phone"", icon on the left-most side.<p>* a speaker in a thin-rectangular shape above the screen.<p>There are a great number of small differences between them, but they are very, very similar.

To be totally honest with you though, iTerm1/2 over Terminal.app hasn't really been that big of a change, I mostly like the improved key-settings and the theming. What motivated that change was that I was having a lot of trouble with getting the modifier keys do what I wanted, as strange as that sounds. Changing to iTerm just fixed it, and I liked what I saw, so there never was any reason for me to go back and figure out what I did wrong.<p>The biggest change by far for me was going from TextMate to MacVim/vim, which has boosted my programming speed immensely (after the usual month of pure frustration and all development grinding to a near halt).",1303177650
