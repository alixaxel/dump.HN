Is it based on some cutoff beyond which extinction is assured?  Or is it linear?Does maximizing the number of species on the planet really trump all concerns of suffering?<p>If so, this logic would also somewhat weaken the value of the life of a dog (300 million) in comparison to that of a cat (200 million)?  And what about the value of your life or mine?  There are 6 billion of our species.<p>Personally, I find it very hard to justify both eating animal flesh and outrage at animal killing.

By keeping the products within a company, you enable much greater levels of collaboration than if they were separated. For example, Google can share private APIs between Gmail and Buzz, however, if they were separate companies, all shared APIs would be legally required to be publicly documented - even if the companies were buddy-buddy. It is also much safer from a disclosure perspective when you want to coordinate projects to minimize the time delay between the release of products that integrate with each other.<p>Sure, there is overhead introduced, but that is exactly why companies like Google hire PMs. Their job is to manage the coordination and minimize the overhead so that developers can actually write code.",1301632960

He then says because of this it would take ""more than three days"" to get from where he is, Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, to northern Scotland. The furthest point he could go to is the John O' Groats campground in Wick. Google Maps reveals that is 704 miles or 12 hrs and 45 minutes of travel.<p>So let's compare whether he is claiming the 55 mile range or the 211 mile range is the one he accepts for non-track driving.<p>211 miles on the various roads would take at least 4 hrs, then 16 hours to recharge.<p>Start: 0 hrs<p>Drive to 211 mile pt: +4 hrs<p>Recharge: +16 hrs = 20 hrs elapsed<p>Drive to 422 mile pt: +4 hrs = 24 hrs elapsed<p>Recharge: +16 hrs = 40 hrs elapsed<p>Drive to 633 mile pt: +4 hrs = 44 hrs elapsed<p>Recharge: +16 hrs = 60 hrs elapsed<p>Drive to 704 mile pt: +1.5 hrs = 61 hrs elapsed<p>So that is about 2.5 days, less than the more than 3 days he claims.<p>At 55 mile range though it would be substantially longer than 3 days though. That would be about 17 hours per 55 mile leg, 12 legs at 17 hrs, 204 hours or 8.5 days.<p>So Clarkson, through his claim of more than 3 days to travel to the north of Scotland, is suggesting the range is more than 55 but less than 211 miles.",1301632212
