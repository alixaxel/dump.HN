He doesn't think he has money, but that's because he spends it. If he could afford those things, so can other people in his bracket.<p>If he saved all of his money he might complain about his poor lifestyle, but for some reason he doesn't seem to realize that they're all choices.

2468903,comment,2466290,2467354,11,0,Dn_Ab,,,"In functional languages we have the modern motivations in two parts. Well one really, but one of the sub parts is so big it deserves a section of its own.<p>Contributions to AI in the form of automated mathematicians is a descendant of Axiomated Set Theory and the desire to automate mathematics in the form of rigorous mechanical proofs. From Robin Milner we have the invention of ML whose actual purpose was as a scripting language to aid in the creation of Automated Proofs [1]! We also have contributions from AutoMath [2] which had a lot of modern cutting edge techniques such as dependent types in the late 1960s. All in all the original goal of automatic mathematics and reasoning  proved impractical but the tools needed for their development have proven anything but.<p>Then there is Lisp. Lisp offered to both functional and object oriented techniques. Lisp was inspired by the lambda calculus which was also an offshoot of the whole mechanize maths movement. It was invented by John McCarthy - whose interest was in the old AI notion of symbolic computing - as a turing complete way of representing algorithms. A very old language its influence on all subsequent history is undeniable. From Lisp we see that: ""Garbage collection was invented by John McCarthy around 1959 to solve problems in Lisp"" [3]. We also notice that the AI researchers had concepts of object orientation in the early 60s [4] and that the later mixins and multiple inheritance had a root in Lisp. The development of multiple inheritance was also motivated by the needs of the old symbolic reasoning researchers.<p>As for Walmart? Walmart is a very big user of optimization theory and logistics. Walmart and its ilk also use Data Mining and Rule Learning stuff. And optimization is a lot more important than efficiently routing trucks: OR people are actually laying the foundation of AI and are seeing a lot of their work rediscovered. OR people also contributed dynamics programming for example. This is what I mention in another post about improving synergy between all these very related silos. These topics are essentially subsets of a more general theory that will be pivotal to AI.<p>I personally think optimization is a very important part of our universe. In a way the principle of Least Action is doing some kind of optimization. I feel that people working in machine learning, in particular the bayesian inference and graphical models part of AI are actually doing a subset of quantum mechanics. Vice versa these techniques will likely prove pivotal in programming quantum systems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner#Contributions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner#Contributions</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automath"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automath</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_sc...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming#His...</a>",1303343770

It is about balance of power in general and how that impacts what is legitimate, regarding to ones position.<p>There is also a certain point where combating racism transforms into fighting with ghosts.<p>From the original story - the Achmed and his extended family kinda fit - since people from general area of mediterran and middle east tend to pay more attention to their relatives - and so this story could also work with Giuseppe from Sicily or Zorbas the Greek, Jovo from Serbia or someone else. It's main point is hardly that muslims are scoundrels who prey on every opportunity to shaft their fellow human. You could argue that it is racist by proxy (He picked an Arab name - so it has to be racist). To me it is the same case of native American woman trying to ban Brave new World since some people in the book whose race isn't even mentioned, live in low tech reservations.<p>The way I see it it is a caricature.

You can execute ""successfully"", but if what you build isn't something the client wants, then you're wasting your time.<p>Depending on what you're developing, a business side perspective could be invaluable. The financial services industry is full of inefficiency, as an example to illustrate my point. I worked in equity research for a while and we published reports that were simply pdfs of excel files (there are some publishing tools out there like bluematrix). There are huge opportunities here for a better publishing platform that is easy to use for someone who is not technologically savvy (like research analysts). Having someone with the insight into the industry could be very useful and would help a developer identify and focus on developing and designing functions that would be useful to the client. I'm sure more than one developer has wasted time developing something only to get FEEDBACK (also know as perspective) from the client (often business related when not a developer end-product) that the functionality doesn't match what they need or expect.<p>I just cannot agree with your point of view here. In my opinion, ideas and perspective are important, but then again, I am new to this. Can someone explain to me why execution should be held above all else?",1303343523
