I remember seeing an analysis somewhere comparing salary/cost of living and size of city in the US (I tried googling the original article but came up empty).<p>Basically if you start in a little village then move to a small town your salary rises faster than the cost of living and so you end up slightly better off financially. Then if you move to a larger town you're slightly better off again. And so on as you move up in city size.<p>This relationship holds except for at the very top, where the curve flattens off and drops slightly. You're actually slightly worse off in the banner cities like LA/SF/NYC.<p>In other words you, as an individual, are paying a premium to live in those places. The sweet spot in the curve financially is the next tier of cities down. I suspect this curve might have some degree of regional variation and might be different in other countries too.",1296645267

I don't know.<p>""Who ""owns"" the content the user ""created"" by typing in a search term and clicking a link?"" Good question, I don't think there can be a definitive answer to this. Google can make a decent case that they own it (just like they own the directions given between two points on google maps, it's a consequence of their algorithm). But I think that's missing the point that, if I'm right, Bing weren't just targeting Google, they were targeting everyone.<p>Obvious sarcastic reply: ""Oh it's all ok, Bing were spying on <i>everyone</i> guys, not just Google users, yay!"" but that neatly brushes under the carpet the fact that <i>everyone</i> who runs a website spies on their users to some extent.

The signal Bing is alleged to be using is that users CLICKED on the result that came up ... not the results that just came up first in Google upon a search query. And these are users who agreed to install the Bing toolbar!<p>Here's a hypothesis. I suspect Bing is making use of data that is typed in the toolbar or browser's search box ... not data captured from text typed directly into Google's search page. This might explain why their ""honeypot-take"" rate was only 8%. This is a subtle point. So ... imagine if you are the coder who wrote this signal collection feature. Would you capture ""term in search box,next URL clicked"" OR would you capture ""if search box search engine == BING or Yahoo or something else then capture term in search box, next URL clicked"".<p>Let me propose an alternative experiment. The test clickers should have clicked on the second or third (or some position N where N > 1) link. This would have demonstrated if Bing is using the actual click information or the search results themselves directly. The former seems completely fair on Bing's part. The latter <i>might</i> be debatable. My point is this ... the Google geniuses fail to distinct these two cases and are muddling it up for the PR drones. This waste everyone's time and productivity. Moreover, they belittle the hard-work of engineers and scientists. It is sad that this is what it has come to.",1296644694
