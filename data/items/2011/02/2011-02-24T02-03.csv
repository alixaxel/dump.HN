But I think you'll find a lot of successful companies usually quickly added a 3rd person to the mix early on. It's a matter of semantics whether you want to call them co-founders or not. The point is that they're in there early on before the major successes of the company which they help contribute to.",1298516377

However, I work with a large teaching hospital rather than small practices.<p>A home run offering for our environment would include a migration path for data from years (and many thousands of patient's data) currently in a patched-together system with 40 years of duct tape holding it all together.  Top it off with a massive dose of free text data fields (so no easy field extraction) and you're looking at a huge custom effort to pull it off.<p>But . . . I think there is room here for something that does something nice with machine learning and NLP.  Some folks looking into this have found that even free text in path reports contains a significant amount of exploitable structure from a data mining perspective.<p>And once you solve the migration, you'll have to go around the heavily entrenched IT groups holding the duct tape.

2256745,comment,2254648,2255230,0,0,silencio,,,"> potentially having to rely on a result that may or may not have statistical significance<p>I can't stress this enough. I've had a bunch of friends buy the 23andme kit while it was on sale recently because they were interested in my results from a while ago, and their buildup to getting their own results was ""what if it tells me I'm never going to have x?!"" and things like that. Kind of frustrating to explain how it works.<p>23andme put me at average to low risk of a few things they test for that I have in real life. One of the more frustrating things to read was that 23andme declared from preliminary asthma research that I was at lower than average to average odds, when in my past I've had severe asthma I've even been hospitalized for.<p>On the flip side of things, 23andme determined my risk of melanoma from genetics is 0.1% (as compared to 1.7% average). But I live in Los Angeles and I get sunburnt/suntanned multiple times a year, not to mention the sheer number of hours I spend outdoors in general. I regularly track skin changes and visit a dermatologist once in a while because new spots and changes on my skin stress the hell out of me. I know my risk likely skyrockets past the 1.7% easily if you take my environment into account.<p>Insurance companies already play this risk/percentage game anyway with lots of other information, and I don't think I see a big of a risk as people being denied insurance from testing like this. If anything, it means everyone can be more proactive and save money and lives in the end. (Of course, I am being pretty naively optimistic here...) I mean, I imagine that's what they're trying to do on some level when they send me pamphlets about STD testing and prenatal care in the mail every other week just because they know I'm a 20something female on birth control.",1298515688

You should be making at least 40 times rent per year (and use more than craigslist to get price ranges — streeteasy.com has pretty real prices). I know that was a tough one being self employed for my first time here in NYC as they usually require proof that you make that amount in some form before signing a lease, or a guarantor. While I personally make more than some of the numbers I hear people throw out from time to time, it's not always an immediate increase in quality of life or affordability here, so it's worth considering that. You might fall in love with the city (as I did) which makes the sacrifice well worth it but not all people stick around.<p>Anyway, if you ask me, risks are worth taking from time to time.
