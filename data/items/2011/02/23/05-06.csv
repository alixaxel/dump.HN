Hollywood celebrities, or at least their publicists, write windy and vapid commentaries. And this, I fear, is what news is going to look like in the future.""",1298438788

Spreedly then redirects the user to you.  You validate the token (similar to catching someone from an OpenID provider) and, if successful, do whatever was required to effect your purchase.<p>From the user's experience, it sure <i>looks</i> like they were on your site the entire time, but their payment details only ever touch Spreedly's servers.  You interface with Spreedly on the backend to do any sort of charging logic that you want -- subscriptions, one-off charges, weird business logic specific to your application, whatever.  (This is the main value add over the regular Spreedly subscriptions thing, which works very well if your subscriptions work exactly like Spreedly subscriptions and, apparently, less well otherwise.)<p>Since the data never touches your servers, you never need to go through PCI compliance work.<p>The big win I perceive for my business is that my checkout forms will only ask for name, credit card number, and CCV, hopefully increasing conversions versus Google Checkout / Paypal.",1298438479
