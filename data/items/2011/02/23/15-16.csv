We also put a fun plug for djangoproject.org to the end of the ""future"" section, which hopefully will also introduce some new people to their project.

I am just pointing out that they are bogus reasons to reject a language. The OP is claiming that the deep type theory constructs of Scala are too difficult for him. Of course they are, just as deep macro fu would be hard for a Clojure beginner.<p>Please don't mistake me. I prefer Clojure to Java any day. I am reacting to the idea that ""too many parantheses"" or ""but macros are too complex"" or ""laziness is too hard to wrap my head around""  or ""Scala has a more powerful type system than I am used to"" or ""Erlang has too weird a syntax"" etc are sufficient reasons to reject them.<p>Back to Clojure. My (original) point is that you don't need to understand macros (say) in all their glory before you build something in Clojure. Use a macro-less or macro-lite subset and grow into macros as you gain experience. Yes you will write less than the best Clojure for a while. (Imho) that is fine (and unavoidable). <i>Rejecting</i> Clojure because you couldn't completely understand macros (or read ""complex"" code with lots of macros) is (imo) not an optimal strategy.",1298476477

2254448,comment,2253497,2253898,0,0,kls,,,"<i>You're not a Lawyer or a Mechanic</i><p>The nature of the arrangement is more similar that not. Both do project based work as service professionals. And both have unforeseen variables that cannot be known at the time of estimating. Lawyers routinely deal with unforeseen political issue (ruling not going the way they expected) and mechanics routinely deal with unforeseen problems that are technical in nature (mechanical failure, that was not known until the heads where pulled off).<p>Software developers routinely deal with both natures of unforeseen variables in addition to the client adding work after the estimate. Which would be akin to a mechanic giving someone a quote and then when they are half way through the project the client saying well while you are in there go ahead and change out the pistons for forged steel ones, and then arguing because the client got charged for the parts and labor. In all three cases the client pays for the additional work not the service provider.<p><i>paying by the hour is a poor and dated way to do business</i><p>I differ on that opinion as well Sitepoint does too, almost all of the top talent in any development field works by the hour not by the project. Most know to not take the entrepreneurial risk of another company while engaging in a contract that limits their reward.<p><a href=""http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2010/09/14/flat-rate-pricing-vs-hourly-billing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2010/09/14/flat-rate-pricing-vs-h...</a><p><i>You're selling a software solution to a client, so you should charge for that solution</i><p>Right and if I am shouldering the risk of the development costs, I am going to license it to that company as well as there competitors. If they own the result of my labor then they pay for that labor.<p><i>building software isn't an exact science and many projects overrun.</i><p>and that is not the developers burden to bear. Scope creep is a reality with any novice firm who is looking for software development. A fixed bid set up an adversarial relationship immediately. You will constantly be parroting ""out of scope"" to the point that the client will be just as pissed as they would have been about cost overruns as they are about not getting the product they want. The knife cuts both ways, and the reality is more fixed bid projects fail, because at a certain point of losses the developer walks or the software gets shelved because the project as scoped is not what the client thought they wanted at the time of developing a functional specification.<p><i>That's a fantastic way not to get hired for a project.</i><p>It's really not, I educate my clients on the risks of software development and what they can do to limit scope creep, changes in priorities and politics, the three big killers of projects. Further all of my clients now are big tech firms, so they are well versus in these realities. Not allowing myself to into a bad deal in no way affects my ability to get projects. Coming off as an amateur in contract negotiations can hurt far more than being firm on how you structure your work.<p><i>because you're the expert and you'll have the better idea of how long it should take.</i><p>Unless you are a politician, there is no way that you can do this with any accuracy, the client will creep scope, it is a given, with time and materials you have a lever that you can pull to say OK we can add it, but it is going to affect you budget by X and your delivery by Y. It puts the onus on them to control scope creep, if it is on you, you will be strong armed into accepting it.<p>If you don't they are just as mad as cost overruns and you have received no money, so when they pull the plug you are the one left holding the bag. I have been doing this for 20 years and have seen first hand that fixed bids cause more problems for both sides. Take a look at all the top guys on HN, take a look at there stories as to why they only do time and materials, each and every one of them will have a fixed big horror story.",1298476385

If you're sending out a large number of job applications and resumes, it might be a good idea to incorporate some basic testing methods. Try out different combinations of CVs, different tones, different vocabularies. Maybe there is a simple reason for all the rejections that can be fixed with some minor adjustments. For example, you might be giving too much or too little information on your CV. Perhaps you're applying at the wrong companies or for the wrong position. The point being, if you received so many <i>fuck-off</i> letters, there is probably something systemically wrong here, and chances are you can use a combination of quality assurance and data analysis to find out what it is.",1298476315

Future of Java-the-language is limited by backward compatibility. This imposes a barrier on the scope of innovation in the language.<p>2. #1 can be helped by the newer JVM languages.<p>3. Current trend to increasingly adopt Ruby, Python or PHP for turnaround time is the result of a momentum and has to mean something. There is clearly demand for faster turnaround time in some segments.<p>4. The JVM languages that can reach feature parity with Ruby/Python/PHP ecosystem and tooling will have a better chance of adoption IMO.<p>5. The next Java is certainly not Java alone. Probably a mix of languages, depending upon which ones have a better VM, tooling, libraries, turnaround time etc.",1298475993

The problem for many coming to Clojure is having to ""unlearn"" the ""object oriented"" Java concepts they already know (true for other functional languages, too, of course).<p>Clojure leaves type declarations completely optional.  It does not try to assemble disparate programming paradigms and integrate them into a coherent whole.  The built in data structures all implement the seq interface, so you can use the same functions on all of them.<p>Rich Hickey spent his complexity budget very well.

And for all the whining people do with Android, they may have surprisingly got it right.  Let me explain.<p>Apple's process is pretty easy.  They own the phone, firmware, software, etc... It's easy for them to test and roll out.  Everyone knows this.<p>Now Android went with a completely different approach.  We give you the OS, now you own everything else.  The OEMs have to ensure that any update works on their phone.  This is great for Android for two reasons: (1) The OEMs COMPLETELY own testing each new build of Android.  Google doesn't have to think about Gingerbread, except for systemic issues.  And (2) if there are issues on a given phone, it's not Google's fault -- it's the OEMs.<p>MS is in a rather horrible position of delivering the OS directly to the phones thus having to test them as they are responsible for failure.<p>One big problem that comes up here is imagine you have one phone where the update just doesn't seem to work.  Are you going to hold up all of the other phones just to get that one phone working?<p>If MS pulls this off, kudos to them.  But I don't envy them.  With that said, they pulled it off in the PC market, but that market built itself around MS-DOS, rather than MS-DOS coming out the gate with support for multiple manufacturers.",1298475821

Programming languages are IMHO a bit like user interfaces in this regard - ""don't make me think"".""<p>By this logic no one would use the command line and Windows click thru wizards blow Unix away. I agree that guis are good for non programmers. Java <i>is</i> better than Scala for some subset of programmers. So is VB. The problem arises  when that statement is modified to use the Universal Quantifier.<p>The thing about a ""powerful"" programming language though (or for that matter a command line) is that it is a <i>power</i> tool. No one forces you to use it and you shouldn't if you feel it is too complex, but using some mythical ""complexity budget"" as if it were some kind of inviolable scientific fact is (imo) bogus. The ""complexity budget"" of anything is a function of the context of its use.\nAs cemerick points out in another post here, Scala or Clojure (or Haskell or Erlang) will always have  a ""complexity"" higher than VB or Java and <i>that is fine</i>.<p>""Again, this is about the complexity budget.""<p>There is no such thing independent of the intent of  the language designer and the context of the use of the tool.

That doesn't make the former uncontestably ""better"" independent of context.<p>And anyway my original point was only that <i>once</i> you choose a language which you can't grasp all at once, for whatever reason, you should start programming with the subset you do understand rather than wait till you completely grok it.

Many people do that in similarly complex languages like C++.<p>But the programmers will, one way or the other, get exposed to the features you considered esoteric. Be it through libraries, or sample code, or whatever. And then they have a piece of code in the language they use for daily work that they don't understand, can't debug, and are alienated by strange compiler errors - not good.<p>It's IMHO also quite hard to come up with the subset you like. I mean, programmers like to have endless discussions about completely irrelevant topics, like brace placement; wait and see the discussions about actual language features to (not) use! Like I said in the other comment, most features are in themselves completely reasonable, so it's hard to make a cut here.<p>I also think the 'mediocre programmer' is a red herring. Not that there aren't mediocre programmers that will have trouble to understand certain language features at all - there certainly are.<p>But I'd wager that even for very good programmers, having many complex language features (that interact!) in a code base will be problematic. Of course you can understand what's going on with some effort on your side, but the problem is with the effort. Programming languages are IMHO a bit like user interfaces in this regard - ""don't make me think"". Having code in a code base that's complex and/or hard to understand is a really, really bad thing. People will shy away from reading and modifying it, and over time it'll grow into an unmaintained monstrosity.<p>Again, this is about the complexity budget. Original Java code was dead easy to understand, now with generics it's a bit harder (but overall I think generics are less bad than you hear all the time).

Now Google is somewhat of a special case because it's a highly desirable place to work and very large so you have issues of scale [2].<p>Sometimes I read posts like this and someone will say ""I sent out X hundred resumes"" and my response is always ""really?"". It always strikes me that if that's what you're doing, you're doing something wrong.<p>Let me explain. I contracted in Australia for some years (where I'm from) and also in the UK (London) for several years. Contracting in London is a soul-destroying experience and there is an industry in dire need of regulation but I digress.<p>Contracting is possibly the worst and most depressing form of looking for work because you in many ways are at the bottom of the totem pole. You may earn a lot but you pay for that. Companies will generally treat you as replaceable (which you are).<p>But in the course of much job-seeking I've spoken to many recruiters and some have given me the lowdown on what they do (including the shady practices). But the thing that stuck out the most for me was they all say they can throw out 90-95% of the resumes (CVs actually) they receive within seconds of receiving. This is a combination of them being bad but, more interestingly, the person just isn't suited for the job. Like not even remotely. Basically people take a shotgun approach of applying for everything. If you're a C++ programmer living in Leeds you end up applying for an Oracle DBA position in Reading. I'm not kidding.<p>I've generally had a reasonable success rate with both getting interviews and getting the job at that point. One reason for this I think is not that I'm some super candidate but that I really target which jobs I go after as being something I'm particularly interested in or something I'm particularly well-suited for.<p>Part of it too is understanding the process and this varies from place to place.<p>So in the UK for example you want to deal with only a handful of recruiting agencies. There are many fly-by-night operations who are either harvesting CVs or just hoping to get lucky. Filling one candidate a month can keep a small operation afloat.<p>So if applying for a job with a bank in London there are three filters you have to make it through:<p>1. The recruiter. The recruiter may be limited in the number of CVs they can submit (eg 2). Even if they don't submit you they'll often tell you they will, which is why it's important to find one you can trust. Trust but verify;<p>2. HR. This is in my experience the biggest impediment to filling jobs. HR know <i>nothing</i> about programming so they'll word scan your CV/resume based on buzzwords. So you need to fill your CV with buzzwords, particularly those for the job. This can often mean catering your CV on a per-job basis. Some may not like this because it's more work (which it is) but that's the point: target high-probability jobs. The problem is that a buzzword-filled CV is actually a red flag to anyone technically competent;<p>3. Hiring Manager: if you make it this far, with UK banks at least, you'll be in a pile of up to 10 CVs generally speaking. Rarely will a hiring manager interview all candidates. They might pick 2-4 they like, screen them by phone and go down to 2-3 onsite interviews. Or they might just interview people until they find someone they like (very common in my experience) so, if you ever have a choice of interview slot, pick the earliest one. Cancel anything else. You can lose a job simply by choosing a slot on the second day and never being seen.<p>So to return to the issue of feedback: it's even worse with recruiters in the picture. The hiring manager may give feedback to the recruiter (but generally won't; they're too busy). But even if they do the chances of the recruiter passing it along, unless you have a very good relationship with them, is almost zero. At the point you didn't get the job, they lose interest in you until the next job they can shop you for comes up.<p>Recruitment as it stands now is a disaster but won't really change until companies (who have the money) sign on to changing it. The feedback loop isn't there to inform them of how they're not getting the best result out of this (if they even care). Bear in mind that the person running the team you would potentially work for may be as frustrated by this process as you the candidate are.<p>Google again is a special case here. We're large enough that we have our own recruiters. I can't imagine how horrid the situation would be if we outsourced recruitment. Of course not everyone can do that but not everyone needs to I guess.<p>The process here is scrutinized (and criticized) quite a lot so is subject to gaming. So please don't take my comments to mean the process here is perfect. It isn't. But I have a hard time figuring out how it could be done better on the same scale. Every large company will be selective in some way, just to limit the deluge of applicants to manageable levels.<p>Other commentors have likened recruitment to dating and it's an apt analogy IMHO. A lot of recruitment comes down to chemistry between those doing the hiring and the candidate. If the interviewer likes you then you're in a much better position. So you can be technically well-suited for something but just not a great ""culture fit"".<p>There can be luck involved here too. It can depend on who interviews you, other factors (maybe an interviewer is just having a bad day; maybe you are). I think it's important not to dwell on the feedback and rejection for too long. Try and just move on to the next thing.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cforcoding.com/2010/07/my-google-interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cforcoding.com/2010/07/my-google-interview.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://screamable.com/google-received-over-75000-job-applications-worldwide-in-just-one-week.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screamable.com/google-received-over-75000-job-applica...</a>",1298473872

2254267,comment,2253722,2254115,0,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"I don't know if you've actually examined the OOXML format, but I spent about 6 months dealing with it in great detail at my old job, specifically Excel. For simple things, conventional XML manipulation tools could potentially be useful, but there are some serious issues.<p>For one thing, the files office generates and consumes are significantly different from the format as specified in the ECMA and ISO standards. The schemas for ECMA-376 will specify elements as occuring in any order, while Excel will <i>require</i> those elements to appear in a fixed order. Tons of tiny problems like this exist everywhere, and you only need one mistake to create a malformed document. The machine-readable XML schemas provided by Microsoft <i>will not work</i> without massaging.<p>The format also makes it very difficult to make simple in-place changes. A good example of this is what you might consider the most basic information in a spreadsheet- cells. Cell tags are contained in row tags which are contained in a sheetData tag. Rows contain their row number as an attribute, while cells contain their A1 ""row/column"" ID. This means if you remove or reposition a row in a spreadsheet you must update every cell in every subsequent row.<p>How about extracting a string value from a cell? The format makes it possible to store inline strings directly in a given cell, but Excel itself never uses this functionality. Instead, the cell contains an index into the SharedStringTable, which is stored as a separate XML document. If you delete or modify a cell, it might be referencing an SST entry that is no longer used. The only way to know is to search the document globally, remembering that dozens of different elements could potentially refer to a shared string. If your goal is to avoid bloating documents with junk, you have to solve this problem for a number of cases- style references, fonts and more.<p>If you want to modify OOXML documents in a robust, thorough manner, you'll deal with tons of issues like this.",1298473764

However, I think we (people who want this and <i>talk</i> about wanting it and wouldn't go off the deep end) are in a minority.  We're writing and talking about it - we (here on HN and blogs and such) tend to have more self-awareness than others - or at least express that self-awareness more than others.  But we're in the minority - people would sue, they'd stalk, they'd pester, they'd argue, etc.<p>Companies love NDAs - how about an NFOA - a Non Freak Out Agreement?  Sign it before an interview.  If you've signed it, we'll give you honest, open, critical feedback about how you do or don't fit in with the company's needs.  Honestly, I do think sometimes I've not gotten a job it was more a personality/culture fit than anything else, but I'd like to know that as well (and frankly wouldn't mind giving them some feedback on their culture too!).  But without knowing, perhaps I get too hung up on a linkedlist question and fret about that in future.  And turning it around, perhaps the company could get some good feedback on their own operating culture (""no, being on call 24/7 to babysit broken code isn't worth $30k, but you didn't say that in the job description"").",1298473547

I've gotten to second and third interviews and thought I was doing quite well. Only to never hear from them again. Just sending out a notice would have at least prevented me from wondering.<p>Knowing why... would be nice, but it's understandleable why companies avoid it. From a purely human perspective it's hard disappointing people and letting them down. People don't like giving other people bad news. Especially if they don't know you. There's no way to tell how the person receiving it is going to react. It's easier to just be as polite as you can about it and keep your resons to yourself.<p>I hate wondering, but that's just part of the process. I've interviewed with a company where I blew past the technical interview. When I came in to meet with the CEO and do the social bit... well I thought I did alright, but I just never heard back from them again. I've wondered a thousand times what I might've said that would turn them off from a perfectly good candidate such as myself. I'll just have to live without knowing and I think it might be better that way anyway. It might be that the CEO just didn't get a good gut feeling about it, maybe I made a bad joke, maybe someone that works there recommended a friend... who knows?
