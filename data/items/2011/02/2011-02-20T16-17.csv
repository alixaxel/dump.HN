2242295,comment,2241531,2241780,0,0,wyuenho,,,"It's not about beauty, it's about the ramp-up speed. When Perl was invented, it was really easy to get up to speed if you were already coding a lot in `sh` and `awk` and `make`. You sort of already know the meanings of the punctuations. These days, the most widely recognized punctuations students and other new programmer know are math symbols, so learning a new language that reuse these are far easier than learning  Perl. After all, it's far easier to learn and remember French grammar and spellings if you are an English speaker, than to learn Chinese. For this reason alone, I stay clear from languages with a lot of punctuation symbol abuse, i.e. Ruby, Perl, Scala.<p>Don't get me wrong I don't dismiss the continuing importance of Perl, that's why I was very careful in my wording (minus a spelling mistake). I don't think there's even 1 metric we can agree on when measuring language popularity (Python is ranked 4th on TIOBE and 6th on StackOverflow and there's exactly 0 job posting for it in Hong Kong), so never-mind 1 that tells me definitively that Perl is coming back. After all, for it to come back, it must have gone away before. Ever thought of why? Even if it <i>is</i> coming back, what's the significance? We've had other viable choices for a very long time now. Python, PHP are all doing a very good job that Perl was traditionally good at. Hell, I'd even throw in Ruby as another viable choice too.<p>Arguing success stories is kind of pointless too, theoretically I can write anything in any Turing-Complete language, so for all I care I could have written Blekko and DuckDuckGo in assembly.",1298221012

I'm not an Apple ""fan."" Also, given that success is usually a fairly complex phenomenon, varied opinions are hardly surprising. Ask a hundred so-called ""Apple haters"" why the company ""sucks"" and you'll get even more incongruent answers.<p><pre><code>  > You seem to be claiming that planning ahead and buying

</code></pre>
I'm not claiming that, and I strongly doubt that I seem to. In fact, I'm simply defending the proposition that Apple's impeccable management of supply chains and inventory allows them to produce quality products at scale and reasonable price points. Yes, producing quality products (not cheap, boring plastic tablets) for 500$ is something that the competition can't do at this point. The stuff that is on par is more expensive (Xoom, Galaxy Tablet and so on); the stuff that is similarly priced or way cheaper (Notion Ink Adam, Archos) is very flimsy and immature.<p>The combination might destroy competition, including Apple, yes, but would definitely require sophisticated supply chain management. Right now, all relevant components are limited resources. What's so controversial about that?<p><pre><code>  > And not only do you credit this one factor with decisive victory

I don't (cf. difference between necessary and sufficient conditions).<p><pre><code>  > you're attributing it not to Apple as a corporation, but to one individual.
</code></pre>
I don't. It's a fairly wide-spread habit to identify the work of a full department (operations) with its VP/head (COO Cook). Nothing wrong with that; reading it as ""ZOMG TIM COOK IS DOING EVERYTHING WITHOUT HELP!!!!11"" is naive at best. Of course, he relies on hundreds of engineers and administrators, but he's been successful in several companies so far and from what I've heard he is indeed a ""hands-on"" manager and workaholic.<p>Nothing fanboy-ish about that.<p><pre><code>  > Indeed, like the face of Jesus appearing in a grilled

I've been doing this stuff for like 25 years now and I've seen a lot of fads and tools come and go.<p>I would like to try and not group TDD and BDD as similar things because in my eye they really aren't: they both provide very different approaches to solving a problem. If you were to simply cover TDD then I would agree with you that it is something that focuses on programming and the programmer and operates within that area of software engineering.<p>BDD, on the other hand, really has little to do with telling a programmer how to test their code or even how to program. About the only thing BDD ""requires"" a programmer to do is implement the Behavior described. There are a lot of ways to do this, but BDD adds a lot of other cool things too (like you can verify the requirements provided too).<p>So, when you mention that ""The 'good' programmers all do things this certain way"" and see BDD as a tool forcing that. Well, I don't think that is the case.<p>The funny thing is that BDD isn't even a new thing because it relies on scenarios. It is very similar to Use Cases with one minor, but important, difference: there was no standardization on Use Cases (Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistair Cockburn is a great book). Cockburn left the way scenarios are written open to the engineers whereas BDD provides a simple language, Gherkin, that can be used consistently across different tools (Cucumber, Behat, Specflow are a few examples).<p>So, from that aspect, this isn't some new ""fad"" that is being sold to developers.

(I think there is a pg essay somewhere giving that advice, I followed it). I knew as a mechanical engineer with some software development experience I didn't want to be in one of the web 2.0 startups. I posted an Ask HN question about how to find startups in Manhattan (I lived in New Jersey, about 1.5 hour commute to manhattan each way). HNers posted two groups (NYTech Meetup, and TechNY?, forget the second one off teh top of my head). I sent an email out to those two groups basically saying, here is my resume, I would love to intern for a startup company, preferably one that does hardware, does anyone have any tips.<p>One of the members on the 2nd board told me about Bug Labs, and gave me the contact email for one of the guys there. I then went through about a 4 week process of playing phone and email tag. I never gave up. I'd get in touch about every 3-5 days and push for an interview. I finally got one, I think just so they'd shut me up. They really had no need/use/idea of what to do with an intern. But I think they knew I wanted it badly enough that it was worth taking a chance on me.<p>I ended up staying there for the rest of college doing 2 summer and 2 winter internships, and it was definitely the best experience/job I've ever had.<p>My suggestion is: figure out exactly what you want to do, find a contact in the company (for me it was HR not CEO) and just lay it out really clearly why you want to work for them and what you will do. For me I made it clear that I would pick up all the low priority tasks and free up the other engineers to do other things. That meant at first writing a lot of the manuals, testing, and writing tutorials. It was probably less programming than some other internships, but I was surrounded by some of the smartest people I've ever met, and it was a great place to work.<p>So just don't give up on contacting them, people in startups are busy, and make sure you make it clear what value you are going to bring to them becuase startups don't have the time or money to keep on interns that don't pull their weight.",1298219453

I considered getting a bike but decided that would be far worse than walking. At one point, I purchased a skateboard but failed to learn to use it.  I leave for work on foot every morning and we do our shopping regularly on foot.  Humans developed the ability to walk long before sidewalks were invented.  They aren't really necessary, though, certainly, some terrain is more pedestrian-friendly than others.<p>If you are ""unmotivated"" and think it's hard, then it's possible you are already more unhealthy than you think: Lack of energy and mental focus for accomplishing goals is an early indicator of not really being well.  And if you think eating healthier is too expensive, you should look into what it costs for medical care for a really serious chronic condition like diabetes.  Google ""diabetic ulcer"".  People get their feet amputated after these ulcers have eaten away flesh all the way to the bone.  I guess having one or both feet amputated is a good reason to not walk anywhere.  I would rather keep my feet though.<p>Giving up my car turned out to be wildly anti-climactic.  The transition was really not that big a deal -- though I already lived close to work and shopping, so not everyone can just do it.  But the first time I walked with my sons to the local grocery store, on the way back, my oldest said ""That's IT?""  He really thought it would be a lot longer walk than it was.

What the author describes as:<p><i>""the mutable default parameter quirk is an ugly corner worth avoiding""</i><p>could also be described as:<p><i>""a natural outcropping of python's late binding, ""names are references"" variable model, and closure mechanisms, which provide a consistency to the language that is often crufted up in others""</i><p>I do somewhat agree with the author that this particular functionality should be a ""use only when needed"" feature. I don't think it should be avoided at all costs tho, because there are times where the mutable default allows for a lot of saved code. In fact in a few cases the code to work around using mutable defaults can get into some serious voodoo because frequently the writer is actually trying to work around the bigger mutable/immutable objects and names are references ""issues"" in python.<p>This also reminds me of something I was reading on the front page today about the old 'use the whole language' vs 'simplicity is king' holy war.",1298218687

For some exceptions, might sell some romance novels or screen plays and write 'news' drawing on morality plays and formula fiction.<p>Otherwise, broadly, first-cut, essentially the whole pile from Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, ..., Dickens, James, to the present and their goals, techniques, values, and traditions are dead economically, intellectually, culturally, educationally -- kaput.<p>Why?  Still in simple terms, they never made it into the 20th century with its standards of information safety and efficacy from mathematics, physical science, medical science, engineering, medicine, and law of the early 20th century.  E.g., for learning about people, f'get about Shakespeare, ..., and just read clinical psychology.  Or, don't read 'writer' Henry James and read his brother psychologist William James instead.<p>The 'writers' didn't have to know much and, instead, wrote 'art' as in the 'communication, interpretation of human experience, emotion'.  For the reader, it was vicarious, escapist, fantasy, emotional experience entertainment, not useful information, not anything solid even about the emotions of real people.<p>So, 'literature' is now for light entertainment.  No one would try to do anything serious -- design an airplane, drug, computer system, bridge -- using the techniques of literature.<p>In the recent past, for media, the content was still from ""the medium is the message"".  So, could pass out content, one size fits millions.  Such content had to be of such broad interest and, thus, so superficial that it could be from a 'writer' who actually didn't know much about the subject.<p>Commonly a reader who actually knows something about subject X when reading work of a newsie about X sees right away that the newsie understands next to nothing about X and gets a lot wrong.<p>Now in great contrast, for each narrow topic, there are many experts who, as on Wikipedia, HN, Stack Overflow, eGullet, various blogs and fora, can, just for fun, write material of much higher quality for free and do.<p>So there are over 100 million blogs tracked by Technorati and some unknown, large number of long tail Web sites so that the focused content is far beyond the old, one size fits millions.<p>Yes, 'literature' is gathering dust on the library shelves and otherwise nearly dead.  We are losing nothing of any value.  It should have died over 100 years ago.  RIP.<p>And we are losing something dangerous that has profoundly hurt our democracy for over 150 years:  We're losing the work of the newsies who just gush their emotions and otherwise distort and manipulate to grab people by the heart, the gut, and below the belt, always below the shoulders, never between the ears, and pretend that they are contributing to an 'informed electorate'.  They've been building a massively, deliberately un/misinformed electorate with consequences -- the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the 1929 market crash, the Great Depression and, thus, WWII, the Cold War, the Viet Nam war, the Great Recession, and more.  I will leave details as an exercise.  Hint:  The Civil War started before Lincoln even took office and from essentially only the deliberately deceptive, inflammatory work of the newsies.<p>There's an important word about 'fiction':  It ain't true.  Then, even if in some case by accident it is true, there's no evidence, certainly no proof.  It's junk best left on the scrapheap of history from long, ignorant, efforts in the struggle to build civilization.<p>The newsies have been among the most dangerous, destructive, and contemptible people in our democracy.",1298218674

Take a look at page 8, the one that contains this prediction.

That includes a 26.3% (2007) and 28.4% (2010) rate of ""pre-diabetes"", which really just means a HbA1c test that was higher than average.<p>But between 2007 and 2010, the diagnostic test for pre-diabetes, the HbA1c, got much cheaper and became part of routine screenings where it wasn't before, so the slight uptick observed may actually be an artifact of increased testing, and it is definitely <i>not</i> part of a trend that can be linearly extrapolated ten years out.",1298218609

2242117,comment,2240226,2240226,0,0,epnk,,,"We attended the Foursquare hackathon yesterday as participants and ended up winning with our thedealio.at private messaging app.<p>To be honest, the only thing we had completed prior to arriving at 1:00p was that we knew the idea.  We had no name, no code written, had not heard about the new API features released, nothing.  So at least it's one datapoint that the winners aren't all pre-developed, polished products.<p>For me, the biggest benefit of hackathons are that you are absolutely forced to use all sorts of skills, not all developer-focused.  We had to discover a problem that was worth solving for a lot of people (P/M fit, I suppose).  We had to battle with stupid issues like buying an .at domain name and having my credit card get locked up due to an overseas suspicious purchase, then having to wait for DNS to propagate so we could get an SSL certificate issued as required by a new feature of the Foursquare API.  Also how the look and feel should be, the UX--simplicity, fun, and engaging. We spent the first three hours writing no code, just getting our game plan in place.<p>Then of course in the actual development we broke all kinds  of rules like code duplication, no testing, editing code directly on the production server, etc.  We focused squarely on speed, knowing that time would be our biggest threat.<p>Which brings me to my main point.  Building any software product is all about compromises, and knowing when to make them. It does go against the spirit of a hackathon to bring a polished product to demo, while just networking all day.  We didn't do that and did okay. But only by using every means available (including pretty much skipping dinner).<p>I hope that the possibility of polished products doesn't hurt the hackathon spirit, and this post is mostly to offer encouragment that single-day hacks can still hold their own.  There were some really great hacks there, and the ones I know that were built just yesterday were among my favorites (4squareand7years being my particular fave).",1298217723
