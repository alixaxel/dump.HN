In case it's the former, here's my two cents.  This comes from a place a little further down the road, and therefore it is a little OT, but I'll mention it because I wish I would have heard the same.<p>You might find that your professional success--perhaps your emotional investment in your business--gives rise to turmoil in your relationship.  Many of us strive to get big, go public, get acquired, acquire others, merge, etc.  These events are typically wins, but the downsides are loss of control, loss of interest, and perhaps even a bit of depression as a result.<p>I hope you're successful.  If you feel a little off in the course of things, don't let it poison your relationship.  Recognize it, act on it, but don't <i>react</i>.",1297407570

Most TDD advocates are overboard with it imo; a test case should certainly be written when a regression occurs to make sure it doesn't happen again, and tests should be filled in in other cases as time and circumstances permit (recognizing that tests are an important part of the application that you can't just shove off until your favorite theorized utopian corporate culture is realized), but I've never been a big fan of making the development process all about tests. I think it's overzealous and ultimately just burns people out on testing, causing them to get lazy and go almost test-less when they have the option. There are times when it's better to discard form and just write some code straight up without descending into a mire of testing beforehand.",1297406950

2205422,comment,2204131,2204663,0,0,JonLAFT,,,"below is some of what i wrote on adam's blog post. btw - @potatolicious, with Luv@FirstTweet we're targeting this niche to help you ""get regular dates with people I'd enjoy spending time with"" as you say.<p>I co-founded and just launched Luv@FirstTweet a few weeks ago.<p>I've thought about many of the issues which Adam describes, although I've never written them as eloquently and clearly as he has. I'm going to address some of the issues described in the blog post (note the ""you"" i reference is adam obv)...<p>1. spamming, hypergamy, and false advertising is a huge problem as you mention, and a big time sink. People want to use online dating because it is a huge pool of potential people and because it’s an efficient use of time. However when you have to waste time it detracts from the value (more on this below).<p>2. spamming - On Luv@FirstTweet you just respond to our Tweets which build your profile, so you’re not browsing profiles or messaging random people. The only time you do message someone is after you’ve been matched with them, and at that point we show several things in common as well as their photo, so hopefully when you email them it can initiate a real dialogue about things you care about, not just “nice pic ur h0t” haha.<p>3. hypergamy is covered pretty much in my comment above due to the nature of how you interact with the site.<p>4. In terms of false advertising, I guess it could be done if you lie in responses to all of our questions, but this isn’t a traditional dating site where people are browsing profiles and a deviant dude hopes his lies will ensnare an unsuspecting profile viewer…we’re building a profile about you and then matching, so it wouldn’t have the same impact and thus I doubt people would feel the urge to do it as much.<p>5. network effects are the biggest challenge I see us facing, and it’s something we’re got to deal with and adapt to. The big players are pouring tons of money into advertising their self-destructive business models as you explain, so this makes things tricky.<p>6. if there was a “like” button next to Zao Yang’s quote I’d click it – nicely put<p>7. “And to redefine the problem a little bit, I suspect there’s more value and fun in helping people meet new friends generically, and only incidentally maybe a significant other.” the nature of our platform could go this way, but currently we’re sticking with matching for dating. Something cool to think about though.<p>8. business models – looking into the future, there are many different avenues to monetize which aren’t ad based, but thanks to some good advice from @schildkrout from HowAboutWe we’re keeping the site free. We want to grow this bad boy after all and when looking at pt #5 above, can’t add any friction to the model to prevent user growth<p>9. the business model issue you bring up is one of the main reasons I had the idea for Luv@FirstTweet: “I sign up on the site, and buy a subscription. I find six or seven girls I like, and send them highly personalized messages. About 15% of people on Match are premium members, and therefore only one of those girls can even reply to my message. I get one reply, at most” – that right there is super super annoying. It is a huge time sink and a waste of money.<p>10. I’m definitely going to read that OkCupid post, it looks terrific.<p>11. backend – while we’re not running computer vision algorithms to analyze smiles, skin showing, etc (which is interesting, but just very different than how we approached things), we are going to continually tweak our matching algorithm based on the responses we get and seeing “what kind of matches work and which don’t” as you mention.<p>12. frontend – this is where we hope to be simple and fun. You say a few points which I totally agree with:\n“Everyone knows that dating profiles suck to create and suck to consume (YES)\nNot only do they lack real signal, they also make for a horrible onboarding experience. (YES)\nYou want me to fill eight huge text areas with witty banter, and check or uncheck 250 radio buttons? (YES…HAHA)\nOverall I’m not bullish on the trinity of people profiles, messaging, and people searches. I know that’s how all sites are built today, but if I were in this space I’d keep an open mind on redefining the primitives.”<p>This is the key here to Luv@FirstTweet....<p>We take a fresh approach and say, hey you’re busy. We respect your lives. Go to work then go have fun with your friends. Oh and when you have 1 spare second when you’re grabbing lunch, or walking down the street, or waiting on a friend…tweet a response to @luvatfirsttweet’s latest question and we’ll store it and build your profile. We have a web interface of course if you’d like to edit your questions and answer some previously asked questions, but the core nature of the site enables effortless and fun profile building.<p>I'd love to know anyone's thoughts on this. Thanks.<p>Jon Lehr\nco-founder, Luv@FirstTweet",1297406156
