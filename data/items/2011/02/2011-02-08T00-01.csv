2191459,comment,2189624,2189624,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>Now, this kind of severe chromatosis is particularly widespread in music-making applications, perhaps hoping to assuage the gear-nostalgia of composers who once had actual knobs and buttons to play with but now are reduced to pretending to operate pretend knobs and buttons on a screen. That's the only reason I can think of for this, a kind of glorious reductio ad absurdum of rampant chromiology, in Reason:</i><p>Actually, I know the designers of Reason. That product was extremely successful <i>because</i> it presented users with an interface that they already found familiar (dangling patch cables plugged into input/output panels on audio gear) whereas most competitors were presenting and interface they did not find familiar (signal routing as electronic schematics).<p>There are far more powerful programs than <i>Reason</i> for making music. But apart from Ableton Live (more modern, but until recently with much less control over signal routing), they are considerably harder to use and have a much steeper learning curve. I have 20 or 30 software packages like this (I used to work in this industry) and while many of them allow open-ended schematics instead of imposing this 'chrome' metaphor on the user, the downside of this is that reading other people's schematics or learning to organize one's own is difficult. A <i>Reason</i> schematic is easy to read quickly because you know where everything is, a lot of the choices have been made for you and you can focus on what's distinctive about it instead of spending the first few minutes trying to parse the graph.<p>At music biz trade shows, the probability that a vendor will speak of <i>Reason</i> dismissively as a 'toy' is inversely related to the quality of the UI on their soft/hardware. In an extreme case the 'software UI' turned out to be an IDE in which you could write Motorola 56k assembler. A year after the firm went bust the lead designer still claimed to be perplexed about why the music-making public had failed to embrace the product.",1297126511

Sure it works, just as well as the physical machines with a hundred buttons and knobs do, but it doesn't make use of all the possibilities a computer can offer. The best and the worst of the physical experience has been ported.<p>To me this is the same as emulating a rotary dial as a mobile phone's only means of dialing a number. It only sounds ridiculous because we all know the more efficient alternative. I think a lot of music software has yet to find the UI breakthrough it needs. Whenever that happens and a new standard of music software UI makes better use of the computer as medium, people will look back at UIs like reason's and find it very misguided.<p>That doesn't mean the answer to all UI issues is to go minimalistic like the article suggests, but I think real-life device mimicking is generally a sign of  lack of UI/usability hard work. It's always the easier solution to copy the existing rather than think hard on a better solution nobody's done before.",1297126297

You will get exposure to 2 different things - one will be to contribute to the main roadmap of our current projects we are working on. These projects have deliverables that will GO LIVE during the course of your internship. You will also have some defined deliverables yourself to complete during your internship. Last year, our interns were prototyping our Magic Fiddle application (award winning and the number one paid iPad app, and our second generation analytics engine from scratch, they helped to create the 3D visualization tool that makes it easy for us to see people uploading music and how it streams by. There was a project where they worked on real-time musical duets. Our interns also worked on a top secret product - all we can tell you is that it’s on the iPhone and it encompasses the camera, gyroscope and the touch screen all at the same time! You will work alongside of Ge Wang our Chief Creative Officer and professor at Stanford.<p>Other perks of being an intern here:<p>•	Being a part of a cohesive vision in a team that is creating strong social experiences with music as the focus
•	Create content rich and interactive social web applications that foster user engagement
•	Team based projects in iterative and highly efficient development cycles
•	Deploy and update apps against defined deliverables

They then reap what they sow.<p>My third point is that it may be that some percentage of kids can never be made to behave properly (short of brain surgery or cognitive drug therapy, for example) and so we may have to adjust our system to accomodate.

I've actually purchased games (that I never actually play) just based on interviews and wanting to support people that have taught me something.
Just this week, for example, I bought three games from one publisher (Mika Mobile) based on a couple of blog entries I had read on an iOS games blog.  I gave the games to my wife, but it was learning a new technique from one of the developers that prompted me to make the purchases.",1297123705

What current information I could find about mobile phones generally refer to using them with in-flight wifi, which seems to directly contradict your statement.",1297123701

It's your personal todo, your personal notes, your personal calendar. They make it easy, ""low latency"", to update your data on Asana so that you will do it readily.<p>The difference is, when someone updates Basecamp, they're updating the team. They're actively trying to communicate and tell other people what's going on. That's work, that's annoying, people don't want to do that, and the info in Basecamp becomes unreliable and prone to be dated.<p>But if you're updating your personal data, people do that all the time. Just in this case your personal data is also shared across your organization so that other people know what's going on at the same time.<p>They pair this with good access controls so that larger groups can share data frictionlessly.",1297123497

The way you write your markup will be a little different than for a normal HTML page but there are custom tags for cool things like auto-inserting page numbers and barcodes. They have some custom CSS too that you use for page formatting, but much of the familiar CSS2-type CSS is in there. I recommend this to anyone who wants to programmatically generate PDFs using Python. Especially if you are already familiar with HTML and CSS.<p>Pro Tip: Use images with a very high DPI. 500 dpi is preferable from my experience.",1297123381

I believe the bad behavior is largely caused by 2 things:<p>1.  Bad influences from the community - parents, siblings, friends, and possibly surrounding media/entertainment.<p>2.  The school system.  More than for anyone else, the way the school is structured is (clearly) ineffective for these struggling students.<p>Even if there were real disciplinary actions taken, the methods of disciplining (that I have observed anyway) are often out-of-date.  Our understanding of behavior change has increased greatly in the past  several years and needs to be more widely understood.<p>Solutions I see:<p>a.  Quit making a large part of school so incredibly boring and seemingly pointless.  Spend A LOT more time focusing on topics closer to what students care about (and should care about).<p>b.  Behavior issues will happen and are normal.  Work on changing bad behaviors by understanding how the environment shapes behaviors.  Understand that behavior change is more likely to happen when new behaviors are supported/introduced/allowed to thrive, rather than continuously trying to suppress current behaviors -- there's a reason for those bad behaviors existing in the first place, you can't ignore them.  Understand how incredibly ineffective abstract commands are (""don't be bad"" as an extreme example), and fear tactics.<p>c.  Bad behaviors are often caused by bad influences in the community (issue #1 from above).  Changing the community behaviors changes the student behaviors (perhaps over long periods of time).  I realize this is difficult, however very essential.",1297123302
