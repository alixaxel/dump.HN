Larry got taken care of because of the stink, but here are thousands of other stories of a similar nature, up and down the spectrum.  Many small businesses started by ""amateurs"" run afoul of regulations, or simply discover that the tax burden is too much in the early days.  Once when I started a small business it turned out I'd located my office in a special tax zone that wanted %3 of all <i>revenue</i> earned by the business.<p>I have a friend who spent 4 days in jail because he was caught near a bar without a drivers license.  He didn't have ID, couldn't prove who he was and got locked up.  They didn't let him make a phone call, and he stayed there until they decided he'd ""learned his lesson"".

Always have a spare power supply and uninterrupted source
2. Always have at least TWO methods of connection, even if 1 is dial-up, test it frequently - know where your nearest source of reliable internectivity is and how long you need to get there
3. Your customer and employer will only accept internectivity issue problems as an excuse once - after that they won't trust you, which will limit your options and may end your remote work, making it worse for everyone else
4. Create office hours and keep them, regardless of time zone, at first try and match your co-workers when possible - for the first 3 to 6 months, treat your personal life the same as you would in an office - don't stop work to do laundry or go shopping ""just because you're home"" - especially if partnered with someone who ""has a real job""...<p>When I got started I found it most useful to spring out of bed, start-up the computers, feed the cats, make coffee, get into sweats and get to work.

The internet is just late to the party.  The cool internet that agreed with your values just happened to be visible for the first few decades of its existence because you were the right demographic.  However it was inevitable that sooner or later the public at large would get a whiff of how cool the net was, and pretty soon money comes into the equation, and it's all downhill.<p>But in reality the cool internet is bigger today than it ever was before, it's just obscured by all the spammy, sock-puppetry, pointless-celebrity-tweeting bullshit that you've come to expect.

Mary Buffett wrote a book called ""Buffetology"" which is really accessible and quite good.  An author by the name of Timothy Vick has written several books on buffett.

For awhile there I bought all the ones I could find, and it was probably the best $100 I spent.<p>Eventually I created a spreadsheet that I'd use to do my net-present value analysis.  I'd take the stock's price, the historical growth, my estimated growth, and work back to figure out what my projected return would be in 5 years.<p>You know you've mastered investing when you're able to predict these returns pretty accurately, though it takes time to know if you were right or not. It is ok, there is no hurry, you can just put money aside and save it (though I'd hedge against inflation- I'd store it in gold or silver these days.)<p>Once understanding investment, economics came to play a huge role in my understanding of how things worked and where things are going.<p>The mises institute: <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a> is the best source of daily informative articles on economics.  They were talking about the housing bust around 2000-2001.  Mises himself predicted the great depression, the invasion of Austria (where he was from, and where his fellow economists laughed when he said that by the same time the next year the Nazis would have control) etc.   I don't read it all the time, and just read articles that I find useful.<p>The Mises institute has a lot of books for free from Mises and Rothbard that you can download, and from many other economists.<p>But probably the best book on economics to read is ""Economics in one lesson"" by Henry Hazlitt.
