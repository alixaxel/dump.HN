Even a dog's visual system is very advanced, if you consider it from the big picture in evolution of visual sensory system in animals. So in the interview ""if you can make a vision system that’s just as good as a dog"" is in some sense analogous to saying ""if you can simulate what's produced from 90% of visual evolution over these million years"", which is clearly, a bit over-optimistic as a starting goal.<p>That being said, wish them luck.

Remember that Watson also has to depress a physical button (the same buzzer everyone else uses).<p>The eye to finger path for humans is about 200ms.  It probably takes about 100ms for Watson to physically press the button.  So Watson is about 100ms faster.  But that also gives humans about a 100ms window in which to beat Watson.  This means that you need to start your press 100-200ms before Trebek finishes his last word.<p>That's pretty good sized window for most people given you are reading the question along with Trebek.

Basically, it is a modified version of IBM Scale-Out NAS [SONAS] that IBM offers commercially, but running Linux on POWER instead of Linux-x86. System p expansion drawers of SAS 15K RPM 450GB drives, 12 drives each, are dual-connected to two storage nodes, for a total of 21.6TB of raw disk capacity. The storage nodes use IBM's General Parallel File System (GPFS) to provide clustered NFS access to the rest of the system. Each Power 750 has minimal internal storage mostly to hold the Linux operating system and programs.<p>When Watson is booted up, the 15TB of total RAM are loaded up, and thereafter the DeepQA processing is all done from memory. According to IBM Research, ""The actual size of the data (analyzed and indexed text, knowledge bases, etc.) used for candidate answer generation and evidence evaluation is under 1TB."" For performance reasons, various subsets of the data are replicated in RAM on different functional groups of cluster nodes. The entire system is self-contained, Watson is NOT going to the internet searching for answers. """,1297399385

It's an opportunity to use things like analytics funnels, and such. Most of these things can't be done without one thing - users using your site. These types of sites are fun ways to potentially get to deal with that. As developers, it's easy to think of things functionally. To us, it's obvious why something would be useful based on its function. But, to the average non-technical user, it takes some extra thought into how can you explain something to them in a way that allows them to understand your service and why it'd be useful to them.<p>I kind of rambled there, but it's a fun technical thing.

That theorem says that you can't improve the performance of a classifier for some objective function, without making it worse on another -- in other words, all algorithms have an identical mean performance when averaged over all possible objective functions.<p>The reason this doesn't mean that human-level AI is impossible is that we too are designed (well, evolved by natural selection) to perform well for a particular objective function: one in which say, the standard laws of physics/optics apply. Optical illusions illustrate that our performance on this objective function is not perfect.<p>Moreover, you can see a human being's performance on a different objective function by, for example, trying to recognize objects in pictures which have been scrambled according to some predefined method (e.g. shuffle the pixels but use the same random seed each time). Each scene will still convey the same amount of information about the objects in it, but it'll be pretty tricky to recognize the objects.",1297399274

Computer vision systems suck.  There's a perfectly good one in our brains.  Why not try to understand what already works?<p>Contrary to what most would believe, brain-based computer vision has made a lot of progress in the past 20 years. Some might think there is a fundamental flaw in the ""brain-based"" approach given past failures, but that ignores that fact that those failures very likely happened due to a poor understanding of the brain at the time.<p>The work in brain-based computer vision however has been mostly academic. Brain-based computer vision <i>startups</i> are even more recent, and I think it's exciting to see the startup approach to solving what has been mostly an academic problem.  In a startup, the engineering mindset, quick iteration, as well as a lack of concern for publishing and other forces at play in academia could produce very different results.<p>I do agree that the 5 year promise is extreme, but I think we need time to see how this relatively new mode of work (both in terms of the technical approach, and the process of implementation in a startup) will play out before we call it a failure.<p>Full Disclosure:  I was an intern at Numenta last summer.",1297398350
