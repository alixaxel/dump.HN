There is one school of thinking that Google is profiting by farming information from the Internet, literally on the back of many people's labor. You can prove this by running a ""Google Sting"", that is known as ""Google bombing"". By having many people setting up honeypot to link an arbitrary keyword to certain URL, you seem to be able to fool Google to artifically associate such keyword with the URL, thus ""proving"" Google is profiting from your labor. I don't really buy this logic. But Google's accusation of Bing steal from them seems very close to this line of framing.",1296665945

2170916,comment,2170697,2170697,0,0,duncanj,,,"I found the reference to Dijkstra interesting because he was a huge advocate for up-front thinking.  The difference between Dijkstra and Waterfall is Dijkstra wanted the programmer to think before working on the feature.  The order in which features were developed was at a higher level.  Waterfall is about listing all the features beforehand and parceling them out to be implemented or scheduled on a monster Gantt chart.<p>A formal methods based process can definitely be agile, so long as the planning has a feedback loop that includes iteratively-developed finished products.<p>It is clear to me that formal methods are avoided because they are difficult.  It is very hard (I've tried) to learn to verify programs without formal education in the methods.  Yet, we can write software without formal methods and we can make it pretty darn correct without proving it correct.<p>Formal methods will probably not catch on unless a concerted effort is made by CS baccalaureate programs to teach it from the beginning.  I fear that most professors are not proficient enough to teach it.  So, it will probably be one of those things that may be a good idea but will be unlikely to ever gain traction.",1296665491

It is also clear that this is in no way an assurance that there are no situation of patent infringements, only that it seems that due diligence was performed. Also, WebM is not comparable to H264 in terms of technical sophistication (it is more in line with MPEG4/VC1) but this is clearly done to avoid recent patents; some of the patents on older specification are already expired (for example, all France Telecom patents on H264 are expired).""</i><p>There's also a follow up here which discusses the thought process behind the 49 potential H.264 patents:<p><a href=""http://carlodaffara.conecta.it/on-webm-again-freedom-quality-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carlodaffara.conecta.it/on-webm-again-freedom-quality...</a>",1296665317

There are a lot of hurdles to running a dating site, the primary ones being dealing with scammer accounts and a stigma with the media and advertisers that borders on the level of running a porn site.<p>However, if you've got some kind of unique angle (like Set For Marriage's focus on marriage-minded people or Ashley Madison's controversial focus on facilitating adultery) or some kind of newsworthy technology it's not really that hard to line up interviews with local news stations and blogs (the founder of Set For Marriage was interviewed by something like 15 local news stations around the US from a single press release and some nudging). Going to online dating conferences can also be very good too, as many of the people in the industry are very willing to help out serious and interesting newcomers.<p>There's definitely a challenge in building traffic though. AdWords and SEO for dating terms are very competitive, and affiliate traffic can be very scammer-heavy. CloudFlare, some decent flagging algorithms, and OCD developers who check for spam accounts multiple times a day can help out tremendously with this, and we've given one nice woman a lifetime premium account for reporting a ton of suspicious accounts to us.",1296665175

None of the patents can be asserted against H264 (nor can the partner companies in general), but any of them can be asserted against WebM.<p>Read JGG's account, which is still the best account to date at:\n<a href=""http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/archives/377"" rel=""nofollow"">http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/archives/377</a><p>Some quotes:<p>""But as noted in my previous post, merely being published by Google doesn’t guarantee that it is. Microsoft did similar a few years ago with the release of VC-1, which was claimed to be patent-free  but within mere months after release, a whole bunch of companies claimed patents on it and soon enough a patent pool was formed.""<p>""VP8 is simply way too similar to H.264: a pithy, if slightly inaccurate, description of VP8 would be ""H.264 Baseline Profile with a better entropy coder"".   Even VC-1 differed more from H.264 than VP8 does, and even VC-1 didn’t manage to escape the clutches of software patents.""<p>""Most importantly, Google has not released any justifications for why the various parts of VP8 do not violate patents, as Sun did with their OMS standard: such information would certainly cut down on speculation and make it more clear what their position actually is.""<p>And not about patents, but the quality of the spec:<p>""The spec consists largely of C code copy-pasted from the VP8 source code  up to and including TODOs, optimizations, and even C-specific hacks, such as workarounds for the undefined behavior of signed right shift on negative numbers. In many places it is simply outright opaque. Copy-pasted C code is not a spec. I may have complained about the H.264 spec being overly verbose, but at least it’s precise. The VP8 spec, by comparison, is imprecise, unclear, and overly short, leaving many portions of the format very vaguely explained. Some parts even explicitly refuse to fully explain a particular feature, pointing to highly-optimized, nigh-impossible-to-understand reference code for an explanation. There’s no way in hell anyone could write a decoder solely with this spec alone.""<p>But maybe Google will fix it?

2170740,comment,2170276,2170276,0,0,zeteo,,,"Cost-benefit analysis of various parenting styles seems like a good idea but, when the article goes much further than that and claims that Chua's parenting style has no benefits whatsoever, its arguments fall flat. The crucial passage:<p>""But hasn't all the musical practice indelibly shaped Chua's children's characters?  Highly unlikely.""<p>is supported by three claims, and when you follow the links that support turns out to be rather shaky.<p><i>Claim 1</i>: ""Behavioral genetics finds roughly zero effect of parents on personality.""<p><i>Supporting link</i>: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/01/implausible_wim.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/01/implausible_wim....</a><p>The claim is implausible (if such parenting can make the kids neurotic, other personality changes must certainly be possible), and the link is to an article where the blog author is not convinced by a book arguing the contrary of this claim. The argument is roughly analogous to saying the heliocentric theory has zero credibility because ""De revolutionibus orbium coelestium"" didn't contain enough measurements.<p><i>Claim 2</i>: ""contrary to teachers' fantasies about changing their students' lives, learning is highly specific""<p><i>Supporting link</i>: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/01/the_case_agains_5.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/01/the_case_agains_...</a><p>The study cited here seems to show that German students who take Latin as a foreign language perform no better on general intelligence measures than those who take English. Again, the <i>non sequitur</i> is staggering. The analogous argument is that practicing the piano is useless, because people who practice the violin get into colleges at least as good as those who practice the piano.<p><i>Claim 3</i>: ""the effects of environmental intervention erode over time""<p><i>Supporting link</i>: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/11/fade-out_teache.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/11/fade-out_teache....</a><p>The link shows that good teachers can make students a lot better on immediate test results than on longer-term measures of subject mastery. While this is interesting, it has zero relevance to the main argument, which was that grueling hours of practice have no effect on students' character.<p>Overall, the question posed and the approach are very interesting, but the subsequent argumentation turns out to be shaky and implausible.

It assumes that the only long-term benefit to knowing how to play the piano is that you can then earn money as a musician.  Bull.  He cites a paper that finds that learning <i>Latin</i> does not affect other test scores.  He twists the results in this article by saying ""X"" instead of ""Latin"" -- which is dishonest of him, he should have quoted what he actually said in the other article.  Numerous studies have found correlation with musical ability and math test scores, although I'm too lazy to look them up for a comment on HN.  The other thing going on is that by practicing so intensely you are getting better at practicing things.  That is an extremely valuable skill, or an extremely valuable habit if you wish to look at it that way.  Now I don't have any studies to back this up, so take my assertion with a grain of salt.<p>What's most sad about this article is how little he sees his own cultural bias.<p>He says that playing the piano is a worthless skill.  I don't see how that statement can be anything other than a value judgement about culture -- music is culture.  He says ""Cost-benefit analysis is not a Western prejudice.""  However, the particular cost you assign to training and the benefit you assign to the resulting skill is inherently relative, and his judgement that forcing a kid to learn piano is bad and knowing how to play a piano is worthless IS a prejudice.<p>His main attack on the science of the book is that he says there's no evidence that parents have any effect on a child's personality.  Let's assume this is true.  So what?  What about skills and habits?  Aren't those important?  (He mentions skills but not habits.  I assume that you can give a kid habits, such as brushing teeth before bed.)<p>It's also torturous to have to read how he discusses questions #1 and #2, which are presented up-front in the source material and don't really need 23 cm of article dedicated to them.<p>Now I'm not one to say that Amy Chua's method of parenting presented in ""Tiger Mother"" is superior.  I suspect I'd find ""Tiger Mother"" to be just another pop science book.  But this cost-benefit analysis is a particularly unsound attack on the practice.<p>I want to see evidence, one way or the other.  Sadly, it's not likely to come any time soon.<p></rant>",1296663002

Because its spec and patents have been extremely well documented for a decade (or so), commented on, and implemented (there are at least 10 implementations I know of).<p>Whereas WebM's details first came to light less than a year ago.<p>You're right that it is possible that either still violate some patent out in the wild.  BUT if you were to weigh the odds -- a nearly decade old open standard technology that has openly solicited and worked to get all potential patent holders in the pool OR a technology closed and proprietary until last year.  You really call even money on that?",1296662693

If Reflector had been open source and free, I'd have been willing to get this feature running. The benefit I'd derive from a working F# mode would likely make the effort worthwhile.",1296662680

Unfortunately, the latter are easier to use as college application fodder.<p>Why study music?  Because it can let you explore the edges of what your fine motor control is capable of, and what your senses and consciousness can perceive.  Because it is a doorway to the mysteries of art and being.  Because it can bring people together.  Because several years of intense study can bring someone pride in skill and deep joy and happiness for the rest of their lives.<p>Prioritizing a short-term gain (like enabling your kids to signal to college admissions officers in their teens) over all of the above strikes me as shallow.  To me, there is no excuse for besmirching something so wonderful as music by turning it into drudgery for the sake of impressing strangers.<p>That said, prioritizing an even shorter term gain -- like being untruthful to your kids and praising them for looking cute and making noises so they can experience an ersatz pride -- is an even shallower wallow in mediocrity.",1296662495
