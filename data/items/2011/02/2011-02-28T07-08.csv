I too was an original VC and I left <i>years</i> ago due to the support failings.<p>Look, we were investors in the truest sense.  TextDrive was this revolutionary new shared hosting platform with a lot of promise (flexibility, no overselling, etc).  Problem was that shared hosting is a commodity with no profit margins.  Since TextDrive was started by people who want to build cool shit, rather than people who knew anything about operations in a customer service industry, the result is a massive series of pivots that left us out in the cold.<p>I'm not making excuses for anyone here, personally I think Jason Hoffman spent way too much time in the forum sucking up the love, and not enough time figuring out how to run a support operation.  So he burnt his bridge with me as a customer.  I won't touch Joyent with a ten foot pole no matter how good it is.<p>But here's the thing: <i>that was their bridge to burn</i>.<p>It doesn't matter what 200 early customers think, because those 200 one-time payments were not going to build a successful company.  The bottom line is that the market for a ""premium"" shared hosting service got squeezed by commodity hosting on one side, and VPSes on the other.  Even if they had managed reasonable uptime (which they didn't because they totally underestimated the technical cost of giving people the freedom they did), it still would have been a doomed market, because VPSes got so cheap anyway.  We can complain about what a bad deal we got, but it doesn't change the fact that the last salary we paid was in 2005, and the hosting world has moved on.  They did what they had to.",1298879533

It isn't an open door - you need skills and/or a job offer, or you need to be in school. However, once you are there, you can apply for your health care card immediately. Some provinces have premiums - around $50 a month IIRC, which are waived if you are a student or make under a certain amount.<p>Note that the ""free health care"" only covers doctor and hospital visits/procedures. It does not cover dental, optical, or any medications. Like in the US, any Canadian employer will offer a benefits plan to cover these things, or you can purchase insurance for them on your own.<p>This is a trade-off though. There is not much of a startup scene in Canada. The few ""major"" tech centers are really weak compared to most US cities. There is not much innovation. How many tech startups can you think of that came out of Canada? They do exist, but the deck is clearly stacked against them. On the other hand, there is less competition for funding, so maybe you can use that as an advantage. I am sure you have read the PG article about why your city matters.<p>I've lived in both countries, and people in both get a ""grass is greener"" viewpoint (aside from the too-proud patriots on either side). It is easier to see the things you don't have and want, rather than the things that you do have and would miss.<p>My personal opinion is that the US is more extreme in all directions.

Startups frequently pay low salaries (ones that may not support the high cost of health insurance) in return for an equity stake that offers the possibility of a high future payout.  You cannot similarly defer health care benefits:  when cash is tight, you either offer costly benefits at the expense of other priorities or leave your employees without health insurance.  This tradeoff is not present if the insurance system isn't employer-based.<p>Of course this is only part of the explanation for how our system impedes entrepreneurship.  One way or another, we're all paying an absurd amount just to keep us (somewhat) healthy.<p><a href=""http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/02/chart-of-the-day-9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/02...</a>",1298879325

2270476,story,,,6,6,WhereToGo,"Ask HN: Where to go from here?",,"Hi all,<p>I'm posting under a throw away account because I have friends involved that would know my original account.<p>I've been interviewing at a Los Angeles-based game developer for a web developer position. I have a few friends who work there. The interview process is wrapping up, and has been great. Things are looking very positive. I'm very positive that I will be receiving an offer from them.<p>I'm from the mid-west, working at a small company that I truly dislike. I also have friends here, which at least makes being at work enjoyable, but is despise my boss because of certain things he does. I could go on for hours about him, but mainly I just feel like he doesn't deserve the things he has managed to get - he's just a scumbag. I code at work here, too. I'm aching to quit but am scared to quit without something to move to - I only have about $10,000 saved up.<p>So, this job change would seemingly be a great opportunity. It'd put me out in CA doing web coding at a young, neat company. But, I honestly feel in my gut that it's not what I want. I just feel like what I'd be doing there would be so insignificant. I want to be creating neat, useful tools that help people on a daily basis. I want to be creating services of value to people. It is what I have always been passionate about.<p>So I am confused as to what I should do. Moving to California has always been a dream of mine, but not under these circumstances, really. I always thought that if I were moving out there, it'd be to San Francisco to live out my dream. I just think if I moved to LA, I'd stare out the window wishing it were SF I was looking at. It's not exactly about location, for me, it's more about doing what I love and feeling fulfilled by it.<p>This feeling has been ramping as I proceed through this interview. I just read this blog post (http://www.tawheedkader.com/2010/09/how-i-made-a-principled-decision-to-quit-my-six-figure-day-job/) and am in a pretty irrational state of mind right now. I feel like quitting my current job, turning down this game company offer if they make it, and using my $10,000 to try to bootstrap my own project. This would be the most insane course of action if I were to ask anyone in my family, or maybe even anyone else at all. But, I feel like life is short and if I don't try this now then I'll never have the chance again.<p>What do you all think? Should I take this new job offer if it's made, and move out to LA? Should I remain at my current job, and bootstrap something in my free time? Should I go all in, and quit my current job and bootstrap something?",1298878872

There are a lot of designers that think that there is zero difference between print design and web design. The only difference being sending the finalized design to the printer or the programmers. (I.e. I design in my little corner over here, and poop out my design to you code monkeys that are little more than the automatons that will construct my vision) This may not apply to all or even a majority, but there are good numbers of them out there.",1298878772

When mastering a CD, the antialiasing filter still needs to shut off at 22.050 Hz and there is nothing oversampling can do to improve this.<p>You can use really long, linear-phase look-ahead FIR filters that are way better than the analogue IIR filters of the olden days, but the filter slopes still have to cut off between 18-22 kHz, which means some ~60dB+ per octave. A filter like this will always produce audible artifacts. This is pure physics and there is nothing we can do about this.",1298876418
