If I value my marginal time at $50/hr, and unconsciously always choose to pay to save time, the mindset becomes ingrained and is hard to reverse.<p>Little things that you quickly grow accustomed to like taxis, dry cleaners, restaurants (plus a few big things like a mortgage or high rent from living alone in a decent apartment, car and all related expenses, etc) all add up very quickly.<p>I think that's one of the biggest advantages college students have when starting a company.

Now, click-thru ad-rates are important, but the impact on your clients, customers, and how they perceive you & your business is also super-duper important too.   I like to say: ""what produces me to use this product, or download this app, or use this ""service"", and what I find, is that I'm always looking for: who built the app, who runs this company, and what impression I get from the web-copy/content.  The cloak and dagger approach does not work, especially if you're trying to get ""respectful"" clients; clients that actually pay for the service you render or who respect what you do as a company.<p>People forgot that we are human, and when you make someone feel that humans run a company - your impact will be huge, and you will notice this with customer satisfaction, and retention.<p>Take the social approach.. Be open, show who runs the company, have a blog, communicate with your customers, show them that you're real and have fun.

In principle, you could do the same thing with C - in fact, you likely wouldn't even have to change the language definition, since the egregious abuses in C mostly result in ""undefined behaviour"", which allows the implementation to detect and trap them rather than hose the machine.

It's the reason why I care about it and I guess lots of other people feel the same way.<p>That you _can_ do things doesn't mean that it's nice or morally okay.<p>Looking at the numbers: Yes, I don't know what Canonical needs or not. If it makes a dent. I hope that I clearly marked this parts of my opinion as nothing but guesswork. Looking at the numbers the banshee project made public I still stand to my claim though and feel that this - so far - is not money you need to tap into as a company.<p>Regarding the switch: You seem to imply that this is kind of a nice thing. As if Canonical was 'allowing' banshee to be the default player. You indicate that this is a kind of 'benefit'. I'd say that the users just wanted that music player and Canonical (or, the Ubuntu project) listened [1], [2], [3]. Providing a music player of their users' choice is not a nice gesture where they help out a weird, unknown & tiny project, they are choosing a product that was available (although optionally) on their platform for a long time as a new default to suit their business needs already.<p>Again: In my world, they are already profiting from the banshee project, ignoring Amazon sales. Integrating Ubuntu One sales was a (fine, great, understandable) business decision. Implying that they can change a 'buy here and you make Amazon donate to Gnome' (yes, the wording is obviously not neutral) plugin, because they are nice enough to distribute the banshee product as a default media player in Ubuntu is outragous in my world.<p>Edit: Just stumbled upon this part of your answer: 'I think it's a bit presumptuous to assume that Canonical doesn't need the revenue from the music sales.'<p>This is mightily misleading and misrepresenting my post. I'm not sure if you don't know or if that is a mistake, but Ubuntu/Canonical DO (potentially) already get money from banshee users. Their own store is integrated in banshee as well [4] and the decision that they backed off from [5] was in fact that they wanted to ship only their own plugin. Which would've been fine. With that decision users by default would've been forced to<p>a) buy using Ubuntu One (100% to Canonical) or<p>b) buy elsewhere, possibly using the disabled by default Amazon extension, which might donate to the Gnome Foundation.<p>They changed their route and I have a hard time understanding it (mind you, again, not from a business perspective. If you like to tack the Greed Badge on your shirt, and probably you need to as a company, this is fine.

There's no way to segregate individual user data and still get the benefits of hardware accelerated encryption. For systems that need segregated users (or even something like an unencrypted system volume with a single encrypted user), you need to toss encryption hardware into the upstream IO pipeline for any benefit. Sticking such hardware into the drive is too restrictive, and also raises the cost of each drive.<p>Furthermore, many chipsets (such as Nehalem and Sandy Bridge) have integrated AES acceleration that offer <i>significant</i> encryption/decryption performance improvements. While encrypted reads/writes will never match the performance of standard reads/writes, Nehalem and SB very much mitigate the performance hit and will still give multi-hundred MB/s throughput on fast SSDs.<p>If I were Apple, I'd ignore TCG Opal and focus on distributing Nehalem and Sandy Bridge throughout the product lineup. (Or, in the case of iOS devices, toss custom ASICS on the upstream IO pipeline.) Then you can offer true encrypted user segregation (or one encrypted user and an unencrypted OS volume) while still buying standard HDDs and SDDs in bulk. Win-win.",1298595694

I don't know tapjoy personally, but I do some CPA deals online for brands you're familiar with.  If the customer isn't known/predicable they get the absolute bottom of the barrel ad inventory until we know whether it converts at all.  If it doesn't convert at all, we cut you loose.  If it does, I squeeze every penny I can out of you, and hopefully everyone's happy.<p>If you can, it's worth investing time/money to learn the market yourself.",1298595622

Recently I couldn't find the cli utility to manage a raid card because the ports system had an out of date location for the source. I was reduced to shutting down a production server just to flip some configuration bits. Freebsd is absolutely rock solid as an OS. The support from certain hardware vendors is a different story.",1298595604
