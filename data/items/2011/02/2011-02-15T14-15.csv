I graduated in a ""marketing communications"" program that spanned design, business, marketing and web development. Unfortunately, coming from a semi-autodidactic background I found it to be truly superficial. It was painful to know the proper way to build a site, versus the default dreamweaver snippets taught. The same for design, and I can only assume the business component too. However, the upside is still important: flexibility in approach and thinking, meaning graduates won't think to fix a solution in the only way they were trained (nee: ""when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.)<p>Blank's recommendation of both broad-area and foundation is better, and could be seen to stem from the ""a-words"" around here: art school. The broad-area art degree requires the student to learn both a core discipline, along with a wide variety of other art areas.",1297781998

Certainly, they do narrow the possibilities down.  However, by dismissing arguments of hacking or sharing an IP address as rubbish, an IP address effectively becomes a person's identity regardless of whether they can completely control it.  Since many users are not technically savvy, they cannot control what happens at an IP address.  Hence, parents and grandparents get sued for their kids behavior, coffee shops with open wifi face litigation, schools and businesses must enforce draconian security measures just to enforce a strong tie between a person and an IP when that tie is not natural.",1297781936

It doesn't feel like it's a fair fight otherwise, since it means he's exploiting a weakness intrinsic to his competitors.

2221377,comment,2220519,2220519,0,0,nchlswu,,,"Personally, I've never been surprised at Wave's apparent failure. To me, it was no different than any other attempt at a ""revolutionary idea"" that didn't work later in another revision or iteration (I think Hacker News readers understand this very well;a poor analogy would be a Microsoft Tablet and an iPad). A lot of discussion about it's failure is a direct result of Google's status and the amount of resources required to come up with a product like wave.<p>When I consider Wave in retrospect, I really think they limped in on this . It was a grand experiment. If they really wanted this to succeed, I don't think they would have proceeded with the launch the way they did. Reading the Quora answer sort of jives with this.<p>I'm surprised no discussion touched upon the Anonymous response in the Quora thread. It's more interesting than ""why Wave failed"" and is indicative of the state of Google. It brings an additional perspective to the discussion around Google's (apparent) talent retention problems. Combined with other anecdotal evidence, it really look like Google is at a loss for how to continually motivate employees with their current organizational structure",1297781875

Its just another adjustment you would do even with your roommate.<p>I've been married for last 8 years and also have a kid. I feel, the best of marriage is lived when you share everything - talk out every feeling - help each other achieve the small dreams - LIVE together! Every relationship, even a mother-child/friends/brother-sister - they all have conflicts - and most of it because of expectations. Without 'expectations' there cannot exist a relation. The key is to achieve the balance - try to give enough space/freedom to each other so that both gets to do the things they enjoy the most - try to find your happiness in the same, if you can, or at least support it in some way.<p>For household responsibilities, it should be equally and mutually shared. But 'don't talk so much' is definitely not the approach to avoid conflicts. We are not machines; the whole point of 'living' is to 'share'; and Humans Do Need to Share. What else do you need to marry for? Better stay bachelor, if you don't think you can shoulder the responsibility to 'share' and handle 'expectations'.",1297781734

Don't get me wrong, the vast majority of ideas that ""beginners"" pitch are ill-informed or naive to the point that the idea is just unusable, but occasionally, you'll come across a rare gem contains some insight that is outside the reach of a master.<p>The key is that the beginner very rarely frames their ideas in the language of the programmer, so we have a tendency to simply check out of the conversation. I like to engage idea people and use them as a springboard for ideas. They're often so excited to talk to someone who they know can make their idea happen that they'll take direction from you. Then again, they're sometimes completely hard headed and stuck in their idea rut. As the master, you get to decide who you want to engage and who you don't.<p>I've worked hard on building my skills at gaining trust and guiding the conversation with idea people.

The ""spoonfeeding"" layer and the ""worker"" layer.<p>In nginx/fastcgi, nginx is the spoonfeeding layer and the fastcgi worker procceses are, you guessed it, the workers.  Nginx effectively acts as a proxy, holding open the thousands of connections users have made but only a small fraction of them are actually being worked on by the worker processes at any given moment.<p>With apache/mod_php there is no spoonfeeding layer.  Every single apache child has the php interpreter loaded and acts as a worker process.   When you look at your nginx vs. your apache setups think of apache children as the fascgi workers <i>not</i> as nginx.<p>Most of the time people switch to nginx and claim amazing results what got them that was the addition of a spoonfeeding layer.  Technically, you could have done that several other ways.  Most higher end sites who've had to care about this stuff for years let the loadbalancer handle the spoonfeeder layer, that way the (web)appservers can focus on being appservers.  Doesn't matter if its a $120K Netscaler or a $0 copy of varnish or ha-proxy bound to localhost, the point is you never want a 1:1 relationship between ""active but idle user connections"" and ""worker processes"".",1297780158

Perhaps that's the problem right there. As someone who has written a lot of C++ for quite some time, the most nightmarish aspect tends to be working with antique codebases.<p>The way people program in it has changed drastically over the last ten or so years. It's possible to have a reasonably painless experience with modern C++ that is pretty much impossible with codebases with significant history.<p>A lot of that is because the compiler support simply wasn't mature enough, so people did what they had to do to ship.

2221189,comment,2220519,2220519,0,0,tseabrooks,,,"Despite the hype... I don't think Wave failed. I blame all of 'us' (where 'us' is defined as alpha geeks, silicon valley startup folks, techies, etc) for this misrepresentation. We all this products must be wildly successful with millions of users or it has failed... we tend to see failure and success as this very black and white / binary thing... but it's not.<p>Google is probably discontinuing use of Wave because it didn't live up to their expectations and didn't have as many users as they need it to in order for it to be viable. If this were created by a smaller company, however, it could still be considered successful... I haven't been able to find any numbers on how many active users wave has but I'd guess somewhere around 50k - 100k... For any smaller company that'd be a huge success...<p>I'm really tired of reading all of the rhetoric that acts as if it's just oh so obvious that Wave isn't a good product. For 50k users it's a great product that they love... It doesn't need to have 2 million users to be a good product... Personally, I think Wave is a BRILLIANT piece of software and I use it exclusively for communication with my 6-10 close personal friends.<p>I have one gripe - the mobile interface is terrible... Maybe if this could've been fixed more people would've used it.",1297778716

We were a bunch of ex-Wavers though, so we were more likely than others to still be holding on.<p>I should point out that our internal version of Wave was different from the external version in at least one very important way: when a wave was shared with a group that you were a member of, the wave was sent to your inbox. Externally, you would have to set up a search to find that wave, so basically nobody ever read group waves. The idea behind the decision was to reduce inbox noise (particularly important in beginning few months), but that also meant reducing utility for group collaboration.<p>We were close to releasing proper groups support in the external version, so you could easily choose which groups to follow/unfollow inside your Wave inbox, but were discontinued before that made it out.<p>So, Wave was awesome for group collaboration, but unfortunately, we never gave the external world much of a real opportunity to witness that.<p>(And yes, there were other issues with Wave. Just thought I'd point out that one.)",1297778414
