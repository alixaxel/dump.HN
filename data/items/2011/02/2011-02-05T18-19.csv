Chemotherapy kills a lot of people, simply because the whole purpose of it is to kill a tumor with poisons. Does that mean that chemo should be banned? Of course not, because people who take chemo drugs are probably going to die if nothing is done.<p>Likewise, opiates kill a lot of people. But how many people would forgo life-saving surgery because of the pain they would have to live with after the surgery if effective painkillers were illegal? My guess is a lot more than the number of people who are killed by opiates directly.<p>The duty of the FDA is to make sure that drugs are safe and effective. If they're overpermissive, more people will die of drugs themselves. If they're too restrictive, people won't get the medicine they need to stay alive. It's a tricky balance to strike, and I think the FDA is doing a reasonably good job.",1296932308

It's human nature to rationalize.<p>The bottom line is that Bing's index contains associations that it could never have figured out if Google hadn't figured them out first.

Just turn it off and let everyone observe that the quality is 99.9% as good as it used to be, and avoid any accusation of copying.<p>By refusing to turn it off, Microsoft makes it clear that it <i>is</i> an important part of their index, and that they have no qualms about having an important part of their index ripped off wholesale from their biggest competitor.

The exact age and type of vaccine used might be if there are various options and risks to weigh, and as a parent I might want to choose those, but vaccinating our children against incurable diseases they are likely to be exposed to isn't up for debate in my mind.  Why, as a society, would we not want to wipe out said disease?<p>Now, I think of my own vaccination history (hypothetically).  When I was a kid, they didn't vaccinate us against Hep-B. They didn't. It wasn't part of the program.  Then a few decades later when I had a Hep-B scare and read up on it, I said, WTF, how on earth are we not vaccinating our society against one of the most virulent diseases on the planet?<p>(The answer would be cost, and chances of someone from my country contracting it short of travel to other locations or IV drug use)<p>We stopped vaccinating against smallpox before I was born.  IF smallpox shows up again, that will change.<p>Handling this a society requires trusting your health organisations - and that's where the problem comes in - people these days don't trust the established authorities.<p>A single unvaccinated child in a vaccinated society is not a risk to the entire society.  A small number of unvaccinated children spread around a vaccinated society is not a risk to the entire society. 
At a certain number, i imagine, things suddenly go from ""safe"" to ""deadly"" with no middle ground.... so this is the type of problem that can probably be dealt with through education rather than force.",1296932127

I did this at the inspiration of a book on continuous improvement I read.  I analyzed the underlying causes of the defects, organized them by category, made Pareto charts, and looked at my underlying procedures to see how I could avoid them.<p>What I learned surprised me, and changed the way I approached projects from then on.  What I learned was that by far the number one problem I needed correct in order to avoid production defects and downtime had nothing to do with my code.<p>I discovered that the number one cause of avoidable defects in production had to do with the quality of my test data, differences between production environments and test environments, and discipline in how code gets promoted to production.  And of course establishing a process for such things as promoting code-- a process which is formalized, followed, every time, and continuously improved as needed.<p>Learning this gave me a new respect and appreciation for the importance of a faithful and realistic staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.  It's often impractical or expensive to various degrees to replicate or simulate a production environment faithfully for a variety of reasons.  What I learned is that not all projects deserve the expense and trouble of that faithful reproduction of the production environment, running production loads in staging.  But to whatever degree we don't do that, we take on more risk, and it's good to at least understand those risks.<p>Perhaps I'm talking more about project management, infrastructure, process and procedure than about pure ""programming"".  But what I learned through this one year exercise was that often times when people think about wanting to get better at programming, improvements in some of those areas are really what's needed to get to the higher tiers of excellence.",1296931966

I don't know what the author's experience has been, but I've seen the recommendation to trim Apache back to 10-15 MaxClients all over the place, and when we took that advice, the results were catastrophic to app performance. We almost fell apart during an event because of slow clients tying up Apache processes. We did plenty of benchmarking prior to going live, but getting a picture of real world performance is a lot harder than running `siege -c 250 <a href=""http://hostname`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hostname`</a> against your server. If you're going to trim Apache back that far, I'd recommend turning off KeepAlive altogether. You want that Apache process free immediately. If you are forced to run a config this tight, it's likely that you can afford the CPU and interrupt overhead of setting up a new TCP/IP session, but you can't afford the extra processes lying around idle, sucking up memory and MaxClient slots. In other words you're heavily memory bound.<p>So let me be clear about this: Trimming MaxClients to 10-15 is <i>horrible</i> advice if you don't understand what your actual memory usage (maybe you can run more) is and the impact of slow clients. I trimmed our Apache modules back to a bare minimum, resulting in an average Apache process size of 0.45 MB. Yes, less than 512 KB per Apache process. We run 'MaxClients' 150 with zero fear of running out of memory. If you're running a PHP based site, your Apache process size is going to be larger, but you had better know what that is before you start tweaking your MaxClients config.<p>I should probably write a blog post about tweaking Apache settings, because I've learned a lot of ""hard knocks"" lessons, not the least of which is ""understand your web server's memory usage"", but here are some quick tips in the mean time:<p>* Unload modules you don't need! Saving a couple megabytes of memory across 100 Apache processes means saving 200 MB of memory.<p>* To understand how much memory Apache processes are using, DO NOT rely on `top`. Have a look at the way `passenger-memory-stats` calculates <i>real</i> memory usage [1].<p>* Understand the output of `free -m`, especially the ""-/+ buffers/cache"" line.<p>* Do not rely on benchmarking tools like siege to tell you the whole story. Slow clients are difficult to account for.<p>* If you have to run a limited number of MaxClients, or you run up against your MaxClients limit frequently, try turning off KeepAlive [2].<p>If you follow those tips, you'll see a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of your Apache config for your environment, because that's what it comes down to. Apache is a fantastic web server, but it has to be configured to fit your environment. I don't have any dislike for nginx, but a lot of the nginx recommendations I see are born out of the inability to properly configure their existing web server. If you don't already know/understand Apache, I wouldn't hesitate to make the jump to nginx. It is also a fantastic web server.  Hopefully this has helped someone.<p>1 - <a href=""https://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/blob/master/bin/passenger-memory-stats"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/blob/master/bin/pa...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/86550/apache-keep-alive-or-not-keep-alive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverfault.com/questions/86550/apache-keep-alive-or-...</a>",1296931328

It is quite another for you to endorse the use of violence for the ""Crime"" of not being politically correct.<p>By not getting vaccinations, they are putting other people's health at risk (cf. herd immunity, and children too young to be vaccinated). This is not simply an issue of free choice or ideology. This is not an issue of just what the consequences are to themselves (if it were, I wouldn't have issue). The issue is that they are endangering the lives of others. Force, or the threat of force, is a reasonable response to the endangerment of human lives. I would go so far as to say that it's qualitatively similar to murder (though quantitatively smaller). We have several documented cases every year of infants too young to receive the vaccination dying of whooping cough that they contracted from unvaccinated adults.<p>""Things are not up for debate"" only in the sense that no amount of rhetoric can disprove an empirically proven fact.  The facts, which were arrived at through science, are that vaccines save lives, and that when individuals are not vaccinated they put not just themselves but other people at danger as well. In the hypothetical, were science to discover new facts disproving this, I would revise my opinion, but these facts have been established over such a long time by so many studies that I consider the odds not just remote but literally impossible.<p>My experience, and you may be an exception although I doubt it, is that people who are ideologically opposed to vaccines have read scientific studies, but aren't actually familiar with science as a process. That is to say, they read a study, and think that it's science and its conclusion must be true. Evaluating a study means also examining its process for sources of bias, examining alternative explanations, and reproducing results in repeated studies. The effectiveness of vaccines and the concept of herd immunity has gone through that process. Anti-vaccination literature that I have seen does not withstand that process.",1296930794

2183554,comment,2182852,2183221,0,0,Mz,,,"""Cite your sources or speak from firsthand experience"" is a standard I have long been accustomed to in certain online forums.  Since I do not know anyone who has gotten well like I have after being so very sick, I frequently speak from first hand experience.  I am well aware that my experience flies in the face of what most people understand to be true.  In some circles, my experience as someone who has had steady forward progress for 10 years straight is viewed as a credential. I am well aware not everyone views it that way.<p>Cultural practices:<p>In Africa, for I believe ebola (see the book ""The Hot Zone""), tribal elders barricaded the roads into and out of the area, told their people ""do not go to the white man's hospital (because you would go with a broken leg and die of infection) and quarantined sick people to their huts. They would leave food outside the door.  If the food stayed there too many days, they burned the hut to the ground without going in to check if anyone was still alive.  This finally contained the problem when modern/western/conventional medicine was failing to do so.<p>Historically in the US, it was common practice to contain the spread of venereal disease by getting the names of all your prior sexual contacts and contacting them to make sure they got treatment if necessary.  This went out of fashion with the advent of AIDS, probably because it was in America primarily a disease of gays and IV drug users who had good reason to not want to give up those names.  My understanding is this is part of what fueled the search for a vaccine for AIDS.<p>During the plague in Europe, flea markets were born of a desire to keep traveling sales people and their fleas out of the city to try to prevent the spread of the plague.  Farmers would leave their goods by the side of the road and leave a dish filled with vinegar.  Buyers would take food and leave coins in the vinegar, to try to kill the infection so the farmers wouldn't catch it.<p>Cooking is so widespread it is not really viewed as specifically intended to prevent the spread of disease.  But undercooked or raw meat is well known to spread infection. Similarly, monogamy is a very widespread cultural value, in part because it helps reduce the spread of disease.<p>The name ""malaria"" basically means ""bad air"".  They did not know what caused it but did understand that you got it from visiting the swamps.  One practice was to live in the mountains to try to not be exposed to ""bad air"".  Since mosquitoes don't typically go up to higher altitudes, this was somewhat effective in protecting people.<p>A ""gin and tonic"" was developed as a means to protect against malaria.  Europeans who were living in Africa would drink a gin and tonic nightly in hopes of killing the infection before it was too developed to effectively treat.  Similarly, in Europe during the middle ages, it was standard practice to drink alcohol with dinner instead of water because the well water was usually not safe to drink.  It was too filled with bacteria.<p>There are many ways in which cultures prevent the spread of disease using cultural or lifestyle practices in place of drugs and vaccines.  Diseases like AIDS have proven so far to be much harder to treat than to avoid getting by just not engaging in certain practices.<p>As for goalposts, sorry, but my mental model is different from yours.  For example, I believe cancer is most likely viral and is thus infectious, though it doesn't spread rapidly like a cold.  Human papilloma virus is known to cause cervical cancer and this is why women get annual pap smears -- to test for it.  Women who have had more than X number of partners (IIRC, 20 partners) are at increased risk of getting cervical cancer because it is caused by a virus which is hard to catch but is apparently sexually transmissible.  Warts and cold sores are also caused by virii and cause ""growths"" on the body, similar to the way cancer causes tumors.  Mulloskum (sp?) is a viral infection which causes growths on the skin similar to skin tags.  These growths are described in the literature as ""benign tumors"".<p>Diet, certain herbs and supplements, and an eye towards body chemistry can prevent viral infection and/or effectively treat it, something modern medicine generally does a poor job of.  So, yes, I believe these things can be not only as effective but more effective than vaccines, antibiotics and other modern drugs.",1296929343

(A lesson Apple probably learned right after the original 1984 commercial.)<p>So, why is this still so popular?  I think it is a form of ideological immunization.  IF you characterize your opponents derogatorily (extreme example: comparing jews to rats by the nazis) you rally your troops with feelings of superiority.<p>Once Apple users are seen as inferior, all their arguments immediately become null and void.  Political parties do this too- conservatives are characterized by liberals as rejecting science, liberals are characterized by conservatives as being irresponsible or pot smokers.<p>I don't think this is good for society.  I much prefer (no surprise given I'm an apple fan) the ""I'm a Mac"" ads that apple did.  Though I think PC users missed out that the PC was the most sympathetic of the characters, because they expected it to be derogatory to PC users and so that's how they saw it. (illustrated by Microsofts ""I'm a PC"" campaign which was a response to the ads they thought Apple was making, not the ads apple was actually making.)<p>So, when Motorola says Apple is Big Brother who are they kidding?

2183540,comment,2183415,2183415,0,0,mcmatterson,,,"Good article overall, but there is one major problem with the section on public-key auth; it's rarely a good idea to use blank pass phrases on your private keys, for two good reasons:<p>1. The security implications. Without a passphrase, anyone who manages to snare a copy of your private key can use it to access any servers where you've authorized it with no further credentials needed. Not good. Using a passphrase turns SSH auth into a poor man's two factor system: what you have (the key file), and what you know (the passphrase).<p>2. It breaks agent-forwarding, which is the system that gives you the ability to SSH onwards from the remote machine to other machines without (again) being asked for your password. This has practical implications when using SSH to drive things like application deployment over git, when you have to ssh onward from the server to your git repository. 
Doing things this way sidesteps the awkward use of deploy keys, and is actually easier to set up and use as well as being more secure. With agent forwarding, there's no need to keep your private key anywhere except your 'home' machine, and yet you get the same benefits your would if you had it everywhere.<p>The annoyance of having to type in your passphrase every time is greatly lessened by the use of a key agent on your 'home' machine. OS X has provided a key agent since 10.5 I believe, and stores the passphrase in your Keychain (you know you're doing things right if an OS X dialog box prompts  you for your passphrase when running SSH in the terminal). Gnome has one built in as well, and ssh-agent is always around for people who want to roll their own.<p>If there's interest, I'll write up a blog post about how to get this stuff set up. It's not really easily discoverable stuff, but it _is_ really simple and useful once you get it up and running.",1296929038
