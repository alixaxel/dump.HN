2209132,comment,2204699,2208248,0,0,jerf,,,"""Then I must have misunderstood your point.""<p>You still are. The core point is different people will measure things differently. The point is that what Person A sees as a minor injustice that he committed against B, B sees as a major injustice because it happened to <i>him</i>. There's an old quote attributed to Mel Brooks where I found it online, though the core quote has been around longer than that: ""Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down an open manhole cover and die."" That's the part of my point you're missing (and I do not think merely disagreeing with), people valuate injustices that happen <i>to them</i> much higher than things that happen to other people, let alone their <i>enemies</i>. Part of why I think you can't be disagreeing with it is this is undeniably true; people are not neutrally scrupulously fair on any level when it comes to their own possessions or desires. Everybody carries around an enormous self-bias, for various reasons, not all of them even bad.<p>Yes, society has come to some basic agreements, but that's not relevant to my point. I explicitly stated that retaliation isn't always unjust, and for another I also explicitly said that while each side <i>perceived</i> its retaliation as just the net effect is an unjust spiral. The perceptions are not the same on all sides. Every major conflict in the world is between a righteous and holy side that only commits justifiable and regrettable retaliation against the bad guys who inexplicably engage in acts of pure, unadulterated evil just for the fun of it and just won't leave us alone... and this describes the beliefs of <i>both</i> sides. Sticking the happy side of this label on ""our side"" with Anonymous is not something I'm ready to do, not ready to overlook the means to their ends, however wonderful the ends may be.<p>And none of this is a refinement of or a contradiction of anything else I've already said, just trying to lay the same basic point out yet more clearly.",1297479407

They will go on to study for more advanced degrees while the people who had to hustle for their grades go off to work in a convenience store or whatever.<p>The real problem is that people who are not smart enough to be studying for a degree even end up there in the first place.<p>In the UK it hasn't really cost much historically to spend three years getting a degree. (This is all about to change, with fees rising to £9000 soon - still very cheap compared to the USA.)<p>Many young people here in the UK have felt that it would be crazy not to go and study a very easy degree subject for three years.

2209126,comment,2208159,2208945,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> Even if the cars turn out to all be fine (and we don't know that yet)<p>Test enough cars and you'll find consistent defects. Test yet more and you'll find consistent and potentially life threatening defects. Is this a fatal problem with your product? Yes. Is it acceptable? Yes.<p>No one would envision my hifi burning my house down, but if it turned on (and it turned itself on at 9pm and off at 11pm every day, I never found out why because it didn't even have a timer or alarm circuit) and something failed in <i>just that right way</i> then yes my house could burn down. If my accelerator has a defect and fails in <i>just that right way</i> then yes I could crash... <i>or</i> I could put my car into neutral like a non-retarded person, or I could drop into 1st or 2nd gear (even in an automatic, which way too many people don't even know they have a 1st and 2nd gear), or I could just take my foot off the accelerator and apply it to the brake.<p>I'm sorry, but when it comes down to the simple facts that all these accidents were caused by driver error, or in the very few cases where defects did exist the accidents were ultimately caused by inexperienced drivers, and yes a person driving for 30 years can be way more inexperienced than someone who just got their license. Vehicles ultimately fail-safe. If you turn you engine off, you're left with a vehicle with no power steering and no power brakes. If you're on a highway your power steering is largely irrelevant anyway, unless they suddenly started introducing hairpin turns on all the national highways that I've yet to learn about. Your brakes, again, don't need to be power assisted for them to work, all you have to do is get to a shoulder and let your vehicle roll to a damn stop.<p>There's claims that switching the engine off while in motion is dangerous, but that's a wholly unproven and rather stupid claim. The problem, if there is one, is that people would panic and over-steer because of the resistance of the wheel, which <i>would</i> be deadly at 70mph. However, that's still <i>driver error</i>.<p>There's only one thing I find dangerous that car manufacturers have let remain for a long time, is that your brakes are a fail-deadly system. Hydraulic brakes need manual-pressure to <i>activate</i> whilst air-brakes are a fail-safe system requiring manual pressure to release. This would mean that in that situation where you have to turn your engine off at highway speeds, your brakes would gently start applying as the PSI drops in the air compressor.<p>You're claiming it's unacceptable to hide a problem with your product, but you're naively not understanding that there is <i>always</i> a defect margin and if that's within the government required percentage then they really shouldn't need to publicly disclose anything at all because it's in the publics best interest not to know that every appliance we own has the potential to defect in a way that could kill us.<p>I had a humble old school MP3 player that melted itself because for some bizarre reason it tried to charge the alkaline battery in it. Worse yet, the battery connectors were actually gold plated and managed to burn a series of parallel lines into my desk. If it had been set on a piece of paper and had been equally as unattended, I'd have likely set my desk alight.",1297479218

Starting with a from-scratch codebase may or may not offer you a shield but likely not - this is because the concept of ""trade secrets"" is much broader than the code itself and a former employer can (normally) easily argue that you are gaining an unfair competitive advantage from your superior knowledge of the confidential information relating to its proprietary product and that you would be misusing such knowledge (which, by law, belongs to the employer exclusively) in using it to do an allegedly independent implementation. The employer might find it hard to win such a case but this would not stop them from making your life hell for several years as you try to defend yourself from such an assault.<p>Short answer: there is no absolute defense in the fact of your no longer being employed when you do the allegedly offending activity.<p>BTW, I don't know enough about the Andreessen or Google examples to comment intelligently on the specifics there.",1297478761

2209109,comment,2208718,2208823,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I think you're failing to understand the purpose of a patent pool here.  MPEG-LA is an organization that licenses a broad-pool of patents to companies interested in licensing them.  They actually have a number of pools, though the H.264/AVC one is probably the most well known.  MPEG-LA in turn, represents about 30 licensor companies that all have patents (on the order of thousands) in this H.264/AVC pool.  The money they get from licensees (on the order of a 1,000 or so) is then split among the licensors (minus an administration fee by MPEG-LA, naturally).  MPEG-LA _explicitly_ makes it clear that they are not providing any assurance (in fact, they make it clear, it's impossible to do so) that all of the essential patents to distribute a AVC/H.264 product are included in the pool.<p>So - MPEG-LA can't ""Infringe"" on a patent with H.264, as they don't distribute any H.264 products.  All they do is license several thousands patents from 30 licensor companies to approximately 1,000 licensees.  They have no obligation to communicate, evaluate, or otherwise publicize whether a patent submitted to this potential VP8 pool would be useful to their H.264 licensees.<p>Now - the question then comes out, ""How is it that the H264 LIcensors think they have _any_ protection against some patent holding company out there?  What prevents someone with a critical H.264 patent from going after Microsoft, or Apple and asking for $500Million claim?""<p>Apparently, this is where the concept of estoppel by laches comes into play.  MPEG-LA went out of it's way to (A) Put out a call for any patents essential to H.264, and (B) Published, very openly, the names of every licensor.  Anyone with a patent that is essential to H.264 has had every opportunity to come forth with one - it's been very, very, very public who they could contact.  At a certain point, you can't delay your claims, or you lose some of your standing to claim them.  This doesn't guarantee that the licensors won't face a lawsuit some time in the future, but it certainly tips the legal scales somewhat in their favor, and likely reduces the potential for a charge of willful infringement and the damages that come along with such.<p>One of the purposes of Patent Pools, is to create this ""certainty"" around the IP strength of a manufacturer.  If MPEG-LA is able to establish a patent pool around VP8, and, after a few years, products come out, and nobody gets sued by a submarine patent out there, we'll likely see the codec become more popular, resulting in more licensors, and, eventually, VP8 could become as popular as H.264.<p>Regardless - I don't see a way for anyone to release a ""Patent Free codec"" in the Video world for at least another 20 years (2028 is when the last of the MPEG-LA patents expire).",1297478683

There are two founders, one of which is putting his own money up to bootstrap with. In the first year, one founder will commit between 150k to 210k in cash, the other will work with no salary. Both founders are absolutely key to the idea working as they have the industry experience, smarts and contacts to get going with. They are looking at hiring two to three people, one of them being me. The offer that is on the table is this: 
Option a) take a salary at 40% market rate in year one and receive 3% equity. Option b) take no salary in year one and receive 6% equity. With both options, if we live into the second year, my salary would go to 80% of market value. If we live to year three, market value salary is restored. The exit that is being targeted is in the 30 to 50 million range. The company is not planning on taking VC with the founders sorting out more funding through personal finances and a little revenue in year two. The idea is solid. The problem is really interesting. We are all new to the startup world which is why I am a little worried about the offer on the table. We haven't started hacking yet so there is a load of risk around building the product and interest in it. I would be very grateful to hear what you think about the options on the table.
