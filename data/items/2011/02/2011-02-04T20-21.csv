It's just that someone else has already gone to this effort. BEAM is an event-based server behind the scenes, with lots of syntactic sugar to make it look multithreaded. The PLT Scheme webserver is another example of this.""<p>This really is not a valid critique. When you get down to it, I/O is going to be interrupt driven. Everything other than the interrupt handlers is just going to be ""sugar.""<p>Node.js is the worst of both worlds - all that ""significant manual effort"" is now pushed into the application logic, and all that it's doing for you is just thinly ""papering over"" the syscalls.<p>If you really want to see a well-done papering over, take a look at Gambit Scheme, instead of BEAM.

2181168,comment,2180623,2180848,0,0,cma,,,"As I understand it, the poor refresh is because each pixel element doesn't store its state in silicon; the physical orientation/charge/whatever of the display element itself is the state.  So you have to wait on each pixel to change before moving on to another (you can of course do multiple chunks in parallel, but your bus is only so wide).  In an active-matrix lcd you write to a memory cell that lives close to the liquid crystal, and that cell continuously drives the crystal to twist the desired amount. You can rapidly write to those memory cells without waiting on the physical twist of the crystals to complete.<p>You can see on the kindle the loading indicator is able to spin at a decent refresh rate; ditto word selection, menu selection, etc.  This is because you are waiting on few elements to make the physical change at a time.<p>A simple pen based drawing surface would only update a few pixels at a time would and presumably work quickly as well.<p>(Any corrections welcome; this is just sort of how I assume it works based on using a kindle, not based on much looking into of how eink actually works)",1296852835

2181161,comment,2179254,2179584,0,0,ddbeck,,,"I think it's unfair to say that the focus on word count is absurd. Like most things, writing well requires practice. The only meaningful metric educators have to determine whether a student has actually practiced is word count. The unfortunate thing about the way writing is taught isn't the emphasis on word count; it's the total neglect of editing.<p>I received a formal education in technical writing. In college, I probably submitted a peak of 40 thousand words to my professors in a single semester. But I wrote at least double that, in the form of things like notes, outlines, and stuff discarded as inadequate or unnecessary. That was the chief thing I learned: not to write less, but to discard more.<p>One of my favorite adages about writing is a good complement to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's quote. It's Sturgeon's Law: ""Ninety percent of everything is crud."" To get ten good words, you're going to have to write 100. I don't think it's a bad idea to teach that to kids, so long as they're taught to throw away the other 90.",1296852686

Even based on a select loop the kernel has still been happy to do many things asynchronously for a long time now, it's just a bit of a klunky API. What stopped it from being easy was that C had no good concurrency story except ""lots of manual effort"", so nobody could really effectively use those things in C. (The kernel has actually had the ""lots of manual effort"" applied to it.) The vast majority of concurrency failure has been layered in at the high-level language point. There is a large class of ""better C than C"" languages (or the implementations thereof as the case may be) that simply shoot you before you can even think about fine-grained concurrency, CPython, Perl, Ruby, Javascript, etc. And another class of languages that permit it but don't really help much, like C(++), Java, C#, and anything where you might seriously use a semaphore directly.<p>This is the core error that Node.js hype and its partisans make, mistaking the deficiencies of a set of languages for deficiencies in programming itself. It's not even in the OS; the OS doesn't mind threadlets/green threads/OS processes, it's all in the high-level languages.<p>The kernel may not have provided you a threadlet system out of the box, but the Erlang VM isn't particularly <i>fighting</i> the kernel either, it's <i>building</i> on it. In this context, that's not particularly what I mean by deficiency. Missing things can be added, I'm talking about things where the underlying layers actively fight you.<p>Also, yes, in some respect I'm still really responding more to the hype than directly to you. Saying that BEAM is an event-based server behind the scenes is basically the point I think needs to be made more clearly. You can be ""asynchronous"" and ""event based"" without having to embed the asnchronony and eventedness visibly in every function and nearly every line in the code base.",1296852413

And we'll still know how much tax the government is charging if we really care - it's printed on the receipt.<p>Doing a little mental math is an awfully small price to pay for a little more transparency. Having it on a receipt, although good, doesn't quite cut it because most people will never look at one. I believe it to be important for every person be in tune with the cost of government.<p>> Wondering - how do you feel about gas prices?<p>Good that you mention that because I don't like the hidden taxes in gas prices and that's precisely the point I'm making. They can up the tax rates on gas here and no one would know the difference because it's built into the price.<p>All I'm suggesting is that we have very clear transparency in taxes and make sure everyone knows the cost; don't hide them.<p>> Do you support advertising airline tickets net of 30-50% surcharges so you can know exactly how much of your ticket goes to fuel, airport charges, taxes, and ""fees""?<p>I'm not talking about surcharges; fuel, airport charges, and fees are nice to know but have nothing to do with taxes so have nothing to do with my point. However, they are nice to have itemized.<p>As for the taxes: yeah, I would like them clearly separated from the advertised price. It's annoying but are you seeing the pattern yet? Taxes that are hidden away in the price tend to be ridiculous and easily increased without the average person noticing. I'm fine with taxes but this isn't what I would call transparency and that's a bad thing.<p>[Side note: this wouldn't be so messy if we didn't have absurd taxes. ""Sept. 11 Security Fee""? Why isn't that a service charged to the airport/airlines? Oh, because then it would have to be reasonable and the airlines would simply price their tickets with this cost in consideration and the TSA wouldn't be spending millions on privacy-invading machines that don't improve security. But they're the government and can just charge the passengers directly and when they need more money, instead of having to justify it to a for-profit company as actually improving security, they can do whatever they want and increase the tax.]<p>> And for the other side of the coin - what about not being reminded exactly how much value you got out of the government every time you drive down a road?<p>I suppose this question is because you think I object to taxes; I don't.

It's my job to know which events are awesome, and which ones are a waste of time -- IN CONTEXT.  The key is that people go to events for many different reasons: socially, professionally, personally, intellectually.  The number of events offered in cities like San Francisco, New York, and even Seattle where I hail from originally are vast.<p>Events matter because they let you practice selling - something you'll need to do sooner or later.  They're a very simple kind of customer development tool, because you have to explain to people what you're doing and if you either a) can't or b) aren't understood then that's a valuable data point.  It can mean a lot of things, but the point is that now you have that data to analyze.<p>Events, when you really engage in them (even in short 45 minute bursts before you bail) can yield a lot of crap as well as a lot of weak connections which might turn into something.  The ""weak connections"" might not have immediate or obvious benefit, but as you continue building you might be surprised.  The key is to filter fast, stay connected, and make it clear what you want from the people you meet.  What is your ask?  What is your give?<p>If you don't offer something, and need something in return, you shouldn't be there.  It's a social marketplace.<p>On the flipside, there are certainly people who go to EVERY event and add zero value.  They offer nothing, they ask for things but there's no point in trading with them.  Every event has these people, the day I figure out what motivates them will be a serious breakthrough for me.  I just accept them as part of the scene and move on.",1296851957

Could it be that the field is  tilted -- e.g. wages are simply at a level that does not allow the average person to save much even if they try, meaning that as soon as they hit a financial bump (job loss, non-insured surgery, car repair) they are in debt and the interest rates on the card spiral?<p>This is not a conspiracy theory -- I don't think there is a literal collection of people in a room saying ""how do we stick it to them this week?"" -- but I do think that many economic actors (credit card companies, credit bureaus, major retail stores, etc) act in their own self-interest to continue this situation.<p>I've seen bits and pieces that support this theory, but I lack the economic and political background to tell if this is right or not.

That system also gets criticism for forcing architects to do a lot of work without a guarantee of being paid anything, but nevertheless it is broadly accepted: big-name bureaus participate in them too.
The reason why it works, imo, is because the potential reward is much bigger. They might spend weeks preparing an entry, but in case of a win it's usual to have months or years worth of paid work.
In my eyes, for web design/software crowd sourcing to gain the credibility needed to attract more than starters looking for a foot in the door, it will need the same effort/reward ratio. For example, you design a specific part of the future website in detail, and the winner gets to redesign the whole site. That way, the client still has the benefit of getting more than well-written intentions in a project proposal, and the contestants know that the potential reward is bigger than being paid for what he has already done.",1296851764

I doubt it's template-imposed abstraction penalty <i>per se</i>, though it could be a result of having to write the algorithm in a generic way.  In other words, if you did a sort of ""manual instantiation"" of the hash_map template, where you made the types specific but didn't change a thing besides that, I think you'd get the same performance as the templated algorithm.<p>I can't say for sure the reason for the difference.  Previously I thought that hash_map might have been wasting time calculating a hash of the integer key (whereas I just use the key as the hash), but I just added another test that uses hash_map with an identity hash function and the performance was unchanged.<p>I bet that hash_map is using external chaining, whereas I'm using internal chaining which has better caching behavior.

- ""people should just stop shopping and pay off their cards""<p>The list goes on. What we have learned from speaking with dozens (now probably hundreds) is that there is no ""typical""

What might it be worth to you (cash and/or equity)? What other features might be important to you?<p>If I get enough interest, I could get something started in a few weeks.

Don't hire a banker unless they've sold companies to the other strategic buyers in your space.  Get another buyer interested asap (I had good luck doing this via Linkedin).  Nothing will motivate the best price and closing like a competitor in the wings.  You'd be surprised how many deals fall thru during due diligence, so keep your head... The deal isn't done till you get the wire transfer.  Don't take an offer unless you would be truly happy with just the cash. Earnouts and stock are very very risky and not dependent on your actions.  Don't reveal anything that could hurt you until they give a term sheet and you ""go exclusive"" AND I strongly encourage you to have a break up fee.  You can tell them revenue and user data before you sign a term sheet, but I'd be careful about naming customers or revealing how your technology works until there is a penalty for them walking away, leaving you with lawyer bills.",1296849753

Many people seem more concerned with the effect of the crisis on Ireland's reputation abroad than with the impact on current and future generations.
