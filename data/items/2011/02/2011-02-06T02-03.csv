Some things I found out:<p>1. Opera and Mozilla (thank the gods) seem to behave almost identical to each other... at least with the HTML5 DnD behavior/events and File API functionality.<p>2. Safari 5 (on Win 7) doesn't seem to understand Drag and Dropped <i>native</i> elements at all. I also scrubbed through the Apple HTML5 site and found no mention of support for the File API anywhere... so even if DnD was made to work, it wouldn't know what to do with the resources.<p>TIP: There is a great tutorial from 2009 online, and seems to be for Safari only, where you can hack the styling of an <input type=""file""> dialog and MAKE it a drop target while hiding the default file box here:

Opera, as much credit as it gets for being so great, doesn't seem to want to have anything to do with some of these native HTML5 APIs -- I believe I read somewhere (this has all become a blur) that they are sitting out from these 2 APIs until the dust finishes settling... probably the smart move, but still annoying my app won't work in their browser.<p>4. IE 8/9... what can I say. I don't think I expected any of this to work, and probably plan on a Flash-fallback for IE only as some longer term solution, but damn, I sort of hoped it would have.<p>5. There is a massive post on all the things wrong with the HTML5 DnD API at quirksblog that made me want to give up HTML5 programming and go back to embedded Applets: <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_dr...</a><p>My point being (12 paragraphs later) that from a week of working on this problem there doesn't seem to be a sure-fire solution out there yet for someone wanting to go the ""pure HTML5"" route... there are some awesome starts to it as linked below, and all the JavaScript from imgscalr.com is heavily commented if you want to take a look at it, but it seems we are still a far way away from some drop-in/jack-of-all-DnD-upload experience that we were hoping for.<p>Made me realize HTML5, at least in the aspects I'm most interested in, is still a long way away from giving me exactly what I need.",1296960658

2184698,comment,2182852,2183418,0,0,philwelch,,,"<i>Your ideology posits that whatever you deem to be ""good for society"" gives you the justification of using violence to enforce. First I'd like to point out that there hasn't been a tyrant known to the face of the earth who didn't use such rationalizations. But secondly, it is worth noting that implicit in this claim is the presumption that everyone is your slave, and everyone's life is to be lived according to your (or your creed's) edicts.</i><p>Of course every tyrant used such ""rationalizations""--every <i>governing institution in the history of man</i> explicitly initiates force and infringes upon individual freedom in favor of the common good, and we have things like taxes, freeways, and food inspections to show for it. The kind of libertarian objection you mention isn't just an objection to especially oppressive government--it's an objection against <i>all</i> government.<p>This isn't a straw man attack, either. If you don't allow for <i>some</i> amount of initiative force for the common good, you don't allow for any system of government which has ever existed, including the US Constitution. Consistent libertarianism leads to anarchism. And that's why the force card isn't effective: it's the logical equivalent of saying ""the government shouldn't mandate vaccination, because the government shouldn't exist"".<p>The only two logical options are to be an anarchist, or to concede that <i>some</i> violence for the common good is justified--and then go on to discuss why this instance does or does not justify institutional state violence.<p>---<p>On the other hand, negligently infecting other people with communicable diseases <i>is</i> a form of physical force, and hence there is a legitimate interest in preventing this from happening.<p>---<p>Finally, what you're discussing <i>is</i> ideology. Now, it's important to point something out. There <i>is</i> an important distinction between science and ""ideology"", or whatever you want to call about it, in that science is <i>only</i> concerned with matters of fact. Matters of value and morality are explicitly outside of science. The closest science can possibly come to ideology is when the facts would dictate any sane person to choose one option over the other. For instance, if scientists tell us they are 99.99% certain that an asteroid will collide into the Earth 20 years from now, and that in the event of a collision, it is 99.99% likely the human race will immediately go extinct, any sane person would conclude ""we have to do something to stop that astroid"". But science, qua science, can't come to that conclusion by itself. If you were some type of madman who wanted to destroy all human life on Earth, the science would be just as interesting and convincing to you as it would be to a sane person, you would just be led to a different reaction due to your value system.<p>Or, back to this point--if your value system favors children <i>not</i> dying preventable deaths from 19th century diseases, you probably favor vaccination. But if your value system favors not being forced to do things against your will over children not dying preventable deaths from 19th century diseases, that's entirely up to you--just as long as you accept the facts of the situation.<p>And, historically, this is what a lot of anti-vax people fail to do. People aren't rational enough to just say ""I value not being forced to vaccinate my kids over my kids' lives"" (which is a disgusting value system, but you can't argue against value systems), they'd rather lie about facts and say ""vaccines cause autism, therefore it's in the best interests of my child not to vaccinate them"".",1296959161

An IP can have <i>many</i> domains, (and a domain many IPs), so it may not resolve to the right page.<p>2. Many sites benefit from the network effect. Ten people seed, 100 download initially, then continue to seed, allowing 1000 to download, etc. Without mass adoption of snooping for who-is information people are basically going to move on anyways.<p>But I think I've thought a partial solution. What we want is two things: Have a significant portion of the semi-technical (a hacker's girlfriend or boyfriend, for example) internet population be able to get back to the site they want. Secondly we want the government to not be able to take down the server that we are communicating with once we found out where it is.<p>All that is really needed to make domain name seizure irrelevant is a little browser addon ""IP History"" or ""Website Time Machine"" or something that will passively remember where the IPs are of sites you've browsed. Each time you try to go to a URL the addon will make a check to see what percentage of the internet browsers have reverted to the old IP address. If this % goes greater than a threshold, say 0.5%, it can slide out a window saying ""Some people have used the time machine on this page recently, are you sure this is what you want?""<p>It makes DNS a less distributed thing. I don't think manipulation would be all that much of a problem, (I can think or 3 counter measures right off the bat).<p>As for the IP problem, if this browser addon becomes widely used enough then it could support some sort of standard that admins could solve the one-ip-but-many-domains problem.",1296958656
