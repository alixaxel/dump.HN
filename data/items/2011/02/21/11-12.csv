So after ~1 second they are 300,000Km apart.<p>On the other hand, from the point of view of a 'stationary' observer, the light and the spaceship emitting it are moving at almost exactly the same speed.  So after ~1 second they are maybe 1 meter apart.<p>How can this be? Our minds naturally want to reject this as nonsense. But the thing the gripping hand is holding that makes this true is that to the stationary observer and the person travelling near the speed of light time is moving at different rates.<p>The person who is moving ~1m slower than the speed of light is experiencing time enormously much slower than the person 'standing still'.  The time difference is 300,000,000 times (sic).<p>Our brains reject this, because we think of time as an absolute rock solid constant, when in fact even with our primitive understanding and slow speeds we can demonstrate experimentally that time is in fact flexible, and it <i>does</i> slow down the faster you get.",1298289585

Doing a naive binary search causes you to drop at floor 50, breaking a bulb, and then at floor 25, breaking your second bulb.  You have no more bulbs, and cannot discriminate between 25 possible values for the tolerance, so your naive strategy was not a good idea.<p>The binary search strategy which works is to binary search with the first bulb until you break it, then exhaustively search with the second bulb starting from the lowest possible tolerance and increasing until it breaks, thus identifying the precise breaking point with the minimum number of drops.  This has a worse case performance of 50 drops, for when the bulb had a tolerance of 49.5: one drop with the first bulb, bulb breaks, 49 drops with the second bulb.

Penetratation testing and something called the SAQ WIZARD which makes the SAQ understandable.<p>The pain involved is high here are some quick tips:<p>1) most new startups might as well forget about applying. Unless you have prior trading history which you can prove your chargebacks are < 1% then you will most likely get a NO.<p>2) The business volume should be at least 5K + per month to make if worth your while (and theirs) and figures below this will probably not be worth their while = a NO.<p>3) Trying to get a good rate is only going to be possible if your a mum a pop store selling shoes etc., anything online will generally be high risk and have fees north of 3.5 %<p>4) if your transaction value is high > 500$ + then you will be high risk.<p>5) anything travel = high risk<p>6) video, gambling, adult, coupons, gift vouchers, warranties, etc are all a general NO.<p>7) dating = very high charge backs, block every Proxy IP and non UK non USA. Or all markets you are not targeting.<p>8) PCI compliance is easy if you use the gateways checkout page, However, if you want to incorporate payments direct into your own site, thus using the API (needed for recurring billing or for repeat clients where you don't want to ask for card number again and again) then PCI compliance is a big task, making sure your servers can pass about 3k5 tests and about 400 questions and standards adopted as part of the SAQ (self assessment questionnaire) + you will need to make sure your app is secure from sql injection etc. etc.",1298286544

So a maximum of seven if you include phone interviews.<p>The interviews were quite challenging (and of increasing difficulty), but there was nothing even resembling a trick question or a mind teaser. I researched a bit before the interviews, and credible results consistently said that Google always had a policy against such questions.
