Do Hospitals have limited reading material? Do libraries not provide outreach services to patients? Do friends/family not bring content?<p>2 - Is there a need and/or market to create/aggregate content specific for this audience?<p>3 - Anything more specific about the content besides being uplifting? Seems like a broad range of content is needed, which is proving a challenge to my brain.<p>4 - Is there a technology angle to this at all?

If you want to support 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x, writing a single codebase that supports both versions is not really that hard. It gets harder the wider your range gets, but it's not impossible. For example: if you need 2.4-3.x then you don't have the `as` statement, so exception handling is tricker across all versions.<p>* Run your code through `2to3`, it probably works. A lot of people are surprised at how close they are to working under 3.x, enough that there are some projects which successfully keep the codebase under 2.x and port to 3 via 2to3 only at release time.<p>* You need good test coverage to have a successful port. Period. This is one of the barriers a lot of people see to porting -- they need to stop and build up tests before they can even think about moving forward.<p>The initial effort in porting turns a lot of people off, as does the ongoing maintenance, especially when there's no audience for it, but as with the movie Field of Dreams: ""if you build it, they will come"".

If you're blogging altruistically you're blogging for others primarily and yourself secondarily. If you're blogging narcissistically you're mostly blogging for yourself.<p>Most of the great blogs that I visit are all done altruistically. They are well maintained, post useful information, and very rarely waste my time. They also require a huge amount of effort on the part of the blogger because they really have to do work to gather and present interesting and useful information for their readers.<p>What a lot of the press has referred to as blogging is ""narcissistic."" Instead of coming up with interesting information and vetting it for their readers they mostly just spew whatever thoughts they had that day onto the page. It doesn't take a huge amount of effort, but the signal to noise ratio is also very low.</i><p>It's really hard to write stuff that will be interesting to people who don't know you and have no real connection to you. I know because I write a book blog called The Story's Story at <a href=""http://jseliger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com</a> and know that producing at least one meaningful post a week is difficult. If writing in such a way that other people actually want to read your work weren't so difficult, we wouldn't have nearly as many professional writers as we do.<p>If your goal is mostly to bask in the relative adulation of others, you can probably do it more efficiently via Facebook. If your goal is mostly to communicate something substantive, you're going to find that it's not five or ten times harder than posting a 140-character message on FB or Twitter—it's 50 or 100 times harder. Twitter is easier than ""A list of N things"": <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/nthings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/nthings.html</a> and ""A list of N things"" is easier than a blog post and a blog post is easier than an essay.<p>People who want to be real writers (or filmmakers or whatever) in the sense that people with no current relationship of any kind will find their work useful will probably still blog. But most of those who <i>think</i> they want to be real writers will probably find out precisely how hard it is to come up with useful and interesting stuff regularly. Then they'll quit, and the people who remain will be the ones who have the energy and skill to keep it up and write things people want to read.",1298262231

Why the hell would they kill the API access before trying to resolve the issues - unless they were trying to push users towards their official apps?<p>If UberMedia had in fact been warned previously, then they're lying idiots - but at the same time, Twitter should have issued a public announcement and a deadline for UberMedia to comply with their demands. But no, instead they don't give the users of those apps any notice at all.<p>Either way, I'm pissed at Twitter for this one.",1298261918
