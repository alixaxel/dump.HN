It's a lot of speeches and rhetoric, very little concrete information.<p>Now society is changing, much of that function is replaced by ""scientific literature."" Fewer reasonable people go into the wild world of tabloid journalism, punditry and politics. There's competition now, pop science can fill those niches. It's entertaining enough while being more informative.<p>Writers overall are closer to the punditry end of the spectrum. They express themselves first and get the details later. Scientists get the details first. Their culture is becoming dominant through technology, through extreme real world effects. Writers as a culture will either catch up or become irrelevant. The frameworks of thought they tend to use are obsoleting.<p>The real problem writers face is not whether a new medium will make them less powerful, it's whether their profession should have power in its current form.

You can often dodge patent claims by doing just one little thing in a different way. When you see a very specific claim, it means the patent lawyer was forced to write it that way by the examiner.

All languages <i>need to be used properly</i>.<p>If you have good standards for naming, then a simple search should tell you exactly how to read ""(f x)"" in less than a second.  The same goes for Smalltalk method names.  If an extremely important method in your application code gets named ""add:"" well, guess what, there are already base class methods named ""add:""!  This means your senders searches and implementor searches -- which are fundamental to the way lots of expert Smalltalkers code -- are going to be polluted.<p>Also, the same thing can apply to function names in Python!<p>In dynamic languages, good programmers know names are very important.  Before a good, experienced dynamic language programmer names something ""foo"", they first search for <i>foo</i>!  They search for things that might be confused with foo!  Programmers of dynamic languages who don't do this are either ignorant or inconsiderate.  This post doesn't strike me as written by someone experienced or knowledgeable with development in dynamic languages.  (And if he's experienced, he's had the bad luck of having been mentored in short-sighted groups.)<p><i>There's a lot of repetition and many times it's downright verbose. But where Lisp is nice to write and hard to read, Python makes the opposite tradeoff. It's easy to read. You can determine how to interpret something—a string, a list, a function call, a definition—just by looking at the code locally.</i><p>This post takes no account of Don't Repeat Yourself and is seemingly written with no foreknowledge of this idea.  Curious, since Python is powerful enough to get close to the ideal of <i>Don't Repeat Yourself</i>.<p>Strategy for creating a blog post that looks analytical and sounds good -- but only to sophomore programmers:<p>1) Pick a certain aspect Y of language X which can be abused<p>2) Give a detailed analysis for why Y is bad<p>3) Completely leave out any mention of known best practices for addressing Y<p>4) Compare to a more popular language Z.  Leave out any mention of Y applied to Z.<p>This way, you can get some attention from sophomore programmers and provide them a way to feel better by giving them a good sounding reason to avoid studying X.<p>Really, this kind of sophistry is so common, there should be a name for it!  (Actually, there is a way that Lisp can be easy to write and hard to read, but that has to do with macro expansion.  But the tendency is for those with substantive Lisp experience to know about things like that.)<p>EDIT: To avoid distracting ""ad hominem"" nonsense.

And many manufactures, as well as Google, are starting to realize they simple can't put a faster processor and more memory in their products and expect to compete with Apple. Google in particular is putting a lot more effort in to the ""polish"" and overall ""experience"" of using Android devices. I know these are dirty words for some, but they reflect the market realities of how consumers make purchasing decisions. And I think it's a good move that will help Android increase it's market share even further.",1298234577

When it launched as a trial it received maybe 100 questions and some good answers in the first few weeks.  I got answers to all my questions - good ones which pointed me toward research I hadn't found in Google etc.<p>But a week later it had been shut down and they emailed everyone saying it didn't meet minimum activity thresholds.  Those questions and answers are no longer available on the net.<p>The question is whether a StackExchange site with relatively small activity is still useful.  I think it is - at least it's more useful than not having them at all.  Who is to say a small site couldn't become much bigger over time.<p>Reddit has done well letting users create any subreddit they want.

Using a straw man as your opening salvo here really doesn't say anything good about your position or your arguments.<p>""This would have happened even without the GNU license. Anything that can be digital is being shared on the Internet, regardless of the license.""<p>As I mentioned, I'm not talking about licenses here. I'm talking about the culture of free and open source software, which the FSF and RMS were instrumental in helping to build.<p>And, I don't consider piracy a useful kind of sharing. You can't learn from pirated software, and you can't give back to pirated software. Pirating software is a net negative for the world (probably, and in most circumstances). While sharing software under an open license is a net positive (probably, and in most circumstances).<p>""Most people will never look at the source code...so the absence of a license that gives you the right to tinker with the inner workings of an application won't really have an effect on the ""technology haves and have nots"".""<p>Most is not all. Some people <i>will</i> look at the source code, and some of them will become contributing members of the community. If they arrive to a culture of sharing, teaching, and learning, that's what they will bring to their own family and friends. You and I are not magical unicorns of uniqueness. The elements of our personalities that drove us to become hackers exists in millions kids all over the world, and if they're exposed to software that has open windows into its operation they will learn from it.<p>""We should be more concerned with people that can't eat.""<p>It's two sides of the same coin. People who know technology are among the best paid people in the poorest parts of the word.<p>Software is what I do, so I try to make what I do as positive for the world as possible (while still making a living). If I were a Dr. perhaps I'd volunteer at a clinic. If I were a scientist, I'd want to work on something that makes the world better. If I were a politician, perhaps I'd kill myself and make the world better that way. But, software is my business, so I use it as best I can to help people.<p>""Which is funny because this right here is devaluing programmers' salaries every day.""<p>Citation needed.<p>""Because there are so many free apps out there, companies can hire less experienced developers for less pay (IE: mechanics instead of engineers). It's one of those things that nobody will notice until it's too late. I suspect at this point, we will start to see programmer unions to keep wages at an inflated level.""<p>This is very fragmented thinking, and I'm having trouble following it. If programmers aren't needed, a programmers union will have no effect (because you don't need to hire programmers; you just hire ""mechanics""). And, if wages are at an inflated level, then market forces <i>should</i> be working to bring them down. That's what the market is for. But, it's not. There are more programming jobs than ever, because software is more important and more valuable than ever.<p>More code equals more developer jobs. Open Source and free software <i>does</i> tend to drag down the extreme ends of the software cost spectrum. Databases, for example, have become a commodity in all but the highest end use cases. But, that's OK. It frees up funds for building higher level tools on top that increase business efficiency, which can cost a lot until they, too, get commodotized. That's the nature of the market, and Open Source/Free software just helps it along.<p>""So, when your company decides to replace you with someone cheaper or goes over to India or the Philippines, don't complain.""<p>Here's where the conversation starts to get funny. I'm co-founder of my company (that shouldn't be surprising; the majority of people at HN have started a company or are planning to). The only way I could be replaced is if the company fails. Perhaps funnier, my company produces 95+% open source software, and I've been involved in Open Source projects for 13 years. Working on and with Open Source software has been the entirety of my professional career, in fact.<p>We're also a distributed company. We hire people overseas when they're the best person for the job. My co-founder was in Australia when we started the company. Our first employee is in Pennsylvania. We're interviewing frontend developers now, and one candidate is in Eastern Europe. I don't see how that's a bad thing. People in India, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe deserve opportunities just as much as white folks in the good old US of A.<p>""Even if they closed-sourced the application, the original source code is still free.
