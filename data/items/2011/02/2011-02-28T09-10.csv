I certainly had no idea what I wanted to do coming out of high school. I wanted to be a veterinarian, but didn't get the marks to get into that degree programme, so I ended up doing bioinformatics, and then eventually wound up doing a computer science degree double major with history and philosophy of science. And I love my job now, working as an academic in technology ethics. But if you'd asked the straight-outta-highschool me about what I'd be doing in 10 years time, she would have had no idea I'd be where I am now. Going to university helped me to work out which path I wanted to take. Granted, I didn't go to an American university, and it somewhat depresses me to hear about how university is pointless etc. because I had some amazingly good courses and learned a lot at my university. But that was back when it was still well funded by the Australian government and less of the corporate entity it's become. So who knows, really?<p>Anyway my point is that university is not just about coming out with a piece of paper, it's about exploring possibilities and different paths. And if you go to a good university that focuses on actually teaching interesting stuff rather than churning out pieces of paper, then you'll actually get something worthwhile.",1298885923

Recently (after Adblock extension for Chrome came), I have noticed a big drop in my Adsense revenue. My pageviews are still the same, but the number of clicks have reduced very much.<p>Has anyone else noticed this or it's just because people are not clicking?<p>Also, on an average, my 60% traffic is from IE, around 20% from Firefox and 10% from Chrome and Safari.<p>So, if Adblock makes its way to IE also, will we see a massive drop in clicks (which means a massive drop in Google revenues)?",1298884111
