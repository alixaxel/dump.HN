When I am coding I am often exploring, I want to try new things, and then after a while I settle with code that I am pleased with. But before that happens I can go through several iterations of changes. Writing tests before writing code is one thing, but adjusting the tests afterwards to accomodate the changes (which may be big) is a hurdle and slows down progress. In addition in a case such as mine where I am doing all the work alone and thus I know every corner of the code written so far gives little benefits.<p>I can imagine of course that TDD is a great tool when there's an assignment for a client with specific tasks to accomplish, but in other cases 'get something working first' is better I guess.",1298173367

On a macro-level, how would you even begin to write tests for a search engine or some stock market bot or other notoriously hard problem?<p>search_on(""avatar"").should_return(""<a href=""http://www.imdb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com</a>)<p>best_stock_for(:percent_return, 200).should_return(""cisco"")<p>?<p>These problems an inherently non-deterministic.  How do you even begin to write a test for that?<p>On a micro-level, sure, maybe you're working on a single component.  And TDD would help you come up with the interface.  But if you don't even know if the answer is a genetic algo, or simulated annealing, or using mechanical turk, or whatever, there's really no point in even trying to freeze the interface.  Which is what TDD really does as much or even more than it verifies the resulting code.  It defines the interface ahead of time.  It's a way to trick developers into writing specifications without using that nasty imprecise context-sensitive language know as english.<p>But then again, right now we're rewriting a pretty critical piece of code.  We've thought a lot about how it works.  We had a few meetings about the new approach.  Wrote up a quick email with a basic API.  And doing pairing and TDD from there, well that's actually working out pretty well.  And I'm confident we're getting better code quicker because of the approach.<p>Ultimately it gets back to the statement that real developers ship.  In some cases, BDD and pairing will help you ship higher quality software quicker.  In other cases it won't, and it'll end up wasting money and time.  And real developers will then use their tools accordingly, and not dogmatically.",1298173013

Not so much.<p>It sounds like you want to get in on something early, and most things early just don't have much money in them.  My advice: find a start up you love and go for it.

When the product's done, I'll move out west.<p>The one thing I would stress is to always have a backup plan.  Things will not go according to plan as much as you'd like, so be ready. I'm living with my parents now, but if they kick me out I know exactly where else I can get free/cheap housing while I develop.
