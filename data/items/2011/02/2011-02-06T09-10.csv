2185302,comment,2183452,2183452,0,0,davidst,,,"Botter Reeves, one of my best friends and a great all-around computer guy (back when that meant being as comfortable with a soldering iron as a keypunch) had a hand in building this. He has fantastic stories of those days. I hope he gets around to writing them down.<p>I'll try and relate one of them from memory. I apologize in advance for getting details wrong.<p>Back in those days you didn't just put out a help-wanted ad for programmers and start filtering resumes. Programming as a professional barely even existed. Instead, you had to find people with the right mindset and train them from scratch. And you had to be willing to look anywhere for the right people. IBM had created the original Programmer Aptitude Test (PAT) and was giving it to college students, teachers, and just about anyone they could round up. The best-scoring testers were immediately offered a job in California as trainees for what was to become SAGE.<p>This was, I think, an office of Federal Systems Division and the job was really a boot camp where the trainees had to learn the principles of radio, radar, tracking, computers and programming. It was quite hard on most of them and people would wash out of the course as it become progressively more difficult.<p>No one outside knew what was really going on at FSD (even the trainees didn't know what they were really learning) but it was getting quite a reputation for itself.<p>It seemed a little cruel to send someone across the country (a big deal in those days) for a job that didn't last more than a few weeks. Botter assured me it was no problem. Even the wash-outs were in demand. Software Development Corp. had a recruiter outside the IBM building to offer them new jobs when they quit IBM.<p>The final, carefully-chosen test prior to graduating boot camp was to understand and explain how a certain subroutine worked. This subroutine was special. It was granted exclusive access to the tiny amount of core memory that was available (most of the memory was probably drum, iirc.) Its purpose was to monitor the results of the radar signals as the antenna dish spinned and piece them together to associate the individual signal samples with the correct objects (planes or missiles), and identify their altitude, speed and direction as quickly as possible. It was unusually complex, self-modifying code.<p>Botter said that few people could understand that code and fewer still could successfully modify it. Those who passed were ready to graduate and move on to work on SAGE.",1296985127

2185285,comment,2184389,2184389,0,0,Jach,,,"> In middle school, science fair projects are typically still required — and, teachers lament, all too often completed by parents. And some high schools funnel their best students into elite science competitions that require years of work and lengthy research papers: a few thousand students enter such contests each year.<p>Making them required makes them dull; the types of projects available to students without the ""elite"" (in my opinion, potentially worthy) status are also pretty dull. For my forced science project I tried to get away with doing something with potatoes and electricity, but the teacher said I should do something in programming instead so I did something or another about various benchmarks and controlling for caching... useless, but got me a grade and didn't consume my time.<p>Do parents still really do projects? I thought the ""chili volcano done by Dad"" has been consigned to sitcoms.<p>> But what has been lost, proponents of local science fairs say, is the potential to expose a much broader swath of American teenagers to the scientific process: to test an idea, evaluate evidence, ask a question about how the world works — and perhaps discover how difficult it can be to find an answer.<p>There's another set of classes that can do this far more effectively than a science project where most entries are BS and uninteresting (I have nothing against the interesting ones, a guy at my high school did some work with MEMS which was pretty cool, he had the best project of the whole district at least). That set of classes is programming. Every time you run the program, you're testing your hypothesis that it works. Errors give you evidence of what is causing the problem, which leads you to question how the computer works and how to get your program to work. More focus on everyone having a ""Basic Programming Literacy"" seems a lot more useful than funding the multitudes of BS science fair projects.<p>A quick comment on why I think so many science fair projects are BS... If it's not worth trying to independently replicate results later, it's not useful science. And in the same vein, if it's been replicated a hundred times, it's probably better to look at something else. (No more potatoes-generate-electricity or chili-volcano projects!)<p>The solar powered car they showed Obama examining looked pretty cool, I'm all for more projects of that sort (unless it's just a reimplementation of a solved engineering class project). Instead of trying to prop up the current faulty system of science fairs, we should create a new system dedicated to producing useful science (where a three-panel poster board isn't required).",1296983998

But there are several reasons why someone might make an insultingly low offer, and it may still be possible to come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.<p>They may simply be trying a hard-ball negotiation strategy, while being able to afford to go a lot higher.<p>The best thing you can do is to explain that their offer is worse than nothing for you and there is no way you can go ahead with it (but don't tell them your break-even point), and collect more information about their situation - understand why they want to do business with you, try to understand it from their point of view: how much revenue can they make from what you have, and what their costs and revenues for substitute options. If they won't get as much revenue from the deal as what your costs will be, then it is not possible for you both to make a profit and you can part amicably without doing a deal.<p>If they would bring in a lot of revenue because of the deal compared to their next best option, you can offer them a price which splits the profit for mutual benefit.<p>Collecting the information needed to see it from their point of view is hard and takes tact, but it is the most important part of negotiating.",1296983669
