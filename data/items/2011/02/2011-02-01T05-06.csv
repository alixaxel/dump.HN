You know the first time you logon to a server and it asks if you trust it?  You're supposed to call up the server admin and get them to read off the fingerprint, or have them email it to you, or get it from some other out-of-band channel.<p>And no-one, nowhere actually verifies host fingerprints.  Even security conscious people.  And what do people do when they get that warning about a modified fingerprint?  Just delete the entry from authorized_hosts and re-connect.<p>So ssh actually does a really shitty job handling key exchange.<p>Anyway, the closest thing to a real alternative to https and CAs is monkeysphere (OpenPGP WoT for servers), but no-one uses that.",1296539974

Taking your work another level (for whatever reason) is another thing.<p>There are many ""interesting"" stories floating around HN about startups, companies, success stories, and probably technical superiority. Sometime, people want to be in the storyline and not on the bench having long-winded arguments (not discussion, but arguments as if there should be one true answer).<p>I joined HN more than 3.5 years ago. A few months ago, I began to disengage from HN. My life turned around for the better. I lost weight, got more things done (not just work, but other things in life), met new people, learned a lot more, understand myself better, and overall, happier. I know some of you become friends here but you know that awkward feeling when you actually meet your online friend in real life? ... yeah... I got that feeling so I know it's not working for me.<p>Not all people have the same feeling/outcome like I do. Maybe it's just my personality that I tend to be more outgoing in real-life than spending time online arguing about Python vs Ruby, VCs vs Angels, Apple vs Google, the future (those discussions were fun had I read them less frequent).<p>Being part of HN feels akin to the starbuck-laptop-user lifestyle, Godin/Tim Ferriss/GTD readers, MBA grads.

If it is to manage sales people now or in the near future then Salesforce is good if you can afford it, it is also good to grow into if you plan to have customer service people. Plus I hear they have a free version for small companies - not sure. If it is just for yourself, then the question is how many prospects are you managing. If it is a lot (over 200) then SugarCRM or Highrise is best suited.  If less than 200, Google docs spread sheet is good to start with unless you need to track a lot of data/ prospect interactions, then use one of the former. If you have never done this before I suggest starting out with a spread sheet and keeping it simple since you will inevitably be making changes to it regarding what you will track and how you will use it to make more sales. This approach will help you refine your immediate and possibly long term needs, and what product is best suited for you. I personally always start with a spread sheet before making a commitment to any system until I know what I/we need. Zoho is a good happy medium between these two choices.",1296537303
