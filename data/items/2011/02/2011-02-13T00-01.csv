2211698,comment,2210469,2211224,0,0,baddox,,,"> <i>For example, no startup could hope to survive without laws protecting trade secrets. </i><p>Existing theft and trespassing laws already outlaw unauthorized physical access to your property. As for disgruntled or opportunistic employees, you can utilize existing contract law to ensure their doing so is illegal. What exactly do trade secret laws cover that aren't covered by more reasonable and fundamental laws?<p>> <i>Open source is no exception. It relies heavily on rules of copyright law and on licensing to make its system work. If everything were freely shareable without any form of restriction, one does not have open source - one has freeware.</i><p>That's why I have strong feelings that the free software movement, or at least the GPL, is insanely contradictory. Their claim is that there shouldn't be liberty restrictions placed on software, but what they really mean is there should be <i>different</i> liberty restrictions placed on software, specifically the ones they happen to like more. In my opinion, software isn't really free unless it's in the public domain (or, nearly equivalently, if there were no longer any intellectual property protection for software).<p>Most of your points are simply that removing the various forms of intellectual property protection would harm <i>some</i> people. The validity of your specific examples are variously debatable, but even if you're right, I don't think that's a good enough argument for keeping the laws around. I can't conceive of any legal modification that wouldn't harm <i>someone</i>. In my opinion, even if something might harm startups (and I'm certainly not convinced that IP laws are vital to startups), that's not a sufficient argument.",1297558672

The main reason, why many people want to buffer their tweets atm, is because they are intersted in having a planned out timeline on twitter. They can sit down at one point, whilst they are browsing the web and then add tweets to their buffer. It just optimises twitter efforts, if you can't be around all day. Sometimes you come across more than one great article you want to share, so instead of flooding your followers, you can spread them out with Buffer. You think that would help? :)",1297558531

Schools receive a lot of money, and have been receiving increasing amounts of funding per student over the last few decades. Some of the worst performing schools spend some of the most per student. I doubt the problem is truly a lack of funds, it's more likely to be a mismanagement of funds. In that case throwing more money at the problem may eventually ""trickle down"" results to individual class rooms and teachers as a side effect but ultimately is not a solution to the problem.<p>The second type of problem seems as much of a ready scape goat as anything else.

If in practice these all still have a high cash cost, even though paid to third parties, then everyone needs to open their wallets, rather than just do pure-of-heart helpful info-design, to appear on the front-page. That is, amounts paid to third parties serve as a short of shadow bid, placing a rising floor on the value of AdWords placements.<p>• SEO tactics that mildly or temporarily fool Google, but that Google then overcomes, provide a dynamic, ever-growing barrier-to-entry to other later-entrant search engines.

It's not like there's an enormous repository of objective data we can just go run to and crunch numbers on with pre-agreed algorithms.<p>However, I would say that you're committing a logical error; we have a certain set of patent laws, we have software leadership, and you seem to conclude therefore there is a causative relationship. That's not logically sound.<p>What I see out there in the world is that very few people are creating software because they are incentivized by a patent system to do so. It's almost absurd to think that someone would be incentivized by a system guaranteed to get back to them a year after their application or so. Nor is the patent system successfully putting knowledge into the public domain; in order to fulfill the contract a patent is supposed to be offering one should be able to reconstruct the patent from the description, generally either trivial or impossible. They create software for other reasons. On the other hand, there's a lot of litigation out there for no real gain.<p>It's not hard to conclude the value of patents are negative in the software domain when almost all the entries on the ledger are negative, and the negative ones are also larger than the positive ones.<p>I'd also observe that I did <i>not</i> say the metric is benefit to the patenter, which I think you may have missed. I said benefit to <i>society</i>. This idea is written into the very Constitutional authorization for Congress to create laws regarding patents and copyright in the first place. So the idea that the relevant metric is benefit to society isn't obscure or something I made up, it's directly from the authorization granted to the government in the first place, I couldn't be any more mainstream.",1297556931

I posted my answer several hours late on a small thread, so I am reposting it here for your convenience and/or corrections. (The original is at http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2210218)<p>* If you are building a website and you do NOT redistribute the website's software (e.g. allow people to run the website on their own server), you can incorporate code from most open source licenses. Specifically:<p>* The MIT, BSD, PSF, and Apache licenses are fantastic for proprietary websites, even if you do redistribute the website's software. (In which case you will need to include a disclaimer, copyright notice, and/or copy of the license, depending on the details of that specific license.)<p>* Libraries licensed under the AGPL may NOT be used for proprietary websites. The regular GPL's language is unclear about proprietary websites, so you may want to avoid GPL libraries altogether. (I have been told that the FSF claims that the GPL covers websites. Note that the AGPL was written to firmly and explicitly address this issue.)<p>* You may use LGPL libraries, but if you modify them then you may have to release the code that you modified. (Due to the aforementioned uncertainty.) Again, I am not certain about this, but I have seen that claimed before.<p>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and nothing I say is legal advice.

The myth is that g is derived in a meaningful way and explains the correlations in data instead of being a by product of the fact that the data is made to correlate (these days) and is just a measure of the correlation of the tests (now made to correlate). Again, I remain sceptical you read the article in full.<p>g is not as useful as T, since its ability as an explanatory variable and verification in experimental settings are sorely lacking.<p>Also, even if a valid concept of a single explanatory variable for intelligence were created, I personally, remain sceptical of the scope of its usefulness considering the space of complexity at hand (humans, genes, environment,...) and likely  a lot less profound and far reaching as the insights of Boltzmann.

If you tear a page out and copy it, you will violate the copyright. If you reuse characters or scenes and use them to create your own work, you are making derived works (JK put her stamp of approval on non-commercial fan fiction by the way). But the farther you get away from the original characters the less you can call it infringement. As the link between the two works becomes more and more abstract and less concrete, the new work is more protected. At some nebulous point it is no longer infringing.<p>For instance, Harry's story and appearance is superficially similar to an earlier work called The Books of Magic, a comic series by Neil Gaiman. You can read his take on it here:<p><a href=""http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/04/fair-use-and-other-things.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/04/fair-use-and-other-thi...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Magic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Books_of_Magic</a><p>Essentially he throws up his hands and says ""borrowing is a fact of life in genre fiction. Deal with it, I did.""<p>How does this apply to computer code? Well, the farther away you get from the original copyrighted code, the less infringing it is. There are extremely limited protections for derived works that amount to Person B having a copy of Person A's code in front of them and editing it.<p>What those Touretzky pages from CMU show is that there is no such thing as a continuum from computer code to an uncopyrightable abstraction. It is abstraction, mathematics, numbers all the way down. In fact, it is speech that is protected by the First Amendment and suppressing it is a constitutional issue with narrow exceptions.<p>So no, you can't use a book model for code. It is not the same thing at all. Executable ideas, math, algorithms, just don't exist in the fiction publishing industry.",1297556502

The problem I found with all of them is that they teach you a few specific things to accomplish common tasks (clickable button, lay out data in a table, etc) but once you want to get more complicated, you're digging into Apple's documentation to figure out how to do it. Once I got to that point, I realized that Apple's documentation is actually pretty good, so I've given up on the books and started just using Apple's stuff. Once you get used to the official documentation, when you want to go back for more details you're going to the master source that has all the information, not just a book chapter with some high points.
