The second piece, ""how he came off in the story"" is almost my exact point: I don't really see how your opinion on how he came off is valuable, unless your really going to delve into some psychological reasoning, use an anecdote or note a similar example - which you didn't. HN is for intelligent discussion i.e. value, not how you thought the guy came off.<p>Maybe if you'd have made a REAL comment, i.e. ""hey, seems like a bumpy ride but it sure does seem like persistence prevails. [enter your comment here]"" then it would have been fine.<p>But as it was, you just attacked him personally based on what you read in that post. Maybe its just a lesson in looking at things from other peoples perspectives, I'm sure I wasn't the only one who thought what I thought.",1297072722
2188375,comment,2187183,2187183,0,0,guynamedloren,,,"Practice, practice, practice.  Duplicate.  Practice.  Duplicate.  Create.<p>If you aren't feeling very creative, duplicate the work of others.  Heck, even if you are feeling creative, duplicate anyway.  Try to copy the iTunes interface.  Figure out exactly what methods and techniques are used to design certain buttons.  Then move on to other parts of the interface.  You'll learn about subtle gradient use, shadows, insets, opacities, font, color palettes, and more.  Before you know it, you'll have duplicated the entire iTunes interface and picked up a huge skillset along the way.<p>Then do the same with the most beautiful websites you can find.  And the whole time, tell yourself it's not impossible to design that beautiful website because somebody already did it.  If you get stuck, google the specific problem.  Somebody was in your place before.  The only way to really learn design (or anything, arguably) is by doing.  When I browse the internet, I subconsciously examine every single piece of the design and figure out how they did what they did.  For most websites it doesn't take more than a few seconds because they're remarkably simple once you know a little bit about design.  For those tricky ones, I look a little closer and can figure it out within a minute or two, sometimes resorting to opening the source and looking at how the images are sliced up.  If something's really busting my brain, I'll fire up Illustrator and give it my best shot.<p>Eventually you'll figure out what works for you and what doesn't.  You'll gravitate towards certain techniques and ditch others.  If you're smart, you'll even end up with a ""graveyard file"" containing all the little pieces that you might be able to use in future designs.  With that graveyard file, designing gets exponentially easier - it's like having a box of magical tools at your fingertips.",1297072720

In Nov 2008 Dreamstar launched 4tube.com that is now ticking over with around 1.6M visits a day, 9 weeks ago we launched a new project PornTube.com that we're very excited about as we're using our existing tube model on a valuable/trusted/recognized domain that has historically outperformed/converted any other domain we've seen. Steve has built a solid reputation for himself over the years by not ripping off content. PornTube is 100% DMCA compliant, we believe the way forward is to work with, and not against the content producers.<p>Our current site has been designed with usability best practices in mind, as well as SEO (We're working with a highly reputable firm in the UK), scaleability, information architecture/semantics, MVT/CRO/LPO. Currently in the process of implementing rdf tags for some of our ""starlettes"" studios and movies, video sitemaps and dynamic rss feeds, social features...<p>As a small team it can be very hard to stay focused, develop all these features and ensure HA while managing +100k videos, security, performance and the list goes on. One of our goals for Q1 2011 is to review our SCRUM methodology and how we can improve our existing processes to stay on top of the game.<p>We worked VERY hard on setting ourselves a good foundation for growth, if there is any interest regarding the actual technologies used please forward your questions and I'll get our CTO to reply.<p>Nonetheless we do realise that their is much room for improvement, so any feedback would be very welcome, we're always looking to improve.<p>(We're also currently hiring ;-) feel free to pop over to <a href=""http://www.dreamstarcash.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamstarcash.com</a> for more info or send your resume to jobs[at]dreamstarcash.com)",1297072289
2188365,comment,2188242,2188242,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"There's a lot wrong here.<p>First, there's no such thing as an ""abstract TLD"". The closest analog would be <i>generic</i> TLDs. The author actually manages to get this completely backwards since the gTLDs are .com, .net, .org and their brethren. The TLDs the author calls ""abstract"" are all actually country-code TLDs (ccTLDs), and they all have a proper meaning. .ly is Libya, .st is São Tomé and Príncipe, and .ng is Nigeria.<p>Just because these governments don't traditionally care too much about who uses them doesn't mean they don't have a meaning. They aren't abstract.<p><i>The address bar in Firefox will actually redirect you to google.com if you type just google, however what I am proposing is to actually get rid of the TLD for some websites.</i><p>This is pure fiction. What actually happens is if Firefox can't resolve the address, it assumes it's a search term and passes the term into a preset URL (defined by the keyword.URL setting).<p>Back before version 3.0 (I think; don't quote me on that), this preset passed the ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" flag to the Google search URL. As a result, if you typed ""Google"" into the address bar, with no TLD, Firefox would effectively search Google for the term ""Google"" and the ""I'm feeling lucky"" feature would redirect you to the first result, which is obviously Google.com.<p>Since 3.0, the preset doesn't have the ""I'm feeling lucky"" parameter, so if you type ""google"" into the address bar, you'll actually get a page of google results for the term ""google"". I, and I'm sure many others, have since tweaked the keyword.URL setting to again use the lucky flag, but on a vanilla install, the author is just plain wrong in his assumption.<p>One final nitpick:<p>* After this recent surge of custom TLDs, I am beginning to think, that they are not a limitation, but that we can change them, almost freely, presumed we have the knowledge to do it (Please, correct me if I am wrong, and forgive my ignorance).*<p>Perhaps English isn't the authors first language, and if that's true then I apologize, but I simply was unable to parse that paragraph. Commas just don't work that way.",1297072251

Basically this is a somewhat simplified model, and the papers on which it is based view things more complex then impulsivness = hard-wired:<p><i>An important note is that the full version of TMT places a constant in the denominator to prevent the denominator from skyrocketing into infinity as delay approaches 0. Also, 'impulsiveness' here is a substitute for 'susceptibility to delay,' something which may vary by task, whereas 'impulsiveness' sounds like a stable character trait that might not help to explain having different motivations to perform different tasks.</i>",1297069468
