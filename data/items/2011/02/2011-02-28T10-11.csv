2270808,comment,2269659,2269659,0,0,usaar333,,,"> All of the above is highly dependent on where you go.<p>That's one of the few claims I agree with.  I can only speak for engineering majors, but my college experience was radically different from the author's.   Whether the piece of paper my classmates and I walked out with mattered is another story, but at least the first three years of education were invaluable.<p>> This really applies to tech, where honestly people don't really give two shits about your degree if you are a good programmer or have experience on hot projects.<p>Half-true.  Even though I had been programming since middle school, my college experience with EECS taught me a lot technically and socially. It granted a far broader network faster than any job has.  On top of that, it gave vast access to internship programs, which taught everyone involved a lot about industry.  And that came in handy after graduating; having the knowledge that I could get a high-paying job almost anywhere at anytime allowed me to take far greater personal financial risks with my startup than I would have been comfortable otherwise.<p>> If you expect to learn skills that will train you for a job, prepare to be disappointed going to a four year college. You aren't going to learn anything that is directly applicable to any job.<p>I completely disagree.  Granted it all comes down to your major, but if you take engineering at a top school (which does not include Yale), this is highly untrue. The knowledge I learned in college was critical to developing my startup from a technological standpoint; operating systems, programming languages, artificial intelligence, probability, algorithms, and databases are just a few of the subjects which have flowed into it.  And yes, you can just ""read a book"", but that is no substitute for being in the thick of it through collaborative group-work.  Technically, being exposed to vast numbers of patterns is essential, and college is a prime place for that to happen.  I know virtually no one who possesses the same technical breadth of those that went through my program (or equivalent).<p>> It didn't prepare me mentally for startups.  College was really an exercise in credentialing within a rigidly defined system, and didn't prepare me to think outside-the-box, live the consequences of my own actions, or really exist on my own in the real world at all.<p>It's amazing what a difference a major can make.   Working on ill-defined team projects that would last well over 200 hours in a single semester was a great precursor to the startup world.  And college is an excellent training ground to build essential social skills.<p>> In my final year I was taking classes two days a week for only two hours a day (most of them intros, perversely). Keep in mind that I was a full time student without a job at one of the best universities in the country.<p>If your goal is to just get a degree, sure, you can slack by.  If you want to take the maximum advantage of courses, this will not be true. Especially in engineering (architecture is another example I've seen), you will work your ass off and learn a lot.<p>> For a lot of students, college is a vacation, and it is a bunch of bullshit if we pretend otherwise.<p>The only sustained vacation during my college years was Winter Break. Hell, the summer internships I had offered way more of a vacation than college did. Again, if you are going to college, you need to take full advantage of it.",1298889056

Friends of mine in teams closer to laptop features (think Windows 7 touch input, for example) never have had problems getting a laptop. On my current team, it's not common for an IC dev to have a laptop. It's also not common to find an IC dev with a machine more than 8 months old. I haven't quite figured out what everyone else's fascination is with laptops. I bought one for my own personal use, brought it to work, and then stopped bringing it because it just sat on my desk doing nothing 95% of the time.

I want to be productive, but I don't feel obligated to plow forward relentlessly hour after hour. If someone breaks my flow to ask a reasonable question, I don't think of it as a big deal. I think true flow is a lot less fragile than many give it credit for. It doesn't vanish anytime a pin drops nearby.<p>I think there's something to be said for the benefits of a less serious and more relaxed mindset. Working steadily, but not getting all caught up in ""how productive am I?"" like you're an assembly line robot. Coding is as much an art as a job and often you can be more productive by playing ping pong and chatting for 6 hours then having an insight that saves you 100 hours in the long run because your mind makes a lateral leap about the architecture that almost definitely wouldn't have happened if you had just sat at your desk typing all day.<p>I still see the benefits of private offices because it can be very beneficial to have the option of silence and intense focus when that is what you need to get over a hump, but it also seems like a lot of programmers are missing the great potential rewards of real creative collaboration--probably because they are used to collaborating in an uptight business-guy kind of way. Instead, they should take a cue from other creative people like artists, poets, and musicians, and allow their minds be free a good portion time through relaxation, speaking freely, and <i>gasp</i> having plenty of thoroughly unproductive fun. The gains in inspiration will easily outweigh the lack of perspiration, and life will become more enjoyable to boot. Isn't that ultimately the point of all this toil anyway?",1298888806

No. What riled us was the bone-headed way the towel cut-back was handled, explained, and justified.

Treating people <i>before</i> they need emergency treatment is much cheaper.

Bayesian methods are not readily computed with today's hardware and software, and my desk is a counter-example.<p>2.1 Last time I fitted a Bayesian model, I had 600 processors with infinibandy things joining them up and left it for a week.<p>2.2 None of the software I use does Bayesian by default.<p>3. In practice, a lot of statistics in industry can be done by barcharts. I know that that is hard to hear.  It is a big leap from there to Bayesian; bigger by far than from there to chi-sq tests.  Data are so sparse, expert judgement so rich, and time so short...<p>4. Priors introduce subjectivity - no doubt about it.  However, so do utility functions, pretty much cancelling it in my opinion.  It is inappropriate to use p-values as a decision making framework for various reasons, but a lot of scientific papers are about recording experimental observations, not decision-making. Policy-decisions should use utility functions and priors; but I am happy with my science papers frequentist.",1298887389
