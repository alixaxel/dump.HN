2187665,comment,2186871,2186871,0,0,yaxdotcom,,,"In the 1980s, I ran a monthly 24 page punk rock music magazine using this technology. By 1984, after I sold the business, desktop publishing was already pushing out ""cold type"". ""Cold type"" -- or phototypesetting -- was what we called the Compugraphic and Linotype machines that used photosensitive paper to image columns of type. As opposed to ""hot type"" -- the Linotype, Ludlow, and Monotype machines that poured molten lead into molds.<p>There was something seriously fun about the mechanics of publishing with cold type. It was a very satisfying physical process, involving all the senses: the smell of photoprocessing chemicals, the warmth of the wax machine, the glow of the light table, our art director humming while wearing his Walkman cassette player. And all the tools: xacto knives, rulers, sheets of rub-on borders and alignment crosshairs. Good layout required an aesthetic sense alloyed with a keen eye, mental concentration and fine motor skills. Maybe not so different from Photoshop now but there was an embodied, kinesthetic and sensual aspect that's gone missing.<p>We thought the combination of the $4000 128K Mac and $6000 Apple Laser Printer was an incredible and liberating technology. Now we barely remember that ""desktop publishing"" was an innovation. And now I realize I miss the physicality of cold type.<p>Of course, there were those who decried all that was lost in the transition from hot type to cold type. Famously, it was a desire to recreate the aesthetic qualities of hot type that spurred Donald Knuth to create TEX, the digital typesetting program.",1297054241

You typically can't buy a policy that will cover <i>only</i> 1970s-era medical treatments.  Even if you could, it brings up a host of ethical issues that many doctors wouldn't be comfortable with.  Say a kid gets strep throat.  Okay, give him penicillin, it's cheap and he gets better quickly.  Now say that the doctors don't realize it's strep throat, or do but forget to give him penicillin, or he's got a drug resistant strain.  It gets into his kidneys.  Suddenly, this is expensive, requiring hospitals and diuretics and possibly dialysis.  But it's 100% fixable.  Should the doctors let him die because his insurance doesn't pay for modern medical treatments?<p>This is the problem with basically all academic economics models.  They make certain simplifying assumptions to make the math tractable, so that they can draw conclusions about the economy as a whole.  And I have no doubt that the economy <i>as a whole</i> is bigger, stronger, and better than it was in the 1970s.<p>But that glosses over all the individuals that make up the economy, some of whom are decidedly <i>not</i> better off than they were in the 1970s.  When someone is involuntarily laid off, they're strictly worse-off than they were beforehand (otherwise, they would've voluntarily quit).  The economist would say ""They'll get a job in some other sector of the economy, one that's growing where their talents can be more productively employed, and be better off in the long run.""  And that's absolutely true, but it doesn't make things any better <i>for that person right now</i> when they need to put food on the table.",1297054211

Is there some reason that you feel you need to also cover this part of the project too? It's difficult enough to master and stay on top of all the technologies that have listed, and design is a huge topic which in and of itself could consume you. It's also in many ways quite tangental to your existing skillset.<p>That said if you do insist on being the fully rounded person and doing all aspects of the project (which I often find myself doing :-) I would second the advice given here to simply borrow design elements from sites that you like (90% of 'design' is simply this anyway, with a relatively small number of people putting actual design principles to use and even even smaller number of thought leaders doing interesting and innovative design work). This should give you a start on getting something that looks somewhat decent, and give you time to think about how far down the design rabbit hole you wish to dive so that you will at least start to understand the underpinnings and theory of the things you had been cargo-culting.<p>Design is not how something looks - it's how it works. Think like an end-user and step back from the myopic view most developers have of their own applications. Ask yourself questions like ""Is it obvious what to do here? Does the UI help me achieve my goals or hinder it?"" The actual visual representation is only one part of achieving these goals. Remove redundant, confusing or cluttered elements on screen. In good design every pixel pulls it's own weight and white-space is used judiciously. Perfection is achieved when nothing more can be removed.<p>Pay attention to color schemes - there are plenty of sites now which will help you pick a nice color palette. Pick colors which work well together and are readable. Colors convey a message.<p>Don't ignore typography either. Googling will give you good suggestions for fonts which work well together and carry certain types of messages and associations. Don't use too many fonts on page. Vertical rhythym and letter/line spacing can make a big difference to a sites appearance.<p>Something I do before starting sites is to make a proof sheet - sample content of the basic types of tags, elements and markup you will encounter, and a CSS stylesheet  defining the appearance of these elements. This may help you visualise the site a little better and will keep you consistent as you build it out.",1297052376

I don't see anyone willingly adding a feature to actually restrict functionality the way a currency detection engine would/does. At least, in an open source project, I think there would be enough resistance from contributors to keep such components from becoming standard features. This I consider a <i>good</i> thing about the GIMP, Krita, and any/every other FOSS graphics package out there.<p>That said, it does present a pretty little puzzle for the FOSS community. Given governments' recent roles in expanding the reach of FOSS software, I don't think we can ignore the question of what happens when and where the interests of the state conflict with those of the FOSS community. Here, specifically, we have a case where a government may desire a ""feature"" anathema to the community, but likely can't force the community to accept such a requirement. What they <i>might</i> be able to do is outlaw any version of the package which does <i>not</i> incorporate the restriction. How effectively can could they enforce it?
