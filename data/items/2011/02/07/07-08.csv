Western philosophy loves setting up these weird one-or-the-other answers to questions and then spending decades dancing around the real answer which is: both or neither at the same time.  Typically comes from also removing the context and timing of asking the question.<p>I'd answer the above question: ""They are both the original ship, and not the original at the same time.""  But, this baffles people who believe that you can't be two things at once, even though the majority of truly interesting phenomena in the world are complex enough that they fit into this answer.<p>Another classic done this way is: ""A farmer looks at a painted cut-out of a milk cow far away against a tree and mistakes it for a cow.  Is it a cow or is it not a cow.""  Again, why can't it be both.  At that moment in time, given the context of a farmer, it's a cow because he believes it <i>and</i> it's not a cow because it's just a painting of one.<p>I also think this need to shove everything into a boolean algebra problem is why most software is difficult.

[...] As you'd expect, the cheap make isn't limited to the surrounding parts of the tablet -- the plastic displays on the 70 and 101 suffer from the same issues. We weren't expecting Gorilla Glass quality here, but both of them are flimsy and when pressed firmly, they start to cave in quite a bit. [...] vertical viewing angles are incredibly bad. Tilting the screens slightly off axis to about 30-degrees caused a ton of color distortion, and if you happen to be standing above the displays while they are propped up on the kickstands, it's nearly impossible to see what is on screen. [...] The VGA cameras on both tablets are incredibly sluggish, and when we finally were able to snap some stills, they came out blurry and grainy. Similarly, when we shot some video, the footage was very choppy and the audio wasn't in sync with the video at all.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/24/archos-70-and-101-internet-tablet-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/24/archos-70-and-101-interne...</a>",1297063665
