I definitely will redesign the homepage and create an apps to make uploading videos much easier.  I totally agree with executing small but with high quality.  I'm planning to focus on helping people sell used things like a second hand marketplace.  A video will best describes a second hand product.  I believe it would be a great niche and it's a huge market also.  What do you guys think if we concentrate and focus our marketing resources aiming toward used things?",1298267995

They're scared of technology because of interference with equipment, and they're scared of any new content providers in the form of books/magazines/etc because they'll upset the decades-old partnerships with the current partners, and they're pretty much just unable to even comprehend or process any ""new ideas"" due to the size of the bureaucracy involved at your average hospital.<p>Again, this is just my view, from my local hospitals.

Yet in this discussion there's a Lisper arguing that with A B C in Forth, you have no idea how many items have been left on the stack. (I presume this is based on a lack of experience, as Canonical Forth style suggests each word starts with a comment detailing beginning and ending stack states.) I find myself wondering, A B C would be surrounded by contextual code, so in real code the meaning would be clear, no?<p>I think that sociologically Lisp and Forth users are more alike than not, but the camps rarely seem talk to each other. It's clear from Forth's history that it has a secure niche in 8- & 16-bit microcontroller applications. I have no idea if there is such a thing as a Lisp application niche these days.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2242594"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2242594</a><p>Edit: link and typo",1298266170

Traceroute operates by setting the TTL (Time to Live) field of a packet to 1 and forwarding it along.<p>In principle, routers that reach a value of 0 when they decrement the TTL drop the packet and send a backward ICMP TTL-exceeded-in-transit notification to the sender, which is how the address of the router is discovered.  Then traceroute sends out another datagram, increases the TTL by 1, and so on until the desired endpoint is reached or a maximum TTL value is exceeded (to avoid getting the datagram into routing loops).<p>In practice, some networks - especially at the edge, outside the core infrastructure of large backbone haulers - block outgoing ICMP TTL-exceeded-in-transit messages, and sometimes all ICMP, including ICMP echo reply, administratively prohibited, and port unreachable messages.  These are all diagnostically useful, but can also be used to profile an endpoint or map the interior of a network.  I would especially expect a government like Libya's to make a policy of blocking such revealing messages at all border routers associated with national-level Internet egress points.<p>There is a constant and lively debate in the BGP and inter-domain networking community about the relative benefit of ICMP messages for troubleshooting and normal operations (after all, there was a reason the protocol was created) vs. the perceived security liabilities of having unrestricted two-way ICMP interactions with the rest of the Internet.<p>So, it's not clear what it means for traceroutes through the Telecom Italia AS to ""fail,"" nor does this necessarily indicate that Libya has gone dark.  It would be more convincing if all BGP announcements associated with Libyan blocks were withdrawn, although that would only happen if every one of their blocks was a provider-independent, RIR (regional Internet registry, RIPE in Libya's case)-issued block, not a delegated part of a foreign provider's larger aggregate announcement, so even then, who knows.<p>For what it's worth, I am unable to reach the same conclusion as the article, at least at this moment.

If you go find your nearest BGP looking glass (such as: 'telnet route-server.gblx.net' as I prefer the Cisco interface, you can find others at www.bgp4.as/looking-glasses) and do, for example:<p><pre><code>   show ip bgp 41.208.64.0/18
</code></pre>
... you will find the announcements for all of the above alive and well.<p>P.S.  Why does everyone who says ""if you have a .ly domain, you are supporting the Gaddafi regime!"" assume that the .ly TLD is managed directly by Libya? [2]  Many smaller, less Internet-involved (if not wholly Internet-unconnected) countries outsource management and use of their TLD to foreign companies in exchange for licensing fees.<p>EDIT: It does appear that '.ly' is managed from inside Libya now, but if so, that's a relatively recent development.  There was a UK company that managed the 'ly' zone for quite some time.<p>Now the primary nameserver seems to be dns1.lttnet.net, associated with Libyan Telecom and Technology, and whose IP is 62.68.42.9 and indeed part of one of the Libyan allocations above (62.68.32.0/19).<p>If it's stability you're concerned about, then look who else is involved as a backup other than lttnet.net:<p><pre><code>   sasha@octavia:~$ host -t SOA ly
   ly has SOA record dns.lttnet.net. khaleds.lttnet.net. 201102220 3600 900 2419200 600

Don't jump to conclusions.<p>---<p>[1]  Most of these are /27s and smaller that are part of larger aggregates.  I can't quite put my finger on why such small subnets are listed, given that the smallest announcement allowed in the global BGP table is a class C (/24).
