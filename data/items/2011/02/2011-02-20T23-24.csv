Like any other (unregulated) market, it has probably been at equilibrium for some time, as anyone that wanted an iPhone could've switched to AT&T over the last 4 years. So the strong iPhone demanders are already AT&T subscribers.<p>Who's left? Casual Verizon iPhone demanders. Let's assume they're not on AT&T (if they were on AT&T, they'd already own iPhones--trivial case). These people are casual demanders, so they won't pay $200 to break contract and get iPhones. They'll wait instead. What happens to them when a Verizon iPhone is announced? Nothing--they're still locked into their former contracts.<p>More likely is that Mauro sees a slight trend increase over the next few months (as these casual iPhone demanders see their contracts end and decide to buy iPhones).<p>I'm not shocked that February 10th was not a humongous success. Gruber predicted something like 1.5-2 million Verizon iPhones sold, but that number was too high. The iPhone market has had 4 years to settle down.",1298246226

2243581,comment,2242594,2243347,0,0,euccastro,,,"Sorry to be blunt, but it's only ""damned close"" from the point of view of someone that doesn't understand either decorators or macros.<p>Decorators are syntactic sugar for a particular mix of assignment and function call.  They're just there so you only need to write the name of the decorated object (say, function or class) once rather than three times.  For example<p><pre><code>  @some_deco
  def f(a, b):
      return a+b
</code></pre>
Is exactly the same as<p><pre><code>  def f(a, b):
      return a+b
  f = some_deco(f)
</code></pre>
Let me repeat: decorators only save you writing the name of the function two additional times.  Which is nice and worth it, but not groundbreaking, and, more to the point, has <i>nothing whatsoever</i> to do with macros (except perhaps that in Python you couldn't do it without macros, but that's besides the point).<p>The equivalent to decorators in Lisp is just normal higher order programming (functions taking functions as arguments, and/or returning functions), with no particular syntax.<p><pre><code>  (define f 
    (some-deco 
      (lambda (a b) (+ a b))))
</code></pre>
It would be bad form to use a macro for something like this, which is firmly within the domain of normal function definitions and calls.<p>(P.S.: For short functions like this, you could have said, in Python:<p>f = some_deco(lambda x, y: x + y)<p>But this breaks for multiline functions and class definitions.)",1298245960

2243508,comment,2242314,2242550,0,0,bodyfour,,,"One thing that I dislike is that it tries to be overly generic, i.e.<p><pre><code>   try { throw 5; } catch (const int& val) { printf(""%d\n"", val); }
   try { throw ""hello_world""; } catch (const char *&val) { puts(val); }
</code></pre>
I think it would have been much better (and simpler for implementers!) if they had made std::exception a more fundamental part of the language and required that throw be used on a descendant of it.  As it stands if you want to be sure to catch any failure from some external code you end up doing:<p><pre><code>  try {
    something();
  } catch (const std::exception& ex) {
    fprintf(stderr, ""ERROR: %s\n"", ex.what());
  } catch (...) {
    fputs(""UNKNOWN ERROR\n"", stderr);
  }
</code></pre>
My personal opinion is that it's easier to deal with C++ exceptions (warts and all) than to try to avoid them.  Just about any method that mutates a STL type can have a heap allocation fail and the only reasonable way to report that is via ""throw std::bad_alloc();"".  Just make sure that your code always follows the principals of RAII ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII</a> ) and you'll be fine.",1298244422

The tabs display in a scrollable drawer.  I found an inferior sidetab plugin for Firefox when I was on Linux for a while and have found no comparable thing for IE (I don't use Chrome); I feel vaguely lost with top-tabs because they're too squished, can't be read, and are hard to scroll around. ;P",1298243570

In both languages, once a program is large enough for any syntactic ambiguity to make a difference, there will be more than enough semantic clues to help solve the syntactic disambiguaties.<p>In other words: yes, one can write really hard to understand Lisp, where (f x) has six meanings in one line, but outside of obfuscated code contests, programmers just do not write such code.<p>Edit: the semantic clues I refer to are those implied by function names, names of data types, etc.",1298243516

Nameserver domains unregistered, control panels inaccessible. No warnings, no email notifications, no refunds of prepaid [quarterly/annual] account balances. Sales and support contacts unresponsive. Owner refuses to acknowledge that he was ever affiliated with the company.<p>Note that they appeared perfectly legitimate: reselling on behalf of a reputable firm [Hawk Host], offering a normal range of hosting plans from a few dollars a month to $80 or so. They had hosted these two domains for 18 months without any significant downtime, and had responded quickly to my (few) support tickets over that time period.<p>Neither domain hosted mission-critical services, just a company blog and web-facing marketing material. The MX records pointed to another mailserver provider. Therefore I had no automated monitoring pointed at either domain, and did not immediately realize that the servers had gone down. (My focus was elsewhere; I first found out when I casually attempted to login to Wordpress later in the week.) As a consequence, I lost these web presences for days, and undoubtedly lost company email [as senders could not retrieve the MX records from the nonexistent nameservers].<p>tl;dr moral: Monitor EVERYTHING. What happens if one of YOUR hosting vendors silently evaporates while YOU'RE focusing elsewhere? Write out the entire chain of dependencies for your email domains, web domains, DNS redirects, IP forwarding, etc. Do this again every few months. If a host/service <i>really</i> isn't mission-critical and you therefore don't want to pay for third-party monitoring, at least setup cron jobs such that your hosts/domains cross-check each other at regular intervals. Remember: Your 1337 skill set is <i>useless</i> if you are not aware of priority issues.
