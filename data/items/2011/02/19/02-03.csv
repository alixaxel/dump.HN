Defensive domain squatting, you might call it.<p>I'm all for abolishing the TLD suffixes totally since (a) they're not used consistently anymore anyway, and (b) it reduces confusion between cases like foo.com and foo.org and foo.net, etc -- unsophisticated users (who are the majority) may assume some or all are the same service or purpose, but they are not. Yes, in a way, in acts to increase demand for a single namespace, but on the other hand, the same sorts of workarounds and naming hacks are still available (add extra words, suffixes, dashes, etc.).<p>I personally now like fun/weird non-sensical non-specific ""made up"" names because (a) they're more likely to not already be taken, and (b) they could be used for an almost infinite variety of purposes justifiably. For example: www.spooflurk.com could be for shoes, sex, politics, a CV, a company, a game, a band, whatever, whereas www.shoe-sales.com is rightly expected to be pretty much about selling shoes. Yes you'll get less ""organic"" traffic (and less accidental traffic, which may sometimes be the same thing) on the other hand I'm a firm believer that the most important thing is to provide something people want, and eventually the right number and mix of people will find out about it anyway, regardless of the name.

The opposite is when you get the results, but by slogging through a bunch of inelegant boilerplate.<p>It's also the whole premise behind the ""hacking the workweek"" type ideas, though I realize not everyone likes those.<p>If anything, I'd say it's a pretty pervasive part of hacker culture, and what differentiates it to some extent from ""normal"" engineering culture: hackers aim for that results/effort win, the cool hack, virtuosic performance, etc., rather than the N-hour straightforward, carefully managed slog. Not even just because it saves time/money, but because somehow it's intrinsically interesting to see people finding ways to get great results via a route other than ""I just plowed through it and got it done"".

When you 'cd' into a directory along your CDPATH, Bash will print out where you end up when you arrive. Here's an example of what I mean (easier to see than explain):<p><pre><code>    circe ~ ❯❯ cd bin\n    circe bin ❯❯ cd ithaca\n    /Users/circe/code/ithaca\n    circe ithaca [master•] ❯❯ \n</code></pre>\nThe regular cd simply takes me where I asked. When I cd and use CDPATH (in the second case), I get <i>told</i> where I end up. Sure, there might be four or five different 'ithaca' folders on various machines and even on one machine, but I think that extra print-out really makes it unlikely that I will get confused.<p>> And you do know that CDPATH also affects shell scripts, right?<p>No, I'm embarrassed to say, I never thought of this. And this part <i>does</i> sound like a potential problem. When I write Bash scripts, I always use full paths, but I see where my having CDPATH set puts me at danger from other people's scripts.

2238134,comment,2237158,2237766,0,0,strlen,,,"Voldemort developer here. I actually spoke with Nathan a bit (hi Nathan!) and concluded ElephantDB is a different project, solving a somewhat different use case.<p>The core difference is that Voldemort read-only storage uses a custom storage engine, based on memory mapped files (see the blog link jbellis posted) which allows a very high data to memory ratio (without having to worry about HotSpot's garbage collection, while excellent, still has issues with heaps larger than 20-30 gb). The data and index files are both built as part of the Map/Reduce job in Hadoop.  The files are fetched in parallel from HDFS  to Voldemort serving nodes, swapped ""atomically"" (atomic relative to a single node, not the cluster), and the process of fetching these files warms up the page cache as these files are written to disk. However, that makes implementing incremental updates tricky.<p>Of course, being part of Voldemort adds additional features e.g., being able to collocate it with read-write stores, using Voldemort's pluggable serialization support, failure detection, existing clients (for Java, C++, Python, Ruby), etc..<p>We use the read-only storage engine heavily for such features as People You May Know (Voldemort push  being after around 100 chained Map/Reduce jobs), Skills, parts of our recommendation engine (the more real time features use read/write store) and more.  The average latency is consistently within a few milliseconds: upper bound being the time it takes a disk to perform a single seek (if the data isn't in the cache). We've current improving ability to expand clusters with read only stores without re-pushing the data: my coworker Roshan was able to even make use of sendfile() when shipping data from one node to another to make this expansion fast with large volumes of data. We're also working on changes to the index format which will make it easier to implement incremental updates.<p>In addition to LinkedIn, the read-only storage functionality / Hadoop integration, is also used by several interesting startups, namely DeepDyve and Mendeley as well as at least one big company (not sure if I'm allowed to give out their name).<p>Bottom line: look at your requirements and see which solves your problem best. Distributed storage systems aren't a zero sum game.",1298081774
