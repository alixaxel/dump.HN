If it is worth a lot to someone (and I suppose not everyone), then the value of Bitcoin will be high. But not everyone wants a Bitcoin.

This means you are getting all the benefit of ""free"" cooling, without paying for a battery system and without paying for enough solar panels to run the AC for a whole house, and getting this boost exactly when you need it.  (When the sun is beating down on your house.)<p>You can also look into air heat exchangers.  This lets you preheat your ventilation input air with heat from your ventilation output.  This only works well for super-sealed super-insulated houses.  (The Germans even have a standard for super-green houses that includes such devices.)<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=heat+exchanger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&#3...</a><p>In Houston, the air quality varies with the tides.  If you are in a similar situation, I'd look into a custom controller that ventilates the house when the air quality is good, but seals it when it's bad.",1298721806
