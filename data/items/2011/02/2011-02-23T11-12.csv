You start getting distance problems though - a lot of words it generates are too close to or are trivial encapsulations of existing words, so that'd need taking account of. One day I'll have a proper play and do something more comprehensive for this.<p>Tip for anyone cacheing unsavoury words - from memory the bulk of what we ended up checking for were racial slurs, of which there's an astonishing (and unsurprisingly heavily localised) variety.",1298461984

You only show up for 30 minutes up to two hours (depends on when you post) on the new posts list and then you vanish forever. You should not repost, obviously, so you can't do much to get your project back on HN for a while. Of course, if you know the right people, they write a blog post about you, which brings you back on HN and you'll be overwhelmed with feedback, but this is rather the exception than the rule.<p>Generally, it is really hard to get people to send you feedback, especially if your project/startup/tool is intended for not tech-savvy users. There will be some users giving you feedback all the time (powerusers/early adopters) and you should stay in contact even if you don't have something new at the moment<p>What I found to be useful is displaying a ""1 minute of your time to improve the product""-form on the (in this case) applications home page, where every user will go. It is important to add a ""no, I don't want to do this""-option, because you don't want to nag your users with a always displaying form-link. Don't do popups, too, they are irritating. Just a small but visible link with a do or don't option and if the user don't want to do it, don't force them again. On my last project, I got almost 20% of the user base to fill out the form this way, which I think is a really strong base for analysing and improving your application/startup/tool.",1298461843

    * Posting tired memes
    * Persistent inability to cite sources for claims (in some subfora)
    * Dozens of other things I can't remember
    * Basically anything the mods decided to ban your for
</code></pre>
The reason this worked is because the mods were drawn from the community. The admins would look at a subforum, see who was trusted on there, had good judgement and was there a lot. They would then make that person a mod, without asking them or <i>even telling them!</i> That person would just log in next time to be confronted with lots of extra widgets on the UI.<p>Because the community was so cohesive across the site, that person would then know immediately it was their duty to post a thread saying ""Hi, I'm XYZ, your new Moderator"" and christen their new powers by stickying the thread.<p>Again, they were not told to do this, but they would immediately and without fail, because the criteria for being chosen as a mod means that anyone who is chosen would be aware of this tradition, and in fact every other aspect of their role, having learned by example.<p>The SA forums were operating lots of quite deep game mechanics stuff nigh on ten years ago. It's very interesting. Most of the measures wouldn't be appropriate for here though, a lot of them involved strategically fostering antagonism for the benefit of wider community cohesion. It really worked over there for a long time though.<p>EDIT: I seem to remember that for a long time they only took payment by actual credit cards, visa and so on, and not debit cards, paypal etc. This was deliberate to prevent kids from signing up.",1298460669

There should be a way for them to be tracked, ranked, categorized and tagged. Seeing what people have done and are doing is a good way to find co-founders, mentors, relevant people and prevent duplication of effort. Most importantly, it is a way for users to find online tools and services that they'll use, and to see their founders who they could contact.<p>-----------<p>2) Seemingly good founders and startups are getting rejected from YC, some being accepted after a 3rd or 4th attempt or raising large rounds immediately afterward. People from outside the US are flying into California and being rejected. I have details of a site that crowd-sources due diligence on startups - a task that investors now do.<p>It's basically about putting YC and Seedcamp-type application questions and their answers online, and then requesting and publicizing feedback. Responses and responders are just as important as the pitch, as seen with Quora and its priority on people answering. Tracking interested parties surrounding a startup team is as important as is tracking people interested and attending conferences on Lanyrd. Also, seeing what startups a person is involved with (investor, staff, mentor, user, supporter, partner) is important.<p>-- There was a time when putting a resume online was surprising and revealing to me, by way of LinkedIn.

A lawyer bills for his services by the hour. Both will provide a best guess at what they think it will take, but if you add some work or they find some problems you eat that cost not them.<p>Why people think software development should be any different is beyond me. If you are not getting equity in the project then you should not be working on a fixed price contract. It places all the risk on you while limiting your upside (you can only make the sticker price on the contract). Meanwhile the client has unlimited upside in this arrangement and shoulders none of the risk beyond the sticker price.<p><i>the employer will feel cheated if paying for longer than they expect (and let's be honest, all employers think that websites take half the time to build).</i><p>Ignorance of the discipline of software development is the employer problem, a good software developer can show them how scope creep, change in priorities and adjustments to specification has a negative impact on their expectations. If they feel cheated that is their problem to deal with, software development is not charity and if it takes twice as long to build and a developer puts in twice as many hours then they should be paid twice the hours just as any other service professional is.<p>The client/employer is not going to say ""oh wow we made twice as much as we expected off the software you developed, here you go, here is some free money"". So why would the developer say ""oh wow the project will take twice a long as, the employers uneducated analysis says it will, let me eat half the labor costs""<p>That being said, only extremely experienced freelancers should consider taking a fixed price contract. It can lead to financial ruin, in almost all situations a freelancer should be insisting on time and materials, like 90% of other service professionals. The exceptions would be reproducible services where times can be estimated with certainty (e.g installing wordpress or Postgres).<p>To answer the parent posters question, I see a lot of Senior level JavaScript freelancers charging in the area of $100-$200 hr for their services.

For example, the reason why colon/rectal cancer survival rate is high is because Japan is basically the only rich country where those cancers are the most common one (in other rich countries, prostate, breast, lungs usuallly come first for the concerned sex). There is also the issue of ""free-ride"", where most western countries benefit from research being done in the US and a couple other countries - which is not so easy to quantify either.<p>Designing good indicators is incredibly hard, and for that reason alone I think it will always be a political question first, and an economical one second (i.e. economics can help making a decision, but it won't give you the decision).",1298459817

If you have 1TB of files you can probably get away with 1GB of RAM for caching with a 90% hit rate. This means that your read speed is something on the order of 11GB/sec.

This means that you can have hundreds of readers from the ZIP file and only one writer. UNIX/Windows file locking semantics support this beautifully, readers don't lock the file and writers obtain a write lock.<p>The basic design of the system is that the readers register an event handler with the writer and when the writer finishes writing a file it updates the readers with the location of the file in the ZIP file.
