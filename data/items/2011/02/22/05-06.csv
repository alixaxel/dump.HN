To get your so-so full service health care, the sane market price is about $333/month, and in most of those systems, medication isn't covered fully if you have an income.  $50-$100 month just doesn't work other than emergency health care.  Emergency plans at that price also have clauses like the first $2500 of an accident is deductible free.",1298354203

Clients that come onboard with a co-employment contract for their employees. We pay their employees, our clients pay us and we become the employer (in most states though laws are always changing). This means we have 90k employees that help us negotiate some pretty good rates for Benefit plans. It's actually a pretty decent way for a smaller company to offer benefits to their employees that are competitive to larger companies.<p>We do try to take on companies of a minimum size (10+ employees) but sometimes end up taking on companies with 2 or 3 employees because the owner forecasts explosive growth -- which never happens. All that said, it's a freaking battle with the carriers every year to try to keep the increases at a lower rate. Also, we have ""rate buckets"" where we place clients according to risk and past medical history of its employees. It still tends to work out better than if they would attempt to get insurance on their own.",1298354070

2248864,comment,2248001,2248001,0,0,pnathan,,,"I work in QA in a high-reliability industry.  Correct operation of some our products saves millions and saves lives. We need <i>super</i> high quality. How we do QA is pretty traditional.  In particular, we have functional test teams.  The perspective we take is that the testers take the specs and develop tests to exercise the functionality, and theoretically, we (QA) cover any spots the developers missed, as well as providing assurance that the developers aren't talking out of the wrong hole when they say they're done. Seems to work most of the time except when mutual brain-farts develop.<p>I don't know that I would go so far as to recommend firing myself to increase quality.  I would have to visit with many teams and really gain experience in the way they work. I do think that we could take a step forward by having a standard across the company to have fully automated test suites running continuous builds and tests. That, however, runs facefirst into the problem of Legacy Stuff and ROI.  Automation just plain takes time when you are interfacing against external programs. It's not always worth it in the short/medium term.<p>There's no silver bullet to the software quality problem. But me, I think that continuous integration provides a copper bullet.",1298351818
