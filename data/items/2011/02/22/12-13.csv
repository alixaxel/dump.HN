For one thing, the barriers to entry are seemingly higher.  How much half-baked functional programming is out there?<p><i>Most of us don't write industrial-scale code twice, and even if we did, we couldn't do it with the same team and starting from the same knowledge base in both cases.</i><p>Big companies are pretty short-sighted.  Above a certain size threshold, companies should implement much of their critical user-facing software <i>at least twice</i>.  Basically, they should be engaging in A/B testing.  Why?  Isn't this wasteful?  I don't think so.  From my experience, both inside companies and as a customer, software can have an impact on employee effectiveness well beyond a factor of two.  There is always room for improvement.  The best way to discover places to improve is through experimentation.  Not doing this, is to leave these potential improvements on the table.<p>Perhaps a level of granularity below that of an entire application would be better.",1298379562

2249730,comment,2248901,2248901,0,0,Starmonkey,,,"A good article, but intimidating, in a way.  And I see this quite a bit in terms of budding programmer advice.  It boils down to ""you need to read this, and then read that, and then read this,"" and then the comments section will have even more suggestions for reading.<p>As I get older, and have kids, I find my ability to sit down and read all of this, and somehow retain it, decreasing.  I've recently decided to ""get back into"" coding (won't go into the history as it isn't tangential to the discussion).  I've been having some fun with very, very tiny beginner level programs in Ruby.  When I build a list of jobs I would want with Ruby involvement, I find I also need to brush up on my Javascript and learn JQuery. I need to get a full understanding of Git/Github. I should also learn Rails and Sinatra, VIM, and get reacquainted with CSS.<p>On top of that, it really does seem that C is a requirement to really understand what is happening in Ruby.  It seems a lot of things that _why_ wrote for Ruby, he wrote in C.<p>Then there is all the additional readings, such as in this article, and comments section.  All of which seem incredibly legit, but leave me feeling like I will never actually find the time to write code due to all the reading I don't have time to do.<p>Is there an order of importance with all of this?",1298379416

2249702,comment,2249189,2249441,0,0,masklinn,,,"> And if you have numerous getter/setters, it will feel and look like shit indeed -- in any language, no matter how terse the syntax. However, in that case the problem is with program design, not with the language itself.<p>You missed a core issue of the whole getter/setter/properties business: future-proofing/evolvability.<p>In Java, people generate bunches of getters/setters because if you ever need to create ""virtual"" members (add pre/post conditions) with public members you've just broken your interface (it's also used by technologies like Java Beans), you can't evolve gracefully from one to the other, hence Java IDEs having become very good at auto-generating getters and setters (including the type-induced naming variations). Likewise in C#, you can't replace a public member by a property without recompiling all clients (and if you follow the C# naming conventions, properties are PascalCased whereas members are camelCased), hence new syntactic forms having been introduced over time to make ""direct proxy"" properties easier and easier to create (last time I checked, creating a R/W property called Foo in C# is down to `public $type Foo { get; set; }`, and no field declaration at all as the field is implicitly generated by the property)<p>And so is it in PHP: if you use public members you can replace them by __get or __set, but if you <i>ever</i> need more than one or two fields you're fucked as you end up with a ball of mud of manual static dispatches. If you go the Java way, you get the Java result.<p>Now you assert that it's the same in every language. This is patently incorrect, and let me demonstrate it with two languages as far apart on this issue as they could be, Ruby and Python (very similar on most things, but not on this)<p>* Ruby has no public members. Period, end of the story. In Ruby, a public member is already a property, but because it's common to just expose a member without pre/post conditions it has accelerators for this such as `attr_accessor`. `attr_accessor :foo` creates a read/write property (actually a pair of methods) `foo` on the object which will proxy to the private member `@foo`. This means if it's exposed in Ruby, it's already a property. If you want to add pre/post conditions, remove the `attr_accessor` call and replace it with an explicit pair of `def foo` and `def foo= value`. This evolves gracefully and scales trivially, declaring a property in Ruby is as terse as (if not terser than) declaring a <i>public member</i> in PHP.<p>* Python goes the other way: everything is public. Period, end of the story. But it also has `property` which is an object implementing the descriptor protocol. Long story short, you can replace a public member `foo` by a property `foo` (created at the class level), and when accessed from the instance they will be indistinguishable. So in Python, just as in Ruby, you can trivially swap out a field for a property as needed without having to dispatch anything manually or defensively pre-generate a bunch of crap.<p>> Ask your co-workers kindly not to carry over Java thinking into PHP world. Really, each language performs best when used in its default way.<p>Getters and setters <i>is</i> the default PHP way. Hell, <i>all</i> of the Zend framework uses getters and setters everywhere[0]. __get and __set (and __call if you really want to talk about that one) are the special cases for <i>dynamic</i> fields and methods (e.g. in ORM), not for <i>static</i> properties.<p>As to my coworkers, they've switched well away from PHP a long time ago.<p>> Also, you have __call() in similar vein, which lets you do pretty neat results: <a href=""http://scriptor.github.com/pharen/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scriptor.github.com/pharen/index.html</a><p>I don't see why you'd <i>need</i> __call to compile Lisp into PHP.<p>[0] example: the request object <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.request.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.request....</a>",1298378472

2249630,comment,2249459,2249459,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Walled gardens are great when a medium is brand new. Without history and without a critical mass of knowledgeable individuals it's very much more difficult for individuals to find offerings of sufficient quality, and then from there to filter based on individual preferences and needs. Such was the case with mobile apps when the iphone came around. The quality of mobile apps tended to be rather poor at the time and there was a bewildering array of them. The iphone introduced a huge new chunk of people to smartphones, the appstore model was an attempt to raise the quality bar of mobile apps and to make it easier for users to find and buy apps. And it worked spectacularly well, propelling a once questionable development arena to enormous heights of popularity (and in some cases profitability).<p>If you look back on, for example, video game development you can see the problems that can occur without such walled gardens. The home video game market boomed in the late 70s and early 80s, with families buying new games like hotcakes. A lot of game makers jumped on the bandwagon and pumped the market full of low quality games. Whereas in previous years the total number of games for the Atari 2600, for example, had been in the low dozens in 1982/83 this number ballooned to <i>hundreds</i>. Consumers could no longer have much confidence in which games to buy and so they stopped buying, leading to a massive crash of the video game industry in the US that lasted until Nintendo came along with its own walled garden approach.<p>However, the video game industry has matured since then, and walled gardens are no longer very helpful (there are far more than sufficient resources these days to determine which games to buy and which to avoid based on individual preferences).<p>As the mobile app market continues to mature it will strain against its walled garden confines more and more. Increasingly such hand-holding is less necessary and more and more restrictive. Apple has a choice to recognize that the market is changing and to adapt or to ignore the changes and pretend as though it's still 2008 while the world passes them by.",1298376681

We did report the issue but never came to a good solution in time. For example, we could give Redis an entire 12GB server and set the VM to 4GB, and given enough time (under high load, mind you) it would climb well above 12GB and start to swap, more or less killing our site.<p>We came across this same issue while implementing a Redis-based solution to improve the scalability of our own systems.  Someone filed an issue reporting this: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=248</a>.<p>Basically, antirez confirms that Redis does a poor job estimating the amount of memory used, so you'll need to adjust your redis.conf VM settings to take this into account.  For anybody relying on Redis's VM, I'd recommend writing a script to load your server with realistic data structures with sizes you expect in production.  You can then profile Redis's configured memory usage vs. the actual memory usage point at which swapping starts occurring, and set your redis.conf according to the limitations of your box.  For example, we run Redis 2.0.2, and using list structures with ~50 items of moderate size, we found configuring Redis to use 400MB actually resulted in it using up to 1.4GB before swapping.  We configure our settings to take this into account.  Mind you, this may all change with diskstore, and later versions of Redis which are supposed to be more memory efficient.<p>For those curious, our Redis-based solution is helping us scale some write-heavy activities quite nicely, and has been running stably.",1298376611
