2173344,comment,2173244,2173244,0,0,yahelc,,,"All the examples of things Google Analytics <i>can't</i> do are incorrect. Google Analytics Custom Events are fairly robust, providing a 4 level data hierarchy. 'Pageviews' are a concept that can be applied in non-pageview scenarios, and they regularly are in apps. And being able to flag people as logged in vs. not logged in is a classic example of what you can use Custom Variables for. Mixpanel has some interesting offerings, particularly in the real-time space, but Google Analytics offers 99% of what most sites need, and without a price tag.<p>There are things Google Analytics does poorly, though, like Goals (which don't work for Events, aren't retroactive, and are limited to 20 per profile) and Funnels (which are even more rigid than Goals).<p>I wish MixPanel well, since a competitive analytics space is good for us all, but the developer they quoted could use some advice on how to maximize his/her Google Analytics experience.

The problem, which Stephenson alludes do earlier in the article, is space just isn't proving to be as useful as we had anticipated.  We're already doing pretty much everything that you can justify from an economic perspective.  Activities like asteroid mining and space solar power aren't going to make sense for centuries even if we dramatically cut the cost of $/kg to orbit.<p>So sure, we could do the same things more cheaply after a huge investment in, say, tethers.
