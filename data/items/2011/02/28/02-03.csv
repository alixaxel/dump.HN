Another option is to create a domain in your own personal account. In that case you have more control, but you also have more responsibility. Sometimes it's good to be done and done.<p>I recommend against using GoDaddy. Very confusing interface. Check out Dreamhost.",1298861808

2269849,comment,2269761,2269761,0,0,zacharypinter,,,"I've been really torn on this one.<p>I don't like the direction Apple is taking for software development. I don't want our field to be one where every product and idea is at the mercy of some other company's approval. Even worse, I don't like how Apple is setting a precedent that all the other platforms are so eagerly following.<p>However, I can't seem to break away from buying Apple products. I tried going the Ubuntu route with a Lenovo x201, but had endless problems with both the software and hardware. The laptop would shutdown every time I closed the lid (even after multiple firmware updates and beta kernels). I missed my ability to print anything to Evernote as a PDF. I missed how the default Mac OS keybindings use Command over Ctrl. On Linux/Windows, any time I view a page with Flash it intercepts the Ctrl key preventing me from quickly opening and closing browser tabs. It's a very old netscape plugin bug, but Apple nicely sidesteps it by using the Command key instead.<p>So, while I can't break free of Apple products just yet (though I want to), I draw the line at developing applications that help fuel the environment they've setup.",1298861571
