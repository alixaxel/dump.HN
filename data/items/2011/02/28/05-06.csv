We slapped AdSense on it. The CTR is awful, and additionally, the ads are either ""public service"", or mostly irrelevant. We don't want to display porn ads - we want to make it so that people bored at work can browse it. We are looking into some other ad networks, which seem to have longer turn-around times and manual approval processes, so we are racking our brains in the meantime.<p>What other ad networks have you guys had success with?<p>What other information should I provide here so that you guys have a better picture of what's going on?<p>Any other ideas on how this thing can make money?",1298872799

2270242,comment,2270051,2270195,0,0,bartonfink,,,"I haven't done so, but have done a fair bit of investigation. The most technically correct answer I can give is that it depends on where you're going and how you leave things in the US.<p>First, where you're going. You obviously want to go somewhere with better healthcare than the U.S., which isn't all that difficult to find. The ? becomes what your obligations will be as a somewhat permanent resident and how you can maintain that status legally. That's really going to be location dependent, but you should look and look hard before you leap, because the consequences could be unpleasant if you screw up. I believe there are agencies that cater to potential expats like yourself, and if you're really serious about this you should talk to one of them to make sure you don't step on any landmines in the process.<p>As for the second ?, The US assumes that you continue to owe US taxes as long as you maintain your citizenship, and they make it difficult to give that up. I don't know exact figures, but you are exempt up to something like $78000 of income and are allowed to write any foreign taxes you pay on that off, but as long as you are a US citizen you're on the hook. If you move to Singapore and strike it rich, unless you pay the IRS you could have extradition hearings in your future. I'm pretty sure the deficient US health care system would be pretty low on your list of worries in that case. Again, this is the sort of thing a professional could tell you more about, but this is definitely out there. I don't want to advocate giving up your citizenship lightly, but know that the US is unique in this sort of taxation and making a fortune abroad without paying US taxes would almost certainly be viewed as some sort of tax evasion if you didn't proceed very carefully.",1298872726

2270237,comment,2269659,2269659,0,0,Breefield,,,"This article sits well with me, as I've hashed this out a lot in my own head in the past year. I would be a freshman this year had I decided to attend a college. However, I didn't want to get burdened down with any unnecessary loans, and as previously stated by others, the industry is quite navigable without a degree.\nInstead I've moved myself from Boise Idaho to NYC, and I'm loving it, meeting other people in the industry I wouldn't otherwise be meeting, and learning new things constantly.<p>I think one main point that the article leaves out is that if you decide not to attend college, or decide to drop out, you'll really need some self discipline. I spent a ton of time in high school sitting in my room being an autodidact. Learning how things work, and then learning to apply techniques and such. Then trying to find any scraps of work I could so as to build a portfolio/resume. Had I been doing what the rest of my peers were doing I certainly wouldn't have been in a place to not attend college.<p>Hopefully that doesn't come off as pretentious. I just think the whole aspect of having a skill v.s. not having a skill, or a passion for that matter, are left out of many of these ""is college worth it right now"" articles. Assuming the goal is to acquire a skill in college, and not to make friends/go through that rite of passage.\nSpeaking of rites of passage, anyone else going to Burning Man this year? It's going to be my first, and I'm oh so excited.",1298872669

2270202,comment,2269659,2269659,0,0,bugsy,,,"Good article. I agree with the points. After I dropped out of high school I ended up going to a well regarded west coast university. I was all set for it to be very challenging and some place where I would learn a lot but I was surprised to find the engineering classes were all things I already knew how to do. To challenge myself I shot for all A+s and considered each mere A to be a failure.<p>I also started to, as a further challenge, not even attend some of the easiest classes and managed to get A+ in those as well. I used the extra time to get involved in student government. I found it interesting observing the politics and learning how much back scratching and insider deals infect even college student council politics.<p>While in school, I joined a music group (unrelated to the school) and we did some touring during this time and earned money. One time we were even paid to play at my university. Touring in a music group is a great gig that I recommend. I met lots of famous and powerful people and made connections doing the music.<p>Still in school, I got a job working for a defense contractor. I wrote software for secret military satellite based space weapons. This was interesting since I didn't have any sort of clearance or anything and I was making close to minimum wage. At one point I had to write a paper on my research for my boss. He published it and took my name off the paper. He also went to some conference to present it that I had wanted to go to but he said I wasn't needed. There were also false promises about getting a $1 an hour raise. I was pretty resentful of this and stopped working on this project.<p>I do have a small list of things I learned in the program but they are somewhat trivial small things that I would have learned anyway. The interesting things had nothing to do with classes. I did make some friends of course but these ""connections"" have not really benefited me all that much, but I wasn't looking for that. It is strange that that is so often cited as a main reason to go into debt in order to attend university. Overall the main thing that happened is it delayed the starting of my first business by several years.<p>This makes me wonder about the value of school over all. I dropped out of high school and then found even college was pretty much useless as well. Very different from the way it is presented as the solution to all of society's ills. Did I learn anything even in elementary school I have to wonder?<p>Well, I knew how to read before I started kindergarten. My parents did not teach me. They tell me that I just started reading signs as we were driving along. Then I would read books. For a couple years in elementary I didn't even attend or study as we were doing some travel. When I returned to elementary school things seemed really slow and backwards. Before college, in primary school and high school I am not sure what I learned there either. Although I did have a psychology class in high school, and then a couple in college that were very interesting, so I learned some things there. But that was from reading the textbook and studies I'd look up on my own.<p>Whenever I want to know something I track down the information and just learn it on my own. It seems to me that school is pointless. I guess it is for dumb people? Or maybe its purpose is to brainwash people into being consumers.<p>Most of the founding fathers and enlightenment philosophe's were self taught. Some of the greatest minds in history are drop outs.<p>I think school is a rip off, just considering the wasted time and not even money. It does not benefit the ""student"", it benefits the system.<p>There is something to be said for a community of learners though. That is what a Start Up is. Others interested in the same niche thing you are come together, and you are now working together to make something new and figure out new things out every day. You depend on no one but yourselves. It is like a Salon of revolutionary France, only more practical.<p>If I had it all to do over again and was able to do so, I would not attend school at all, not even elementary school. I would simply unschool myself. This way I would have more time to work on my projects and inventions that I started working on before I was a teen. It would have given me a tremendous head start. I did not know it at the time, but what I was doing then was useful, unique and valuable and I was doing it right. Of course others are telling you you are wasting your time and should be doing worksheets or reading some nonsensical textbook instead, but that is because they are ignorant.<p>In addition to running my latest business, I read a lot. Now I am becoming educated. None of the history that was taught in school was accurate in the least. It was just propaganda to create patriots who will kill the ""enemy"" without question. The most ridiculous thing of all this is being forced to chant a pledge of allegiance to a flag, a piece of cloth. No allegiance to one's family or friends, the allegiance must be to a cloth.

2270125,comment,2269812,2269812,0,0,dbro,,,"This would have been helpful to me when I was starting out building <a href=""http://domainjig.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domainjig.com</a> - which is a simpler site than the author's. That said, I'd offer these responses to those looking for some advice:<p>1) Yes, wrapping every database call with an asynchronous callback is a drag. I found a helpful library that made some of my workflow easier to express and maintain: <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async</a> And I'm pretty sure I could simplify my code quite a bit more if I understood functional program patterns better already.<p>2) Libraries can be challenging, but I was able to find good ones for everything I needed. The author discussed version issues. To deal with that, I punted on all those node library managers and just jumped into the library code, checking it in to my repository and freezing it in time (in contrast to the authors point #9 about NPM being awesome for him). The other issue I found with libraries was that there are TOO MANY of them for any single thing. For example, there are at least a half dozen separate libraries to help with asynchronous workflow, and trying to choose which one would be ""best"" was difficult, and depended on freshness, documentation, and then actually test driving them. Github's encouragement of forking made this extra challenging, with many slightly tweaked variations for each separate library.<p>I found node.js lived up to its promises (for me): coding in javascript on both server and client was helpful in avoiding context switching inside my head, and encouraged me to invest more effort in writing better quality code everywhere. And node.js is plenty fast.<p>Another thing I'd add is that I used redis and tokyo cabinet as data stores and found the node.js interfaces to them to be mature and easy enough. It was convenient to use python's interactive shell to create and experiment with redis, and then port the routines to node.js.<p>To summarize, consider this a positive vote for node.js.",1298869782

But ""B2C is predictable and not too risky"" is patently absurd.  It requires attracting users, keeping them and figuring out a way to monetize them in some economically sensible way.  And this is while competing with 1000s of other services trying to attract attention as well.    VC portfolios are littered with carcasses of B2C startups that never caught on (and those are the well capitalized ones)<p>With regards to B2B, I think you're describing B2B in a consulting context vs. B2B SaaS.  In SaaS if done right, you have people with a pain and with real money to solve that pain.  As a result, you don't require millions of users to make good money.<p>Of course, one is not better than the other.  Depends on what you know, what gets you excited, etc.",1298869549
