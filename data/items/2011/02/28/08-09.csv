(Zsh actually has its own filetype, but unfortunately no folding built-in support like the sh filetype) There's gotta be a reasoning behind that. Maybe $() isn't POSIX, but unofficially standard b/c most shells support it?<p>[ Note (IIRC) in vim shell filetypes are like this: sh=(sh, bash, ksh) zsh=(zsh) csh=(csh, tcsh) ]<p><pre><code>  > Either way, those examples aren't actually related to point\n  > #3 in the article.\n</code></pre>\nThey were sort of related in that I was talking about the shell implicitly quoting the contents of the variable. I was just pointing out a different context where (I believe) that it also does something similar.<p><pre><code>  > They fail in zsh, when zsh isn't in ""sh compatibility"" mode,\n  > so perhaps you're using that.\n</code></pre>\nI ran into issues with that a few years ago, and then steered clear of using things in that way. I may well have been using zsh at the time as I was using it for a while before switching to bash, and then back again to zsh (and I didn't keep notes on that timeline).",1298883325

However, that does tend to be the exception. The general perception of performance (at least in the areas of MS that I had contact with when I was working there) is that it's important to hold the line in performance, and it's not generally valuable to invest in actually improving performance over time. MS spends a lot of resources measuring performance very accurately, but not nearly enough resources in making appropriate architecture and design choices, or in making big performance improvement pushes.<p>My experience and observation is that performance improvements of substantial magnitude are often available for the taking in almost all software projects, but it requires a concerted effort to realize those improvements.

What do I owe those bastards who get to live twice\nas long as I am and beat me up and teased me on the playground in\nmiddle school?<p>The more insidious thing about universal healthcare is that it really\nscrews over most minorities. Minorities tend to have diseases that are\nnot as well researched as those found in ethnic majorities (or certain\nminorities which are disproportionately represented in the medical\nresearch community). Moreover, drug testing -for safety and efficacy-\nin minorities is very scant, and it is sometimes the case that adverse\nreactions to drugs occur in minorities that do not occur in the ethnic\nor racial majorities. Of course to find that out you need\nstatistically relevant sample sizes, and the way drug safety testing\nis done is by recruiting on college campuses - you can see the\npotential problem here - and even still some minorities that are\noverrepresented on colleges are, for whatever reason, underrepresented\nin testing pools.  So as a minority, one might be paying into a system\nthat disproportionately treats diseases that one would not be getting,\nor with different pathologies, and for which the treatments may be\ncompletely ineffective or even dangerous due to lack of study.<p>Then there is this problem. What if those who decide health coverage\ndecide that heterozygous genetic condition X is covered (and it's\nexpensive). Two parents who are carriers now can decide, hey we can\nafford to have kids - after all it's their right. So now everyone is\nsaddled with the burden of their selfish choice. Or, we can restrict\ntheir liberty by prohibiting all such pairs of parents from\nreproducing. Whereas if they are responsible for the cost of their\nchildren's care, then the simple answer is they might think twice\nabout having children and if they are foolhardy enough to, there is a\n1 in 4 chance they get dinged with the cost of coverage.<p>Ultimately, any governmental (i.e. non-free-market) health insurance\nplan must either explicitly discriminate between individuals or, if\nuniversal, implicitly discriminate between individuals. The perverted\nconsequence is, ultimately, going to be a transfer of wealth from the\npoor (via inflation) to those who have the right genetic\npredisposition to conditions which are decided to be covered by the\npowers that be.<p>Keep in mind that 'free market' != 'for-profit'. You can have\nnonprofit insurance companies, and healthcare charities, in a 'free\nmarket' system. What free market means is that the consumer has a\nchoice of where to go for their services. If you are saying that you\ndon't like 'free market healthcare' you are saying that in the\naggregate, the population is too stupid to make responsible,\ncost-effective decisions about their own health. If that is the case,\nwho or what group of people could possibly be so enlightened and\nall-knowing to correctly orchestrate all those choices from the full\nsociety on down to the individual level? And how might we shield\nsociety from the hubris of our godlike health chancellor/council?",1298881625
