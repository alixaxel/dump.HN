It's exactly from their use of the iPad, my parent's use of the iPad and my own and my wife's that I make these observations.<p>Re: form factor - I agree that these things are linked - but I'm saying the touch screen is the killer innovation.  Yes, the form factor allows the touch screen to be used comfortably, but people don't really care about the form factor per se.  Lack of a keyboard doesn't enable me to flick photos to browse my photo album, or to pinch to zoom on them, or to draw with my fingers on the screen - the touch screen does.    A device with a slide out keyboard would do that just as well.  It's just that there are significant design challenges in building such a thing so we haven't seen a convincing version of it yet.

The cost of health care is so outrageous the only way to make it bearable on the population is just to give the government a license to print unlimited money in order to pay everyone's health care bills.<p>Insurance (which is a horrible system for health care, since insurance depends on people who buy it not to use it, and all of us need health care, usually multiple times per year) and government programs merely mask the root of all of this, which is that health care is completely and utterly unsustainable at its current rates. Something has to change about the way we administer medicine because nobody can afford it.<p>Everyone outside of the US has seen that people can't afford it and instead of fixing it, they've just said ""the government will pay whatever it costs, don't worry any more, peasants!"" In the US the problem has existed so long because we've covered it with insurance companies, but that system is crumbling as it gets harder for anyone without a job at BigCo to get reasonable care.<p>Our options are to figure out how to make health care cost a reasonable and affordable amount of money or let the government print money to fix it all for all of us (in the short term, ignoring the consequences of printing a bunch of money to keep an unsustainable system alive).<p>The current plan to force everyone in the United States onto an insurance policy with minimal modifications from existing policies is a pretty bad plan imo. The rates will be about the same and I'm sure the insurance companies are going to be thrilled to get tens of millions of new customers to suck dry by legal mandate. The people that will qualify for state subsidized insurance rates are only a handful more than the people that currently qualify for state medical programs like Medicaid anyway.",1298332584

You can rely on the public system for pretty much everything, but only catastrophic medical services are well-funded (and even then ...). Otherwise you will need to get used to waiting in a queue.<p>Private health insurance then allows you to get the frills and to do so without waiting.<p>If you have private cover and need surgery to treat a non life-threatening issue, then you can usually get it done almost immediately. If you don't have private cover, you may be waiting for years.<p>Still, in US terms, our private cover is very cheap. I'm a single, non-smoking, exercising male, 30 years old. I pay about $1200 a year with a $500 gap. But I also pay $20,000 in taxes, a goodly portion of which make their way into the public health system (and far too much of which goes into middle class welfare, but that's by the by).",1298332389

In other words, you can have all the rational features of friendship but probably need to stay away from the emotional side (and definitely the romantic side).<p>There are two reasons for this. Emotional attachment creates decision bias which will eventually interfer with the job function of your boss (and/or your own). Leadership often needs detached objective assessment and you want your boss to have that capability.<p>The second reason has to do with group dynamics. Events play out differently when the boss is in the room (e.g. no venting).

They give you the choice of using their service for free (no revenue for them, no revenue for ad-driven content sites), or paying them a fee for the use of their service (which is strip everything except the content so <i>you</i> don't have to - a value-added service if I ever saw one). This fee gets forwarded to the content author, while they keep a commission for the service they're providing you. You, presumably, see a value in their service, or you wouldn't use it.

They give you the choice of supporting the content and the service, where money is split to support the service you like and the content you like, or just use it without paying anything.

People using the app don't have a choice between subscribing through the app or through the website, seeing as Apple does not allow linking to the website. Obviously, people using the app won't think of going to the browser to subscribe. Hence, even though it seems there's an alternative, toll-free way to subscribe, in practice there isn't. Even though it looks like it's optional, it's not, and content-based apps are going to be especially hit with this toll. The Apple 30% toll - encouraging people to develop for your platform, then putting up flat 30% fees on revenue - now <i>that</i> is extortion.",1298331601

Would you have to take your redis cluster offline to redistribute data from all nodes over the new keyspace?<p>It's not easy, actually. The short answer is that we don't add capacity (because we've only needed to once, and we have tons of room to grow now). The long answer is that I have a switch I can flip that starts incrementing/adding data to a whole new cluster of Redis nodes while it still updates the old ones. We can then backfill all data to the new nodes and when they're setup, flip a switch to read/write only from/to the new nodes. It may sound a bit weird, mostly because it is. Moving sets of random keys from one node to the other <i>while</i> you're expecting live reads/writes is a huge pain, so I just punted on the problem.<p>(I elaborated a little more in a comment on my post: <a href=""http://bretthoerner.com/2011/2/21/redis-at-disqus/#comment-153603719"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bretthoerner.com/2011/2/21/redis-at-disqus/#comment-1...</a>)<p>> wonder if consistent hashing might be a bigger win in the long run.<p>I'm not sure that it's applicable. Consistent caching is really handy for caches when you don't want everything to miss as soon as 1/N servers drop out of the ring. You have to (imo) think of each Redis shard as a ""real"" DB. If your master PostgreSQL instance dies, you don't just start reading from another random instance and returning ""None"" for all of your queries. If a shard goes down, you either depend on an up-to-date read slave or nothing at all. I'm not sure how consistent hashing helps when adding nodes to a ""real"" DB, either. Say Node1 holds all of the data for CNN, you add a new node to the ring and now some % of CNN keys go to that new node. Now all of your writes are updating new/empty keys and all your reads and reading those new/empty keys. How does consistent hashing help with the migration?<p>(I'm really asking, because if I'm missing something I'd <i>love</i> to know.)",1298330472

From Sony's perspective this makes perfect sense and isn't some emotional over reaction, Someone has gotten around their security and if they don't pursue this it will be seen as an open invitation to hackers on all of Sony's platforms. As a platform company and a content company they're doubly incentivised to pursue these sorts of actions in the courts.<p>Even the OtherOS debacle makes sense from their perspective. They make a loss on each console they sell[1] and rely on strong games sales to make up the difference. At launch they had a horrible attach rate (games sold per console sold) and much was made of its use as a cheap computing cloud platform. So removing the ability for new consoles[2] to act as a platform apart from its primary gaming role helps Sony's bottom line.<p>[1] They certainly did at launch not sure if that is the case any longer, historically consoles are sold at a profit once they reach middle age and production costs come down.

And if it did, the deductible would be so high as to make the plan worthless for anything short of a car-crash-emergency-type-situation.</i><p>This fits a fair number of cost complaints I hear over healthcare.  Who wouldn't like to pay $50-100/month to have something better than emergency healthcare support?  But think about the costs of such a system, regardless of inefficiencies / the problems of the current system that make things cost hundreds of thousands:<p>Doctors and nurses and supporting staff must exist.  So must hospitals.  They are highly trained, and will be expensive - <i>period</i>.  They also have to keep learning, so they can't be busy making money all the time.  And they must have such people <i>available</i> all the time, or people die.<p>Given that, and the equipment and check-up and hospital time, how much <i>should</i> a minor surgery cost?  Not in cost to you, in <i>cost</i>.  If the cost to you is mitigated <i>in any way</i>, it's extracted another way (taxes).  I'd have trouble seeing it cost less than a few thousand dollars in the best, highly-used system.  That's a lot of training and a lot of supporting necessities for any random surgery.<p>At $50-100/month, they would have to sap you for nearly a decade to make up a single surgery.  It might even out for the insurance company if that was it - but certainly not when you get older, and not with any kind of routine, preventative care.  Scale that up to emergency situations where major surgery and years of rehab for even 0.1% of the people they're covering - how many hundreds of years does that cost everyone on the plan?<p>Cataclysmic health insurance is cheap <i>because</i> it only covers cataclysms.  Because one in a hundred lives cost an utterly enormous amount more than a single person generates.<p>---<p>None of this is to say that I think the healthcare system is efficient by any means, nor not full of corruption, waste, frivolous lawsuits, or damaging dogma.  Merely that there is simply a bottom limit that the prices that people <i>want</i> to pay will <i>never</i> be able to support, unless all cataclysmic protection is dropped.  And would you rather die from a car crash, or be rehab'd for a couple years and continue your life for another 60 years?  So people choose the cataclysmic protection, and prices jump.<p>---<p>edit: because this seems it will come up often, some evidence for my claim based on Canada's setup, copied from another comment I made below: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Canada"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Canada</a><p>><i>In 2009, the government funded about 70% of Canadians' health care costs.</i><p>><i>Per capita expenditure in 2009: 3,895</i><p>$227 per month, per person, comes from the government, which means it comes from taxes.  And an additional $100 per person is spent per month on average ($324.58 per month).  <i>Far</i> in excess of $50-$100.",1298329224
