You need to be able to calmly watch your portfolio halve in value and sit it out if you're going to be a buy and hold investor (or any investor, really).  I have several friends who took their money out near the bottom of the latest crash and put it it cash or cash equivalents.  It's the absolute wrong choice investment-wise, but it's understandable.<p>Selling before the bottom and buying before the climb is the right thing to do, but if you can do that, you're not spending time reading HN, you're either working hard as a trader or relaxing on your desert island.",1297382388

2204475,comment,2203604,2203799,0,0,slapshot,,,"The equally big flaw is that it focuses on the _average_ employee rather than the _marginal_ employee.  If you want to decide to hire another employee, your concern is not how productive your average employee is.  Your concern is whether the next employee will be a net positive or a net negative.<p>I'll bet that Wal-mart's marginal employee profit is almost exactly $0.  In other words, Wal-mart has hired so many people that there is no benefit to hiring one more, and has been so efficient in getting lean that there is nothing to be gained from firing somebody.  (Of course, that ignores individual performance, but on average.)<p>The same analysis might be true for Goldman.  Even though the average Goldman employee is raking in hundreds of thousands for the company, it's not clear that Goldman would profit an extra $200,000 just by hiring the next average employee.  It's very likely that Goldman has a limited number of opportunities to invest and that the current staff is enough to handle those and no more.",1297382341

And if you're a prescriptivist who prefers original meanings, then use the original (15c) meaning.

2204309,comment,2203604,2203604,0,0,j_baker,,,"I think it's a bit more nuanced than this.  It's like the example given in the Mythical Man Month.  If you want to grow corn, you can pretty much be assured that no matter what you do, you can harvest the corn more quickly if you put more people towards harvesting it.  This is because harvesting corn is a <i>partitionable</i> task (in other words, you can easily divide the work up amongst an arbitrary number of workers).  Of course, productivity per person will go down, but the overall rate at which you're harvesting corn will still grow.<p>Programming isn't easily partitionable.  Programmers need to communicate with each other to do their task.  Thus, adding more people makes you progress faster <i>up to a point</i>.  At a certain point, adding more people starts to slow you down.  Therefore, individual worker productivity will go down more quickly faster than it would for the corn harvesters.<p>Lumping all the different positions from all these different kinds of companies ignores these differences and really makes it difficult to apply the idea in general.  For technology companies in particular, I'd say that the productivity loss can be even <i>higher</i> than 3/2.",1297380126

I'd even say that in the chess challenge, they could kind of cheat, Deep Blue had every 5 piece board configuration in a book and so if it could play to 5 pieces left then it knew how to play from there,  humans have their look up optimized differently.   If this technology can be generally applied, it just seems like a radical tool, radical for medicine, law, and probably revolutionary for other professions where access to information hasn't been as important.<p>That being said,  a really really clever jeopardy playing machine just doesn't seem ""intelligent"" to me.   Huge bounds forward,  we're making progress, I'm not denying that but Watson isn't going to slurp in the works of Shakespeare and write down some original thoughts on it, comparing it to current events.   Or contrast Wordsworth and Keats.   Or suggest a new experiment to further identify envelope proteins on a virus.  Or invent a new way to etch semiconductors even smaller than we currently are.

It does not mean the software is bug free, but that the bugs that it contains are either edge cases that is rare to run across, or they manifest very rarely as real world consequences. I guess that what we call stable is just the state where no obvious bugs arise in normal usage and at the same time is pretty rare for the developers to discover, get notified, and fix, new important bugs.<p>It seems like that under this assumptions node.js is stable enough, but what are you doing with it?

Do a search like [gmail accounts in bulk] to see people trying to spam the Gmail sign-up process. Things like a real-life phone call or phone number/SMS add friction and make it harder for spammers.",1297378939

It could thus potentially work like a multi network MiFi.  Imagine an app that tells you which data signal has the fastest speeds and allows you to switch between networks seamlessly. Perhaps Apple will build it into the OS..?<p>I know that there are broader implications for the market if Apple does release such a device. But it just occurred to me that you could potentially manage multiple pay as you go accounts for data with such a device and always have a data connection. Such a feature could lead to a more ubiquitous mobile web experience for many of us. This I think would be possible in the UK where most places, apart from the remotest areas, allow you to get at least some data signal from one of the five main networks.",1297378894

If I were twitter I would allow other companies to sell their data so that developers have other ways to obtain twitter data.  Having GNIP be the only reseller of twitter data will keep the price too high.  Maybe twitter wants to discourage people from accessing twitter through other platforms thereby forcing people to have to go through #newtwitter. What ever the reasoning, this results in less innovation on the twitter platform.",1297378863

The odds of this being the case is about 0%.<p>I've thought about this problem some, and I think there are a few unacknowledged issues:<p>- Who you <i>will</i> get along with, and are a good match for, is often different from who <i>you think</i> you will get along with. Dorky Dillon, taking from the author's example, doesn't want page after page of plain janes similar to himself - like all humans he wants to date upwards... even though it is against his long-term interests and reduces his ""efficiency"" in the system.<p>- We have solid predictors of <i>long term</i> relationship success. Similar politics? Check. Similar religious views? Check. Suffice it to say, the odds of a hardline Republican and a extreme Democrat working out in the long run is pretty low, but would they enjoy hanging out for 5 minutes? 10? A month? Part of the dating site's job is to find <i>dates</i>, long term relationships build themselves out of that. IMHO there's a big difference between long-term compatibility (that the poor lovebirds will discover for themselves with or without your algorithm's help) and short-term compatibility (e.g. the ability to carry a conversation through dinner that won't put the other side to sleep). We have good predictors for the former, but IMHO not so much for the latter... and the latter is also much harder to infer.<p>So far dating sites - and even the vaunted OkCupid is guilty of this - conflating personality with opinion. Personality is what matters most in the initial stage, but none of the sites are collecting meaningful information on it.<p>I almost feel like matching people based on <i>relationship</i> compatibility (i.e., mid to long term) is the wrong way to go. IMHO it's a far better bet to predict whether or not two people can get through dinner without trying to kill each other... and just send them on a date. If they click, great. If they don't, spin the wheel again. The modern dating website, with its hyper-focus on long-term compatibility seems to be optimizing prematurely.",1297378826
