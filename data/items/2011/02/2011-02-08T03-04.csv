I talked with a friend, and it turned out that a lot of the same friends that show up on my profile when I am looking at it show up for him when he views my profile.<p>As to (a) and (b), the friends that showed up seemed pretty random - I interact regularly with less than half of them. It's definitely not random, but I'm not sure how it's determined. It would be interesting to track it over time (as friendships are added, removed, and changed).",1297137567

I'm currently working for a local (and damn fine) new media firm as the only iOS developer. I started as a development intern over the summer and got hired for the school year on a part time basis.<p>My life plan had basically been to go to school for a comp sci degree and then get a job as a developer, as that's what I really enjoy doing. However, I've recently been having second thoughts on school in general and whether or not I even want to pursue a degree. This, coupled with the fact that I've recently received two separate offers for full time work (one with the firm I'm currently working for, one with a new startup that shows a lot of potential) as a developer straight out of high school, is making it very difficult for me to make a decision.<p>I've been discussing it with my parents, and they've been being very diplomatic about it by saying that I should do whatever will give me the most options in the long run. My friends that I've asked think that I should take one of the jobs that've been presented to me, as this sort of thing doesn't happen to most people in their lifetime, let alone before their high school graduation.<p>I don't really have a specific question, just a call for advice: what would you do in this situation? If you need anymore information, just ask. I'll give what I feel comfortable telling.<p>Thanks for reading.<p>TL;DR: I'm about to graduate from high school and I have two job offers for full time work as a developer.

2191820,comment,2189907,2191761,0,0,bmelton,,,"Given the nature of how the government provisions work to contractors, they almost certainly do.  Not being privvy to the task at hand, they likely had one of the following scenarios at play:<p>1) The Federal Government (hereby, ""Fed"") wanted the data.  Fed puts out a request for proposal to qualified federal contractors to solicit work bids.  Qualified federal contractors respond with work proposals, detailing the level of effort, the likely strategy to obtain the information, and establishing a cost and payment terms.  Cost structure is either Time & Materials (T&M) or firm fixed.  If it's T&M, they'll be paid for the time, effort and overhead required to have performed the task.  If it's firm fixed, they'll be paid a set cost as established in the proposal.<p>2) HBGary had an existing contract for work with Fed.  This contract may cover intelligence gathering, cyber intel, whatever.  Fed creates a new task order for HBGary on the existing contract.  Contract is either amended (if firm fixed, after the effort is quoted) or falls under existing task orders.  HBGary is paid according to the terms of the existing contract.<p>To cut to the chase, there are other likely scenarios, but they all look similar to the above, and all involve HBGary being paid under the terms of the contract.  Whether they're paid a flat fee or based on the effort involved depends on the terms of the contract.  When they get paid depends on the terms of the contract.  How much they get paid depends on the terms of the contract.<p>It sometimes happens that the government opts out of paying for things like this, and someone decides to buck the red-tape-brigade, but those matters usually end up in court as a contract dispute.  Generally speaking, I think it's fairly safe to assume that HBGary is getting paid.<p>What I suspect a lot of people are overlooking here is that generally, if the government has contracted to buy something, EVEN IF somebody completely different comes up with the same good (tangible or intangible) for zero or significantly reduced cost, the government is not allowed to purchase unless there are provisions in their existing contract that allow for this.<p>The rules governing this process are the ""Federal Acquisition Regulations"", are set in stone, and are established so that both sides 'play fair'.  The terms of the contract are always upheld unless there are exceedingly dramatic reasons not to, or failures of performance.  If I contract to buy 10 servers for the government for $1,000 each, and somebody else then offers 10 identical servers to the government for $0 each, I will still be paid.<p>Since the cost of technology generally goes down over time, this prevents Fed from buying cheaper after the original contract was penned, and is allotted to protect contractors from the Fed, as well as the other way 'round.<p>It's complicated as sin, and yeah, there are loopholes out the wazoo (most of which relate to winning work,) but it's also defined, repeatable and ends up in HBGary getting paid.",1297136109

Read about how difficult it is to break the $40,000/year barrier if you have children due to the escalation of taxes and scaling back of tax and other incentives. How is someone with the good luck of having parents who are attorneys or accountants different than a minor noble in 16th century France?<p>My father worked in public housing projects, and I used to go along with him to block parties and sometimes hang out with him at work in the summertime when I was young. I'd play with the kids hanging around who were 8 or 10 years old. You know what? They were all the same as my friends at home -- just kids. I didn't understand then that they were poor and I wasn't. Those same kids a few years later would have a harsher introduction to the world than I would.<p>It's amazing to me that you'd equate my perspective to an infomercial, than proceed to castigate people who dare to have a cheap telephone or complain about their miserable condition because they have water and foodstamps.<p>I'm not a proponent of the welfare state. I drive around my city past the idle factories and dilapidated relics of the prosperity of ages long past and get angry. Then I drive outside the city, away from the ""welfare state"" and past the new prosperity: sprawl shopping centers and subdivisions -- all artifacts of tax policy, loan guarantees and subsidy of infrastructure and get angry. (You probably wouldn't call that ""welfare"" though.)",1297135700

That implementation definitely sounds more useable, and of course, there's a jQuery plugin for it :)<p>2. There's no explicit way to merge groups, because it sounded like more of a hassle than it was worth.  What do you think of avoiding the problem in the first place by suggesting existing groups as the user types in a group name to be created?<p>3. Separate add link button: good point.  changing this.<p>4. Video: lets forget it.  I've never done anything involving video uploading, and once I had a look at what a hassle it is to do, I don't think it's worth it for the amount of our users that will actually use it.<p>5. Step editor.  Yes, also a good point.  CKeditor seems perfect.<p>6. the importance of border-radii: cannot be underestimated. the PDF is supposed to be a bit more than wireframes, but is not intended to be that high-level of a design.<p>7. Captcha vs. email verification.  I did think about this one a bit.  I personally hate email verification more than I hate captchas, but is there some other reason to prefer one over the other?<p>8. ban user is about as useful as video uploads, and is probably not worth the hassle it entails.  lets cut this.<p>9. early on, many of the people who've expressed interest in the site wanted to use it in non-english speaking settings. since there is no ""settings"" page yet (not enough settings to make it worth having one) the languages selector goes on the top menu rather than inside a settings section.  Changing it at the very least changes the language of the UI (assuming this isn't too difficult) but could also change which protocols are shown (this sounds much harder.)
