Moreover, unlike its considered rivals (Facebook, which I don't consider to be a rival although many tech blogs do after Facebook implemented the status feature) is that Twitter only release changes to its users after a lot of consideration and testing which is another reason as to why they won't throw away their value proposition.<p>Additionally, and potentially the most important fact is that Twitter is a place to communicate with people, discover what new in your world and let them know ""what's happening"" hence the ability to do so via SMS. By editting the limit etc, they are alienating a core of their users and a CORE which has been the heart of its growth especially during the Iran Elections etc and by editting the limit and adding meta data to it, users in these regions wouldn't have been able to see the tweets properly because everyone on the planet don't own a smartphone.

And the pernicious thing with this is that, while of course publishers and creators should be renumerated, doing this through scarcity, which is a natural condition in the physical world, does not make sense, as it is not a given in the virtual world, and scarcity should be avoided where possible, right?<p>Markets basically are good because of three things: 1) enabling efficient investments, 2) decentralized decisions, 3) and efficient use.<p>But in the virtual realm, while the first two of these are the same under scarcity, the 3rd is not, as without natural scarcity, efficient use is 3) as much use as possible.<p>Therefore a market-like popularity algorithm (no council of old men deciding what receives money, but popularity / appreciation / number of downloads) + a levy system, or something similar, would make the on-line market work much more in the spirit of the first, physical goods market, rather than according to the letter of that market.<p>And as the importance of virtual goods grows, it becomes more sensible to create a second market for it, so we have two free markets, instead of one.<p>For those interested, I wrote more about this in my (history) thesis:

The markets generally ensure that p*r < 1 long term (for constant market size); however, the values of p and r, and the economies of scale of new technologies have a profound impact on their overall impact on important societal outcomes like inequality.<p>For example, consider a technological advance which has relatively low barriers to entry, such as voice over IP. In this case, r < 1 (people doing VoIP work get paid less, on average, than people at telcos before) but p > 1 (access to telecommunications technology is easier, so more people do it, even at fixed same market size). This creates more jobs and reduces income inequality.<p>However, in other cases, new technologies have higher barriers to entry than the existing manual option, p < 1, r < 1; medical equipment that is prohibitively expensive to manufacture and operate except for big players; small clinics close down and a few mega-clinics open up; while production is more efficient overall, the market is less efficient, and profits are higher for the few that remain in business. There are less jobs and more inequality.<p>The best possible outcome is when technology that makes jobs obsolete is low-cost and accessible to everyone; jobs are lost, but people don't need to work as much to make ends meet.<p>The worst is where new technology creates economies of scale that mean few big companies control major production but don't need many workers, but still charge only marginally less than the more labour intensive alternative; jobs are lost but prices don't go down by much. The only solution to maintain income equality is government taxation of those big companies combined with government public good expenditure (e.g. hiring the people who lost their jobs to do research).",1297931726

You're definitely right about the industrial revolution, and I hope you're right about the information revolution.<p>However, I think there's a real possibility that, in the near future, automation will lead to a permanent increase in unemployment. Even if general AI proves to be a long way away (which I think it is), a lot of service jobs are algorithmic enough that they could became automated in the next few decades. If true, you end up with a small elite business/management class which finds themselves far wealthier than before; a few people who managed to hold onto their old jobs (domestic cleaners, plumbers, etc) or find new 'creative' jobs; and a vast unemployed underclass.<p>In theory with all our new machine-created wealth the entire underclass could live very comfortably on welfare. However, the way most societies are set up, that's unlikely to happen. The economic pie gets bigger but the people at the top suddenly find themselves with even more power and get an even bigger slice, and the people at the bottom get screwed.<p>I think this guy makes a fairly convincing argument: <a href=""http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm</a><p>If you have the time, his scifi novella about the social impacts of mass job loss due to automation is also OK (like a lot of amateur scifi, some of the writing and characterisation is pretty bad, but the ideas are interesting).

I'm actually quite happy with the deal I got all in all, and in any case, I wasn't at the table when the terms were set.  I'm simply pointing out that it's extremely naive to think that focusing on creating long-term value for customers cures all ills.<p>In fact, we are in a period in business history where companies that have achieved cash-flow positive with good growth and a sizable revenue stream are at a loss as to how to free up cash for continued growth (and to reward early investors and employees).  IPO'ing brings huge overhead with Sarbox, not to mention the requirement to manage the business to quarterly goals.  Continued venture funding is usually quite a bad deal, loans are still really hard to get, and more creative options (like FB's private placement) are under lots of scrutiny from the SEC.<p>That leaves a buyout or private sale as the two best options, neither of which is an efficient transaction (ie unlikely to bring the highest value), and both of which are likely to come with some unattractive terms.<p>As an entrepreneur, don't underestimate the importance of this question: once you create a valuable business, how will you transform the equity that you've created for yourself, your employees and your backers into cash?",1297930994

What Ortega y Gasset argues, and what is still true today, is the true threat to our livelihood comes not from those working to change our society but from those who deny its imperfections, who see acts of self-improvement as admissions of weakness, and who define the correct view to be equivalent to the view of the majority.",1297930879

2230251,comment,2229833,2229833,0,0,microarchitect,,,"The paper (unfortunately behind the ACM paywall) makes for very interesting reading.<p>There are a couple of points in the paper that aren't mentioned in the article.<p>The first one is the the difference between low and high NFC (need for cognition) individuals. The paper defines NFC as follows: A person with a high NFC loves to seek, reflect on and reason about information, whereas someone on the other end of the continuum only thinks as hard as (s)he has to and is inclined to rely on others. Their results show that low NFC folks actually took longer to complete the internalized version of the task while the high NFC folks took longer to do the externalized version. This reaffirms Haldar's point, but with a caveat - his conclusions are applicable only to ""power users"".<p>The other interesting thing was that both low and high NFC individuals got started on the task much faster (the paper calls it time to first move) with the externalized version. Presumably, all the individuals were told they _had_ to complete the task while in the ""real world"" many might have just given up. If you're designing an application, this is a useful lesson, getting started should be easy (i.e., an externalized interface). I guess this is also traditional wisdom, but it's nice to see this confirmed by peer-reviewed research.",1297929610
