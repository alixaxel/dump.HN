They all end up building the bit Jamie proposes (easily sharable group calendars with email/IM/website integration), but _nobody_ ever implements the ""Managers"" half of what Exchange does, because nobody writing open source software has that itch to scratch.<p>It's not 100% cast iron guaranteed, but the observation that ""enterprise software"" gets written by people on salaries in cubicles, and ""open source software"" gets written by people who don't have to wear suits to work - is so overwhelmingly often correct that we can use any of the very few counterexamples as ""the exceptions that prove the rule"".<p>Note too, that ""founding teams"" are not ""typical open source developers"", I think a small startup with a great plan and some enthusiastic early-adopter corporate customers is most probably who'll take down the MS Exchange market monopoly...

2261083,comment,2260863,2260950,0,0,alextgordon,,,"My 4am thoughts on the matter...<p>If a site has N copies associated with it, then you could compare that to the average number of copies associated with sites of that pagerank. If the difference between N and the average is high, then that's a likely spam site. Let's call this difference σ.<p>This gives us a problem though, because while σ is a good indicator of spamminess, it's not foolproof. A low pagerank site could have been copied from lots of times, which would unfairly earn it a high σ.<p>What we can do is calculate a σ', by inversely weighing each copy with the σ of the site on the other end. A copy of a site with a low sigma will increase σ', and a copy of a site with a high sigma will have less of an effect on σ'.<p>So while our high σ may have initially suggested the site to be spammy, all its copies are from high σ sites, which are counted less towards σ', leading to an overall verdict of <i>not spammy</i>. [I wonder what would happen if you iterated this process]<p>As for your example, the smaller site wouldn't be penalized, because N would be low. If it were say, a full wikipedia mirror, then it would be penalized. Wikipedia would not be penalized, since it has an ungodly amount of pagerank. There's also no bias against smaller sites, since σ is calculated relative to pagerank.<p>What have I missed?",1298608467

Since I know the airbnb folks hang out here, I will elaborate:  We tried to book a room and found that the slow response time from our candidate people made it impossible to fix up a place in short enough notice.<p>However, there was something in this process which might have alienated the spouse from airbnb forever (much, much more than the convenience/ time lag factor):  We exchanged emails with the airbnb people, who were quite helpful, and in one of them said something like ""the owner pulled back from the agreement at the last minute because he lost power from a snowstorm, which is quite reasonable."" Or something to that effect.  A couple of weeks later, the owner emailed us, basically screaming ""why did you post such nasty things about me?""  Turns out someone from airbnb had put ""the owner pulled back from the agreement at the last minute"" onto the owners feedback page, with neither our permission nor any context (like, the power went out because of the snowstorm).
