It's not an application in itself, so it can't check for updates with the consistency that a browser can, and when it does run it's always to immediately execute whatever flash content was requested, so there's less leeway for it to start updating itself in the background and potentially impact performance.  Currently it pops up a window on startup every once in a while (I skipped it the first time and it didn't bug me again for maybe 2 weeks) and its maybe 2 clicks and 20 seconds of downloading. It's not Chrome-level seamless, but it's pretty damn good and I was surprised by how good it was compared to Acrobat and every other updater I've used in the past.",1298674733

But it looks like the guy has just a very thin skin.<p>I'm an iPhone developer who signed up with the program as soon as it became available and I can tell you: Becoming an iPhone developer was a major PITA. It started with the registration (Apple let you wait for weeks after you purchased the membership), then with taxes formalities (as a non us-citizen I had to call the I.R.S. and get a w8-ben number ... mix a polish name with a german address and an overseas phone call and you get a really fun time). Oh, and I had to print out all my contracts, sign them and send them via snail mail to some Apple subsidiary in Texas.<p>And then the fun just started - I spent days getting all the provisioning profile stuff working (only to get my app to run on my device). Uploading the finished app to the store was another story (there was no build & archive & submit 3 click way - you had to build the distribution package yourself).<p>Considering RIM has just started their developer program for their playbook I'd say that the blog post is exaggerated.

Its cheap and easy. Just consider it part of the cost of domain registry.<p>This is helpful in two ways. First, it will prevent you from accidentally registering a domain that is too close to someone else's trademark (and losing your domain later in a nasty surprise kind of way). Second, it will give you a nearly bullet-proof automatic way to file a complaint with ICANN that will almost always result in you being given the offending domain.<p>In any case, head on over to <a href=""http://www.icann.org/en/udrp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icann.org/en/udrp</a> to see what your options are. Just filing the complaint may be enough to cause your shadow to move on to less proactive victims.",1298673718

So for the sake of argument let's just call it even, except we're spending several times as much.  (we actually spend more gov't money on healthcare per capita than many companies with socialized medicine, in addition to private sector spending -- that's how broken our system is).<p>B)  Regarding doctors wages, I'm not really talking about ""poorer"" countries unless you'd call western europe, canada, japan ""poorer"".  If they make significantly less in those countries than here..  sure, fine.  Given that we don't offer cheap schooling like those countries there might be a limit to how low we can go, though.<p>C)  Top 5% of income != doctors, necessarily.  And the money we're wasting, a <i>tiny</i> percentage of that is going into doctors' pockets.  Most of it is just plain pissed away, and a lot goes to insurance company profits.

Except for the pain of losing your father -- which I have been lucky enough to avoid, and I am so sorry for your loss -- I have felt all of what you're feeling.<p>Mostly, I've felt it because I've (been lucky enough to and / or made it a point to) work with really talented programmers, people who were better than me.  That is great for learning and very hard on the ego.  Look at the people you're working with and ask yourself if they are ALL super geniuses, or if maybe some of them are simply more experienced and / or had the luxury of being able to focus more on their studies while at school instead of having to work and deal with the grief of losing a parent.<p>As to feeling like you're slow to debug and problem solve and whatever...don't.  If you have the brains and the persistence to have made it this far as a programmer, it's very unlikely that you're actually dumb.  What you ARE, self-admittedly, is inexperienced and under-educated.  It is experience, not brilliance, that makes people fast at debugging: when you've seen similar problems before, when you have an array of exploratory / testing techniques that have worked for you in the past, then you too will be fast and all the younger programmers will look up at you and go ""damn, I wish I could be as inventive as that guy.""<p>Here's my best advice for you right now:  stop focusing on learning for a while and focus on having fun.  If you find that you enjoy programming, everything else will start to come easily.  Here are some specifics on how to implement that:<p>1) Start a notes file where you jot down anything that seems interesting.<p>2) Follow your instincts; whatever you stumble on that seems interesting, do a bit of googling and read up on it.<p>3) Reading is good, but coding is God.  If you don't write actual working code for something, don't imagine that you have learned it.<p>4) Don't push.  Whenever you get bored or frustrated with something, put it down for a while.  Go read about something else in your notes file.  Or watch TV.  Or take a walk.  Or whatever you feel like doing at that moment.  Give yourself permission to not be perfect; you'll find it amazingly liberating.<p>5) Take care of your body.  This one sounds silly, but it makes a huge difference.  Sleep enough and eat right.  Tired programmers are stupid programmers and anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.  The myths of super-productive 40-hour coding runs powered by Jolt and Cheetos are just that -- myths.<p>6) Definitely find a project, and do it in a new language.  Choose a dynamic language for now; you can go back and learn the C/C++ memory management stuff later.  Ruby or Python would be good choices, as they are highly employable languages that are used in both enterprise and startups.  node.js would be another good choice, but is not yet as employable.  If you want a suggestion for a project:  pick a website that you like (ideally one with a public API) and write something that pulls down data from that site and stores it to a database.",1298671756

You enter a budget range much like you do and it shows you the options. Then, you could see any pictures your friends took on such trips. And with a FB message/email, you can ask them how much they spent, where they stayed, what places they loved, how the food was, etc.<p>Okay, who has built this?",1298671248
