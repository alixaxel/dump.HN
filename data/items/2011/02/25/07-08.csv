NVIDIA GPU Tesla have 512 SIMD cores organized into 16 SM (""streaming multiprocessors"") with 2 independent instructions (from 2 different threads) issued per SM per clock (each instruction goes to its' half of the SM, ie. to 16 cores wide SIMD group):<p><a href=""http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/fermi_white_papers/NVIDIA_Fermi_Compute_Architecture_Whitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/fermi_white_papers/NVIDIA_...</a><p>That gives us \n[16 SM x 2 instructions  x [1-16 cores]] - anywhere between 32  to 512 ops / clock - 1000 GFlops in the best case.<p>The Itanic - 8 cores x 6 independent instructions -  something like 200GFlops.",1298620719

For any reasonable place to live in SF - your going to be between 1800 and 2500 for a two bedroom.<p>Thats not ""a small portion of your income""<p>Additionally - you may have health care costs of as much as 750 per month if you have a spouse and child on your plan.<p>Figure as much as 400 to 600 per month for a car. 100 for cable, 150 for an unlimited family cell plan. School costs for your kid, and god-forbid you. like me, have child support to an ex.<p>So:<p>6000 Income<p>750 insurance<p>2000 rent<p>100 internet/tv<p>150 cell<p>100 power<p>1000 kids school/child support<p>250 other debts<p>600 car+insurance<p>== 4950<p>That leaves 1050 for the remainder of the month. Which is ~260 each week for expenses such as food, gas, savings, a beer with friends, date night, a bottle of wine etc...<p>100k is literally the bare min in SF to live moderately comfortable.<p>Now assuming you didn't have the school/child support, you can replace that with savings, which is great. but for a lot of people it is a 1K expense not savings.<p>Additionally - this doesn't account for a lot of other potential monthly expenses that are common.",1298620668

2261436,comment,2261312,2261312,0,0,fleitz,,,"From the article:<p><pre><code>  ""Instead, he believes that Anonymous has ""decided to continue their antics. They're in it for the laughs… this is a real funny game for them."" Not content with the damage they have inflicted, they ""harass a company that's trying to get back to work."" Each time a new story about the company appears in the press, Butterworth said that these attacks spike again.""\n</code></pre>\nIf the press is bad for HBGary why do they participate in it? A no comment would have been sufficient. I think HB Gary is participating in the press to incite attacks so they can present themselves as victims, collect evidence, have someone charged, and declare victory. Seriously, a sheet of paper written in sharpie. They're expecting me to believe that the RSA holds a security conference with out badges, with out video monitoring and that some anon in a Guy Fawkes mask walks up to the table and places a threatening did it for the LULZ paper on their booth with no one noticing. Maybe, V for Vendetta is a real movie and such a person really exists who can easily pass through intelligence services and evade video monitoring. If I was HB Gary I'd have extensive surveillance on the booth to catch just such a thing. I'll use the Aaron Barr method of finding anons and assume the anon who placed the paper is employed by HB Gary. This from a company whose services are retained for their ability to plant false documents. The sign should read 'We got laughed out of the security conference for using weak passwords, storing them weakly, and reusing passwords in addition to being vulnerable to basic SQL injection.'<p>In my opinion, officers of HBGary Federal were engaged in stalking people online and selling private information about individuals for commercial purposes, as well as engaged in defaming these individuals with false information to the FBI. Given the demographic of anonymous it's quite likely that some of these individuals were children. I'm not sure if this is illegal in the US, but if they collected and prepared to sell personal information without consent about Canadian citizens they'd likely be in violation of Federal Law. (PIPEDA)<p>Also, regarding the millions of dollars in damages, these claims would be impossible to verify with a private company. Public companies on the other hand are required to file damages to the company both tangible and intangible. In a lot of hacking cases you'll see millions of dollars claimed, but if you look at the 10-Qs (SEC Required docs) you'll see no such filing. If you want a case to look at in particular for this, look at what happened to Kevin Mitnick. Why is it ok for HBGary to take money to compromise computers, but when Anonymous engaged in expression of speech they are targetted by federal investigators?<p>This is a company that used intelligence assets against pro-union websites. My personal feelings regarding unions aside, this is attempting to violate the rights of individuals to peaceably assemble. Even if it isn't illegal per se, it's highly unethical.<p>If HB Gary only engaged in ethical business practices there would be little damage from the disclosure of the emails. The damage results from the conspiracy to commit activities that are likely criminal.<p>A better question to ask is given the emails why Federal charges have not been laid against HBGary?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act</a>",1298620595

2261407,story,,,6,12,blackhole,"Ask HN: Why Am I In College?",,"I have been rejected twice from the Computer Science department at my college, which severely restricts the CSE courses I am allowed to take. I skip most of my classes, instead teaching myself everything out of the textbook, only attending class to turn in homework or take tests. With this state of affairs, I find myself wondering why I even bother to go to college when I'm working on a startup and only attend college to learn more about programming. Could college doom my startup to stagnation? Could it retard the startup's progress so long that by the time my product is released its already irrelevant? I've talked to several people about this, and there are 3 main arguments for staying in college:<p>1. Networking. The people I could meet in college are too important, even if I can't get into the CSE department itself.<p>Counter-argument: This only works if there isn't a better way to network with like-minded people.<p>2. Ensuring I don't miss out on important concepts. By taking CSE courses, I ensure i'm on an equal educational standing with everyone else and that I didn't miss any important concepts that I wouldn't have picked up during self-study.<p>Counter-argument: You can't possibly know everything and trying to write a perfect program gets you nowhere, so self-study would be far less time-consuming but just as effective, and I know that I am already very good at my chosen area of expertise.<p>3. It's a safety net. Unnecessary risk is stupid, and most startups fail miserably. The time spent at college is worth spending to ensure I don't get thrown on to the street.<p>Counter-argument: The time spent during college could doom the startup before it even finishes its product. Alternatively, if the startup did fail, my situation wouldn't make it unreasonable to go right back to college and find intermittent work to support myself.<p>I may be confidant in my ability to craft a product that can support me, but I'm sure everyone whose startups fail miserably is too. What concerns me is that, of the two internships I had, all I learned was that I absolutely detest having a normal job. If my startup fails, I'd just try another one, and then another one. I probably would never even apply for a job that required a college degree, so if I'm not going to use the scrap of paper they give me at the end, and i'm teaching myself everything out of a textbook anyway, am I wasting my time and putting my startup in danger, or would dropping out be a stupid thing to do?<p>For reference, the startup is not web-based - it involves games. I have 2.5 years of college to go and live with my parents somewhere on the west coast of the United States.",1298619705

""Segregating knowledge"" in your brain is nonsense.  If you do that you're already crippling yourself as a developer.  Ultimately your best protection is to simply not get involved with incompetent and clueless people, and always do good and ethical work.  That's not too hard if you are a talented engineer in silicon valley, but probably easier said than done for the average code monkey in a cubicle farm.
