Low resolution copies (for sharing) will be stored on your CloudFront distribution.<p>--------<p>The details<p>The state of photo sharing is absolutely horrible. Most people upload photos to Facebook and I won't even go into the 1001 reasons why their photo service is abysmal. Some use Picassa or Flickr, while better than Facebook they still control the destiny of your photos. Flickr's got APIs - so that's a start but it's not trivial to get all your photos and their meta data (comments, tags, etc).<p>What I'm envisioning is a frontend for YOUR photo collection that resides in an Amazon S3 bucket you own. A good interface to upload photos, share them, and control privacy. The whole point of this is to be open and let you retain ownership of your photos.<p>Lots of potential features on the roadmap but what I described is phase I.<p>My guess is the cost would be in the $1-2 / month range + any S3 costs you'd incur yourself.

You could then extend it to work on any language you wanted.<p>Biggest thing I couldn't get right was automatically connecting frequency of errors to particular lines or modules.  I found that I made the same mistakes over and over, and I had to just spot them and jot down what not to do or think of a ninja way to avoid it.  I also found that there was a strong correlation between syntax/test failures while writing code and how bad the code was.<p>What would have helped is if I could calculate the stats per function, line, or file and then have some pattern analysis spit out common grammatical structures that I do which are correlated with errors.  It'd be something like:<p>function/while/if/return 24% chance of defect found in blah.c:func1 and blah.c:func2<p>Then it'd get closer to predicting defects and letting me go check the spots it recommends.<p>But, never got around to it since it became really insane after a year already without that level of analysis.",1296955416
