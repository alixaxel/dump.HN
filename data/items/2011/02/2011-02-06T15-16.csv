We can't even ask them without influencing them.<p>Therefore we have to make a decision that seems best for them, even considering our cultural bias and imperfect view of their society. I can even say that we will make a decision for them, maybe just wrapping it into some feel-good distractions.

It's more subtle influence, but influence nonetheless.<p>I'm not really saying that change is inherently good, that's a view that can be easily disproved by samples from our own culture.

Suppose we are give a triangle ABC with sides a, b, c, that is, side a is opposite angle A, etc.  Then from some simple trigonometry, we know the law of cosines that<p>c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C)<p>Then if C is a right angle, cos(C) = 0 and we have the Pythagorean theorem<p>c^2 = a^2 + b^2<p>So, given the triangle we have the law of cosines.  If in addition we know that angle C is a right angle, then we have the Pythagorean theorem.<p>Well, to conclude the Pythagorean theorem, it is just crucial to have a suitable assumption, say, angle C is a right angle.  Else the Pythagorean theorem does not hold.<p>We know these things.<p>'Machine learning' is a four letter word -- junk.  Here is why:  They have a 'paradigm':  Get an 'algorithm' from somewhere, put it a black box, and say ""Try this!"".  By analogy, this is mixing up snake oil instead of good chemistry.<p>The big, huge problem is that, with their nonsense paradigm, there is no good reason to believe that the black box has any value.  By analogy, they take the Pythagorean theorem and apply it to all triangles ignoring if there is a right angle or not.<p>There is a rational sickness ubiquitous in 'computer science':  Take results from mathematics and with great determination ignore the assumptions.  Machine learning is one of the sickest.<p>Bluntly put, done with any rational care, machine learning is a topic in applied math, but the workers in the field know far too little math, make gross mistakes at nearly every chance, and, in particular, ignore the mathematical assumptions and, thus, proceed with no rational support.<p>Computing was not always this way:  The origins of electronic digital computing were in scientific calculations in WWII.  D. Knuth's books on 'The Art of Computer Programming' are fairly careful mathematically.<p>At the time of the first editions of Knuth's books, hot topics were 'algorithms', especially for sorting and searching.  So, there it was fairly clear what such an algorithm was to do.<p>Then the definition of an 'algorithm' grew to include just any piece of code that ran and, hopefully, usually stopped, and what properties the results had were not emphasized.  So, we have gone some years with a programmer announcing that they have an algorithm to tell people, say, what they should eat for breakfast.  They call a venture partner who says, ""So, you have an algorithm."".  Gee, anyone can have an algorithm for anything; the question is, what properties does the algorithm have?  As long as computing wants to ignore the properties and the assumptions, they will have a tough time doing better than snake oil.<p>Part of this very relaxed attitude toward algorithms came from early work in 'artificial intelligence' (AI) where the criteria were:<p>""Do you have running code?  Does the code produce something that at first glance looks like something a human might do?"".<p>Then these criteria opened the doors wide to just any intuitive, heuristic, or black box techniques.  In particular, now can call nearly anything 'machine learning'.<p>Actually just guessing, as from intuitive and heuristic efforts, is a tough way to find something powerful for a challenging problem.  Instead, starting with some assumptions and doing some derivations is much more powerful, e.g., as for the law of cosines and the Pythagorean theorem.<p>The problem for AI, machine learning, etc. in computer science proceeding mathematically is that the corresponding math is often a bit advanced, and the profs didn't take the right courses in grad school and don't know the math.<p>Actually, for 'learning', there is a lot that is quite solid in parts of mathematical statistics.  There the math is done with good care, is basically correct; and someone with a better math background than many of the statistics profs can make the math rock solid.  There is more for 'learning' in optimization, control theory, and stochastic optimal control.<p>So, much of AI and machine learning is a C- student's rip off of some Cliffs Notes summary of mathematical statistics applied ignoring the assumptions.  Bummer.<p>All that said, if you want to see AI approach <i>the singularity</i> where there is something like actual intelligence, then it does appear that you will need some very new approaches and ideas.  Even done very well, not all of this work will be solid mathematics.<p>In the meanwhile, broadly the <i>good stuff</i> is in selected topics in mathematics.  I suggest you emphasize linear algebra, mathematical analysis, and optimization and then relatively advanced approaches to probability, stochastic processes, and mathematical statistics.",1297006743

It also betrays the underlying assumption that men and women are two completely different species that live in completely separate worlds. Throughout the article that assumption is never challenged.<p>> <i>The male brain has the enviable ability to essentially switch off emotions when desired — in part because it’s hard for a man to think clearly in the face of emotion.</i><p>Big news: everybody does that, no matter what gender they are. It's called compartmentalization, without it people would not be able to function. Emotional reactions and analysis are pushed off to a future point in time whenever more pressing concerns are at hand. That's a basic mental triage technique and everybody can do it. There are also many people who _never_ do it, and in my experience there was no significant gender difference to that behavior.<p>> <i>When men see a worker taking criticism personally, seeming to push too hard for his or her ideas, or having a  personality conflict, they automatically view that worker as less business-savvy and less experienced, or as someone who operates on emotion, not logic.</i><p>Paragraphs like this make excellent statements for people who like evolutionary psychology, but they're simply not rooted in fact. In my experience, most ""Type A"" personalities who do like to dish out harsh personal criticism like it's a bodily function simply cannot take the same when it is directed at them. Likewise, the perception of business-savvyness is probably always linked to the perception of sameness: successful businesspeople attribute superior skills to people whom they perceive as similar to their own personality. And again, I observed no significant difference between sexes here. Regarding the unspoken assumption of public displays of male toughness: I've seen tough jock-types sitting under their desks crying just because someone had looked at them funny.<p>> <i>The science is clear, for example, that although the female brain isn’t designed to compartmentalize personal feelings the same way a man’s brain does, a woman can — if she chooses — force a calm demeanor when she is starting to feel defensive.</i><p>That's a lie.

So long as you're only aggregating stuff that was already public anyway (e.g., public tweet streams), you're not adding additional risk in any obvious way.<p>But on the other hand, to the extent that you're going beyond aggregating and curating public data, you are adding risk.  And on both your web site and in other public discussions, you seem to acknowledge that there's something there to talk about (why <i>have</i> a security page otherwise?), but there's been a continual marked reluctance to get into specifics about even the nature of what data you're collecting, let alone how you're managing it.<p>What's more worrisome, this all comes after the assertion that even though the ""user functionality"" code is slipshod, you're still confident that ""anything to do with security is not compromised.""  Security doesn't work like that.  If you're unfortunate enough to have a buffer overflow on the machine running your stuff, it's compromised.  Even if that's only in the ""user functionality"" code.  Even if it isn't your code at all, but some other service that you weren't using, but forgot to turn off or firewall away.<p>You might also want to try a bit harder to see things from the point of view of your critics.  One of the things they're thinking about is the Haystack anti-censorship project, which attracted enormous hype in the technical and mainstream press, but collapsed after a much-delayed security audit found the code badly wanting.
