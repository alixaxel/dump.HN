However, after working in this environment for a while, I made a decision to switch to Windows (windows XP initially, now 7) for the entire organization. using OSX was just untenable for our business practices and environment.<p>Kept the hardware though, and still buy Apple hardware as replacement, it just doesn't run OSX, which is sacrilegious in some circles.",1297738745

If they don't have strength in software, can they really execute innovation, differentiation, and shareholder value at the software level?

2219931,comment,2218470,2218765,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"My point is that in Python land it is silly to call u"""" strings, ""Unicode"" strings. Unicode strings are strings in UTF-8/16/32 and a bunch of lesser-used encodings. For that matter """" could be used as a Unicode string as long as it's only ASCII. What the docs should be talking about is ASCII vs UTF-16, not ASCII/Latin-1 vs Unicode. This starts making a difference when questions like ""How much memory is consumed by this string?"" or ""What characters can I not store in Python?"" are asked. In this light, Python 3 makes a big improvement: it has immutable byte arrays and it has encoded strings.",1297738702

Some desire to be different?<p>I ask this because I am a fan of Python and Clojure. I got into both as a result of reading pg's essays on Python and Lisp many years ago. Both languages were sold to me not as an act of rebellion but as more-powerful, higher-level languages that could get the job done more quickly. I quickly found this to be the case, compared to Java which I was used to. Nowadays, I grimace when I have to use Java or C and find myself missing a language feature from Python or Clojure that could have saved me an awful lot of typing and repeating myself.<p>So, in my experience, was the choice of esoteric languages born of a desire to be different? No. Does it make me out as being an amazing programmer? Sadly no, not necessarily.

Besides the idea that push to talk is a horrible idea, my job was to work with Nokia to make sure the software worked properly.  We had some lower level software from our hardware provider (Kodiak Networks) and some UI code that we had built ourselves.<p>As these projects tend to go, things didn't go well.  due to various issues in the Nokia closed source software layer there were a number of bugs we (Orange & Kodiak) couldn't fix.

Not once - Nokia never paired us with a serious developer who could even attempt to fix issues in their code.  They surrounded us with product manager wankers and threw in a 22 year old engineer who wasn't able to make much progress debugging the problem.  The Kodiak engineer was all ready to attack the problem with a dev board and a JTAG but no one would let us in the lab.  What a clusterf<i>ck.  Apparently a good bit of the S60 development wasn't even done in Tampere (or Finland).  I think it might have been done in Japan.

By the time Nokia launches MeeGo and handsets, Android, iOS, and others (WP7, RIM, Palm) will be further entrenched in the market (e.g., market share, brand, hardware partners). Second, there is the fundamental issue that succeeding with MeeGo hinges not only on the OS but also on a thriving application market. Because of the application markets, there are strong network effects with mobile platforms. These network effects make it very difficult for a new platform to break into the space.<p>To complement investments in MeeGo and WP7 for the smartphone market and Symbian for the feature phone market, Nokia should immediately invest in an Android strategy as a fail-safe. I understand this conflicts with Nokia's historical strategy of controlling both software and hardware, but it's quite possible that Android will eventually emerge as the winner-take-all platform in smartphones, aside from Apple/iOS and several niche platforms. If this were to happen, Nokia's singular bet on MeeGo (or WP7) may destabilize the entire company.<p>In short, I propose that Nokia pursue a four-pronged strategy, pushing forward with MeeGo, WP7, Symbian, and Android -- Symbian for feature phones, which still account for roughly 80% of the worldwide mobile phone market, and MeeGo, WP7, and Android for the smartphone market. As uncertainty is reduced over time regarding 1) the potential of each of the smartphone platforms and 2) the pace at which geographic markets are shifting away from feature phones to smartphones, Nokia can appropriately adjust its investments. By making investments in each area, and adjusting the relative amounts over time, Nokia can better ensure its survival and prosperity despite the quickly evolving mobile phone market.",1297735288
