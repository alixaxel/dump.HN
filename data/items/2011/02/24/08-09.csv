What do I do?",,"i just closed a $100K round at a very nice valuation from individual angels within my network along with some from friends and family.  The thing is, it's pre-product (the investors know that) and I have a very technical team but none of them who I would consider to be my co-founders just because of their inability (due to school and work) to dedicate their time into the company as much as I do - thus, I have a huge majority of the company shares.<p>I'll be the first to admit that there are many more talented developers than me and because of that, I want to put my efforts into what I'm good at which is on the business side.  However, I really seek a technical co-founder who believes in the product more than wanting to take a paycheck.\nWith the money that we have, I thought it'd be easy to recruit talented developers who would rather take more equity/less cash than ones who want more cash than equity.  However, it is not easier - it's definitely harder.<p>I know I took my startup in a weird process.  It's usually find a team, make a product, put it to market, raise money - but for me it was half-ass find a team (although very talented), raise money, make a product, put it to market.  Now it's biting me in the ass.<p>So HN, what should I do to find a talented technical co-founder who will take the CTO position and lead the rest of my teammates?  What else do you suggest that I do?",1298537793

Having 3 levels of UI complexity does not provide any useful advantage in ergonomics or ease-of-use. Get any consumer-level SLR, put the mode dial in the green all-auto setting, and off you go. For someone who wants to have fine control over the camera, having dedicated buttons and dials is way better than the proposed interface (see Canon's G9, G10, etc, and their Nikon counterparts for good non-SLR examples). Conversely, there are plenty of point-and-shoot digicams that cater to the people who just want to take snapshots.

2257366,comment,2257327,2257362,0,0,kitsune_,,,"It's not, I guess, since the comment is available from here:<p><a href=""http://blog.liip.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.liip.ch/</a><p>""I often get asked by potential employees and clients, why we do PHP and mostly PHP only. A valid question, of course and my first answer usually is (besides the ""historical reasons"" one), that nowadays all those server side (scripting) languages are mainly the glue layer between the front-end (the browser part) and the back-end (your storage and ""database"" solution) and not the one and only defining factor if your project will be a success. Or not.<p>Python, Ruby, PHP, they all have their merits and disadvantages, but could all do the job equally well for our daily business. The important deciding factors happen in other areas nowadays.<p>But, why don't we use a ""cooler"" and ""cleaner"" language then, if it doesn't matter?<p>For one, as said, historical reasons. We invested a lot in PHP, our whole company has deep knowledge in PHP, we know what PHP can do and what it can't. We attend a lot of conferences, know people who can help and we can even influence where PHP is heading to (to some extend, of course). And if there's something missing or broken, we can try to fix it ourselves.<p>Then all our code is of course in PHP and reuse is highly important to us. There's still code from the early Flux CMS days in some of our latest projects. Not because we're too lazy to re-factor our code (we do that all the time), but just because it works, is tested and proven to work. We can profit from the work we did years ago and don't have to start from scratch.<p>""But PHP isn't very innovative lately"" you may say. While that's true somehow for PHP itself and there is certainly some lack of roadmap and governance there, it's certainly not true what's currently happening in the so called ""next generation framework"" space. With Symfony 2, Flow 3, Lithium and certainly many others, there's a lot of innovation going on. I'm sure those will change the way we write well developed PHP projects. The people in those projects also talk together and try to make reusing components between them easier. No more ""this is my framework island"" stories. We live in a very exciting time here.<p>So while you may think that PHP is stalling, it maybe just matured enough to enable such great projects as mentioned above. Innovation in the PHP as a language space isn't badly needed anymore, the magic happens in the frameworks on top of it (ruby and rails have the same relationship, I guess).<p>But nevertheless, PHP isn't doing a full stop. PHP 5.3 brought namespaces and closures. PHP/Next (whatever the version number will be) will for example bring traits and even more speed and memory improvements. Stuff the frameworks can really make use of.<p>One last thing for us, why we stick to one language only, is that it was our strategic decision to concentrate us on as few technologies as possible, but to be as good as possible in them. Of course, we still constantly reevaluate new technologies and introduce them when they fit (we even have a written process for that, called ""techmatrix"" :))<p>This is for example why we use only Symfony 2 for all our new projects. You need very good reasons for using another framework. And as Symfony 2 has a similar mindset as our own ""old"" framework Okapi, the switch isn't too difficult (and we can reuse code). I ported liip.to from Okapi to Symfony 2 in a few hours (without knowing Symfony 2 very well) and could reuse lots of code.<p>Yes, PHP is just the glue between the front and the back (Jackalope is one prime example for that), but a very good one at that and I'm sure we will be very happy with PHP for the foreseeable future. With all what's going on in PHP-userland (compared to the PHP core), we currently live in a very exciting time. And I'm really looking forward to see the outcome of that. Don't write PHP off just now.""<p>Oh the irony...",1298537349

However, both sides of the language wars tend to see things in absolutes. Experience can be an asset, just like it can be a liability.

You don't need a highly skilled labor pool to fill a significant percentage of those jobs. The education budget has historically been dependent on revenues from the gaming (gambling) industry. You can guess where Nevada falls on education spending, graduation rates etc. Nevada ranks poorly in every social spending category so it's not just education that suffers.

I have an idea for a book that might be called “Simple Code"". It presents a decision-language to help software engineers make good design decisions. My idea is in the very beginning stages (4 days in) so it is vague; but it would incorporate XP theories and practices, especially TDD. The set of rules in the decision-language might be similar to rules in a game. I’m not sure if this “idea” of mine is a book at all. It might be a web-based tool for searching ""reliable"" sources or it might simply be a new language. The project is going to be my first attempt at merging my art with my software engineering skills. Whatever form it takes, it will be inspired by art, nature, and minimalism. If it's a book, it will be small enough to read in bed.\nHow would I use latency-oriented engineering to minimize the loop from idea to learning to feedback from real users?\nHow much of this project do I have to imagine/articulate/build in order to get feedback from real users?\nHow do I get that feedback?\nAlso, how do I justify the expense, i.e. the time needed to complete one loop, to my investors (my husband)?<p>Thanks.",1298536383

It does not seem to be because of the product.<p>If the merger offer is not confidential then you can take it to investors. In this active fund-raising market with great technology, an offer from a very well known company and a market whose size has been validated by the number of competitors and the funding of other companies can only be attractive to other investors as well.<p>If you have the apetite for risk then it would be very well worth taking a swing in this case.",1298534842

So one day I tried calling it while at the door... when it started ringing, I started hitting buttons on the keypad (on the door) and when I hit the # key (or maybe it was *), it picked up.  I was then able to dial 9 from my phone, and it let me in.<p>I no longer live there, and don't have access to an apartment that has one.  I'd be interested to see if that works on other systems.  If anyone wants to try, let me know if it does.",1298534751
