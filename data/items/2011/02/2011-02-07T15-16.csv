Anyway, it's not something someone can simply say ""Hey, this app took longer than 50ms to respond!"" It's more of a gut feeling that something about it is slow.<p>They are likely aiming at the 50ms threshold because that's the point at which you really can't notice it, most of the time.  At > 50ms, it becomes more and more noticeable, and by just 100ms people actively start complaining about the slowness of response.<p>edit:<p>As for the FPS gaming issue, the reality is that you don't notice it in FPS gaming because the games are built to hide it from you -- when you press your fire button, your gun fires, regardless of net latency.  And that has been true for a very long time.  I think the last game to really wait for server response before doing anything was Quake 3, and probably some of the Quake 3 engine games.<p>I could never stand Quake 3 for that reason, if you had anything higher than 30-40ms it started feeling like you weren't controlling the game.",1297094336

It fills a lot of blanks in in my understanding; blanks that were also glossed over in my education as well (Waterloo CS & C&O, 2002).<p>The book starts from the most basic 'switch and a lightbulb' circuit, and takes a stepwise approach that ends up disassembling x86 by the final chapters. Although it can be a little pandering in points, and the rigour certainly isn't there (I can't remember for certain, but I'm pretty sure it violates my 'must have footnotes' rule regarding non-fiction), in my opinion it's a wonderful nightstand read regardless.<p>Indeed, there are a couple of spots the book knocks it out of the park without (I think) intending to. As an example, the book presents Turing machines (not by name, mind you) as a moving head traversing through a fixed memory, whereas all of the theory I learned in school presented them as a moving tape passing through a fixed head. It's a seemingly small detail of implementation, but it made an <i>enormous</i> difference in my understanding of how the modern computer evolved from Turing's work. All of a sudden, an ALU + a program counter becomes a modest leap from the theory of a TM ripping through a tape.",1297093913

The only way to resolve things are:<p>A) Place a larger order under safer terms for you - I know that sounds crazy but you can sometimes get suppliers to ""do the right thing"" by rewarding them for their bad behavior. Offer to purchase an extra large order where the money they already have is the down payment.

2189145,comment,2188958,2188958,0,0,FD3SA,,,"This is an extremely cogent article on the unemployment issue. It appears the US needs to seriously start considering the structural unemployment that results from accelerating efficiency gains brought on by technological progress. Although I am a huge proponent of free markets, I've always worried what would happen when the radical pace of technological change outpaced the average person's marketable skills.<p>My take on this is that human abilities are normally distributed, and the average employable person lies right at the mean in ability. Technology, on the other hand, started at the far left of the ability curve and slowly began automating the most menial tasks. Over the last century, the mean technological ability line has inched ever closer to the mean human ability line, eliminating otherwise employable people from the market along the way.<p>You don't have to be a Singularitarian to see that this line has already caught up to the mean human ability, as evidenced by the blue collar recession we have experienced recently. The problem is that about 68% of the human population lie within one standard deviation of the average. If you look at the income gap data, it appears there is a divergence occurring in job demand, where only the high skilled and certain non-automated low skilled jobs are in demand. The big fat middle of the distribution appears to have been automated, hence the lack of demand for blue collar jobs and the structural unemployment we see today.<p>I would be curious to hear HN's opinions on how to deal with this issue. I am at a loss, as the foundation of the issue is based on the non-malleable human ability distribution and the ever accelerating pace of technological efficiency.",1297091628

And let's say the current ROIs per man-year in X are at 3% (it's a mature well-developed economy, the home planet) but ROIs in Y are an amazing 20% per man-year. X bankers will <i>still</i> prefer to lend to Xers rather than Yers. Imagine they lend to a Yer. 10 X years later (1 Y year later), Yer repays the loan with 20% interest. Great. But imagine they had lent to a Xer. 10 years later, the Xer repays the loan with 34.39% in interest! (3% compounded annually.)<p>And the exact same logic applies if the banker lives in Y. Xers are <i>still</i> better investments. A Y banker loans to an Xer for 1 Y year, and a year later gets the loan back with 34.39% interest, as compared to the best his fellow Yers can do, which is just 20% per year.<p>So interest rates need to scale with the dilation. If they scale too little, then all money will flow to the slowest timeframe. If they scale too much, the money flows to the fastest timeframe. Modulo the cost of moving between timeframes.
