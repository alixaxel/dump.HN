Firing him is one, but it's better to look at his skills and weaknesses and see if there's anywhere else he would fit to still provide value.<p>The kindest way to do so is this:<p>Before you fire him, try to measure what he's doing and the value he generates. Look for alternative employment for him in company as an option and bring him into a meeting room with two people, explain that he's underperforming and develop a performance improvement plan with him as well as offering the alternative employment if it's appropriate. Minute the meeting, give him the option to change the minutes and get him to accept them over email. Re-evaluate his performance again over the next couple of months and make a decision. Once that's made, bring him back into the meeting room, inform him of your decision, stick to it and act on it.<p>Having said that, you're in an at-will state so the type of thing I've described probably doesn't happen there. It's really down to you, but I've always sought to get the best out of my employees.

Don't worry about generics and the reflection API in the beginning because once you get used to the syntax figuring out how generics fit in your code and how to make use of them will be pretty easy. If you're looking for extra motivation to keep you going you could try writing an android application, that's actually how I learned it.

From IDEs to the display api to as3 apis in general to the true object oriented architecture to lack of browser inconsistencies to client side storage to sockets and networking options to modular applications.<p>Say what you want about flash. It certainly has its problems and it has certainly been abused, but let's not ignore all the areas where js is still playing catch up and will be for a long time (even it's just IE). Flash has been a lead innovator in web-based interfaces for many years. Even if it's true that it's in decline, completely discounting such an important technology only shows ignorance.",1298016560
