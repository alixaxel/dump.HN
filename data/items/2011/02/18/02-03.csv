Why are we in 2011 still raising money offline? You market through Facebook or Twitter, get customer service through Get Satisfaction and host your servers on Amazon, why shouldn’t getting funding for your company be serviced through the web? The whole process has to move online.""<p>I disagree, funding a startup is unlike any other commodity or service you might just buy online. Yes the web makes it more efficient to process and transmit information (startup pitches, prototype products/mockups), but if a VC is going to put in 7/8 figures into your startup, you better believe he's going to want to meet with you and your team.<p>There's a reason that we have a high degree of local VC's in various parts of the country and the world. They need to be on the ground, close to their startups. Mentor them, advice them and make sure the $$$$ they've invested in is being put to good use.<p>Its been discussed endlessly here and elsewhere: a good idea is worthless without a solid team behind it. Angels/VC's invest in people first (and then the idea). Doing the whole process online is not going to work for the majority of the cases.<p>Apart from that, love venturehacks and the work Naval is doing..",1297997294

The best number I can find for MySpace is 100 million active users. It's easy to misrepresent the scales involved just because they're so very large, but the difference between 100 million and 600 million is huge. 17 year olds are fickle consumers. 53 year old Aunt Sue is not. How many people still have a paid AOL account simply because they don't want to lose their email address? AOL's stayed alive for YEARS on them.

When it comes to being weight in the balance I think the general public is the least wanting. By no means am I saying lets intact laws and retroactively throw these guys in jail, but the reality of the situation is that given the cozy nature of business and government in this sector nothing is going to happen until the general public starts calling for blood. They are embolden by all they have gotten away with it will not be reduced and no laws will be enacted until there is a fear of the general population. I think the mid-terms helped to stoke that fear. I don't want to get into the politics of the change but a mass flushing of Washington should send a signal.

In addition to several things mentioned in the comments, these tablets had problems like,<p>1. Almost all except Samsung Galaxy lacked direct use of Android market.\n2. Some had software problems with bad out of box experience.

Regular apps built for Android phones did not give good experience on the tablets<p>For the future tablets, waiting for Android 3.0 may not be a good reason. They always can release the hardware and then update the software later. HTC flyer is following this approach. There is a risk of users turning away if the first impressions are really bad. Announced prices for several of them are on the very expensive side. Among the announcements I also notice that very few come with wifi only option which is another reason for high price.<p>I collect tablet information at tbltpc.com.",1297995597
