Copyright is a sword, not a shield: With copyright they can prevent the use of the image as they see fit.<p>The right to use an image or likeness of a person as they see fit is conveyed by the model waiver. When you sit for a private, personal portrait session that you pay for, the waiver you sign shouldn't assign all rights to your likeness to the studio.<p>On the other hand, if you are paid to model something, the waiver you sign probably does give the photog all rights to those images in perpetuity.<p>But even then there are limitations. Most jurisdictions won't allow an implied endorsement unless the picture was specifically taken for that purpose. For example, if a young model sits for a stock picture which depicts him sitting in an Aeron chair and he later becomes a famous programmer, Aeron cannot buy that picture from the photographer and run an ad saying ""Bill Gates loves Aeron Chairs!""",1296926930

2183440,comment,2183207,2183207,0,0,maxklein,,,"The problem here is simple: The people buying pick-axes are much smaller than the people buying gold. If there are 1000 people buying gold, there are 100 people mining for gold, and 10 people selling pickaxes. So the pick-axe market is quickly going to be dominated by someone who executes well and can offer the best pick-axes at prices less than what anyone else can compete with.<p>It's like frameworks - only a few rise to prominence, and that's because they are constantly developed, well marketed, etc. There is little space for a lot of choice in the tools market. The winners take all.<p>In the consumer market, however, even if you don't make a blow-out hit, your chance of getting by are much bigger. Even if you find a little gold, you can always sell it off and survive. But if you're selling pick-axes and they are lower quality and more expensive than the axes of the other established players, you'll not sell anything and die quickly.<p>In both cases it just comes down to who is smarter and faster and can better manage their finances to expand wisely. Both the pick-axe business and the gold business need proper intelligence and good business sense, and those who can bring both will be successful in either business.<p>Another consideration is this: It's easy to find gold. It's not easy to sell pick-axes. For pick-axes you need a supply chain, a cheap source, a marketing strategy. Gold panning requires a pan and some luck. The people who go for the Gold rush are normal people hoping to get lucky. They lack the skills to actually produce and sell jeans. Even if they tried, most of them would not be able to sell pick-axes.<p>So you can't really advice them to go sell pick-axes, as that is a more skilled business than panning for Gold.",1296926366

I have yet to meet a pro-vaccination person who was willing to talk about the actual science.<p>Please, also realize when you say ""mandatory"" you are saying that you endorse the use of violence on people who-- for whatever reasons-- choose to make a different choice about the healthcare of their children.<p>It is one thing to incarcerate, or kill if they resist, someone who has committed a crime like murder or rape.  It is quite another for you to endorse the use of violence for the ""Crime"" of not being politically correct.<p>Your ideology posits that whatever you deem to be ""good for society"" gives you the justification of using violence to enforce.  First I'd like to point out that there hasn't been a tyrant known to the face of the earth who didn't use such rationalizations.  But secondly, it is worth noting that implicit in this claim is the presumption that everyone is your slave, and everyone's life is to be lived according to your (or your creed's) edicts.<p>That is the opposite of liberty, and contrary to the entire history of common law, and specifically the US constitution which recognizes people as having inalienable rights. One of these rights recognized in the declaration of independence is the pursuit of ""life"".  Quite literally, that means the right and power to make their own health care choices, based on their best understanding of the state of knowledge at the time.<p>In my experience, those who are wary of vaccines are pretty well aware of the state of the science on the issue, while those are pro-vaccines are generally after an ideological agenda of mandatory vaccination, and only invoke the word ""science"" to put forth the idea that their opposition rejects it.<p>Well, I see thru your claim.  You reject science, the scientific method and the entirety of intellectualism.  You are being dogmatic.<p>Edit: Everyone who votes me down without responding to my issues, proves my claim.  I made an argument here that substantially contributes to the discussion.  You vote me down and you vote to make HN a popularity contest where posts are ranked by adherence to The Party Line, rather than contributing to discussion.<p>By doing so you just prove that the claim about being influenced by ""facts and science"" is false and the reality is political ideology over all.",1296925733
