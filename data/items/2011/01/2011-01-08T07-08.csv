2082603,comment,2082544,2082544,0,0,rsepassi,,,"Well-rounded often means the person seems generally capable of tackling a broad range of activities, though they may not be stellar at any one.  A guy who does well in school, plays sports, can mingle well, has a good group of friends, etc.  Balanced, normal, etc.  Used in this sense, it's a pretty poor compliment and doesn't seem to be a description that one should strive to achieve.  What exactly is this ""well-rounded"" person good at?  Yes, you may want to be versatile and generally comfortable in a wide variety of situations, but you definitely want to kick ass at a narrower set of activities.<p>Building character is often used to justify grueling tedious work, regardless of its merits/value.  Done right, building character would consist of valuable activities that improved upon an important skill or helped people.  That is, one builds character by learning and by overcoming obstacles on the way.<p>These are basically two phrases that could be used to signify positive attributes/activities, but are usually used in stupid ways.",1294473275

2082581,comment,2081296,2081296,0,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"Software as we all know it today is inseparable from the internet. Like a lot of learning or information exchange on the interent, it's largely a peer-to-peer activity (software being the exemplary). Academia is hierarchical and relies on a specialist gathering, filtering and preparing information to disseminate to many. The former is more error-prone but also much faster.<p>Or another way to look at it: If young John Resig builds a tool that will save you time, should you wait for your professor to learn about it and teach you or learn about it from John himself? I'm not knocking academia (there's a lot of theoretical work going on in CS that's invaluable to the industry), but your professor is professional educator, not a professional programmer, so her needs and your needs (to have the right tools to build things competitively) are not perfectly aligned. In many fields the difference is probably inconsequential, but in something as rapidly changing as software I think it makes all the difference.<p>I've seen the effects of this lag in a different way living in Thailand. Since most of the developers here do not learn English well enough to work/research in the language, they're ability to learn new technologies is slowed waiting for the handful of bilingual developers that exist to learn them and then blog about them in Thai. The effect is that the technology base here is horribly outdated. New <i>products</i> are built aggressively, but they're almost all built on yesterday's tech.

No.  It was formed as a reaction to plans announced by the big telcos to monetize traffic flowing through their networks.  Specifically, they were going to hobble the connection speeds of any popular website like YouTube unless they were paid money.  So people who weren't even their customers could have their traffic throttled merely because it happened to cross their network.<p>At the time, everyone from the ACLU to the Christian Coalition was outraged by this naked money grab.  Basically, almost everyone hated the idea.<p>Then a bunch of lobbyists came into play and split us up about what we should do in response.  So you have the current false choice of ""let the government regulate the internet"" and ""let free enterprise screw everyone over.""<p>What everyone wants is an internet where a suddenly popular site only has to pay its own ISP for bandwidth, not one where every single network operator comes to them for a handout saying, ""That's a nice website you got there.

I say definite as these are the ideas that I've vetted with my partner as worth some exploratory work. The app that's in the store has a timeline set up for adding several new features that have been planned and I'm also spending some time reaching out to reviewers, etc for marketing that product.<p>I'm also looking (not aggressively) for contracting work as I'd like to pick some up in the next month or two, but that's something I'll slot time for when the time comes.<p>My question:<p>I normally have a laser-like focus on projects and will work nearly non-stop until the next goal is reached (prototype, version 1, etc). But I've started to see myself bounce around between projects more that normal. I'm still working constantly, but I'm not really spending enough time with each project to make significant progress (or the level for progress that I'm used to).<p>I'm wondering if people here have proven tricks for working on multiple projects in parallel. Do you divide by days? Hours? Do you set smaller goals for each project and work serially through them? Don't fight things and just do whatever you feel like until you find a rhythm?<p>It's not a question of over-working as I do get out of the house on a somewhat regular basis for recreation - this isn't a procrastination or burnout question. Also, it's not a question for me of task management in the sense that I forget what's next. I know what's 'in the queue' at all times. I'm wondering what people have found most effective for moving several projects (in various stages) forward aggressively.<p>Thanks<p>Edit: typo",1294471146

However I did start reading this note and found myself strongly flustered at this part:<p><i>I thought that if I got into to a good college, or a good grad school, or lost weight, or went to the gym nearly every day for a year, or created programs that millions of people used, or spent a summer or California or New York or published papers that I was proud of, then maybe I would feel some peace and not be constantly haunted and unhappy. But nothing I did made a dent in how depressed I was on a daily basis and nothing was in any way fulfilling.</i><p>I'm annoyed at how stupid it is. And how, until recently, I wouldn't even have noticed. Let me translate to illustrate:<p><i>I desperately wanted to see what was on top of that hill over there. I thought that if I got into to a good college, or a good grad school, or lost weight, or went to the gym nearly every day for a year, or created programs that millions of people used, or spent a summer or California or New York or published papers that I was proud of, then maybe I would find out what is at the top of the hill. But nothing I did made a dent in my knowledge</i><p>Wouldn't that be silly? Wouldn't that make you wonder what he was thinking? Wouldn't you say ""so go climb the hill. That's what you need to do and that's all you need to do. Forget the distractions. Go over there. Climb the hill as high as you can and keep trying every few days until you build up the fitness to get to the top"".<p>Yet you see the note of the guy and you feel sorry for him and how hard he tried to keep living and how much he struggled and what pain he was in and he missed this concept completely. If you want peace you need to work on peace and why you can't be at peace and changing yourself so you can. If you want to not be haunted you need to work on not being haunted and if you want to be happy you need to work on being happy and how you can be. Not on grad school or weight loss or gym work or <i>anything</i> else. Your life isn't unhappy, your thoughts are unhappy. Don't improve your life, improve your thoughts. It might not work, but the other way cannot work.<p>If your code isn't working right, you'll never ever ever fix it by going to the gym. You will only stand any chance of fixing it if you look for the bugs in the code that isn't working and out from there.  If you have been hurt and can't be happy, you need to work out how to feel happy even though you got hurt. That's it. That mental adjustment is where the bulk of your energy should be going. Learning to change it and trying repeatedly until you succeed.<p>It's so frustrating to look at it and see him basically saying ""I skirted around my problems all my life and suffered horribly, and when they didn't magically go away I decided they were completely unfixable"".<p>You can feel however you like about whatever you like. This definitely extends to feeling good even when bad things happen. Maybe not <i>all</i> bad things, but many. It may not extend to PTSD. What's frustrating is that he believed he was unfixable <i>without any solid basis for that belief</i> - without talking to a single expert, even - then made the biggest and last decision of his life based on this conclusion.<p>It's not cowardly or morally inferior or anything like that, it's just ... a strategy that stands a low chance of helping.",1294470092

I've seen both sides of it; I've suffered through 7 semesters with BB as a student, and 2 as a teaching assistant.<p>It uses frames. When you open a link in a new tab, you get the bare page without the top/left nav bars. Really? They couldn't even use a little 1998 Javascript to get the page to reload inside the frameset?<p>Too many modules are enabled by default, which causes confusion when profs use things differently. Does the syllabus go in ""Course Information"" or ""Course Documents""? Or, since it contains the prof's email, ""Staff Information""? Do homework assignments go under ""Assignments"" or ""Course Documents""?<p>There are two ways to upload files. One is convenient for both students and teachers, one is not. Guess which one is more obvious? The nonintuitive one, Digital Dropbox, is buried two pages deep. It has two choices: ""Add File"" and ""Send File"". If you add a file, but don't send it, the teacher never sees it. From the teacher's end, Digital Dropbox renames files, for your convenience. Yes, BB, thanks so much for renaming my students' Java files so that I can't compile them. Also, for your convenience, any .html files that are uploaded get their extension changed to <i>.rtf</i>, prompting more shell scripts just to de-BlackBoard your students' files.<p>The better upload option is for teachers to allow submissions in the Assignments tab. This makes <i>way</i> more sense, since you can view and complete the assignment all on one page. To enable this, the teacher has to select an assignment type of ""Assignment"", instead of the default ""Content Unit"". As a TA, I only knew this existed because one semester, one of my profs used this. (Once, out of all the classes I took that had digital submission.)<p>The grading page is <i>horrible</i>. It has a table for the grades, like you would expect, with one column per assignment, and one row per student. If you have more than 5ish assignments or 15 students, it overflows the page. This would be fine, except the table doesn't respond to the scroll wheel. It has a scrollbar on the right, and a scrollbar on the bottom, and watches their position with Javascript. When you scroll one of these, the table contents are updated to reflect that position of the table. This makes scrolling awkward every time - the screen flashes a bit, and you have no idea how many columns Blackboard decided you wanted to scroll until you look at the header row. Oh, and every time you resize the page, the table is reset to the top-left.<p>TL;DR These people need some serious UX help, fast.",1294470036
