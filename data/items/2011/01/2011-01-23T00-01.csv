If we can agree that the WordPress team needs to focus on security, then we are basically in agreement. The details of how to do this can hopefully worked out by the WordPress team. They have certainly been given good advice over the years, much of which they have tended to ignore. Perhaps they will begin to listen. Given the scale of WordPress's success, we must hope they reform their ways.<p>Ideally, at some point soon they will recognize some of the dangers that arise from using such an easy-to-set-up language as PHP, and they will recognize that they appeal to a largely non-technical audience, and they will start taking some responsibility for their choices, and their success.",1295744125

And the valuables are not blueprints or styling sketches, but the huge volume of computer instructions required by these cars: the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid uses about 10 million lines of computer code to shunt power seamlessly among the car’s battery pack, power inverter, drive motor, gas engine, generator and other subsystems.<p>By comparison, Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner relies on a mere eight million lines of code.""<p>Linux is ~4 million lines of code[1].<p>I have trouble even conceptualizing how that much code can ever be usefully conceived or maintained. Obviously, it's possible. I just don't get it on a practical level.  Can anyone explain?<p>On a different vane, given the apparent impracticality of keeping code secret, and the enormous undertaking that is required to develop this kind of software, wouldn't it be better (lower cost & better quality & short lead time) just to open source it, and have a platform that can be used by different auto manufacturers?

This makes use of the optional start argument and list add operator.  However, Python's docs suggest using itertools.chain instead:<p><a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#sum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#sum</a><p><pre><code>  >>> import itertools
  >>> [l for l in itertools.chain(*[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']])]
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
</code></pre>
(Of course you lose the benefit of a generator by using a list comprehension, but this is just an example.)",1295741738

2131422,comment,2130767,2130767,0,0,fingerprinter,,,"In one VC funded company I saw three CEO transitions: Founder CEO -> Outside CEO #1 -> Outside CEO #2.<p>The first transition, Founder CEO -> Outside CEO #1 was very smooth. The outside CEO has a three time CEO who had run both very small and very large companies. He had experience, passion, compassion and understood what it took to connect with people and customers. He could sell most anything.<p>The company took off under him. He was able to reign in finances and inspired people to work hard and get things done. We started to dominate our market and our tech was the best in the industry. In about 2.5 years we had near zero voluntary attrition and we built a great team.<p>Outside CEO #1 left for personal reasons and everyone thought Founder CEO might step up and become the CEO again. He didn't and we hired Outside CEO #2 instead (Full disclosure, I was involved in the process of hiring outside CEO #2. I preferred another candidate but didn't have senior voice in the matter).<p>Outside CEO #2 was a disaster. We had become accustomed to transparency at the highest level in the company and we got less and less until we got none from OCEO#2. He also hired people he knew for senior positions in the company without having those people interview for their positions (He actually had two people hired before he even started....he had two people displaced from their current roles for these two individuals). Those people started to hire people they knew without interview process and the cycle perpetuated.<p>Voluntary attrition of old/founding employees skyrocketed from 0% over 2.5 years to 60% in 10 months. Sales slowed, current customers were not happy with latest revisions of product and changes in customer engagements. We started to bleed money and needed to take a down round and then a D round of funding at a much lower evaluation. Our competitors started to fly by us as they started to do things we needed to do, knew we needed to do and had tried to do but were shot down for not being ""strategic"" by OCEO#2 and his new executive team.<p>18 months later the company is still in business but has lost all employees that were pre OCEO#2. Market has passed company by.  Board is investigating what has happened and why attrition is so high but I fear it is too late (I say fear b/c I still have stock).<p>So many lessons learned from this experience. I feel I know so much more for having gone through this experience, both the highs and the lows. I feel for the Founding CEO, but he could take it back at any moment,  and I hope he does. He will have a much harder time rebuilding the company, but he will also have lower expectations as OCEO#2 is such a disaster nearly anyone would be better.",1295741463
