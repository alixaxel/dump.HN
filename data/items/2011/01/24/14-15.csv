From that perspective inheritance is simply extending an API with another API that has new behavior and uses the existing API etc.<p>So, while syntactic sugar helps with bookkeeping, OO is a programming technique not a language feature.  With great discipline you could write OO code in C, but languages that pick up the slack help you write clean code faster and avoid the temptation, late at night, to use ""goto"" that one time it really helps.

All those sorting algorithms that come with programming languages - they were written and optimized by people with a good understanding of CS concepts (note: they may or may not have a degree).<p>The algorithms in CS are motivated by real problems. The algorithms came about when researchers faced certain issues(i.e. a faster algorithm is needed etc).

The undergraduate degrees merely expose you to the techniques but in reality, you will most likely call some function or routine if you want to do it.<p>And that's just the algorithms part of CS. There's a whole world of optimizing this and that, how to design a fault-tolerant distributed computing system, etc. Again, you may or may not use this.
