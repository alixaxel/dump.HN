Retroviruses carry its own reverse transcriptease, and must use the cell's own resources to do the actual transcription (they need to get the dNTP to build actual DNA strands). The 'big deal' about this discovery is that HIV can use rNTP to preform reverse transcription instead in cases where there isn't enough dNTP, which presumably (I'm not an expert in this field) is one of the reasons why it is so successful compared to other retroviruses.",1295833365

Where, then, did this way of thinking originate? Not in universities, as the author suggests, but much earlier. Students are trained from a young age to participate in the game that is schooling; you are foisted into generic classes and made to take surface-level standardized tests (measuring nothing but the rote memorization seemly criticized by the author). Very rarely are you taught by a Professor in elementary, middle, or high school. Rather, ""education professionals"" prepare you for what is to come later. Just as often as not these teachers are uninterested in your learning (2), simply seeking a paycheck. Both teacher and pupil are playing the same game, one in which neither benefits from going above and beyond. Is it any small wonder that students enter college as excellent students, but poor learned citizens?<p>The article is far too narrow; The problem, much more broad. It's not the universities failing students, but the institutions that placed them there. We're not going to college intellectually and socially curious, only to have that squashed out of us; We're going to college expecting more of the same.<p>(1) <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2133712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2133712</a><p>(2) This is not to say that great primary education teachers do not exist.

When I reach 0, I make myself go and do that thing. While it may sound like a gimmick, it does seem to work well for me. Simply starting to count down is easy to do, and can be done simultaneously with almost anything (except writing perhaps). Counting also gives you time and preparation in order to stop what you're doing (a.k.a. procrastinating). When you reach 0, you have this sense of obligation to stop procrastinating and do the work. The longer you count down for, the more obligated you'll be to do the work.",1295832916

They are the medium from which light itself emanates.<p>You can find this kind of mismatch elsewhere when it comes to similar comparisons of actual intelligence, vs. perceived intelligence a particular badge bestows on a person. ""I graduated from Harvard"" ""I went to Oxford"", ""The best school is Seoul University"" etc. Appears to have only slightly more substance to a person's intelligence and worth than the brand of socks they are wearing. Yet the public will grant significant weight to these things.<p>Articles like this work to slowly peck away at this often faulty public perception. It's not that Rhodes Scholars, or graduates of top schools aren't smart -- just that similarly smart people exist elsewhere. It's only a matter of time before ""Rhodes Scholar"" means only slightly more than ""Dean's List"" in terms of perception.<p>I'm afraid more and more that badges that <i>should</i> signify significant intellectual achievement are becoming more and more worthless.

2133888,comment,2133304,2133669,0,0,maxawaytoolong,,,"If you already are running a startup from your dorm, the main reason to stay in college is to meet women. Honestly, there is no easier venue, and the chance to have a captive audience of thousands of women looking for a boyfriend will never happen again in your life. You should be one of the most ballin' dudes at Bentley.<p>NYC is the second easiest place in the USA to meet women. It's not as easy as when you're in college. But it's about 100x better than Silicon Valley.<p>Relationships might seem unimportant when compared to your potential bazillion dollar website, but even the most autistic geeky weirdos want companions - see all of livejournal as evidence. I did startups in SV/SF for 10 years and could count the number of women I worked with on 2 hands. If you're working 12 hours a day, when are you going to meet the other women who aren't working at startups? At the bar, after work. But, you could go to any bar and there would be no women there, either. You end up condemning yourself to a life of near chastity hoping your startup sells so you can maybe attract a mate based on your bank account. That probably won't even work, there are loads of rich dudes in SF/SV who can't get a date.<p>The NYC startup scene is OK but kind of stupid.  \nThere is a lot of dumb money. For example, GroupMe got $10M for a product that took 24 hours to build and has already been built by a dozen other companies over the years. The guys working on it are basically drunks and stoners and guys who follow jam bands around. (Check their twitter history, I'm not just being snide.) I actually think they are cool dudes but I'm just using them as an example that the bar for funding in NYC is way lower compared to SV.  The nouveau startup wunderkinds in SF/SV are now all straight-laced type-a achievers who went to Philips Andover, Yale, Stanford, MIT, etc.<p>(This is actually really weird, cuz it's the opposite of the previous bubble where SV/SF was a bunch of bipolar freaks and dropouts with purple dreadlocks, and you needed to go to Choate and Princeton and wear a suit to get a job in NYC)<p>I spent about 2 years in NYC hanging out with startups and came to the conclusion that most of them are just ""playing startup."" The startups that make the most sense there are startups that target the NYC market first, like Gilt and Foursquare and media/blog empire things like Gawker, Tumblr, and DailyBeast. GroupMe works well in NYC, too, as the main activity is to go out at night and you can use it to sync up. So if your plan is to service the NYC market first and then see how it spreads from there, it's not a bad place to be and it should be trivial for you to get funding $$$.",1295832149

A non-qualified dividend is taxed at your base tax rate.  Bear in mind that a dividend can alter your base tax rate, which affects contributions you may have made throughout the year.

When in fact it is the inverse and analagous to waiting for a function to return and thus more similar to a print() function call. The whole point of coroutine yielding is that it inverts the point of view of a call stack and allows the called routine to be the calling routine as well.<p>I still use Python for some things and have too many fond memories to ever hate it, but even if generators get cleaned up I'll probably stay w/ Lua for pipeline type projects as I've grown too used to runtime within an order of magnitude of C, better coroutines, and its more Scheme-like nature.",1295831657
