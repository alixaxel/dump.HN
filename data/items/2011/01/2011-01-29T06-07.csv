I say everything here without knowing you, your wife or your idea.<p>First off, make sure that you read this article and follow it unless you have a good reason not to:<p><a href=""http://startuplawyer.com/startup-issues/if-i-launched-a-startup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startuplawyer.com/startup-issues/if-i-launched-a-star...</a><p>Specifically, both you and your wife should have vesting shares. After all, there's a reason that most people do not start up with their loved ones - they say that the best family business is a sole proprietorship. This isn't a corner store and you and your wife might find your marriage taxed by this radical twist on your relationship.<p>Would you start up with your wife if you weren't married? If not, then my polite suggestion is that you hire your wife and give her lots of equity for her contributions. Taking on a business partner is an incredibly important decision, and if you wouldn't hire her otherwise then it's a potentially questionable decision now. I wouldn't belabour this point but you didn't explain her background.<p>The other thing is that it pays to startup with a good idea. I'm a big believer in MVPs and pivoting and trying things until it works... but the fact remains that most ideas are terrible and it's hard to tell when one of your ideas is terrible. Most people around you are inclined to tell you how great an idea it is, because they can see in your eyes that you want them to love it. This is an extremely dangerous confirmation bias because you can and will waste your valuable energy and enthusiasm.<p>In short: seek people that you can trust to give you honest feedback on your ideas. Steve Blank's 4 Steps to the Epiphany is worth the kudos it receives. And most important of all: make sure all founders have vesting shares.",1296284146

2154920,comment,2154106,2154106,0,0,mtr,,,"1. It makes more sense to value your company on the profit as opposed to revenue, and throw in some expected growth for good measure.  For example, would you rather buy Ford with $132B in revenue, or the Google with $28B in revenue?  The market cap of Google is 3 times that of Ford $197B vs $65B.  Or Yahoo (revenue $6.5B, market cap $20B) vs Google ($28B, $197B).  Google's revenue is <5 times that of Yahoo, but it's market cap is 10x.
2. Why do you judge the offer to be low by 20%.  Is it 20% lower than what someone else would likely pay, 20% too low based on your expectations.  If you can get a better deal somewhere else, why would you accept this one?
3. They know you are young and are likely leveraging this to their benefit.

I believe more people concluded Anonymous/Wikileaks are vandals and bullies from hearing about (or being affected by) the DDoS attacks, than came around to sympathy for Wikileaks.<p>So orthogonal from any 'letter of the law' analysis, it was an immoral and counterproductive thing to do.<p>If the 'sit-in' directly blocked the objectionable activity, a different analysis might apply.

Moral and effective activists will choose other tactics.<p>And regarding: ""its important enough that the consequences are irrelevant""<p>That way lies zealotry, madness, impotence, chaos.

Multiplied by 40, that is $6 million.  $6 million is, seat of the pants calculation, two orders of magnitude lower than 2% of United States VC funding in a typical year.  VC funding is three orders of magnitude lower than the amount of outstanding bonds in the US.  That is one asset class: there are others.<p>Or, for another visualization: if this investment is one pixel, then the US bond market is a grizzled old neckbeard sporting six monitors at 1024x768.

Amount of computations and bandwidth required -- simply because of the amount of information involved, which is much more than stereoscopic 3D.<p>2.  A moving display technology that can display these computed holograms.  My understanding is that the display needs of the order of one to ten giga-pixels or more to be useful to a non-technical end customer.  A common approach then is to tile a large number of displays in cost-no-bar systems.<p>In this work, they seem to be using an ordinary display to render the holograms, which is why the rendered image is nowhere close to the source content.<p>Achieving 15 frames per second using a GPU for hologram computation is an advance but does not seem to be extra-ordinary to me, and nor a significant breakthrough.  This is because the amount of computations done I guess would be no more than what the display can render, so significantly short of what a good holographic display would need.<p>Here are some links worth checking out:
