2060542,comment,2060213,2060213,0,0,solipsist,,,"This seems to be one of the most prominent debates between entrepreneurs: ideas vs. execution. I'm sure that a lot of us would agree that the solution isn't black-and-white, but it would still be beneficial to know how much influence ideas and execution each had in the end product and its success.<p>Unfortunately, the title of this post falsely suggests that it is black-and-white. And the article itself uses the same arguments I've heard everyone else with the same stance use. That seems to be the problem: we keep using the same arguments over and over again. People on either side have failed to make a convincing argument, as their arguments are getting old and repetitive.<p>What we need is a logical explanation to be written or even an experiment to be done on the subject. Perhaps Paul Graham might consider taking up the issue in his next essay, as I know we all enjoy reading them and I'm sure he could introduce some new arguments in the piece.<p>My ""fresh perspective"" on the subject is that ideas and execution don't occur in the ways most people expect they would. It's not as if an entrepreneur spends two weeks coming up with an idea and then six weeks executing. The ideas phase and the execution phases are intertwined, in a way where the entrepreneur will spend a portion of each day coming up with ideas as well as well as another portion executing them. Even if you believe you have the solid idea down, executing it will bring up new questions that need to be answered and thus more ideas have to be made.<p>However, there are usually a few days in the beginning in which the entrepreneur has to come up with the core idea, the framework for everything to come, or the initial innovation. And while the core idea is important to some extent, I actually believe the ideas that are made closer to the end of development cycle have more importance. This may sound counterintuitive since these ideas often result in small details that the user may hardly notice. But these details are like the details Steve Jobs puts in his products. These are the details that affect the user the most. They can bring the core idea to a whole new level by building on it. But without them, there is essentially nothing special about the product.<p>Try taking a new perspective on the old debate of ideas vs. execution. Don't forget that ideas are made at the same time as the execution process, and not just at the beginning. The core idea is important and it determines the <i>potential</i> success of the product, but the ideas and execution that follow determine the <i>actual</i> success of the product. Unless the core idea is worthless and has little potential, the ideas and execution are more important in my opinion.",1293991085

2060522,comment,2060298,2060475,0,0,kroc,,,"Well put; what I believe in is that user agents should do their absolute best to make the most sense of what information is available to it in the context of the UI paradigm of the user agent. i.e. there is not enough screen space on phones for every website to fit an RSS icon; the browser should do the best thing that befits its UI and help minimise the efforts of the user to get the information they want. RSS can massively help with that.<p>Imagine for example that on the Chrome home page, where sites you visit often appear, Chrome also was following the RSS of these sites in the background, and listing new news items for those sites on the home page, all without you having to do anything.<p>There is infinite possibility here for browser vendors to make browsing quicker, easier and more intelligent and RSS is a key part of that. The browser vendors are not interested in exploring this avenue and as such everybody is stuck doing the same stupid routine every single day. This is dumb!

2060521,comment,2060317,2060470,0,0,cloudsigma,,,"Yes you are right, it is certainly easier to snoop on customers as an IaaS vendor if you keep full root access and file system visibility. I'd say that constitutes 'lazy policing' and not needed and that is certainly our experience :-)<p>Botnets etc. rely on free hijacked capacity not computing resources bought on an industrial scale on commercial terms. The cloud is no more prone for use as a botnet or other problematic activity than dedicated hardware. Although often touted, I've yet to hear a compelling case for IaaS clouds being any more susceptible to such use than VPS, shared hosting etc. etc.<p>Likewise, such activity becomes very obvious very quickly and it isn't access inside a customer's cloud server that allows you to spot such activity.<p>As I say, there are not real reasons not to give customers full control of their cloud servers any more than they have full control of their dedicated servers. In fact, the flexibility of the cloud makes policing it more easy than dedicated hardware without snooping inside customer servers or restricting their ability to control their computing.<p>In terms of administration, customers can choose to use their own in-house admins or that of a third party and many of our customers do. The point is they done have a choice, with other clouds they have one choice, the cloud vendor as the admin. That's overly restrictive and it isn't surprising why you get such concerns raised over security and control in the cloud.<p>Thanks for the great feedback by the way.<p>Best wishes,<p>Patrick\nCEO\nCloudSigma",1293990762
