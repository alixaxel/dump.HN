2084674,comment,2084416,2084643,0,0,mayank,,,"In my experience, the PhD does makes you smarter in a sort of trial by fire. I haven't met a single (math/CS) PhD student who wasn't intimidated by the magnitude of their research field when they started, or seriously intimidated by the math in a seminal research paper in their area, but came out with a mastery of the subject (which is not to say that there aren't any crap PhDs -- there are). At the very, very least, if you finish your PhD diligently, or even get close to finishing it, you will develop a confidence that you can in fact chip away at the most abstract and difficult problems, and usually come up with a good solution, while building on the efforts of much smarter people. At a very practical CS/algorithmic level, a lot more will seem possible, and you'll reinvent the wheel a lot less.<p>I've often seen very smart people in CS/ML who didn't have a PhD. However, they sometimes also lack the body of knowledge in advanced algorithms or statistics that comes from 5-6 years of monk-like reading and chipping away at immense intellectual problems that have been tackled by some of the smartest people in the world.<p>So if you don't mind 5-6 years of near-poverty, intensely difficult problems, a possible lack of interest from your advisor (thankfully not in my case), peer-review rejections that sometimes seem arbitrary and disheartening, and can take 3 months to come around each time, large minds and frequently larger egos, intense orgasmic breakthrough eureka moments that come from spending months or years working on a problem, self-learning some truly amazing things, and drinking discount ""St. Remy"" brandy instead of Remy Martin, then by all means go in for a PhD -- you'll come out sharper if you make it.",1294541716

2084618,comment,2084157,2084439,0,0,extension,,,"By the conventional terminology (which could admittedly be less ambiguous) ""client prediction"" is where the client shows the player a locally predicted present game state inferred from stale authoritative information. The client guesses what is actually happening right now based on what it knows was happening some time in the past, as told by prior updates it received from the server. This works if there is a lot of temporal continuity in the game, such as there is when the laws of physics are obeyed. Sources of entropy, like player input, can't be predicted and so that is where inconsistencies will appear.<p>""Lag compensation"" is where the server accounts for client latency when making certain authoritative game logic decisions i.e. ""did a bullet hit a target y/n""? Essentially, it decouples the <i>when</i> and the <i>where</i> of the event. So a target can be hit by a bullet <i>now</i> but the hit took place <i>where</i> the target was some time in the past. Since that would generally feel ridiculous to the player, it can only be done in very particular situations where the event is mostly entropic and instantaneous, and therefore unpredictable (e.g. a player firing a bullet with infinite velocity) <i>and</i> where the inconsistency is unlikely to be noticed (because you typically aren't paying much attention to where other players are aiming).<p>The lag comp described on that page you linked to is only for player vs NPC, where the NPC is totally predictable and therefor always appears in the same place to all players. If you tried to lag comp a slow moving projectile with player vs player then the projectile would have a curved path, following the target around as they tried to dodge it. It would give a blatant unfair advantage to lagged players.<p>I don't see any lag comp options for light cycles since your only real options for bending the game rules are a) letting players pass through walls/crash into walls that aren't there or b) moving players/walls around retroactively, both of which will appear obvious and unfair.",1294539996

The moment it finishes, you multiply the size by a random number ...<p>Then comes the twist.
