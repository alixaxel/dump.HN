2084759,comment,2084339,2084339,0,0,davidst,,,"I've done quite a bit of work with dictionaries going as far back as 8-bit machines with tight memory constraints.  Bear with me here as it will get interesting.<p>A Bloom filter is a great data structure but probably not the best choice for this problem.  It's not as memory efficient as you think.<p>Here's why: Think of a Bloom filter as a collection of hash values where each individual hash value is expanded by 44%.  The cost of maintaining the same false positive rate of an explicit log2(n) hash is to use 1.44log2(n) bits (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter</a> for more detail.)  So, if you want a false positive rate of 1 in 64k you could store a 16-bit hash in an array or a 23-bit hash in a Bloom filter.  That's a significant tax to pay when memory is tight.<p>In this case it's better to keep a bit array of explicit hashes than to use a Bloom filter.<p>An array of hashes gives you some options to make it smaller:<p>1. Sort the array by hash value and store only the differences using a delta coding scheme.  The downside is you have to search the entire array (or maintain some indexes into it) to look up a single word.<p>2. Break the array up into sub-arrays where each sub-array is chosen so the first N bits of the hash are the same (and discarded.)  Each sub-array uses a smaller hash value and can still be binary searched.<p>Of course, strip prefixes and suffixes from the words so the number of hashes that must be stored is reduced.<p>1.5 bytes per word is easy and with some work you can approach one byte per word with a low error rate.<p>If you're allowed to do off-line preprocessing on the word list you can do better.<p>Look up the history of Doug McIlroy's Unix spell checker.  He got 75,000 words to fit in about 52k (going from memory here and my copy of Bentley's ""Programming Pearls"" is at home.)  McIlroy traded away random access and had a fairly high error rate to get that much compression.  Essentially, what he did was to create a large 1-bit Bloom filter and delta-encoded the differences between set bits (similar to option #1 above.)<p>If you want to maintain fast random access for individual words you can do this with a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG).  A simple DAWG with fixed node sizes and no stemming of any kind will get two bytes per word on English.  Add variable node sizes, stemming and a few other tricks and you can have fast lookup with a near-zero error rate at a cost of about one byte per word.",1294545446

Apple provides a curated store to sell apps for their IOS devices.  Their market, so they get to chose the rules.  If you wanted to go sell products in Costco, or Walmart, you would have to play by their rules.<p>If you, as a developer, or user, don't like those rules, then thankfully we have superb open source operating systems, such as Linux, and OpenBSD that give you almost 100% freedom to build, sell, and use the applications of your choice.<p>In fact, if you have a jail-broken IOS device, then you can even purchase apps for those devices from places other than Apple's curated store.<p>The Droid, RIM, and WP7 platforms also provide varying degrees of freedom.<p>If, in fact, Apple had a defacto monopoly, then their behavior might come under some form of legislative oversight - but, they certainly don't have a Monopoly on the mobile computing platform, and we really don't need some external body providing regulatory oversight as to what/how Apple should approve applications landing in the store.",1294542797

You can literally have the best of both worlds.  It preserves maximum freedoms for the users.<p>What it <i>doesn't</i> do is advance the agenda of the GPL, which is to create a self contained and self sufficient ecosystem consisting solely of the GPL.  So when dual licencing you can say, well, we're not at that utopian programmer's paradise yet, so it doesn't matter, but the less commitment people have to a strong GPL, the longer it will take to reach that ideal world.",1294542786

2084694,comment,2084308,2084308,0,0,kls,,,"While, the systems I designed and built may not be considered Google or Amazon scale, I have build some of the largest travel systems the web uses. I have build systems that not only the biggest use with hundreds of thousands of request per second (hotels.com, travelocity, Expedia, Orbits) but thousands of other smaller clients where supported simultaneously. Anyways to get to the point there where two major decision that we made early on that saved us years and millions of dollars in frustration. Those two where statelessness and decoupling.<p>Statelessness is important because it drastically simplifies your software architecture and ejects the concern of scalability into the infrastructure. This is a good thing because with a good automated install strategy new capacity can be online in minutes (now with the cloud seconds). When you are stateless you don't have to worry about inter-application communication among nodes, rather you can have dead simple load strategies like load based, round robin, load balancing where the most under utilized node gets the next request. Statelessness is paramount to scalability, at least to cost effective scalability.<p>Now on to decoupling, I don't get too caught up in the enterprise buzz word bingo, but there is one that developers should pay attention to and that is SOA. SOA is just a name for a good architectural strategy that has been employed for years at the big guys. Summed up SOA is just a form of decoupling. If a system does an independent task then that system should be decoupled from the system as a whole. You should not think hey lets build a reservation application you should think lets build an availability service, a booking service, a  concierge service. And these services as a whole will be assembled together by a UI into a work-flow that allows people to make online reservations. REST is just an extension of this in a well defined and intuitive manner.<p>This allows the services to be used in new and novel ways, not only that but it isolates the system and makes capacity planning very easy. If you see a good deal of load on your availability service or your search service you can scale that area with precision, allowing you to put the horse power where it counts. As well with a decoupled system, that has well defined interfaces if a portion of the system in unreliable the entire piece can be snapped out and replaced with no effect to the larger system as a whole. It becomes very easy to trim out the rot in a decoupled system.<p>Going further, and on a side tangent, a decoupled system is easy to bring in contract development capacity in to work on it. You define the interface and what the component should do, and you can hand those component documentation off to a third party to build with far less risk than ""hey build this whole system"". This becomes critical if you experience the two year growth rate that we did.<p>I would say those two choices above all other allowed our small start-up the ability to scale on demand and grow from a handful of niche client to supporting every major travel system in a two year time frame.<p>Had we not made those choices we would certainly had a few year time-frame that would have been painful while we redesigned the architecture to handle the scale at which the business grew.",1294542482
