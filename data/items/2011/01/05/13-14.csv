You have to provide Amazon with all software that is yours on the Market\n2. You have to add Amazon specific DRM to the apps you add to Amazon and cannot use any other DRM\n3. There are privacy requirements on embedded advertising\n4. The parentheses in the agreement are not well balanced! There are a lot of missing closing )s.<p>So you cannot pick and choose which of your software goes on Amazon and which on the Market. The DRM means you would at the very least need 2 versions of your software if you use Google's licence server ""DRM"" - one with Google's technology and another version with Amazon's.<p>I'd say that if you go the DRM route, you'd want to use Amazon or the Market, but not both. If Amazon turns out to be more popular with paying customer this could really have an impact. Especially the ""all your Apps belong to us"" requirement - I think having a free-with-adverts version of an App on the Market and a paid version on Amazon is forbidden under this agreement.<p>Policing rogue advertising is good, though I doubt Amazon will really kick anyone off for using AdMob or any of the big players.<p>Also, #4 shows that the agreement was not written by a Lisp programmer.

2070936,comment,2070761,2070761,0,0,rst,,,"As a rubyist, my main reason for preferring it to Python is what you can do with ""blocks"".  The idiomatic way of iterating over the elements of an array, for example, is:<p><pre><code>  my_array.each do |elt| ... do stuff with elt ...; end\n</code></pre>\nThat looks like a control structure, but it's actually invoking a library routine (""each"") with a block of code (the part between ""do"" and ""end"") as an argument.  It's easy to write your own routines which also take blocks as arguments, which effectively adds new control structure to the language.<p>This flexibility can be really expressive, but it can also easily lead to code that n00bs find confusing.  Python syntax isn't as flexible, but that can make Python code more approachable, particularly to novices.<p>Aside from that, available libraries may make a difference; SciPy and NumPy might come in handy for you, depending on what you're trying to do.",1294235750

2070929,comment,2070745,2070745,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"IDEs are hard.<p>Java was around for almost a decade when Eclipse became really mature...  And Java was a language that was designed for GUI development from the very beginning,  however,  the Eclipse team had to develop their own windowing toolkit from scratch to get something that could swing that load.<p>The Python community has dreamed of a Python-based IDE for as long as Python has existed,  but it faces two roadblocks:  (i) there is no 'standard' GUI toolkit for Python and certainly none with the required maturity and (ii) it isn't easy for an IDE to reason about dynamically typed code (also not as necessary...  Eclipse substantially lowers the 'verbosity tax' that makes Java programming so wet.)<p>Part of the problem is that an IDE requires that people who are passionate about programming get together with people who are passionate about designing user interfaces.  GUI programming is particularly expensive,  especially for open mixed initiative applications such as moderns IDEs.  The kind of person who is 'hyperproductive' in LISP (or any other language) tends to avoid the morass of GUI development,  where you can spend months and months going back and forth with designers and customers making sure the app correctly supports every interaction that would be intuitive to end user.<p>Now,  LISP does have the advantage of being easy to reason about (since the program is also data) but it's fair to say that a really good IDE costs millions and millions of dollars worth of programmer time to develop.  The core of Eclipse/Java was developed by professional programmers working around the clock.  The community contributed plugins for Eclipse,  such as the PHP and Python modes,  are just a joke in comparsion...  In some sense they're a step up from vi,  but they're an embarassment if you compare them to Eclipse/Java or Visual Studio/C#.",1294235583
