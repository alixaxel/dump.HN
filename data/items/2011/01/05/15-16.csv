For the scoop on that, check out Knuth:<p><a href=""http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/lp.html</a><p>Here's an example of Adventure done up literate-style by Knuth:<p><a href=""http://www.literateprogramming.com/adventure.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.literateprogramming.com/adventure.pdf</a><p>But what we're talking about here is a bit simpler. Writing code has always had this strange quality of having to write for two very different audiences at the same time. You need to address yourself both to the machine, to execute the code, and to human readers, to understand it. (Even if the human reader is only the author.) The entire history of programming languages and paradigms is a history of being able to address the human more and more directly, and the machine less directly, as computers get ever-more powerful and able to perform the extra legwork involved in translating ""higher-level"" forms.<p>Literate programming means that you acknowledge this fact -- and try to write and structure your code to be read by people first and foremost. Think of your source code as an essay to be read, rather than a list of commands to be futzed with and hacked until it works.",1294243189

2071315,story,,,1,2,wallflower,"All traffic is not equal",,"All traffic is not equal.<p>I'd like to highlight this really cogent comment on the TechCrunch article ""Memo to Twitter""<p>At the heart of the issue is the simple fact supposed technorati and the media continuously drive the concept of all traffic being equal. This misconstrues data and unless you exercise due diligence, investment. Oh, but people stopped reading prospectus long time ago right.<p>There will always be a new number 1 or even top ten. What no one discusses is that as more people join the internet (globally), its conceivable that a site could loose its spot without loosing its traffic by merely being eclipsed. Which brings us to Facebook and Google. Why do we compare the two. Google is a search engine, email, video and a full out blog platform. Is Facebook any of these? No, but we compare. It's clear that a bus stop is only a portal to other places, much like a search engine, it's not a destination. Facebook is a destination while Google's search engine is a means of finding a destination, so why the comparisons?<p>Facebook doesn't provide any of Google's functionality nor that of its other properties. The reality is they are complementary. Many Google users have Facebook accounts as Facebook users have Youtube accounts and GMail accounts and Blogger accounts. Until the supposed stats of the day take functionality into account they won't be much more than indicators of traffic at the moment but nothing else.<p>There is popular and then there is necessary. Of all the services up top and even Yahoo's struggles, why do we still see so many GMail, Yahoo, MSN, and even AOL email addresses despite the coming and eventual going of Facebook, Myspace, Geocities, Orchid and whatever else? That's probably how you know most of this stuff is a fad, because at the end of the day no matter how popular the current #1 is or will be, perhaps the best way to determine metrics is by the staying power of a domain name in the email address of people using the internet. Sadly, its not very sexy and doesn't make for great headlines.<p>-Michael A. De Bose<p>http://michaeladebose.collected.info/",1294242952

I was there for Christmas and tried to see if we could find a video on Netflix and couldn't find a single computer in the house that we could turn on and get the answer to that question in less than five minutes. I'm not making up that number, that's the time the fastest computer took to boot and present a working Firefox. 1.6GHz Pentium M may not be state of the art, but it's not <i>that</i> slow. It is of course because there's just so many things running in the background that the various virus scanners and backup product (or possibly products, I wasn't 100% clear) are just killing each other with IO contention. (If Windows doesn't already have it, it really needs an official ""scanning"" component in the OS that things can hook to so it can coordinate disk scanning and avoid thrash, that would help an enormous number of home users.)<p>I was nervous about removing the virus scanner in particular; he's savvy but he's a professional in another industry and doesn't have time to keep utterly up on every threat. Even if they aren't perfect they do sometimes work. So I offered to put on Ubuntu 10.10, which of course made the system usable again.<p>What stunned me was how slick the desktop really was. Integrated messaging, application menu is great, the application manager filters the apps from the incidental cruft like -dev packages, and just an indefinable feeling of polish everywhere. Still not quite the Windows level of polish but getting the very quickly and surpassing it in some areas. If you haven't played with stock Ubuntu in a while, I'd recommend checking 10.10 out just to see the current state-of-the-art. I was so impressed I put it on my own laptop. (Fortunately I've learned to keep 20-30GB just sort of lying around on the hard disk to make trying a new distro easy; I recommend it next time you find yourself partitioning.)",1294241736
