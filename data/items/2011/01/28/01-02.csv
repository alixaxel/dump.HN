When we started working together, we discovered that we had studied many of the same things - Godel's theorem, the halting problem, boolean logic, etc. Much of his overlapping stuff came from a subject called ""Theory of Computation"", whereas mine came from ""Formal Logic"" and ""Metamathematics"".<p>I think the idea of combining the fields is really brilliant. Nowadays I do a lot of programming (I founded a couple of businesses that are software-focussed), and would love to have had just this kind of educational background.",1296179993

2150480,comment,2148774,2149321,0,0,Smerity,,,"The same tactic was used by Google for Google App Engine - ""if it doesn't scale then we're not including it as a feature"". This is why so much of Google App Engine's documentation focuses on scaling [1]. Depending on who you ask this is genius or folly.<p>By forcing yourself into this tactic you end up having to consider all the scaling complexity in the prototyping stage before your app has even proven itself potentially successful. If your app becomes wildly popular then the combination of your early work and Google's behind the scene scaling means there are far less problems for you to worry about.<p>My major concern with this method is that people already focus far too much on premature optimizations before they even know where the real bottlenecks are in their application. If premature optimization leads to burn out or less features then it's a poison to our projects and should be avoided.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/scaling/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/scaling/overview.h...</a>",1296179973

It can be very tough at times, because my record is going to follow me for the rest of my life. I've changed completely and lived on the right side of the law for years but I continue to lose work from time to time due to my record.<p>In general, I don't bring it up to people but when I'm questioned about it, I always answer honestly. I can be trusted. A some of my friends have laughed at one time or another about stealing supplies from their company or how much they slack off. I will probably always be a better employee then them and they will probably always have a lot easier time finding jobs.<p>I was lucky enough to have my felony expunged and the rest of the incidents don't look good but are far easier to explain. I'd look into getting your felony expunged, here's some new info you may not have seen:<p>Gay v. Ariail (<a href=""http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26592"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?...</a>) in 2009 decided that a person could have their record expunged after 15 years pursuant to SC's Youthful Offender Act even if the person was not sentenced under YOA provisions. You mention being a teenager but over 18, so I'm assuming 18 or 19. A youthful offender is defined as someone between 17 and 25. It also needs to be 15 years before you can expunge the record (you've stated 16). The other part of the puzzle is that your conviction can not be a violent crime. You mention a felony theft, so hopefully that's just due to $ amount. SC's definition of violent crimes can be found at <a href=""http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c001.htm</a> (Section 16-1-60).<p>If you want to talk to someone (albeit younger) who's dealt with a lot of similar situations, let me know and we can find a way to communicate.<p>Best of luck either way. It sounds like you changed your life around and deserve to be trusted today.<p>Loophole / Possible Alternative: Quit, don't be a founder, be a well-compensated first employee or something similar.",1296179765

Even gambling markets and futures markets, which are both classes of prediction markets generally, are actually information markets even though they are ostensibly about goods or events.<p>I agree and disagree about your characterisation of technology. While yes, computers make authoritarianism more tractable, I don't think they can completely solve the calculation problem.<p>Suppose you use Leontiev input-output matrices to do your central planning. Matrix multiplication is an O(n^3) problem (I've been told by a mathematician that it can be done in n^2.75 with some tricks). If we take GDP growth as a proxy for the number of matrices required, it would need to be kept below a few percent or it would outstrip Moore's law in the long run. And that's ignoring the problem of populating the matrices in the first place.<p>FWIW, I host an economics blogger in Australia, Dr Nicholas Gruen, who has proposed to reduce market volatility by requiring blind clearances on a once-per-minute basis.",1296178609

Most ""gym rats"", as you say, seem to do nothing but bench press and curls. The bench press will, if not balanced by pulling, exaggerate the internal shoulder rotation.<p>Deadlifts, Rows, Pullups (or lat pulldowns if you must) -- all strengthen the back, and offset the shoulder rotation issues.<p>> Apparently squats and deadlifts will give you pretty extreme imbalances in the hip muscles (that's what the posture specialist and a deep-tissue masseur told me after working on me). You can fix that by stretching. I don't know if it matters, because it doesn't seem to affect me functionally or aesthetically.<p>This is also not true. Many gym trainees who actually attempt to squat will do it with a very narrow stance, and a very shallow depth. This makes it a quad dominant exercise, which could be a problem if they didn't also deadlift. However, a full depth back squat is a very balanced exercise, and will do wonders to increase hip mobility, not to mention strength. Deadlifts are the single best exercise for strengthening the posterior chain, which anyone who picks something heavy up off the ground needs.<p>Many people avoid squatting and deadlifting because they think they will hurt themselves, so they end up doing much worse things: leg press, smith machine squats, hack squats. Instead, learn the lifts properly (""Starting Strength"" by Mark Rippetoe is a fabulous book for this), and you will realize how valuable they are.",1296178055
