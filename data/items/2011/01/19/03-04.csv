2118491,comment,2118374,2118374,0,0,Umalu,,,"Government debt is a deferred tax on a country's citizens and their descendants. So it can be a real drag on future growth and, like credit cards, feels cost-free until the bill comes due. What's more insidious is that it is often run like a Ponzi scheme, in which current citizens benefit at the expense of their descendants.<p>But it is hard to say where the ""point of no return"" is for the U.S. Many countries have higher government debt as a percentage of GDP than the U.S. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_public_debt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_pub...</a>). Some of these high debt countries have reached their point of no return (Zimbabwe, Greece, Sudan) while others have not (Japan, Singapore). The U.S. is richer than all these countries and also has the advantage of a de facto worldwide dollar standard, so the U.S. is better able to withstand high debt loads than most countries. But then that's like saying the U.S. can afford to run up a huge credit card bill. The U.S. will feel richer than it is while charging, and the U.S. will be much poorer than it is once it pays it off.",1295408798

The sites will, for the most part have user signups, data storage (material uploaded) and will need to have a rich UI.<p>I could probably accelerate the development by using Flex or Silverlight but I really don't want to depend on plugins for the idea I currently want to build on. It's something that has to be accessible to everyone so PHP is my current option. Especially since it has such a large community surrounding it.<p>About myself as a developer. I'm not a noob developer. I know programming concepts. But I am completely new to web programming. I do know web architecture and AJAX conceptually but I've never touched PHP or java script in my life.<p>Oh I am also not developing a web app here.<p>I just want a few pointers to some good resources out there that could have me applying knowledge to building this site on the go.<p>It is critical that I will need to know \na) site design\nb) AJAX\nc) Knowledge on implementing a site in a scalable way so that it doesn't become a monolithic block at any time. It has to support agile development\nd) Security. The site will include payment options so the last thing I'd want would be SQL injections into a non encrypted database and everyones personal info getting stolen. (Stop 'gawking').I need to know how to secure the site on ALL fronts\ne) FTP services for the site.<p>So yea. That was a little too much to form into a search query and I don't want to spend time right at the start looking for material that might suit my needs.<p>So I was hoping the HN community could help me out here by pointing me in the right direction to a bunch of tutorials that help me get into the real development ASAP.<p>thanks :)<p>edit 1- first comment I got was to look at Ruby on Rails.

If you know stuff that few other people know, you can make more money. Once everybody figures out that's where the money is, the money isn't there any more.<p>Companies will only pay to train you after they have figured out they need something -- and with most companies this is about six months or more after they actually needed it. So they are in a bind and have to hire talent immediately. Folks who come in knowing what the company wants pick up the extra bucks.<p>The trick here is that you cannot rely on your company to train you. You have to figure out where the market is going, all on your little lonesome, and then do whatever you can to master the tech -- including writing programs for local charities if that's what it takes to get real-world experience -- before the market gets there. This is called investing in your future. It's the tech equivalent of going to night school.<p>I've been playing this game for a long time, and I've been the young buck making the big bucks (although I've never been the older complainer guy). After I worked my way through code monkey, architect, lead, and pm roles, I ended up training and watching software teams. So I've literally either participated in or worked with folks helping and evaluating hundreds of teams.<p>Best teams? If I had to generalize, I'd pick the old guys who keep picking up new tech. They know the business, they've been around long enough to play nice with others, and -- if they've stayed current this long -- genuinely are having a fun time with what they do. Plus they tend not to get stressed out by too much. Second best? A mixed team with mostly young guys with lots of current tech and a couple older guys to provide that gray-beard kind of balance.<p>But that's just a generalization, and like all generalizations it's very limited in its application. Each team is completely different. That's what makes this biz so much fun. Just like my generalizing, I think companies get too caught up in buzzwords. Smart guys with good attitudes can do a lot. I wouldn't go ape-shit with concern simply because buzz word X wasn't in somebody's job experience (or vice-versa) If you know you have to learn X for this next project and you're sitting around waiting on somebody else to come and teach it to you? That's just a little bit too passive for my tastes.<p>I hate to sound like such a hard-ass (well maybe not really) but this is a very simple business that hasn't changed much in several decades. The pace might have changed, sure, and the tech is all new, but the mechanics of being a good project member, what makes a good project, and how people get paid and such are all the same as they were in 1980 or something.
