It turns out very few people at the time were interested; they didn't want meta-codecs, they wanted the codecs themselves. A particularly abysmal demo of Stormbringer at Apple finally drove that point home (in addition to the fact that Apple was uninterested in Stormbringer, which needed more work to be practically useful, our demo laptop decided to overheat and break down in the middle of our pitch to the Quicktime group). That took our sense of direction away for a while; for most of 1998, no one worked on anything related to Ogg.<p>Then in the fall, Fraunhofer decided to start cracking down on free encoder implementations of mp3. That worried me. It also seemed like things were only likely to get worse; the trend was clearly for companies to start ""cashing in"" on the Net any way possible, often involving the basic technology itself, and it looked like digital audio would be no different. In 1998 this sense of foreboding was mostly a vague suspicion, but the trend strengthened and clarified over time. That gave me a clear direction to begin Vorbis; I knew what the world was going to need in a codec and soon.</i>",1295432734

You may find other approaches attractive as well. For example Zed Shaw's Tir is making an webapp flow looking procedural by smart using coroutines underneath. While the idea was invented before, I like his implementation; i didn't yet hack anything serious in it though.<p>If you like evented style, Nitrogen is also very interesting. It allows you to program callbacks which jump from server to client and back in a clean way, IMO. That'll work for you if you can swallow Erlang syntax of course. I'd say this product is really production ready, btw.",1295431639
