(tasty theme and wpreviewsite plugin), personally I still think it is the way to go.<p>But anyone in here had experience about promoting/marketing the premium theme and plugin?<p>Correct me if I was wrong, in general, these premium themes doesn't seem hard to code, some plugins, for example, gravity forms, takes time to build but still, not the rocket science.\nso i guess the problem is down to how to promote, do marketing, and sell these theme/plugins, any ideas suggestions?<p>2. freelancing Wordpress theme development<p>Quite often I am asked about quoting projects for wordpress theming dev work, , mainly about convert the design into wordpress theme.<p>But at least 8 out of 10 quote request I have, the client doesn't have very clear idea about what they want to have or the scope of the project doesn't have very clear cut.<p>So  things bite me are:<p>* submitting quote takes my time, and I am not able to charge the time for quoting projects so I dont want to invest hours before I can secure the project. How do you guys handle this?<p>* for the vague project, if I put  defensive ballpark (i.e., good buffer for the margin), the client could go away. but if I ask too much details, the client could go away either and as I said,  I dont want to invest hours before I can secure the project.<p>* communications are expensive, i.e., if i have to confirm many details with the client during the project so not good profit in the end.<p>small things, for example, some clients don't have good knowledge of wordpress,  it could take me another 20-30 mins to help them  to setup. Do you guys charge for this kinda of tasks?<p>So for freelancing part, I am looking for the good process to streamline the job.
