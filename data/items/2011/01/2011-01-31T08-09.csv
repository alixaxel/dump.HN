  A high level of confidence in your own ideas and ability to execute

Neither did <i>No Country</i>. In other words the Coens have the discipline to subordinate their cleverness to the needs of the genre and the story.

He summarized that an MBA is a professional degree, not an academic degree.  As such, the value from an MBA depends on who your classmates are, not what your profs/textbooks say.  He said that it's often the prof actually learning from the students.  They can discuss case studies and business issues in class, and each student can add something special to the discussion.  ""Well, we experienced this exact thing back in our 2004 expansion push, and these were the issues that we encountered and how we dealt with them.""  ""That's funny, we experienced something similar in 2005, but it was in Japan, and dang, we had a totally different set of experiences, this is what we had to do, but we failed at this and that in the attempt.  These were our results from the whole thing.""<p>Joe Schmoe with no real experience can try to mumble something that he learned back during his Marketing 303 class, but nobody will care.  If the university is worth anything, Joe Schmoe would not be accepted in the first place.<p>So the guy emphasized to me that the real value from an MBA is not the fancy 3 letters, nor the fancy job prospects, though those are all nice bonuses.  He emphasized that the real value was the professional network that would be accumulated (the better the school, the better the network as a general rule), and correspondingly, the wealth of information and future opportunities that could be gathered from that professional network.<p>So it sounds very similar to a comment someone made about why they found university to be valuable in that other thread about whether to attend university.<p>On the flip side, I knew a director of marketing from when I worked in telco.  He had an MBA from Phoenix University online.  His class included a hotel clerk, for reference in terms of their student quality.  But he wasn't expecting anything out of it.  He came from an engineering background and had gradually transitioned into sales and marketing.  But he found as he moved up the chain in sales and marketing, he lacked some of the fundamental aspects of business that many of his peers seemed to possess (simple things, like even vocabulary; what the heck does managerial accounting mean, and how does it differ from regular accounting?).  So he enrolled into Phoenix just so that he could talk shop properly with his peers.  He's a lifer at that telco, a rising star, so getting an MBA from Harvard wouldn't help him achieve his goals any better than Phoenix would.  His goals were just to keep growing inside the company, not seek a high-profile exec position somewhere else; Phoenix provided him the tools he needed to do exactly what he wanted.<p>So in the end, it depends on what you're looking for.",1296462397

    - Is my idea profitable?

If you are truly passoinate about your idea, this won't be a big obstacle.<p>Almost all of the people that you could pay to work on your idea are in the business of getting paid by clients to write programs, not in the business of implementing business ideas themselves.  They don't have the investment in your idea to work the nights and weekends for free that it would take to turn your idea into a business.  That means that you can probably trust them.  However it also means that they aren't as committed to implementing your vision as you need them to be.<p>If you teach yourself to program, you can make sure that your vision is implemented correctly.  I also guarantee that your idea will be improved by the process of writing the code yourself.<p>The reason I can say this with such confidence is that six years ago I had an idea.  I took some money and found some developers and paid them to implement the vision.  They happily took my money, but kept running into obstacles and telling me, ""It can't be done.""  Each time they did I'd dig into the work that they'd already done and do a ton of research and come back a week later and say, ""I think you can do it this way.""  They'd get back to work and then after a while they'd come to me again and say, ""It can't be done.""  Unfortunately I ran out of money before anything useful came out of this process.<p>However, I was still passionate about my idea.  I assumed that the problem was that I had the wrong developers.  So I wrote everything I knew about my idea down in a PowerPoint presentation and showed it to some friends and they gave me more money.  So I founds some other developers and quickly reestablished the same pattern.  At this point I was used to it.  They'd say, ""It can't be done"" and I'd find a way to move the process forward.  This time I had enough money to get a crude prototype out of the process.  Unfortunately, when I showed it to people, they didn't like it.  It was an implementation of my idea and solved a problem, but it was awkward and slow and largely unusable.  I was out of money again and didn't have anything more to show for it.<p>However, I was still passionate about my idea.  About 18 months ago I decided that I was going to teach myself to program so that I could implement my idea on my own.  I'd learned BASIC as a kid and took a few programming classing in college, but it wasn't my major and I'd never attempted anything on this scale before.  It has taken a lot of time and hard work, but I am closer to the achieving my vision than ever, and more importantly, my idea has been dramatically improved by the process of writing it myself.",1296461984

When the internet and the web became popular the French lagged behind because what they had was good enough to cause a lot of them to stick to what they had (a French system for the French available everywhere versus a system that was mostly geared towards the English language users). For the rest of Europe there was no such alternative (Local variations did exist but were not as successful and widely adopted as minitel was in France).<p>Finally, due to labor legislation France has one of the worst environments to do start-ups in.<p>Taken together that should explain some (but probably not all) of the reason why France with the exception of Paris is a little dark on that map compared to the rest of Europe.<p>One HN'er that I know lives in the South of France actually commutes to London for work, that's how anemic the tech scene in France outside of 'la banlieue' is (that's French for 'the suburbs' which they use to refer to suburbs in general but specifically to those surrounding Paris, inside that border is where most of the French tech scene is located).<p>Possibly someone from France can jump in here and give some more background and/or correct me if I'm wrong.",1296461790

And they would <i>call you up</i> and give you <i>bad advice</i> to maximize their churn in your account and, hence, their commissions?)<p>I loved Prosper (crowdsourced P2P loans), which was mentioned.  However, the primary barrier to Prosper's success has not been regulation (a somewhat surprising statement, considering they were shut down for securities laws violations for the better part of a year).  The primary barrier to Prosper's success is that their product is strictly inferior to credit cards for anyone who can get a credit card, which means you have an adverse selection problem for borrowers -- the only people who apply have either maxxed their cards or would never be given one in the first place.  As a result lender returns are terrible -- many lose principal, and a huge majority underperform <i>substantially risk-free investments</i> like T-bills or CDs.<p>I'd love to see an innovative option for consumer or small business loans, but it has to compete with this deal: up to $15k delivered instantly (or in 2~4 days), 4% transaction fee, 1% interest for 12 months followed by ~15% interest for life.
