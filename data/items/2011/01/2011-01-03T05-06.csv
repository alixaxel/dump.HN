2062276,comment,2060783,2060783,0,0,parasubvert,,,"basic summary (I'm paraphrasing)<p>- the basic problem with most ""futurism"" is that it's additive.  what's more interesting, and what Taleb is trying to do, is look at what no longer belongs:  what will be removed, or what is fragile<p>- First thing that will be gone is the US Federal Reserve [and I presume he's implying most central banks].  It's very error prone, very centralized, and thus fragile.  It depends on a central figurehead (the chairman, i.e. Bernanke or Greenspan).  If they make a human error, that will percolate through the global system.   We need more financial system redundancy, thus there will likely be currencies independent of government; we have lost faith in technocrats running our affairs.<p>- The nation state will be going away, with power reverting back to ""statelings"" and the city state.  It's Abu Dhabi vs. a large country like Saudi Arabia.  The nation state is very artificial, based on the French romantic ideal in the 19th century of the nation state, but went bankrupt because this lead to more aggressiveness and wars.   It's unstable in the current world because we've become too interconnected; when some parts of the world have the authority of a nation state they can't ""do"" anything other than fatten government officials.<p>- Mandelbrot discovered a law regarding life expectancy of technologies, similar to how actuaries in life insurance companies can guestimate a person's ""conditional life expectancy"".   A technology that is 25 years old is likely to stay around for another 25 years.   The implication is that most of today's technologies will fail, maybe a few today will survive, whether they make sense or not.   The bicycle will be there, the car will be there, the wall-to-wall bookshelf will still be there (the book is 500 years old). These things are very robust in the face of change. Something like an Amazon Kindle is pretty fragile.   Computers from 10 or 20 years ago have files that are very hard, if not impossible to retrieve - this is an illustration of the instability of technology.    Whereas a technology (like a paper book) that lasts 500 years likely has some properties that we don't quite understand; it fits our minds or our genetic makeup in a special way.<p>- Corporations won't survive; artisans tend to survive.   Corps follow the stock market and thus will take the BP approach of high-risk/high-reward, but this will greatly expose them to black swans.   The artisan model, like I'm wearing shoes from a French company that has been making shoes forever, companies that aren't listed on the stock market, and thus are not motivated by it, will tend to survive.<p>- Science has always been about revolutions, it has never been incremental in its progress.  Having said this, things have been depleted and we are running into some fundamental limits in some domains more than we realize [he doesn't really go beyond this]<p>- Black Swans will be a more common species of event, or more consequential, because the world is more connected, more efficient, and thus will have massive pockets of instability.  Unless we realize this & move to more robust forms of organization:  artisan, city-states, decentralized, as he prefers, the world is going to get more and more exposed at scale to unpredictable events.",1294034209

Though, I think that quantifying damages of a non-distributed copy written work might not be very easy in court, but lawyers are a crafty bunch.  It seems like there's a trend to remarket old copywritten material where there's a market for it, especially with new cheap distribution models you see like with Steam or Amazon's Ebook store, for example.  This could work to reduce the number of abandoned works and push them back into availability to the general public.",1294034188

I calculate that a 160 pound man would lose about 250 calories to gut microbes each day if he were consuming sufficient protein, fat, and minerals to sustain efficient gut microbe multiplication activity. A diet poor in supportive nutrition would curtail gut microbe activity resulting in more efficient energy absorption into the bloodstream. That is, a higher proportion of the energy consumed would be available for metabolic needs and fat storage. In my own experience, if I consume extra calories, I just have more bowel movements and don't gain any weight unless the extra calories are carbohydrate.",1294033897

It is a legal status specifically granted by the IRS after a review.<p>Income raised prior to receiving the exemption is almost always treated as income earned through non-exempt (i.e., for-profit) activities.  There are exceptions, of course, but you need to consult a tax lawyer (specializing in non-profit/charitable tax law) to figure out if you qualify for those exceptions. There are very important reasons behind this (including, but not limited to, the deductibility of transactions).<p>State tax law may be more permissive, but that only affects your state tax status.  Federal tax law governs your federal tax status.  It may be possible to be a non-profit for state taxation but a for-profit for federal taxation.<p>Also, to address inaccuracies in your blog post:
1) There are no age restrictions in any state on incorporation.  However, few businesses will enter into contracts with minors unless their parents guarantee the contracts because minors have very special rights under American contract law.<p>2) There is no need to incorporate a solo operation.  Incorporation is intended to simplify accounting for collaborative efforts.  Individuals can simply register a DBA (if they're making up a ""company"" name"").  In your case, incorporating is proper: you claim to be founding a charitable organization, so incorporation is a necessary step to receiving tax-exempt status.<p>3) It's humorous to see that you believe that a non-profit only needs to file 2 forms, online, once a year. Those two forms are just the start.  There's a lot more paperwork involved.<p>You need to consult a lawyer, immediately, because you may receive a call from the IRS in the near future.",1294032972

If Facebook is like Microsoft in that it can maintain a high profit margin due to continuing to successfully exclude any competitors from its market, just as it has so far (in Microsoft's case, through a combination of government-granted monopolies, criminality, and consistently not fucking up; in Facebook's case, perhaps not) then it could have profits like that with as little as $6B/year or so of revenue.  Presumably, within a couple of years, the majority of the internet's users will be Facebook users, which is something like two or three billion people.<p>Is it reasonable to expect Facebook to extract US$2 to US$3 per year per user?  It's hard for me to imagine how they could fail to extract several times that.  If nothing else, the blackmail value of the data they already have on hand ought to be larger than that.  (""Upgrade to Facebook Premium today in order to have the option to keep your past private messages from being visible to all your Facebook friends!""

As a layperson when it comes to automobile engineering, I only care about whether or not my Toyota works.  But as a customer who relies on its safety, I assure you I care a great deal about whether or not it is well architected.  As a layperson when it comes to structural engineering, I only care that my house stays up.  But it better be well architected.<p>Don't mistake a customer's lack of caring about C# vs Java with them not giving a crap about whether or not your application will suddenly spew their credit card numbers to the world due to a slipshod security model.  I don't care what approach Toyota took to form my transmission, but I would sue Toyota if my transmission suddenly broke and it turned out they'd put it together in a sloppy fashion.<p>Like all things, a customer's real care is based on a continuum.  I don't care particularly if Reddit or Twitter goes down, but I care a great deal if Bank of America suddenly lowers my balance due to a rounding error.<p>Of course you can get overwhelmed by architectural possibilities.  Assess your customers' expectations of your uptime, overall quality, etc.  Assess your customers' expectations of your ability to release new features quickly.  Assess projected scaling issues.  Avoid buzzwords.  Adjust accordingly.  A foolish building architect could easily spend a year figuring out the ideal materials, but a competent one will still get the building done safely, on time and on budget.
