2125231,comment,2124592,2124592,0,0,thinkwise,,,"Group buying has been around for eons starting in China known as tuangou. Although there are lots of new competitors in the space, there is clearly a great deal of pent up demand from local businesses in the marketplace. I doubt that this form of consumer purchasing will die anytime soon.<p>One should ask themselves why there is so much pent up demand for group buying in the marketplace?<p>Some critics focus on poor efficacy rates for repeat business from Groupon customers.  Others will claim that it is a fad.  Still others will argue that the business running a Groupon campaign will not make money from the deal.<p>But what is the alternative?<p>The alternative for most businesses is to purchase ads in local print newspapers, create print flyers, and other more traditional means of marketing, which all require upfront costs from the local business.  Most small businesses do not use online SEM.<p>The great advantage with Groupon is there are no upfront costs. (1) Businesses get thousands of impressions from the email marketing campaigns showcasing their deal.  (2) If a deal gets executed the business gets guaranteed foot traffic and revenue from customers, which is trackable. (3) There is the potential to acquire a percentage of new customers as repeat customers.  All of this with no upfront costs.<p>The reason I am very optimistic on the continued growth of this model of purchasing is that the market is validating it.  You can see this from the explosive revenue growth numbers of group buying companies.  And businesses recognize that it is much more cost effective and measurable to launch a Groupon than invest in the alternative.<p>So the analysis should not be what is the best or perfect solution for local businesses to acquire customers, but what is a marginally better alternative for customer acquisition.  Group buying is.<p>For large businesses, I see a similar value. I would make an educated guess that Gap and Amazon spend a great deal of money on customer acquisition. Thus the group buying economics probably work in their favor. I would have a hard time believing that they lost money on their Groupon campaigns.  Even if they broke even, it is a campaign that successfully drove millions of paying customers to their site, broke major headlines, and was great PR for both companies.  Just because you are a big company doesn't mean that you do not appreciate this kind of attention.<p>We are witnessing the nascent stages in the evolution of group buying.  Larger companies like Groupon and LivingSocial will build an incredible amount of data to mine for new initiatives like determining their customers' preferences and targeting them for secondary purchases.  This is just the beginning.",1295557158

At any time, we can get a sit down with the partners to bounce ideas off of or just chat and hear about their experiences.<p>And they're completely honest about their opinions. I remember when we first joined with our original idea (we pivoted twice), Jim flat out said I'm not a big fan of your idea, but I know you guys will succeed somewhere down the line, and that's why I wanted you guys here. And 4 months + 2 pivots later, he's excited about what we're working on now and the potential it has.<p>One of the best parts was if we ever needed advice around a particular topic: SEO, scaling, customer acquisition, sales, PR - one of the partners would introduce us to a founder who knows everything about it. The best way to leverage advisors and learn from them.<p>The i/o space is also amazing. I love the fact that it's like a second home. Whenever we're in the city we drop by to catch up with everyone there. And even after the program, everyone still hangs out there.<p>I think all of the incubators bring a lot of value to a start-up.

Bill had a CS degree from BC, but he wasn't a talented web developer or anything like that. His background was helpful, though, since it was good to have least some technical knowledge before starting the company; we weren't operating completely in the dark. I had zero technical background. You could probably get to Bill's pre-WePay level with a bunch of books, long conversations with your programmer friends (you can make some of these friends online - try hacker news), and persistence.<p>><p>> If you are ""relentlessly resourceful"" you can find a way to build what you need to build (usually by finding the right person and convincing them that you and your idea are worth their time).

Environmental regulations, taxes, tort law, and various other similar regulations, not to mention the natural pressure that the best interest of society tends to be somewhat compatible with profit, all influence companies to choose the option that is best for society as a whole most of the time.

2125100,comment,2123205,2123804,0,0,morrow,,,"I agree with you, but I think the ""overpriced"" label still has real meaning for the high-margin products you mentioned.  A company's ability to charge higher margins can be for several reasons, whether they be legitimate competitive advantages: first to market, superior products, better marketing, better image, vertical-integration, etc. Or less legitimate/illegitimate: monopolies, oligopolies, collusion, anti-competitive practices, underpaid labor, etc.<p>For SMS in particular, the only way they get away with charging so much is consumers don't have much choice in the matter, as all the major US carriers charge for SMS, and the cost is minimal to them for the reasons described in the link.  Their justification for doing so then seems to fall on the less legitimate side of the scale.  For Coke, since their value is based in some part on their recipe, you could argue their justification for their margins is, at least in part, due to the exclusivity and superiority of the product, rather simply relying on collusion or being a member of an oligopoly.<p>This isn't to say that companies shouldn't charge whatever the market will pay, but charging high margins for the wrong reasons hurts the brand's image, erodes customer loyalty, and most importantly means they probably aren't innovating -- leading to more problems down the road.  Apple's strategy vs. Microsoft's, $17 CD sales vs. $1 digital downloads, and iphone users lamenting being stuck on ATT (and possibly now switching to verizon) are all examples of this having an effect.<p>That said, I doubt any startups are capable of or willing to rely on illegitimate methods to maintain high margins, I just wanted to argue that there can be negative consequences for existing companies who choose to do so without legitimate justification.",1295554553

Main idea: What is interesting for you is what your friends find interesting. I made a functional prototype hacked together in php+mysql with ugly html+css. But it works which is why I guess now would be a ""launch early"" moment. Or atleast show to a bunch of people for feedback :-)<p>On the site your main source of links is from people you add as your friends or people you subscribe to. People you subscribe to provide you with links by posting them. Friends provide you with links both by posting them but also by reading other peoples links. By reading them they recommend them to you. If you want to change the type of content you are getting then you have to change your subscriptions or friends. This way the normal karma driven paradigm is changed to a more action based paradigm. Your actions can have the effect of people subscribing or unsubscribing you.<p>I have a number of problems with my site, which I would like advice on:<p>- I have no idea how to drive traffic to my site. The site doesn't really work without having a critical mass of people using it, so I have to bootstrap content into it somehow. I also have to get people to visit it somehow. I thought about reddit's self-served ads as a cheap way to present it to users, but I'm not sure if I'd hit the target audience - whomever they might be.<p>- ""Prompted by login-form"". The concept only really works if users make profile on the site and invest some effort in setting it up with friends. I think it's a serious flaw that there is no readily accessible non-authed part of the site, but how do I fix it? Auto-generate a user to new visitors and link them to some default subscriptions?<p>- Lack of business plan. No idea how to break even, let alone earn money on the site.<p>Some background as to why I made it: In the fall (2010) Reddit was invaded by Digg users. Reddit.com won the Digg-Reddit ""war"", but in my opinion the old Reddit-userbase lost, as the site was somewhat diluted. A lot more pics on the frontpage, and less serious articles. My initial thought was to design a site that could withstand a large influx of new users without changing the experience for existing users. If the existing users mainly discussed tech news and there suddenly was a large influx of lolcat loving people then the original users should still mainly see tech news and the new people lolcats. Whatmyfriendsread.com was the result.",1295554327
