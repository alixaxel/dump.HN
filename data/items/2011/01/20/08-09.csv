2123107,comment,2122521,2122972,0,0,innernette,,,"There are two big concerns with a state's ability to tax: the due process clause and the ""dormant"" commerce clause[0]. Quill Corp v. North Dakota[1] is the most recent SCOTUS case on point, and it really confused more issues than it settled.<p>The short, minimally accurate version goes like this: The analysis under the due process clause and the commerce clause looks very similar—they both deal with fairness and the connection (""nexus"") the taxpayer has to the state. There is older precedent, Bellas Hess, that required a physical presence for nexus under both the due process and commerce clause. In the 67 years after Bellas Hess, the due process doctrine changed a lot, so courts around the country began to wonder if Bellas Hess was still relevant. North Dakota jumped the gun, and tried to overrule Bellas Hess for the Supreme Court. The Court was <i>not</i> pleased. So Quill holds that the nexus requirement is different under the due process and commerce clause. Due process does not <i>require</i> physical presence, but the Bellas Hess physical presence test is still the law under the commerce clause.<p>There are some state court decisions applying Quill every which way.<p>Why does this all matter? The due process limit is unavoidable, by the courts, the federal government, and the states.<p>The commerce clause, on the other hand, is a limit on states, but it is within congress's powers to redraw. For example, Congress clarified the state's power to tax income in P.L. 86-272.<p>I think states are losing revenue that is rightly theirs. Amazon has basically built a business model around avoiding sales tax. I like buying cheap stuffs on Amazon as much as anyone, but I also like having state-funded universities, decent roads, and the rest of the goods that sales/use taxes fund. States shouldn't have to suffer because so much of their economy is moving online. As long as states mind the ruptured, tangled mess left of Quill, and follow any rules thrown down by congress, I think states can get theirs without any constitutional problems.<p>[0] The dormant commerce clause is like the shadow of Article 1, Section 8. Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, so even where Congress has yet to regulate (such as use tax land), states are still prohibited from certain actions.

They are not revelations of some truth about the nature of intelligent life in the Universe (or even our galaxy), they are merely reflections of our utter ignorance of the subject.<p>Where do these figures come from? For fully 5 out of the 7 parameters to the Drake equation we have extraordinarily limited data. How common are Earth-like planets? Call back in about 5-10 years when we'll have some solid data from the Kepler mission. How common is life on Earth-like planets? Who knows? We aren't even close to being able to get solid figures on that. If we can find life on Mars or rule life out of ever having existed there then we'll have a teeny tiny bit of data. But even then such an estimate will be biased by the anthropic principle and at best only accurate to perhaps a single order of magnitude (if that). Even then that leaves half of the parameters as wild ass guesses.<p>Not to mention that the parameters aren't independent. If we find life on Mars existed or still exists that would make f-sub-l higher, but it would probably make f-sub-i correspondingly lower.<p>Worse yet, the very premise of the Drake equation is at odds with the premise behind the Fermi paradox. If even a single, slow colonizing intelligent civilization ever existed in our galaxy it would make the number of possible communicative worlds differ by perhaps even 6 or 9 <i>orders of magnitude</i>.<p>The exercise is only worthwhile when it is not taken seriously, which is a bit of a catch-22.",1295512701

It does seem that some of them have a problem with me.<p>My experience with ""my own people"" is somewhat colorful. In an attempt to have me keep more of my heritage, my folks saw fit to send me to Chinese school when I was younger. As one of the more westernized kids there we were subject to ridicule, condescension, and outright hostility - from teachers <i>and</i> students alike. It was the most emotionally fucked up thing I've experienced to-date, and that's after going through the wringer of shitty/abusive college profs and evil exes. Where I grew up, whites picking on Asians was rare, and certainly never systemic. Yet I found myself at the butt end of racism, from my own kind, on a regular basis. I've been through some tough shit, but this remains the only time in my life where I've ever contemplated suicide. It is also the only time of my life where I'd considered myself truly bullied.<p>And more galling, the teachers were complicit, encouraging, and sometimes even <i>participatory</i> in this sort of thing.<p>It's erased <i>any</i> sense of racial solidarity I ever had. Prior to that point I used to actually believe that a Chinese might look out for another Chinese - after all, we were all in another country, in the same rickety immigrant boat. So much for that.<p>Those years have basically soured my ability to approach ""Asian Asians"" with anything better than a vague distrust. I do not treat Asian-Asians with hostility, but I certainly cannot readily welcome them into my circles as I can anyone else.<p>FWIW, I'm a 1st-gen. I was born and raised in Asia, and have every claim to my heritage as any other Asian on this continent. Yet, I've been welcomed in every single community I've ever approached except my own.<p>There's a silver lining though - after I got myself the hell out of that place, I diversified my social circles greatly and became more or less color-blind. I no longer hung out with the ""other Asians"" - even the westernized ones. I'm happy to say that my social circles span the entire racial spectrum in a way that none of the more traditional Asians I know have done.<p>[edit] Curious note: I have a lot of very Asian-Asian Korean and Japanese friends, and we have no trouble getting along. So it's not the <i>Asian-ness</i> that seems to be the issue. If I had to take a wild poke at it, I'd say it's because there's not the constant insinuation that I'm a traitor to all Chinese-kind for daring to embrace Western culture. <i>shrug</i>",1295512315
