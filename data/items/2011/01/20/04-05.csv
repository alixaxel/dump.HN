ISTR that at least at one point you could buy cars with IR HUDs, though I don't recall reading anything about that in a while; I don't know if that's because they don't really work or because they're just boringly common by now on cars I can't afford.<p>Also, assuming a very good computer driver, a computer driver will have a much better sense of when they are in trouble. They might refuse to drive fast in a low-visibility situation. I see a world in which computers ""want"" to drive 55 in areas currently labelled 25 (though of course they will honor the speed limit) and in some cases will insist on driving 25 through areas labelled 55 that turn out to be something like forest too dense to see through that may be harboring deer or something, or other situations in which a human would blithely speed through but the computer is ""scared"". Arguably correctly.<p>And per my other message, when the computers are tweaked to ignore that and then hit a deer, lawsuits.<p>It's gonna be interesting times.",1295499538

If computer drivers are safer under some circumstances, lawsuits will be filed about how the computer <i>wasn't</i> driving the car.<p>My father works in the car industry. When I was young (though I heard about this later so the memory is fresher than that), he was called as an industry witness in a lawsuit in which his company was being sued for <i>not</i> putting antilock brakes on this particular car, ""resulting"" (for some value thereof) in a fatal accident. At the time of the accident, antilock brakes were actually an option on the car... an $X,000 option in mid-1980s money. The idea of putting antilock brakes on all the cars was an economic absurdity.<p>The car company lost.<p>I know the cynical answer is to say computer will face major legal barriers but I'm not sure it's that simple. One can look at the lawsuit-happy USA and readily see a world in which licensing restrictions are actually significantly tightened and it becomes <i>illegal</i> to drive a car under most circumstances using the exact same logic. Conclusion? Beats me.",1295499358

I believe someone has ported similar features to Asterisk.<p>Bell Atlantic (Verizon now) years ago had something very similar with ContactLine.  You had 99 preprogrammed 'call plans'.  1-9 would forward through with various options, 10-19 would forward with screening, in the 30s you could check in and it would forward the call to the location where you were, with a greeting to call the person.  60-69 call plans would page you, allow you to get to a phone, and it would bridge the call.  I believe produced by Octel, later purchased by AT&T, spun off into Avaya.  Back in the late 80s, made the mobile phone incredibly powerful - back when phones had 3 watts, not the .6 watts we have today.  :)<p>Vonage has Simulring which has some of the features that Google Voice has.<p>However, to the phone companies, any solution here is a cost center, not a profit center (except ContactLine which was $19.95/month).

NP hard is a class of problems such that every problem in NP can be reduced to any problem in NP hard. Meaning if P=NP then every problem in NP(including the NP complete problems) can be solved in polynomial time; all it takes is one algorithm that solves an NP complete problem in polynomial time (note that this does not show that P=NP hard, a much stronger claim).",1295498612

Washington state changed how they require sales tax a couple years ago and now charges sales tax based on where you _ship_ the end product. Out-of-state is zero as in every other state, but in-state is where it gets miserable. The table the department of revenue publishes has something like 150000 rows where, to get an accurate sales tax jurisdiction code and rate, you have to look up by the full Zip+4.

It's one thing to say that businesses have to collect sales taxes for the state the product is shipped to but what about local sales taxes?  In Illinois the state gets 5% but in downtown Chicago the total rate goes up to 11.5%  That's still a significant difference and one could argue that Chicago/Cook County are still getting ripped off.  If companies pay all of the local taxes then life get complicated quickly, especially for a larger company like Amazon.  However I'm certain that someone would come out with a fairly automatic solution for this problem so I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea.<p>Another option is to charge the tax based on where the company is based, or better yet tax based on the district that the warehouse or store that the item is shipped from is located.  I.E. if you buy something from amazon.com and they ship it from their warehouse in Madison WI (not sure if there is one there, just an example) then your purchase is taxed as if you drove to Madison and bought it.  This is still relatively complicated but I believe that it is the best solution, especially since it's closest to what would happen if you drove to a store.
