Also, their initial target market -- ""group and event organizers"" -- are typically not the <i>individual consumers</i> he paints them as.  Most of these folks will be organizing stuff for their kid's baseball team or doing something church-related or some such.  In other words, they are basically charitable organizations, but often of the sort that has little to no funding.  For an organization like that, coming up with $5/mo is a huge challenge.<p>And, yes, these types of people are frequently a pain in the ass to deal with:  They typically don't have training for what they are doing, they are doing it ""for the greater good"" with little or no personal benefit (or vastly underestimating what they are getting out of it), they get no respect for the work they do and they often have a sense of entitlement based on the idea that they are giving their time and energy away for free so it is only ""right"" that other folks kick in something for free to help them out.  If you have a business, they may well see you as a wealthy capitalist pig who is basically obligated to do some do-gooding to save your worthless greedy soul.<p>Trying to induce folks to pay a small fee when they don't have any money to give you is the thing that is ""not a business model"".

The other alternative is that it's much more nuanced than ""of course"" allows, you just haven't understood the debate.<p>> The only reason people are complaining is that their iPhones have H.264 hardware acceleration<p>No, people are complaining for many other valid reasons. Like: the digital video world runs on H.264, it has deep, complicated, expensive internal toolchains to support it, legacy archives encoded in it, basically entire businesses built around it. The video production world is far larger and more complex than you're picturing it. A ""script"" isn't nearly enough to do what you're talking about; suggesting you just need to point ffmpeg at a hard drive of stuff has dramatically underestimated the scale of what's involved.<p>Or, reasons like: they want the video tag to succeed, and this decision essentially entrenches Flash for another five years at least.<p>In an h.264 world the video tag had the combined support of three major desktop browsers, iOS, Android, a tonne of shipping mobile and embedded hardware, a Flash fallback and crucially it was an easy implementation for all the video content producers, with no re-encoding required. That's plenty enough to give it a good beachhead and momentum away from all Flash all the time.<p>In a WebM world, you have the support of Firefox, Opera and Chrome. No shipping mobile support. No shipping embedded support. No shipping Flash implementation. No video producer support. No video toolchain support.

I was looking more for the longer term investment: work, take the note and convert it to equity at a low dollar/share, and hope they get bought out. I guess I feel fairness would be double the equity that was originally to be given, whether thats with a change to the firs note, or the creation of a second note. Problem is they don't seem to be willing to compromise and allowing me to convert my note at a lower rate than $2/share, since 3.5 months ago shares were $0.74. I just find it hard to believe the company is worth $2M. I've asked to meet in the middle at $1.37/share, but not sure that'll fly either. And if it doesn't, it seems my efforts are futile.

2106273,comment,2100966,2103278,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"The example you gave is a degenerate case that isn't really representative of the real world situation.  Making x to be an odd multiple of pi in your example is an excessive constraint on the problem.  Real world problems requiring creativity exist in highly multidimensional spaces and their fitness functions often exhibit fractal behavior.<p>For example, let P be the set of all English-language poems of N lines, where each line is a semantically and syntactically valid expression in English and N>0.  P is an incredibly huge set.  We want to find solutions of high aesthetic fitness on the set P.  Applying a few arbitrary constraints reduces the size of the search space but has little effect on our ability to find solutions with high aesthetic fitness.  For example, we could arbitrarily restrict our search to the space of English poems with N=14, 10 syllables per line, an alternating pattern of an unstressed and stressed syllables in each line (iambic pentameter), and a rhyme pattern a-b-a-b-c-d-c-d-e-f-e-f-g-g in the terminal words of each lines.  We've now drastically reduced the size of the search space such that we are now searching only the space of valid Shakespearean sonnets.  However, even with our arbitrary constraints in place, we're still solving a highly unconstrained optimization problem and the arbitrary constraints we applied don't prevent us from finding solutions of high fitness.<p>We could say that the bumpiness of the fitness function is fractal -- the shape of the fitness function on an arbitrary subspace resembles the shape of the fitness function taken over the whole space, providing that the subspace is itself ""large"" in some sense.  The point is that there's nothing special about the arbitrary constraints we imposed.  We could instead choose to work in the space where N=16, the number of words per line is between 4 and 7, the first four lines are all questions, and the last line is constructed in the form of a direct object followed by a subject and a verb and a repetition of the direct object (e.g. ""Yoda, you seek Yoda"").  There are still many aesthetic and unaesthetic solutions in this space, perhaps there are even some solutions with greater fitness than any of the 154 solutions that Shakespeare discovered with his set of arbitrary constraints.",1295058540

I'm not sure entrepreneurs would come out ahead, but you're far more likely to catch the Herokus and Reddits and less likely to catch the folks who start a restaurant or a RoR CRUDscreen with no plan for monetization.",1295058535

2106228,comment,2105661,2105973,0,0,jerf,,,"""When he showed that user-definable, verifiably associative combination operators can provide magnificent opportunities for automatic parallelization...""<p>To the extent that I have a programming style, I find myself increasingly thinking of it as Primitive-Oriented Programming. If you want your final program to have some desirable property, be it correctness, scaling, parallelizability, or even more complicated things like one I work on where the interface must have the property ""able to be remoted across this certain protocol for various reasons"", the best way to achieve that in general is to create primitives with this property, create ways to combine them that maintain the property, and build up from there.<p>It's very hard right now, because 1. modern machines and programming languages make it hard to create these properties in the first place, so many corner cases to cover because nobody pays any attention to this idea except by accident 2. modern languages tend to make it borderline impossible to verify that properties are being maintained (think things like type-level verification) and it's so easy to violate them that you <i>need</i> this help 3. if you're programming in a team environment the concept that there are certain properties that should be maintained and if you violate them things won't work is extremely foreign to pretty much everybody so in summation 4. you pretty much have no support for this from any angle, the way you can get languages that support and/or mandate OO or FP.<p>And as a special subcase of this, yes, if you want parallelizable programs the best way to get there is with primitives that embrace it at the bottom. This is why, for all Erlang's faults, it's so much more fun to write parallel programs in Erlang, for instance. The primitives support the concept and there are a number of ways in which you <i>can't</i> get yourself in trouble because there's simply no way to accidentally mutate a variable in a foreign process with the provided primitives. You can't even express it. This is also why Haskell is so exciting to me, because it both starts providing this verifiability to some extent and also shows me where my command of this is weaker than I'd like. (Designing usable primitives is <i>hard</i> because if you accidentally, say, make it impossible to ""go up"" then when you need to you're in real trouble. There's a reason why most languages make it so easy to break out of the constraints, because generally you <i>have</i> to if you want to get real work done.)<p>Anyhow, while to be honest the rest of Fortress has been unexciting to me, mostly because it's targeting programmers writing code the types of code I don't, this is one of the more exciting ideas that could come out of that effort and the need for multicore-capable languages in general, and I hope this sort of approach spreads.",1295057079
