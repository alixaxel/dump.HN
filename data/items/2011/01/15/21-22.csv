For me becoming a public technical speaker was worth every penny, I ever paid to UOP.</i><p>For people that don't understand why degree programs (regardless of school) require communications & speaking classes, this is it. Public speaking has probably gotten me further along in my career than any other skill I learned in school.<p>Most people groan in their normal classes when they have to give a speech about their project, but I think it's invaluable. You can also see immediately the difference between a brilliant student who is otherwise a lousy speaker, and students who may be so-so in the subject but great speakers -- and think about the future prospects of both students. I'd be willing to guess that 9 times out of 10, the speaker gets into higher positions in their career and makes more money.",1295128679

But to first address your question in your edit: think of DNA as a pair of singly-linked lists, each with an alphabet of four characters. Each singly-linked list is the ""reverse complement"" of the other: the reverse sequence with an A-T swap and a C-G swap. At each position there's 2 bits of information, and the other linked list allows for some redundancy.<p>To probe for information in a DNA database, you construct the reverse-complement of the desired bit of information, attach a marker to your probe (such as a fluorescent dye, biotin, magnetic bead), then physically mix it in to your DNA database.  A couple cycles of melting and cooling, and your probe will eventually find it's target DNA.<p>Of course, the thermodynamics of a physical database like this aren't particularly great.  I'm not sure of the asymptotic behavior; my intuitive guess is lg(N) just like in B-trees or what have you, but I've never run the numbers or heard of anyone else running it. Also, the constant in front may be just a <i>few</i> orders of magnitude larger than our current systems :)<p>Reading DNA is getting super cheap these days, and the pace of DNA sequencing technology makes Moore's law look positively wimpy.  There are about 30 serious startups working on technologies that fall into a few broad categories, and some like PacBio had an IPO this year.  Writing DNA is a much more difficult challenge, I don't know of many people looking into it yet.  The market for writing DNA isn't nearly as obvious as it is for sequencing. Of course if it becomes feasible to write your own pets/plants/children instead of breeding them, the market may explode.",1295126078

2107822,comment,2107238,2107528,0,0,xenophanes,,,"Serious chess player here. I'm sure that Rook or Queen odds is a win but it is not a simple matter to force equal trades in chess games. It may be easier to force them with those odds (I never studied odds games much so I don't know a ton about how the dynamics change -- but neither have you), but I don't see why.<p>In general in chess the opening determines how easy it is to trade pieces and who has the option to trade how much. In some openings you cannot easily trade any pieces even if you want to. In others you can trade several if you want.<p>It's easy to give examples. White can trade his f1 bishop off easily in many e4 openings (not just against e5 but also against c5 nf3 d6/nc6). Or in d4/d5 openings with Bf4, black can play Bd6 to trade. There are also plenty of opportunities for white to play Bg5 and trade for a knight in various openings. But if you take other openings, like a closed French it's hard to trade pieces. Or a French with black trading his bishop on c3, it's hard to trade the other pieces. Or in a king's indian you don't necessarily have any good way to trade pieces without taking on some disadvantage. Or in a Najdorf obviously you can force some trading if you want to play Nd5 in some lines for example (I mean lines with e5 by black, not the piece sac lines) but when you do so it's not actually very good for white. This is one of many examples where going after a piece trade gets you some disadvantage.<p>Sorry for details, but really you can't comment on this stuff without knowing a hell of a lot more details than I just wrote. There are plenty of openings that do not allow convenient trading of many minor pieces, and trades of majors aren't all that common. Another good example is all IQP openings for either side which allow some trading but also get dynamic and interesting positions (and of course they are also positions where you're completely screwed down a queen). IQP positions are also interesting in that the IQP side must avoid trades b/c he has a losing endgame, and conservative players think it's bad for the IQP player but actually those positions are fine.<p>The strategy ""just trade stuff and get to the end game"" in normal chess is not easy to implement if your opponent doesn't want it.<p>tl;dr in chess it's usually pretty easy for white to trade one set of minor pieces but not necessarily any more, and doing so may be (slightly) bad for him.",1295125931

In the past 6 months alone, companies with expansive networks are truly attracting the critical mass of people with all different ages and interests (these ""sharing"" businesses are no longer have user-bases consisting of early tech adopters). This is proving itself with the enormous valuations for companies such as Groupon for shared buying power, Facebook for shared social news, Zynga, etc.",1295125343

From my experience (I built a lightweight protocol for multiplayer game with Node.js), it is super easy to program with Node.js and it just works. But the down-side is, you don't really get scalability. Node.js is great in one-process environment, and you don't have any methods for inter-process communication (you can do it based on you tiny protocol, but really, that is not what you want as ""inter-process communication"" means). Node.js is fast for prototyping, but I am eager to try out Erlang or Go before deployed the current version in production.",1295125286

Think about what you're about to do - you have a startup idea and want to execute it, so instead you're going to learn a bunch of languages that you probably wont use. How does that sound like the right way to get you startup off the ground? Well, it doesn't to me.<p>I'd suggest that you ask around and determine what languages other people are using to execute their startup ideas. For example, I think Python would be a great start. Perhaps learn Javascript too, since it has many applications.<p>Don't focus on learning all of the languages. Focus on executing your brilliant idea, and learn the languages and frameworks required to do so.",1295125236
