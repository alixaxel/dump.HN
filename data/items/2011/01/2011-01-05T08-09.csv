2070418,comment,2061722,2068897,0,0,ZPedro,,,"Well, of course. And if you think about it further, all user-facing software is, in fact, an illusion. Smoke and mirrors all the time. Apple just pushes the illusionist work even further than what most software developers (who are themselves illusionists, whether they realize it or not) consider as being ""real"". But it works, users prefer that.<p>Not only that, but I'm convinced that users are actually more efficient when perceived responsiveness is added: for instance, most users will not start thinking about what to do next on an app until they are seeing the app interface; presenting then with a non-interacting screenshot as soon as possible actually makes the overall interaction more efficient. But the ultimate is what the guys making PCalc discovered ( <a href=""http://www.dragthing.com/blog/2009/07/how-to-make-your-iphone-app-launch-faster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dragthing.com/blog/2009/07/how-to-make-your-iphon...</a> ): you can put a non-interactive screengrab in such a way that even though it is a dumb image, touches will actually be recorded and have their effect as soon as the actual interface is set up; users can actually interact very soon. Now that's badass.<p>(however, most animation stuff doesn't fall in the category of perceived responsiveness, as most often, for instance for transitions, the end result must be ready before the animation begins; also, ""undocumented nature""? Apple's obsession with perceived responsiveness is well-known).",1294217885

I'd be more alarmed than enticed to discover that the current implementation of datasets-larger-than-RAM for my chosen database was considered ""flakey"", and was going to be swapped out for a green-field approach in the next release.<p>As Redis is mainly an in-memory DB, currently larger datasets than RAM were not our first goal, and there was even the idea to drop support at all for this use case. I think that what matters for most users is that the default mode of operations is working great, and that for an alternative mode of operations developers are not dogmatic and don't fear to drop what is not optimal to replace it with something better. In many other contexts this would be regarded as bad marketing and not done at all, but I try to follow a scientific way to make progresses, and I tend to accept that I and the other developers are not perfect and need to make mistakes and improve the design again and again ;)<p>I like Redis data model and I think this is our biggest value, and we need to find different underlaying implementations for different use cases, and keep trying to provide more speed, better durability, better replication, and so forth, ad libitum.",1294217470

But I think that most of the value of Redis is its data model, and I bet it will survive Redis itself, so the idea is, let's look to alternatives that make this data model working well with data sets bigger than RAM.<p>Our old solution was VM, but we found it is not ideal, does not work well with the Redis in-memory back end persistence ideas (that are instead working well without VM). What to do then? Keep trying with the wrong solution? :) I guess not, open source also means that if the cure for a disease is not good enough we put things into the trash and try again and again, as the sole goal should be the progress of the technology we are trying to put in the hand of users.<p>So we have a new model now, and will test how it works in practice. What we said is: for write heavy applications where performances matter, use Redis as an in-memory DB. It works well, it's well tested, and we can count many happy users.<p>But if the Redis data model solves your problems, and you have a read-heavy application with tons of data, we are going to provide an alternative that could work well.",1294217176

Here are some things that make it hard to believe IP is a good fundamental right (in the sense of Locke):<p>*  Bob and Joe on opposite sides of the world have no problem with each owning a pair of shoes.  But if Bob invents a device on Tuesday, and Joe independently invents in on Wednesday, why should Bob get everything and Joe nothing?  Yes, from a <i>practical</i> standpoint it's necessary to give patents solely to the first-mover; otherwise people would pretend to invent existing things.  But why should time-of-invention matter <i>morally</i>...at <i>all</i>?<p>* Should Shakespeare's heirs (or, more realistically, a copyright-holding corporation) really be able to dictate how his plays are used today?  And forever?  If not, what moral principle would we use to choose a time limit?<p>* Why, if IP is a moral right, are mathematical theorems not ownable?<p>* It's not to hard to distinguish things which are physically ownable, but where does one draw the line with IP?  How detailed must my graphic design be for it to be mine <i>forever</i>?  Can I own all green squares, or only green squares inside of blue hexagons?  Legally, the threshold for copyright is set to try to maximize societal benefit.  But if copyrights are moral rights existing independent of any legal framework, on what moral principle could one decide what's copyright-able?",1294215705
