GIMP is probably the best for traditional photo editing, but there seems to be more programs oriented toward illustration. In particular, I like Krita.<p>I don't really know what the deal is with the low development interest in GIMP. I think maybe it's that Photoshop's professional niche generally isn't comprised of big fan of computers in the first place, so they are more like the Office crowd and just want to use what they're used to; they're hostile to any change from the start.<p>I also think that the extremely long development cycle of GEGL, which was necessary for the most commonly requested features like increased bit depth, CMYK, etc., may have turned developers off.<p>I'm merely guessing here, though.

In Photoshop you can attach dropshadows (layer styles) to layers. This will save you a lot of time when something changes. I used Photoshop and Gimp. I can create the same images in Gimp but it just takes a lot more time. For hobby that's ok, but for work it's not. Thats why people are willing to pay a lot for Photoshop. 
One thing that is bothering me in Gimp is that there is a layer size. Seems like a minor thing. But these are the little things that get in the way of working quick.",1294735626

2091377,comment,2090678,2091147,0,0,nocman,,,"I'd like to know more specifically the choice of acceptable instruments.  My observation is that the choices of piano and violin are not limited to Asian families (at least, not in the US).  There seems to be a link between people who wish to foster academic excellence in their children, and the choice to have them play piano and/or violin.  I'd be interested to know if anyone here has any insights as to why those particular instruments are chosen, and I'd be even more interested to know why other instruments would be strictly <i>excluded</i> (whether by Asian parents or those of other heritage).<p>Personally, I think it is a good idea to have kids learn piano for at least a couple of reasons.  First, I think the visual layout of a piano can help attach a physical understanding to the concept of intervals and chords (specifically the distance between notes, and the clustering of notes in specific patterns to form chords).  For me personally, I think that was a benefit, even though I play piano very little, and not very well.  Secondly, I don't recall ever meeting an adult who took lessons as a child for any length of time (and then quit) who as an adult does <i>not</i> wish they had continued.  Now surely there will be at least 7 people on HN who will now speak up, inform me that they hated lessons as a child, happily quit when they were able and never regretted it for a second.  But unless my memory is failing me, that must mean we've never met (or at least we've never discussed piano lessons), and thus my statement still stands :-D  To that I will add, that even with a number of ""I quit and I'm glad"" entries, I still think the majority of the adults in question wish they hadn't quit.<p>Oh, and a third reason to play piano:  they make nice weighted, touch-sensitive keybords now that do a pretty decent job of mimicking the feel of a real piano (at least close enough for me), and you can move them from room to room and house to house <i>by yourself</i>.  (You won't have to get 3 to 5 of your soon to be ex-best friends to help you).  We sold our old upright piano about 3 moves ago, and I've been celebrating the sale ever since :-D",1294735382

But from a historical perspective, it's likely that standards will change over the long-term, as they did for, say, women's beachwear or corporate dress.<p>If we reach a time when almost <i>everyone</i> is working from home in their PJs, we should also wind towards such dress being accepted in semi-formal contexts. Consider jeans in the workplace now. Even 30 years ago, a CEO wearing jeans at a board meeting couldn't be taken seriously whereas now it's almost a cliché in tech firms (compare early 80s and 2010 Steve Jobs).

However, helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators (cyclotrons, synchrotrons, and the like) are less likely to be referred to as ""alpha particles"" because the high energies produced by these sources highlights the striking difference in behavior of their particles from the classical alpha particles produced (and originally defined by) the process of radioactive alpha decay.<p>The same goes for a proton beam.",1294733980

The whole piece is pretty much 'Revenge of the Nerds' tripe, containing the usual, trite anti-jock (and, lol, anti-minority) rhetoric combined with facile AP/SAT test-score elitism (I'd have thought HN would be suspicious of arguments that use test scores as a proxy of education quality).<p>Caltech is in <i>some</i> class by itself, sure, but not for the reasons he cites, which are plain bullshit, and definitely not a completely 'positive' class---there are definite, subtle tradeoffs of a Caltech education that are not highlighted by the rather crude level of discourse this article has encouraged.<p>Already mentioned and debunked here is the asinine assumption that AP/SAT scores are used as proxy for actual academic excellence by the admissions committee.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2089717"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2089717</a><p>However this next comment, while probably made on the wrong premises (that the admissions committee uses test scores as the sole criteria), is probably the only assessment of Caltech I've seen that has a hope of getting the real issues that show going to Caltech can be a bad decision if there are other respective alternatives available:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2090087"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2090087</a><p>""Well, from the article, it sounds like most of the Cal Tech freshmen have already wasted a few years getting ready for the SATs, making straight A grades, and taking AP courses. Sorry, guys, but that's a LOT of work, a good recipe for early 'burn out', and indicative of a lack of seeing reality. What Cal Tech is insisting on looks very much like at least simplistic understanding and likely 'obsession', and a big, HUGE, problem with these two is that they overwhelm rationality and ability to see reality clearly and, net, are from harmful down to debilitating.""<p>Indeed, even though the admissions committee emphasizes the fact that test scores do not completely determine admission, preparing for tests and 'burning out early' is exactly what the majority of applicants end up doing <i>anyway</i> to get into this place. Then Caltech has (and misses) a great opportunity to end up educating people the <i>right</i> way, as you say.<p>What many people who go to Caltech do is end up learning all the right subjects but the wrong lessons. There is hardly room for introspection, broadening one's perspective, and really learning the why and how of research---there is only the assumption that you are <i>enthusiastic as hell</i> at math/science and you are going to <i>signal this</i> by overloading, taking the hardest classes for no good reason, and trying to impress Head Nerd in <subject of your (their) choice>. This is your <i>life</i>---this is a social group where your self-worth is measured by your GPA and how many papers you publish. Too many people I knew have been sucked in this way and ended up burning out in one way or another.<p>The end result is that there are no 'jocks' at Caltech in the usual sense---what you have is a similarly wretched, caveman-like hierarchy, but with 'sports' replaced by 'academic achievement.' Surely a different and perhaps more productive contest than what goes on at other colleges, but no less of a harmful environment. Unless you are at or near the top of the hierarchy, the environment has the structural effect (as in, may not be intentionally designed) to beat any previous interest you had in math or science out of you. Could this be an explanation for the high suicide rate at Caltech (and other elite institutions like it)?<p>Basically: Where was the <i>education</i>? For being a fairly good student who clearly could learn subjects straight from books: how to learn what to learn? To educate <i>yourself</i> in the <i>right way</i>? To see the world for what it is and make independent, informed choices? To be rational?<p>Hell, this shouldn't be exclusive to Caltech---with the availability of information these days it seems to be a much better payoff to educate people in this alternative way instead.<p>So, go to Caltech only if you really understand it as just one small step in a longer research career, you know how to be rational and not get taken in by the social hierarchy there, and you are in contact with helpful faculty with whom you know you will have a productive relationship. Or, if you estimate P(Head Nerd) as being really high, so you can start your own little fiefdom.<p>Full disclosure: I went to Caltech (class of 08) and thankfully am in a good Ph. D program right now where I can 'pick up the pieces,' as it were, and reignite my interests.<p>I am constantly in conflict about this---would I have done 'better' (for some definition of better) overall if I hadn't gone there, and instead gone to an easier school?<p>Or do I just remain grateful about my current situation and just stop thinking when I think about this? I am forever indebted to my parents for their sacrifice in paying my Caltech tuition, and I really think there could not be a better place for learning engaging subjects with the brightest people around. All my career opportunities were made possible because I networked in the Caltech community.<p>But I just think there could have been a much more principled, less psychically costly way of doing it.",1294733402

The solution is GEGL (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEGL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEGL</a>), which has been under development for a (very) long time now and is partially implemented in GIMP 2.6, the latest stable version. It <i>is</i> a problem, but it's important to put it into perspective: almost all monitors display 32-bit color (EDIT: or less) anyway, so if you're doing work targeted at a computer screen, it probably doesn't matter anyway. If you need to do work at color depths higher than 8 bits per pixel (that is, if you're doing serious print work) then yes, you need to be aware of these limitations. If you're almost everyone else it's probably not an issue. (I don't mean to imply that it's not a problem at all, but I think it's important to keep it in perspective.)<p>For the people here asking whether GIMP is good enough for what you're doing: Ars Technica did an excellent review of GIMP 2.6 about a year ago (EDIT: 2 years, but it's still the same major version). It's long, but well-worth reading and will answer your questions. It's written from the perspective of a professional who uses Photoshop, but does an excellent job of remaining balanced.  This quote summarizes the review (and also my opinion) pretty nicely, I think:<p><pre><code>    I may seem to skew negative since I talk so much about what's missing, but
    it's hard to dwell on what a program does well and not sound like a fawning

    will not be disappointed. There is a ton of room for advanced work here.
