Lots of knowledge about ""coding""...very little knowledge about anything else.  The playing field is much more level than it initially seems, but because the CS 101 classes are mostly about writing toy code it's easy for prior coding knowledge to be intimidating.  In my own undergrad CS program, the CS101 hotshots fared no better, on average, than the kids who came in with no experience at all.  In fact, a few of the loudest initial braggarts were the most spectacular flameouts, and about an equal number of the no-prior-experience kids ended up the honors graduates.<p>Universities could do a lot to combat this problem -- it might be a good idea to let the high-school coding jocks place out of the first CS classes.
