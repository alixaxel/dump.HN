If your software doesn't mind having nodes frequently drop out due to overheating, then it apparently is cheaper to replace melted CPUs than to keep them all cool.<p><a href=""http://blogs.technet.com/b/msdatacenters/archive/2011/01/04/shedding-light-on-our-new-cloud-farms.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.technet.com/b/msdatacenters/archive/2011/01/04/...</a>",1295240362

Getting better sales skills is going to make you more money.  Even if you worked in some high-fallutin' ivory tower institution you still need to go cap in hand begging for funding.  Every job interview is a sales situation, every annual review etc.<p>Are you disputing the claim about help desk having a high turn-over?  Have you even <i>worked</i> in IT?  Seriously.<p>As for programmers making such big salaries, outside of anomalies like Microsoft, Google and Facebook, good luck with that one.  Try comparing against electricians, plumbers and carpenters.  Or even the bloke who owns his own lawn mowing business.

2111242,comment,2110756,2111159,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't really want to give the impression that it's this totally intimidating atmosphere all the time, because it does fade with time, and most engineers learn to ask questions abundantly, and most engineers are also really great at answering questions.  One of the most commonly cited perks of being at Google is the ability to ask anything of anyone.  Have a question about HTML 5?  Shoot hixie an e-mail.  Digging into the internals of Python?  Guido works there, as do a number of other core Pythonistas.  Building a Go app?  Rob Pike can answer.<p>That said, it <i>is</i> intimidating starting as a Noogler, largely because of the huge volume of proprietary material you need to learn.  There's one true way to store structured data, and while it's open-sourced (Protobufs), you've probably never used it.  There's a unified JavaScript library (Closure), but it wasn't open-sourced until recently.  There're logging, and log-processing, and monitoring, and RPC, and cluster management systems to learn.  There're a bunch of storage options, some of which you may've read about in public but never used (BigTable), some of which will be completely new to you.<p>The scale of problems that Google tackles is also bigger than most people are accustomed to.  In a lot of the industry, a few-dozen node cluster is fairly large.  At Google, thousands of machines are routine.  Big-O notation can be ignored at a lot of shops, but at Google-scale, anything that runs in greater than O(N log N) will usually take centuries.  Most frontend web devs never worry about latency; at Google, we care very much.  A/B testing has recently made a lot of headlines and had some neat libraries developed for it, but its centrally ingrained in Google's feature development processes.<p>When you first start out - particularly if you're used to <i>always</i> having the answers, as many Google engineers were - that can be intimidating.  There's suddenly so much you don't know, and yet you know (through Google's public reputation) that software obviously gets written there.  Once in a while, it's even <i>good</i> software.<p>For your first few weeks, you probably won't even know what questions to ask, because there's such a volume of knowledge out there.  Oftentimes, somebody's already solved your problem, but you don't know about it because it might never occur to you that someone's already solved it.  There're also things that Google pays attention to that many other shops don't - in many other employers, you'll never have to deal with internationalization, or handling Chinese characters, or right-to-left languages, or XSS, or managing HTTP resources when you have a large fleet of potentially-out-of-sync webservers.  When I started doing code reviews for the websearch webserver, the tech lead said, ""We don't expect you to know everything, but we expect that by now you've learned enough to know when you need to ask someone.""",1295239680

If there were an option to, for example, disallow sharing of X on app Y, users would click it without understanding why. Then, months later, since X isn't shared, feature Z of app Y doesn't work. But the user doesn't understand how this works (messaging in the app might make it better, but not all apps are going to do it right and not all users will understand anyways). Since it's broken, the user will blame Facebook -- Facebook is broken!! Except the silly user did it to themselves.<p>This <i>has happened</i>. Since most things on the site are an app, Photos is an app. There used to be an option which ultimately disallowed an app to post certain kinds of stories to your stream (I don't recall the details). You could set this option on the Photos app, meaning you would never see any more photo stories in your stream. The option was very buried, so people had to specifically go to Photos and turn on the option... and silly users <i>did this</i>, forgot about it, and then complained that Facebook was broken since they never saw photos stories. Nevermind that it was their own fault. This option has since been removed in one of the Platform permissions revamps recently (IIRC it was simply forced to ""off"" for all apps, with Photos and similar internal ones special-cased to be forced ""on"".)",1295239517
