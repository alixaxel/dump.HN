There are a great many traits from our parents that affect us strongly on a subconscious level.<p>Besides, saying ""yeah, we have parents, but we all end up the same regardless"" is a total cop-out when you turn around and say ""yeah, we have genes, but they count for a wild fluctuation of 50% - far more important in the development than any other factor"". Which is odd. We all have eyes. Arms. Legs. Lungs. Run, walk, cry, think, breathe, eat, excrete, suffer cold and hot. If you're trying to paint this theoretical 100% influence total as ""that which makes us individual from each other"", then it's farcical to say ""parents don't count because we all end up with the basics"" but somehow genes get special treatment. The fact that some of us have red hair and some don't doesn't count for 50% of our individuality.<p>If such minor differences between people really counted for 50% of our differentiation, then there'd be far more homogeneity in personality for people of average height, average build, and average attractiveness.

Check out the homepage http://justremindit.com for more details like what are the benefits of Voice call based reminders, who is it useful for, etc.<p>It took more than 6 months in part-time to make it at par with commercial apps in the App Store. Finally, it's available to download here - http://appsto.re/JustRemindIt. App is FREE to download, and comes with few free reminder credits to play around. After that you can recharge your account with pay-as-you-go model.<p>Please download the app, use it, and let me know your feedback - all kinds of inputs are welcome. If you like the app, I'll really appreciate if you can write review as well.<p>I'm super excited about this first step and looking forward to real challenges that will begin now. I've lots of plans for future versions, like support for recurring reminders, SMS or Email reminders, seamless integration with Contacts and Calendar, Group reminders, etc. So please let me know your inputs, they will help me to work on the right features.<p>Thanks HN!
