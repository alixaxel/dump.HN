They still need to transcode to H.264 for Mobile Safari, Safari (using Youtube's HTML5 mode) and soon IE9 too; <i>none</i> of these have announced plans to support WebM.

2098797,story,,,2,3,timmm,"Why do people latch onto the superficial aspects of other startups?",,"1.	Startup names are becoming annoyingly standardized. You basically take a word that relates to your industry then ad –ly or instead turn it into a verb by adding –ify at the end. Yet these aspects are completely independent of the startup’s success. Instead why don’t people try and come up with a name that is short, easy to remember, intuitive to spell, and descriptive of what the company is about. That might actually affect your success as a startup.<p>2.	FORGET VIRALITY! When I was a freshman in college I uploaded a video to youtube that received 20k views in a week and millions by the months end. I got calls from all the major “funny video” websites and ended up selling to collegehumor.com (~$400), which was a mistake since a week later I got a call from ABC who was interested and offered 3k. The point is the more viral you are the more prone you are to fizzle out faster. The whole ordeal lasted less than a few months. IMO “Virality” and virality coefficients are a waste of time if you want to actually build a business. Spend the time you would improving your viral score and build a better/more useful product.<p>3.	Do you really need a mobile app? There are plenty of industries in which a mobile app would serve no purpose except wasting the time and resources of the developers.<p>4.	A/B testing is a waste of time. Instead use that time building a better product! Craigslist/Google, for instance, has barely changed any of their layout/design. Good developers spend time improving their core product  and doing things that are important/matter, not testing the effectiveness of different font colors.<p>a.	Does design/brand image (logo) even have any effect on success?<p>Cliffs: If you are going to copy another company at least copy the parts that attributed to their success. \n//rant",1294891130

Ironically, I first got on Flickr when Yahoo Photos shut down and they forcefully migrated me to Flickr. But I'm letting my pro account expire this month. I've been using Flickr for 2 main purposes: sharing photos with friends and backing up all my photos. It hasn't been great for either.<p>No matter how many guest passes and invites I mail friends, most of them only look at the photos I put on Facebook. Facebook keeps improving their photo service - removing album limits, increasing resolution. I can't name a single new Flickr feature in the past 3 years that's impacted me.<p>For backing up, it's really not very convenient, especially if I had to restore. I've moved to rotating offsite hard drives a while ago.<p>I do still enjoy some of the social aspects of Flickr groups, for general photography and related interests. That's enough to possibly keep me active there as a free user, but in general the quality of the average Flickr group is pretty low. It really depends on the group admins and Flickr doesn't offer any incentive for them. Wouldn't it be easy to offer free Pro accounts to the admins of the top 1% of Flickr groups? Or some swag?

2098716,comment,2098388,2098592,0,0,spin,,,"> ""Can/should we be testing anti-depressants on animals at all?""<p>Yes, of course.  We can test a bunch of mice, rats, and monkeys, and then chop up their brains afterwords and actually look at what happened inside.  It's not as good as experimenting on people, but it does tell us <i>something</i>.<p>> ""Is it possible that depression in animals is different than depression in humans?""<p>This is exactly the question being asked.  From the article:  ""Are we in fact modeling the right things? Do the tail-suspension test and forced-swim test detect antidepressant activity after all?""  ie, that is, in fact, exactly the question being asked.<p>> ""Is it possible that lab conditions affect the psychology of the animal?""<p>Lab conditions absolutely affect the psychology of the animal.  In these tests, ideally, what they do is they have two populations of animals.  Let's say group-A rats get injected with drug XYZ, and group-B rats get injected with saline (placebo).  You then look for differences between the two populations.  Ideally, the technicians don't know which rat is getting the drug or not, all they know is that rat#1 gets injection#1, rat#2 gets injection#2.  So both populations of rats get the exact same treatment, and you look for differences between the two populations of rats.<p>(Also, some animals don't mind being in cages, but some do.  For example, there's <i>lots</i> of experiments with rats and macaque monkeys, because they don't mind cages or people.  Whereas chimps would rather rip your arms off than be caged up or experimented on.)",1294889221

By my calculations, three nanoseconds must have elapsed between his presenting the cheque and the arrival in my account of the funds needed to honour it. I refer, of course, to the automatic monthly deposit of my Pension, an arrangement, which, I admit, has been in place for only thirty eight years. You are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity, and also for debiting my account £30 by way of penalty for the inconvenience caused to your bank.<p>My thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has caused me to rethink my errant financial ways. I noticed that whereas I personally attend to your telephone calls and letters, but when I try to contact you, I am confronted by the impersonal, overcharging, pre-recorded, faceless entity which your bank has become. From now on, I, like you, choose only to deal with a flesh-and-blood person. My mortgage and loan payments will therefore and hereafter no longer be automatic, but will arrive at your bank by cheque, addressed personally and confidentially to an employee at your bank whom you must nominate. Be aware that it is an offence under the Postal Act for any other person to open such an envelope.<p>Please find attached an Application Contact Status which I require your chosen employee to complete. I am sorry it runs to eight pages, but in order that I know as much about him or her as your bank knows about me, there is no alternative. Please note that all copies of his or her medical history must be countersigned by a Solicitor, and the mandatory details of his/her financial situation (income, debts, assets and liabilities) must be accompanied by documented proof. In due course, I will issue your employee with PIN number which he/she must quote in dealings with me. I regret that it cannot be shorter than 28 digits but, again, I have modelled it on the number of button presses required of me to access my account balance on your phone bank service. As they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Let me level the playing field even further. When you call me, press buttons as follows:<p>1. To make an appointment to see me. \n2. To query a missing payment. \n3. To transfer the call to my living room in case I am there. \n4. To transfer the call to my bedroom in case I am sleeping. \n5. To transfer the call to my toilet in case I am attending to nature. \n6. To transfer the call to my mobile phone if I am not at home. \n7. To leave a message on my computer (a password to access my computer is required. \nA password will be communicated to you at a later date to the Authorized Contact.) \n8. To return to the main menu and to listen to options 1 through to 8. \n9. To make a general complaint or inquiry, the contact will then be put on hold, pending the attention of my automated answering service. While this may, on occasion, involve a lengthy wait, uplifting music will play for the duration of the call.<p>Regrettably, but again following your example, I must also levy an establishment fee to cover the setting up of this new arrangement.<p>May I wish you a happy, if ever so slightly less prosperous, New Year.<p>Your Humble Client<p>(Remember: This was written by a 98 year old woman; DOESN'T SHE MAKE YOU PROUD!)",1294888439

Really, `tptacek`, it takes almost no independent search to come to a murkier conclusion.<p>Interestingly, while the Flash IDE is most definitely closed, the SWF file format and the tools to create SWFs... it's not so cut and dry.\n  Here's the (Flash 10 SWF Spec)[<a href=""http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/swf/pdf/swf_file_format_spec_v10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/swf/pdf/swf...</a>]<p>There's probably a bunch of stuff left out that'd make implementation difficult, but that hasn't stopped:<p>(GORDON)[<a href=""https://github.com/tobeytailor/gordon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tobeytailor/gordon</a>] -- an open source Flash runtime written in pure JavaScript . It only supports up to Flash v. 2; almost useless, but interesting.<p>Here's the (Flex SDK)[<a href=""http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Flex+SDK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Flex+SDK</a>] which includes the Flex framework, and a partially open source SWF compiler.<p>Apparently, Flex compiler isn't totally open source because of patents concerning audio and video codecs (I'm recalling this off the top of my head; please verify).<p>Here's (Tamarin)[<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/</a>]. It's a VM for EcmaScript. It's been rolled into SpiderMonkey, the JS engine for FireFox, I think. It includes support for packages, namespaces, classes, and optional strict typing of variables. Really useful stuff for interactive devs that, unfortunately, hasn't been widely adopted.<p>Adobe contributes to WebKit on behalf of Flash & Air; I don't know what their contributions have been/how useful they are, though.<p>I'm a professional interactive dev, and I specialize in Flash, so you might conclude that I'd be biased, and I wouldn't blame you at all. However, as a Flash dev, I'm familiar with the non-marketed vectors of the Flash environment. Take that as you will.<p>We're geeks: let's all invest a little time to investigate the rhetoric.\nIf you really don't like Flash, pick another reason: there are many ;)",1294887741

If tomorrow we found out that we couldn't use animals as test subjects because the validity of any such experiments was suspect, then how would 'we' generate grant money?<p>* Hand-wavy answers like, ""It's impossible to know, so we'll just assume that the answer is no.""",1294887733
