I think I would have noticed if they regularly advocated (note - a distinction from broadcasting) extremist views. :)<p>You, on the other hand, have noted that you have no first hand knowledge of AJ or their reporting. But have taken content from a website that exists to track down examples of anti-Semitic material to inform your view of them...<p>> Are you really claiming that they completely lied about something so easily checked...?<p>No, more bad rhetoric. You know I am not claiming that. I am explaining that they hunt down these clips, often presenting them out of context, with the agenda of exposing news agencies as anti-Semitic.<p>Point being made is; you should definitely treat them as circumspectly as you are treating AJ.<p>> They have aired lots of scandals in lots of president administrations<p>I'm mildly unconvinced that airing scandal is a good marker for neutrality & credibility :)<p>The BBC are pretty good - probably the best ""simple"" news source, although it has its biases (most notably it is often anti EU). NYT I am always divided over, but generally pretty good. They make up my four ""preferred & relatively trustworthy"" news sources along with AJ and the Financial Times. There is probably a slight liberal bias in my choice of news consumption, but I have yet to find a conservative media source that I am comfortable with.<p>BUT; you could pick up lots of examples of problems.. the BBC, for example, tends to be very ""white middle class Christian"" centric (and sometimes, ultra-politically-correct). They also, recently, broadcast some BNP interviews which had pretty nasty/racist comments in them - basically the same sort of lines as the first incident you pointed to with AJ.<p>We picks our source and then take them with a grain of salt. The point is not to find you a ""source"" to prove Al Jazeera's credibility to you, the point is I am giving you my opinion as a cynic and AJ watcher that I find them to be a relatively neutral and balanced news source. If you have respect for my opinions you might take that as an endorsement, or otherwise you might not :) I don't mind.<p>The points you have raised do concern me; enough that it will be at the back of my mind now when using them as a source, at least in the near future. I'm afraid it is not enough to convince me they are anti-Semitic and completely non-neutral/compromised.",1296348743

There are great many algorithms/models out there that are seemingly great and do wonders on toy data, but in the real world fail not only because the data isn't comprehensive (it isn't sampled well), but also because people misuse existing models and tweak them enough to work for that data and those tweaks make it on acclaimed journals/conferences.

Median household income is around $50k right now, so this is a decent standard of living.<p>> if you provide some useful service and that service would be made more useful if you could hire a graphic designer to make it pretty, you wouldn't be able to<p>A two-person household where both members worked full time would be making 3.6x the current median household income, which is way more than they need. This surplus could be used as investment capital, where it would be distributed and decentralized, so it would be much easier to do Kickstarter-style funding. If we accept $75k at the point where money stops having an impact on happiness, individuals would have 20% above that line to play with for those kinds of things. Essentially, the stack ranking converts your surplus productivity into status for you, and distributed evenly to your friends and neighbors, who have the power to return it to you if they think your project is socially or economically valuable.<p>Some good points though, especially the part about profit as an index of what makes people happy. The problem with our current system is that this is only true if your profits come from people who make less than $75k. 40% of consumer spending is driven by people in the top 10% ($82,500 annual income), so it's fair to say that that spending is misallocated and doesn't contribute to overall happiness.",1296348376

Yes, there is anti-Islamic sentiment to a degree among a small portion of Americans, but it doesn't reach the levels on display here. This is a pattern of Al Jazeera's, which makes sense because news organizations do tend to slant their views to fit general trends among the populations of the countries they serve in.<p>It makes a lot more sense that Al Jazeera is so well spoken of here just because it is a significant shift from what were used to in the feeble mainstream US media, rather than Al Jazeera actually putting a much deeper level of intellectual effort into their news.

This is a product which is likely to produce a strong reaction. Much like Four Loko, it will be perceived as a danger to teens and college students, but instead of having to justify stopping distribution as it did with Four Loko, the FDA can send an email to the DEA, who will raid them, and production will stop immediately. Those involved will go to jail.<p>Furthermore, I suspect that dispensaries will be reluctant to stock it. Firstly they will not wish to be involved in the fallout to the above; secondly, it's not targeted to the generation of people who can easily go to a doctor and pretend to have aches and pains to get a prescription, and so their clients will be poorly matched to it; and thirdly, they for the most part wish to appear respectable and unremarkable, because to do otherwise would be harmful to the political efforts at legalisation.",1296348199

<i>http://www.grooveshark.com</i><p>Twitter - great, compared to Facebook (and in its own right). I really like the clean and upbeat design flavor Twitter has. Twitter has to distill much more information in a newsfeed than Facebook and yet still manages to be more effective.

Anyway, for somebody in my shoes, that is, doing a self-funded, bootstrapped startup while working a day job, the requirement to move would mean needing to quit the day job, but the initial investment would leave - for me anyway - too short of a runway to justify it.  At the end of 3 months, I'd come back here (presumably) and need to find another day job, and need to find it pretty quick, in order to pay rent and car payment, etc.<p>But the $150,000 investment option should be good for at least a year of runway, enabling a founder to work on their project full-time.
