People sometimes downvote for idiosyncratic reasons but someone else usually comes along and neutralizes that (as I just did). The main thing is to keep the discussion on-topic and not go meta.<p>You make an excellent point: the difficulty of programming is not only that of instructing the computer but also that of the problem the program is to solve. I agree.<p>(As an aside, the main problem with your comment is that it was rambling. This obscures your otherwise valuable insights. I recommend a course of obsessive-compulsive editing :))",1294556158

It may even help. It's got a lot of people talking about her...<p>Here are some other thoughts/questions:<p>1) Users have been receiving free upgrades for years, meaning she received no additional revenues from them. I wonder many of the vocal unhappy users would upgrade to the app store version anyway if she just called this 3.0. How ""valuable"" is the livid segment of her existing customerbase?<p>2) The app store will allow her to reach new users that don't know or care about the developers. The Mac App Store is a black box where the developer reputation doesn't seem to matter much, unless its reflected in the reviews. Think about buying an iPhone app... Have you ever researched the reputation of a dev before buying a $4.99 iPhone app? My brother would just buy the app and be happy as a clam.<p>3) She has 70 reviews in the store so far. Only 1 mentions this and gives her 1-star. Many give 5 stars and some talk about how they are happy to pay for this upgrade.<p>Again, not condoning the behavior... Just thinking out loud.",1294556035

There are the up-front costs you allude to when you say ""short-run"" --- even if you're cutting your mold from aluminum, that's an expensive way to make five instances --- but there are also costs associated with the ""mass"" nature of the production.<p>First, mass production must be geographically centralized. This means you have shipping costs.  For fragile or bulky objects, the shipping cost can sometimes exceed the material cost.<p>Second, mass production involves inventory at every stage of the supply chain, although you can cut inventory down quite a lot from what we used to do 60 years ago. Maintaining inventory is expensive.<p>So it's possible that 3-D printers will beat molding for mass production. It's just not likely in the foreseeable future.<p>Molecular nanotechnology will, of course, make 3-D printers beat molding.",1294555952

This is stupid on two accounts: even if you do an academic career, what you did during your PhD is rarely what you will do later, and PhD teaches you many other things.<p>I only realized it afterwards, but many people are simply incapable of working by themselves without being given precise instruction: PhD teaches you that in some way (of course, there is a selection bias). It also trains you to communicate to other, which is a very valuable skill. You are also used to being criticized on somehow objective criterion: few people are able to take critics in any other way than personal. Finally, you almost always learn tenacity.<p>For me, saying that PhD is a bubble because there are few academics positions is like saying being an entrepreneur is a bubble because so few people become very rich. Even failure teach you a lot (where failure would be defined as not becoming an academic in the PhD case).",1294555698

2085008,comment,2083672,2083672,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I think programming is a vague term. If programming just means rigorously encoding an imprecise set of instructions then while not easy I cannot say it is especially difficult.<p>But if your programming involves complex mathematics,physics, linguistics, biological, intricate interactions with the world, heck even philosophical concepts then programming is in the cartesian product of the domain and field and is as hard as the toughest problem you are attacking, judged with respect, also to the source field. The true difficulty is in balancing multiple species of abstraction, domain knowledge, device knowledge and encoding instruction in a way that satisfies all of these.<p>So there is the base difficulty of abstracting and then converting mental concepts to a set of computations compounded with the difficulty of getting the abstractions of your domain knowledge to transfer to a set of mental concepts that are transferable to a set of computations. heh. If the field you are dealing with is easy And Or you are continually dealing with the same problem more or less (just different facets) such that you had internalized most of the process to automated subthought (mastery) then yes it will appear easy.<p>Programming then, would only be bounded by its own internal difficulty, which gets easier the more you explore it and learn widely applicable abstractions. Once you mix in the difficulty of the field the same applies till you have reduced the interactions of field+programming to mastered concepts. If the field has a high minimum then this reduction may still always remain extremely difficult. So if one finds programming easy it could also be a sign that you are not challenging yourself enough, not pushing your boundaries sufficiently.<p>My theory is that those of the greatest skill have burning curiosity and will to improve, respond positively to challenge, and have great ability to focus - together this allows them to hold on to and continually attack a problem to a greater depth than most. You need only pick 3, maybe only 2. If there is any inherent genetic advantage held by some - greater ability to focus, efficient use of nutrients, quicker and more enduring synaptic connections, whatever - for the rest of us, I feel the brain is marvellously malleable and can be tuned down another set of dimensions.  The space of intelligence is gigantic and non euclidean and likely with no concept of a global maximum. If the person is so determined they will work around their deficiencies and or train their mental processes stronger so that any ""lack"" of inherent skill does not get in the way of what they wish to do. This is what I believe I do and did. I do be slow as molasses.",1294554425

I never meant to say that corporate crimes are victimless in any way, but that I was under the impression that computer forensics had a relatively low involvement with ""brutal crimes"" as you described in your post before last, and a significant involvement with white collar crimes. Of course, there are exceptions just as that interesting story you linked; but admittedly I know very little about this as I've never worked in this field myself nor do I personally know anyone that has. Sometimes people's expectations are far from the reality of a thing, like some students first realization of what computer science really is. I take no offense at all.<p>Speaking of that story you linked, I was wondering how they knew it was him who made those search queries, perhaps they somehow found out where she was during the time the searches where made. When I finished reading it though, I didn't find myself disagreeing with the verdict --especially considering the evidence of suffocation. Seems a bit unlikely she'd be able to fake that.<p>I never knew the agencies you named were so accepting to volunteers. I would have thought they would act suspicious of people volunteering --especially for a line of work that carries such a gloomy stigma (what kind of person would want to do this work and why?).
