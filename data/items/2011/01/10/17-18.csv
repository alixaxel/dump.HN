2089153,comment,2086836,2088109,0,0,sorbus,,,"Quite sorry about the confusion; but no harm done, at least.<p>If you have showdead turned on, there are lots of spam posts around - mostly just bunches of links from users who are dead (they can post stuff and see their own posts normally, but no one else can) - but this strategy is rather worrying, because it's harder to catch automatically. On the upside, the community is large enough now that most of these posts should be caught and flagged.<p>Simply skimming through noobcomments looking for spam might not work as a strategy anymore, though, especially if they start grabbing comments which originally contained links (especially citations) and then replacing them with legitimate looking links to new sites; basically, if they figure out a way to stop the links from looking spammy, they're going to require a bit more human effort to catch, which might let lots of them get through - especially by posting on older articles which have fallen off the front-page.<p>(Great, I'm giving advice to spammers now. Bit worried about posting this, actually, but someone else is going to think of it - probably already has - so I'm probably not doing any harm.)",1294682300

2089130,comment,2088453,2089051,0,0,pzxc,,,"You are using the ""official"" inflation numbers. Do you really think they report it accurately, when so much depends on it -- not just confidence in the economy, but COLA adjustment for our massive social programs, etc. That is like asking an encyclopedia salesman if you should buy an encyclopedia.<p>The official inflation numbers have all kinds of wonky adjustments in them. For one thing, food and energy are not included (because they are too ""volatile"" we are told), yet food and energy are the #1 expense for most American households. Also if something rises in price too fast, they use ""substitution"" (saying that people will buy something else instead of that) and therefore that products inflation is not included in the ""official"" number.<p>It's no different than the games they play with the unemployment numbers -- not including people who have been out of work longer than unemployment covers them, people who have accepted part-time work when they really wanted full-time work, so-called ""discouraged"" workers who have stopped looking, etc.<p>I don't know what products you buy, but I can tell you that where I am the price of milk, bread, and almost everything else I buy has gone up a helluva lot more than 0.8% per year in the last few years. The few products that haven't risen in price considerably, have gone to smaller product sizes/containers.  Some products have done both.<p>Now, I'm doing just fine so inflation isn't much a burden to me -- yet.  But for millions of Americans who are either low-income or worse on a fixed-income, it is a very big deal. Quoting the fed's own numbers about inflation to say everything is alright is like trusting the fox to guard the henhouse -- that is the true definition of a financially illiterate comment.  Don't take their word for something as critical as this, research it yourself and use facts to support your position.<p>And admit to yourself that they have an inherent bias, a conflict of interest, to make things seem rosier than they are, because it allows them to sell public debt, treasury bonds and short-term T-bills, to fund our massive deficits. If they actually reported the truth of everything suckers around the world wouldn't be as likely to let us keep spending trillions more a year than we earn like a teenager who doesn't understand how credit cards work.<p>Call it fear-mongering if you like, I'd rather face the realities of our situation than stick my head in the sand.

When the upload is done I use a JS callback to set the location of the uploaded file (bucket and path) in a hidden field that gets set in the ActiveRecord model when the form is submitted.

You've oversimplifying the complex subject of nutrition.<p>It is now known that it's not as simple as ""calories in - calories burned = weight gain or loss"". The body burns more calories processing some kinds of foods compared to others. The body is less efficient or less encouraged to convert some kinds of excess calories into fat, depending on the source of the calories. It is becoming more clear that insulin plays an important role in a large percentage of cases of obesity, and it turns out most of the most cost effective foods encourage the body to produce the most insulin (and, almost paradoxically, also encourage hunger).<p>Your own example demonstrates my previous point. I would need to eat 18 (!) of those salads you suggested, every day, to merely maintain my weight. Or 5 Big Macs. It's obviously an extreme example, but which do you think poor people would choose? Buying cheap food can make the difference between paying the rent and living on the street.<p>With all due respect, it's ignorant and offensive to blame poor people for all their problems. Having an adequate amount of money makes an astonishing difference in your ability to achieve good nutrition, lower your stress, pursue advanced education, get enough exercise, etc.<p>I know it's popular to blame all poor obese people for their own predicament, but it's simply ignorant.",1294680493

The build out from that was a social dating site which we would monetize.<p>It failed for a few reasons. The concept wasn't well defined, and neither was the problem in all honesty. We were excited about the tech and less so about the execution, spent a lot of time working on the caching code and some framework code etc. and not enough time executing the idea. We never launched (though we could have a couple of times).<p>The other problem was that the idea would have synced with the tech crowd - but probably less so with the mass market, and we didn't put any thought into how to get the idea across to them.<p>It wasn't a total failure; I sold some of the code to another social network startup for a lot more than it was worth. They were a VC backed outfit that floundered shortly afterward - so I wasn't the worst example out there :P",1294679002
