Just because Groupon is growing faster than Google did doesn't mean it has a chance to match Google's total growth. One important thing you left out is timing. When Google started, it was neigh impossible to get to where they have reached without some massive luck.<p>What does that have to do with Groupon and their growth? It seems like every new company that hits the scene, is deemed the next big thing and has a meteoric rise. They come faster, and get bigger, but does that mean they are going to eclipse the giants on the scene? Not without some spectacular luck and smart moves.<p>There are few companies that have planted themselves where Google is, and I don't know if Groupon has the potential or leadership to make it happen.

Typically in the business world that means you start signing up your (potential, pilot) customers <i>before</i> you have a product.<p>Dismissing apps that can't make money as toys is not the same as saying that 'what you produce initially is something other people dismiss as a toy'. Really, they're not even close to being the same thing.<p>> Maybe thats just because my goal is not to make money. It's to build interesting things and have an impact.<p>Yes, that probably has something to do with it. If making money is a secondary goal to you for whatever reason then you are in a luxury situation, one that likely the vast majority of the people out there envy you very much for.<p>The interesting part for me is that typically developing without a monetary incentive to do so leads to lots of wasted time and effort, having a simple and concrete number to measure the success of your application by (turnover vs 'eyeballs') works wonders to stay focused.<p>""Make something people want"" is not a religious item, it's common sense <i>if</i> you want to make money you had better make sure that there is a market for your product. That's the 'want' bit.<p>Developing 'just for eyeballs' or 'impact' or 'personal interest', 'technical fascination' and so on is great but without a monetization strategy you might as well be living in 1999.<p>You keep taking PGs words out of context and applying them to the writing of Paras because in your mind there is a seeming contradiction but I think the similarities are far larger than the differences.<p>YC typically does not invest in companies that have no clear idea of how they plan to make money, even when they're focused on the consumers.",1294666226

They said ""no"", so I quit, and that was that.)<p>Instead I was encouraged to come up with my own activities. I always felt that my parents had great expectations of me, but at the same time they were careful to never actively formulate those expectations into action points. That gave me a sense of responsibility: I knew I was just a child, but at the same time I had been entrusted the serious responsibility of deciding what I should do with my life. Should it include modern art or maybe egyptology? The best way to figure that out was to read books about it. If my parents didn't have a suitable book, I could always walk a few blocks to the library. My friends' lives had a similar degree of liberty. I don't remember us ever minding homework; it was something you could take care of in 15 minutes -- or the next morning at school, if you were feeling lucky.<p>Probably the general atmosphere in Finland in the 1980s played a role in making my childhood such a happy one.

The fun didn't last long: in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed and pulled Finland into a recession, as the Finnish economy had become too reliant on ridiculously profitable exports to the bankrupt Soviet empire.
