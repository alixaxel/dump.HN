2070793,comment,2070258,2070258,0,0,singular,,,"I was using ubuntu on my desktop for a year and a half, and it is most definitely a capable system - these days I just don't think windows on the desktop is an option for the serious hacker - unix tools are just too damn useful, too many open source projects assume you're on a unix, and the various crufty elements of windows are just too painful to bear, no doubt a result of their (quite justifiable given their market) obsession with backwards compatibility.<p>Having said that, linux <i>does</i> have rough edges - for example, I apt-get'd bugzilla the other day, only to realise I didn't need it on that particular box. apt-remove'ing resulted in the setup asking for the (non-existent) db password, then refusing to continue when I didn't supply it.<p>After a bit of googling round and trial-and-error I found a solution (sudo apt-get remove bugzilla3 rather that bugzilla). Had the same issue with virtualbox for a while too, equally irritating.<p>Also, there are the issues that don't quite work nicely like closing the lid killing the whole system, on 2 different laptops.<p>Having said that, I still adore linux;  it's the Millennium Falcon of operating systems and despite the (sometimes quite fun for hackers actually) various fixes and cludges you have to apply, very capable. Having tried various flavours of linux every year or so for the past 10 years, I do think the latest ubuntus are miles, <i>MILES</i> ahead of what came before them, and considerably fewer cludges required than in the past - if things keep on developing at this rate we might actually have a very real windows competitor.<p>I mostly use OS X now (though still do some stuff in ubuntu) as I want an OS that gets out of my way and looks pretty doing it, while retaining the various unix tools I desire (thanks macports!), and that would probably be the system I recommend to a hacker with cash to spend, however linux is genuinely a great option to go for too.<p>/rambling a bit...",1294231495

I'd recently built my own new website, which was pretty much all my social networks on a single page. A friend asked me when he could have his, and after that I knew I was onto something. It turned into OnePage (<a href=""http://myonepage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myonepage.com</a>) and it is doing well, with thousands of users. The problem? revenue was an afterthought, so to fund it I had to keep doing contract work. I tried doing it part time, and then I tried doing a wave of full-time and then a wave of full-time work on OnePage. We tried applying to incubators, too. After a year and a half, I still know there's huge potential in that space (just look at about.me), but I know I need to sort out my income so I can focus.<p>So, when the November Startup Sprint popped up, the timing couldn't have been better. I built my second startup called Buffer (<a href=""http://bufferapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bufferapp.com</a>) with the sole purpose of getting to ramen profitability and using it to free my time. I built the app in about 7 weeks of evenings and launched with payment options from day 1. Fast forward one month until now, and I've had just over a hundred signups, 3 of which are paying. I have a long way to go, but I think this is the method more people should take.<p>Some people want the lifestyle business so they can spend less time working and enjoy life more, others want their finances ""sorted"" so they can hit for the home run.

I think he barely noticed that it wasn't Windows, and I've had no complaints since.  For most purposes the operating system is becoming less important, since many things are now accessed via a web browser.  The main product differentiator is how much maintenance you have to do to keep the OS running well, and in that regard Windows is very high maintenance.",1294229033
