Corruption and graft have become so bad that everyone from the top-most office down to the lowest level refuses to even lift a finger without getting his palm greased. Things have become so bad that officials are willing to cause a loss of billions of dollars to the taxpayer just to make some money (ref. the ""2G scam"").<p>What India needs is a WikiLeaks. And a ""wikileaks"" for corruption, where you can list the name, position, etc. of the officials who are corrupt. It would be a pretty long list, I can imagine.",1294120667

2065954,comment,2065416,2065416,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"This is probably OT and maybe even rude... but that lead-in with the Kanye lyrics is just strange.<p>My reading of the lyrics snippet (and I'm certainly no expert in these things) suggests that the character is telling a girl to run away from him because he knows he's a dick. Specifically, he's a dick that's especially good at criticism and spreading negativity and of the list of targets, one group happens to be people who work a lot which implies to me that the character's less-than-hardworking nature looks bad by comparison.<p>So not only is the character a dick, he's a self-professed underachieving one and perhaps even proud of it. He might even be worried that the girl is one of those kinds of people he hates, or maybe he kinda cares for her and knows his personality is toxic on some level, or he just can't have nice things, or there happens to be a hotter girl one table over so this one has to go...<p>Anyway, it's just odd because it seems like the character that is ""speaking"" in the song is exactly the sort of guy who might bitch about how troublesome smart people are because he's always got to be the smartest guy in the room but refuses to put in the work required to remain the smartest guy in the room when there's other <i>actual</i> smart guys in the room. So the best solution in that case is to get rid of the others by telling them to ""run away as fast as you can.""<p>In summary, it seems to me like the lyrics are actually speaking more as a person who hates over-achievers and/or smart people than as a person who is one of those troublesome smart persons who hates average folk and therefore would appear to, well, not really support the author's actual argument. Or something?<p>I don't know. I'm probably not one of the smart ones. so... :P",1294118276

There are tons of other problems if you focus on human-driven cars: drunk drivers, the need for designated drivers, comparatively high risk of being killed or maimed, having your kids nag you or someone else if they want to experience the world outside of their neighborhood, driving course costs (oh wait, in America we don't have to pay... in Europe, well, I hope you have several thousand euros). There are so many issues that they greatly outweigh the ones in a properly-made public transit system.

I figured that there wouldn't be any superficial differences, but I knew that there were architectural ones that I'd run into eventually and maybe I could learn a little more about how different OSes worked.<p>One thing I did notice right away was that the console felt different. It felt like it was maybe more responsive somehow, and not just when it was scrolling a wall of text. It even felt different when I was typing. Somehow, typing at a console (not in X, not via SSH) <i>felt</i> better in FreeBSD than it did in Linux. I couldn't tell you why, and I didn't really understand it myself. It wasn't something I could measure, or even describe, but it left me feeling like FreeBSD was more than 'just like Linux'.<p>I only used it for a day or so before I realized that I'd screwed up the partitioning and wiped out my Windows partition, and so had to re-reformat, but it left a profound impression.<p>I feel like iOS is the same way. All the Android phones I've tried (including a friend's Nexus One) have been, theoretically, the same as an iPhone in terms of features and capabilities and even hardware, but even before I got into using them in depth there was just something that felt a little off about tapping on icons or scrolling lists, and I could never put my finger on it, so to speak. Perhaps it's just design decisions or usage patterns that I'd internalized already, but I've always felt like it was something more. Maybe the scrolling behaviour is something I picked up on unconsciously, because while I don't remember it being slow or jerky, I do remember it didn't <i>feel</i> right.<p>Perhaps the numbers-oriented engineers at Google can't quantify it and so don't prioritize it, or maybe they just don't think it's worth wasting time on, but I think consumers, in the end, will notice.
