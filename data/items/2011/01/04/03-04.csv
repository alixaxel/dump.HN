The JVM is not without its quirks and challenges, but it’s a mature platform with well-known performance characteristics and a vast archive of libraries, particularly in the financial services world we find ourselves in.</i><p><i>We use the JVM in a non-traditional way. Our backend services are written in Scala, Clojure, or a mix of the both (making use of a thin compatibility layer we’re developing). Our web frontend is written in Ruby, and can be run on JRuby in production. This polyglot programming approach allows us to leverage the strengths of each language while still operating on a common platform. One could argue that it would be simpler to pick one language and stick with it, but that presumes that all problems are equally well solved in any one language.</i><p>Other than the vast archive of libraries, which are not necessarily going to be straightforward or similar to use across the languages on the JVM, one could still leverage the strengths of individual languages while still operating on a common platform, such as x86_64.  Does the addition of another abstraction layer that provides the same interface (the languages) but that you don't really interface with directly really have that many (significant or otherwise) advantages?",1294112622

Load balancing isn't just for ultra high volume sites that need multiple machines.  The main use case I have for load balancing has to do with reliability, particularly when it's time to do OS patches.  Most of my projects are games that have people from around the world hammering on them. It's become impossible to find a good time of day to bring things down for a couple of minutes while I reboot after an OS patch or upgrade how much memory a machine has.<p>* Server configuration. Automatically handling the webserver configuration is a great value to the customers.  But it's helpful to know if it's deployed in a multi-threaded way like Apache MPM-Worker vs MPM-Prefork.<p>* Database replication, and/or automated data backup. How it works, and how you can restore.<p>I'm currently using Rackspace for all my stuff, and liking it.  But I'm not really looking forward to getting into HA-Proxy, and figuring out how to get the keep-alives and so on configured properly.  Perhaps I should have just used amazon, with their dizzying array of loadbalancing and database options.  The thing that has kept me away, though, is the complexity involved in learning all of their product offerings and my complete inability to understand how much it'll cost. (It's like it'll be easy to figure out how much it'll cost after you've been live for a while.  With Rackspace, on the other hand, it was comparatively straightforward.)

It's probably okay to get going at the very beginning.  But if you want to really learn PHP, especially the new additions for PHP 5.3 then I suggest looking the code and using a PHP 5.3 framework.  Look for a really small one so that you can see everything in the framework without having to look through a ton of files.  Fatfree is one good example.

I wouldn't just not show up like the guy in the story but I do have depressive cycles where I'm not sure I'm doing any good by showing up; I come in anyway. After a while the cycle swings the other way and I get heroic coding done at a (excuse the pun) manic pace. I like to think it comes out more productive on balance. For instance most recently I spent two months studying legacy code  but didn't have the right frame of mind to make changes to it. Close to the deadline I had an upswing in mood and completed a total rewrite of the software in three days during which everything I touched turned to gold.  Two key points: one, this was (embedded system) code a senior engineer struggled on for 2 years. So even averaging the month during which I did nothing with the week I did everything, I was still more productive by a huge margin. The second key point is I used both halves of my cycle to advantage. I knew I couldn't handle the rewrite while depressed, but what I COULD do was use that fugue state to plod through his old code like a zombie. Even though I didn't feel like I was making progress (and my boss was beginning to worry!) what I was doing was priming my brain with knowledge of what the legacy code did. That way, when the upswing did come, I didn't waste a single second of it.",1294110649
