2065665,comment,2063616,2064581,0,0,mich-unhosted,,,"i can see your point, but there are some differences. the main one is that freenet is anonymous, and unhosted is not. i think unhosted is, if anything, most similar to SMTP: a protocol with which an application, that is inherently 'hosted' (uses persistence on online servers), can be 100% decentralized (bar its dependence on DNS). Instead of centralized, as is the default these days for internet apps. All its weaknesses apart, we should thank SMTP for being an alternative to a centralized facebook-messages. ;) Unhosted wants to create a decentralization layer for web apps to run on.",1294109937

Better questions to explore would be<p>Q(a) ""What is the value of the mobile payments sphere?"" \nQ(b) ""Is the industry growing, or on the decline?""  and \nQ(c) ""Are there any current industry leaders?  If so, what percent of the market have they captured?""<p>My take:<p>A(a) Completely speculative; because the valuation of the industry depends upon the adoption of a specific kind of hardware in this case, the valuation of one startup in an untapped sphere is basically irrelevant.<p>A(b) Mobile payments, just like ""mobile"" everything else, is an industry that is on the incline.  Ergo:  probably a good industry to play with risk.<p>A(c) Not yet.  There will be a ""first-mover advantage"" for the first company that attains modest adoption (Square seems to be headed there).  But there is also a LOT of room for competitors to build a better revenue model that diverges from the traditional one.  Square's current business strategy seems to echo the very old-fashioned credit card machine model of making revenue per transaction (which is something that most business owners detest).<p>And an Extra Credit Q:  . . .<p>ECQ(d)  Is the future headed toward having more buyers or more sellers of the kinds of transactions that a ""mobile payments"" system would help grow?<p>Some interesting things to think about.  ;)",1294109456

If thorium reactors had fewer spectacular commercial failures (e.g. [1]), it's largely because they had fewer commercial attempts.<p>(That's not to concede that SFR failures were entirely commercial -- political obstruction was a large factor too. Both anti-nuclear opposition in general (post-Three Mile Island and post-Chernobyl) as well as specific, extremely misguided opposition to plutonium breeding. Argonne's IFR project was killed for this second reason [2]).<p>><i>Thorium-based designs seem more realistic and useful, I wonder why this is not investigated more: it is more common than uranium and produces less nuclear waste than uranium-based designs.</i><p>There's no meaningful distinction between FBRs and thorium reactors in fuel supply -- both have theoretically thousands of years of potential, so that it's silly to call this a factor. Nor is there a significant difference in waste production. (Though if I remember right, some minor actinides can only be efficiently destroyed by fast neutrons. This isn't an important difference; MAs are a small component, so you can augment a thermal-reactor fuel cycle with dedicated ""waste burners"" (e.g. [3] [4]) and still have a mostly-thorium fuel cycle).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THTR-300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THTR-300</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/oleary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/inter...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://energyfromthorium.com/2009/11/11/lftr-and-msrs-achieve-the-doe-nes-goals/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyfromthorium.com/2009/11/11/lftr-and-msrs-achiev...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2002/nea3109.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2002/nea3109.html</a>",1294108095

There is a tremendous amount of economic research to support this.<p>Of course, I agree with you that printing money does not always create wealth. Far from it. There are many cases in which it does not create wealth. Highly inflationary economies are a good example of this.<p>But if you re-read the three situations I describe, you will see that they do indeed describe places that the printing of money will create wealth that would not have existed otherwise without the printing of money, and which are above and beyond the mere reallocation of wealth.<p>Perhaps to better understand why your point is not true is to understand your claim from a different perspective: that the money supply should <i>always</i> stay exactly constant, year after year.<p>Even a cursory understanding of my first point (that economic growth in and of itself requires a corresponding increase in the money supply) shows this to not be true. Imagine the economy grows and the money supply stays constant. The value of products available per dollar now increases annually. This is deflation.<p>Now you are implicitly claiming that deflation is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>To read more on deflation, see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation</a>",1294108039
