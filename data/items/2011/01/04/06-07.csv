But it's true that they've used the iPod connector for ages and that it's been very nice to be able to use any iPod cables laying around to charge pretty much anything they've built since.<p>As Erik pointed out, it'd be nice to see something super easy to plug. I've never had much problems with the iPod connector, maybe due to the build quality. But USB (of all sizes, but regular USB in particular) has often times been a problem. It needs to either accept to be plugged upside-down or to be very simple to identify which side is up. USB is super frustrating on the latter.",1294124357

You know how a website uses facebook connect to authenticate a user? Well, what is to prevent you from going into the javascript and searching for your uid and changing it to e.g. #4, mark zuckerberg, or that of Mike Arrington, before posting something to the server?<p>Is there protection against this on the websites?<p>Today, I fooled around with DISQUS and used the javascript console to try and fool it into thinking I was someone else. But I think that with DISQUS, they rely on the cookie (not the uid in javascript) when you post the comment, so you can't impersonate other users. However, if we go back to my original question -- how do websites which implement authentication with facebook, google, etc. protect against such impersonations?",1294123943

2066141,comment,2065604,2065883,0,0,pyre,,,"I think that 'not being straight-up about things' is breaking things down <i>waaay</i> too generally. This guy basically found a way to 'cut in line' so that the woman could evaluate whether or not she liked him. She still got to choose whether she liked him or not based on the qualities that he possesses. He just made sure that he actually got a chance to be evaluated.<p>Another analogy would be like finding a way to make sure that your resume isn't one of the ones that is immediately thrown out by some HR person before being forwarded to the hiring manager. The hiring manager still gets to evaluate you based on your skills, but you just made sure that he/she even <i>looked</i> at your skills (vs being cut from the list for some arbitrary reason).<p>On the other hand, a girl having her best friend hit on you to see if you'll cheat demonstrates a fundamental lack of trust in the relationship. Regardless of the outcome, she's already demonstrated that she doesn't feel that she can trust you. This is a far deeper cut than convincing all of the extremely 'hunky' guys at a bar to leave (for some reason or another; maybe spread a rumor that the bar next door is giving away power tools or hair gel or something) so that you even have a chance with some of the attractive women there.<p>For some reason, it's just the 'pretending to be someone that you are not <i>on the internet</i>' that makes people throw up the 'creepy' flag. If I was to pretend to be someone that I'm not in real life, people would <i>not</i> immediately think that I was creepy.

However, I'm not sure I understand your comment as this concept that you are referring to is part of the point that I was trying to make.<p>What happens specifically to the S&P 500 would not be the primary concern for an investor whose portfolio consists of a wide variety of asset classes and who follows a glide path approach by reducing their allocation to stocks (and increasing their allocation to bonds) over time.  Thus an investor using this approach would not be 100% invested in the S&P 500 at the beginning or the end horizon (or at any point in between) of their investment.<p>I guess my point is that even just adjusting this data to include a 60%/40% equity/bond portfolio, rebalanced annually would be a heck of a lot more useful for retirement planning.",1294122566

Good experience, summarized, so go read it!<p>It reminds me of something I've spent a good amount of time pondering in the last few years: survivor bias in the tech news reporting world and the duality of things an entrepreneur most hold in his/her head and heart.<p>On the one hand: as entrepreneurs we must believe the impossible; a premium is placed on bringing a new idea or a gamechanging technology into the mix. In general, this idea must have horrible flaws, extreme difficulties, and significant unproven assumptions, or someone else would likely have done it.<p>So, on the one hand, we must be largely blind to downside risk while working on something that we have essentially 'sold' ourselves on.<p>On the other hand, we are typically using other people's money to go do this impossible thing. And, equally importantly, we are spending our own valuable time -- time that could be spent with our family, essentially, as PG commented in an essay, we are adding significant misery to our lives.<p>Survivor bias means we don't hear about all the unfunded, unsuccessful startups in the news. I know this -- there are a lot. I think this is likely the most difficult thing a startup entrepreneur faces; the requirement to both blind oneself to downside risk so that the journey can be fundraised for and begun and also the ability to unblind oneself when key decisions are made, decisions that impact other people's lives -- employees, spouses, investors.<p>Add to that the fundamentally speculative nature of the business, and I would call it a tough job! One that pays, on average, really well. Or, on average (minus every company you read about in TechCrunch) extremely poorly.<p>I am therefore currently spending more time trying to encourage people starting businesses to erase their downside risk first; figure out how to make it work and get it financially sustainable as early as possible.
