Better than the iPhone 3G and 3GS.<p>- The default keyboard was very poor: inaccurate and horrible to use, even with some tactile feedback turned on. I switched to Swype a few weeks back and now can't imagine using anything else. Typing on my gf's iPhone is a horrible experience in comparison.<p>- The HTC customisations are surprisingly nice (I removed them for two weeks to test the alternatives and went back).<p>- Web browsing is not as fast, but provides a better experience.<p>- No iTunes. I can't stand the application, and being able to manage my music using a simple folder structure was a breath of fresh air.<p><i>Cons</i><p>- The apps are not as polished as those available for the iPhone and not as numerous. Your favourite and most-used apps may not be available.<p>- Contact management <i>can</i> be a bit of a pain (more in a moment).<p><i>How should you prepare for the switch?</i><p>- If you don't already, get yourself a Google account. It will make life so much easier.<p>- Get yourself over to <a href=""http://www.google.com/contacts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/contacts</a> and correct mistakes, merge contacts that it, and remove any unnecessary entries. If you don't, it'll cause havoc when/if you import your Google contacts into your phone.<p><i>Conclusion</i><p>- I wish I had moved to Android (or, more specifically, Android on a HTC Desire) sooner.<p>- I've had no regrets about moving.<p>- My girlfriend (a bigger nerd than me) is convinced: when her iPhone contract ends she's already said she'll be switching.",1294817548

Initially many companies went and got a lot of cheap and mediocre developers (mostly through outsourcing) and replaced a couple good ones with dozens of average ones for the same price. They saw it as a deal. Eventually they are realizing that programming is not like picking potatoes -- ""Just hire more for the same price, they all sit and type all day anyway, so just get more for cheaper and we'll get ahead faster"". Well it doesn't work like that.<p>Once mediocrity starts to dominate, even the few good ones who are still hanging around, will leave as their work turns to teaching others and babysitting them full time.<p>In general it is not possible to replace a highly skilled programmer with an X number of less skilled ones.  Many hit that realization and we start seeing lots of these types of articles even as unemployment is above 10%",1294816634
