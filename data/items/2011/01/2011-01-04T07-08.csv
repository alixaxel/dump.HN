In fact, I’ve just tested if the problem happens for GET passed values and it does. Not all the passed data to a website is treated as a number, so not all websites with the PHP versions and configuration that could fail with this bug will be vulnerable, but definitely there is going to be a huge amount of websites that will do. This is really scaring.<p>I hope the PHP team patch it soon.<p>Meanwhile, a possible workaround would be adding this line at the very top of the execution of php website:<p>if (strpos(str_replace('.', '', serialize($GLOBALS)), '22250738585072011')!==false) die();<p>This will stop execution if any decimal version of the number were passed as parameter. Note that 222.50738585072011e-310 cause problems too, and any of the other possibilities to write it.<p>Do you know if there are any other possible ways to write the number that causes trouble too?",1294127988

That particular application is extremely parallel, numerically heavy, and should tolerate the loss of precision very well.

2066278,comment,2066084,2066219,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"It just depends on how the crash is triggered. Most things that users run into in normal usage don't have very much potential to become a serious attack vector for lots of reasons -- many programs are not particularly network-aware or may not provide any service an attacker is interested in denying, the attack may require local access (which is still serious in some cases, but obviously less than something that can be exploited over the network by sending a malformed query),  and so on.<p>I think that the vast majority of stuff doesn't qualify as something that should be reported to a security team first. However, from a brief glance at the article, it appears that a remote user of a web application may be able to crash PHP entirely if he can find the right place to drop the number, denying access to all programs that depend on that PHP installation. That is a very serious bug and one incident can theoretically take out hundreds or thousands of sites and cost a lot of people a lot of money, not to mention time or frustration. Definitely seems like it should have hit the security group first to me.",1294127900
2066277,comment,2065526,2065526,0,0,nkurz,,,"I've tried using Square as a small business owner, and their model generally makes sense to me.  We're not using them for our primary credit card processing needs, though.  I think there are still some kinks that they need to work out.<p>The positive:<p>You can be up and running from zero to accepting a credit card within an hour.  Compared to the traditional alternatives, this is incredible.<p>Their rates are reasonable.  We do slightly better on the interchange-plus merchant account we use, but they aren't bad.<p>The mobile phone card reader is free, and works with both iPhone and Android.<p>The mixed:<p>Their customer service reputation isn't great.  If you read their online forums, there a quite a few people that feel they aren't paid promptly.    Seems like things are getting better though, and kudos to them for having an open forum!<p>They seem to have trouble getting the devices to people promptly.  It seems like it might be worth a negotiating a packet rate with Fedex to get these there overnight, or at least to make sure they get in the mail immediately.<p>The negative:<p>The experience at least on Android isn't great.  It feels like an app that was ported by an intern and then forgotten.   There's a settings icon that takes you where the menu button should, and the back button doesn't actually work.  For example, I started the app right now to refresh my memory, and I'm at the login page and can't figure out a way to get back to the first page without killing the app.<p>The GPS location trick is cute, but can't be turned off.  If you are using the phone inside a store, it constantly searches for a GPS signal.<p>The reader (at least on Android) is flaky.  It reads a card eventually, but seems to take 3-5 attempts.  Worse, if you tap the reader in any way, it thinks you've tried to scan a card.  This said, it seems like it's better on iPhone.<p>My advice to them:  Raise more money, and spend it on improving the mobile applications and lowering the fees as much as possible.  Low cost and simple is great marketing. Somehow get the reader into users' hands the next day after they sign up.  And make sure it works.<p>Our current solution:  We're using an interchange plus pricing model from <a href=""http://vantagecard.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vantagecard.com</a>. They seem good so  far.  They resell for Global Payments, who are pretty awful to deal with directly.  For our store, we use a wireless Verifone Vx610 --- works, but difficult to set up and expensive.  For mobile, we use Inner Fence on Android (free) and iPhone (99 cents) and an Authorize.net Gateway ($10/month).  Both are pretty good.  We have a $50 iMag Reader for iPhone that works well to scan cards; on Android we have to punch in manually.  Which really is to say that we'd love to be using Square if it was a little better implemented.<p>I think they have a decent chance of transforming the market if they can get their act together. Their ease of setup, and the fact that you only have deal with them and not 4-5 different entities, gives them a tremendous leg up.  $200M?  Yes, if they can pull it off.",1294127889
2066275,comment,2064060,2064710,0,0,Misha_B,,,"Agreed, but I could imagine one implication that might be  revolutionary for urban areas. With driverless cars, it might easily become much more economical not to own a car at all. Even when one does own a car, they don't have to park it within short walking distance form their destination, as the car parks itself.
Free from strict parking requirements and regualtions cities can become much more friendly to pedestrians, and buildings (especially medium-high ones) may become cheaper and more free in their design.",1294127848

A floating-point multiplier/divider, then, turns into a fairly small adder, which is much smaller and faster. Square roots and squaring turn into bit shifting. They have some clever method for doing addition/subtraction efficiently. And since they can fit all this in a small area with short critical paths, they can clock it very, very fast, and include a lot of them on a chip.",1294127731

Choosing specific stocks is meaningless: given perfect knowledge about events, of course you can make a ton of money.  For example, your retirement plan in 1990 could have been ""buy a million shares of Apple"".  You would be exceedingly wealthy today.  But your plan could have been ""buy a million shares of Wang"", in which case, you'd be a welfare recipient.  The key to getting rich is to be able to predict the future perfectly.<p>This is difficult, so people average it out and choose something like the S&P 500.

The bank's total reserves must equal at least 10% of their outstanding liabilities, which includes customer savings and checking accounts, in the same way that outstanding gift cards are considered liabilities for retailers.  When a bank lends you money, they're really just signing a piece of paper that says, ""we've given this person X dollars"", thus it counts as a liability, in that somebody could come calling for that money.<p>When you deposit physical cash, the bank gains an asset, ie: that cash.  It gains an equal liability, ie: the amount it credits your account.  Thus the sum total of the amounts deposited and the amounts loaned must not exceed 10X the amount it either has in its safes, or that it has stored with the central bank.",1294127519

So not having mutable state is not a good argument against modeling them as objects in an object-oriented language.<p>Secondly, rules do have state, in so far as one rule is distinct from another. Perhaps a rule has preconditions (which could be represented as a binary tree and evaluated through recursion) that must be true before the rule is ""active"". Perhaps rules have effects, a list of state changes that they impose on the rest of the game world. You could model these as functions, or alternatively again as trees, evaluated through recursion. If the rule system needs to be flexible enough, they could be serializable and deserializable from a text or binary format.<p>If the game is a simple one, with a fixed set of rules that never change, there's little need for this. But if you look at a game like Monopoly, there's a lot of complexity that comes up in real-life games that isn't so simple to encapsulate in rule lists, such as making complex deals, haggling, borrowing money from other players, even receiving charitable donations from other players to prevent the game ending prematurely.<p>Move further into business rule systems and the need for flexibility increases again.
