The initial complaints are due to the apps you want to use requiring Java and Flash, that's independent of the OS, and would be the case with any Operating System that could use Java and Flash. You could of course said no to the updates.<p>Furthermore, it's completely unnecessary to install Avast, you can install Microsoft Security Essentials, free, and it works great. Microsoft can't bundle it, since they would be charged with monopolistic practices.<p>Your OEM provider installed a Norton trial, that also has nothing to do with Windows. Windows 7 only creates 2 Program Files if you're using a 64bit operating system. The (x86) is the 32bit programs, whereas the Program Files are native 64bit, it makes it a bit clearer when uninstalling or organizing your system.
