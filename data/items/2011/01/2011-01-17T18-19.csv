I can only tell you the truth - it takes a long time for the pain to <i>subside</i>, but it never truly goes away. The only thing you can do is to talk with friends and family and to tell stories about your dad to keep his memory alive. It's been 13 years or so since then and recently I got married and we had our first kid. We ""adopted"" a very good family friend to be a surrogate grandmother to our son, not in replacement of my mom but just to fill the void.<p>I know this goes against the ethos of HN, but life is really not about software.

2113001,comment,2111671,2111671,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Hardly.<p>Apple could certainly avoid continuing to innovate and continuing to compete and get eaten by competitors (especially Android in the mobile space). However, there's still plenty of room at the top for Apple. The developing world is a huge, and growing market. And smartphones and similar devices are likely to be a huge business there for a variety of reasons.<p>Moreover, Apple is better poised than ever to compete against Microsoft on MS's own turf (business computing). Computing devices that take advantage of ubiquitous networking and heavily rely on managed applications (in the style of iOS) are almost certainly the wave of the future in enterprise computing. The era of ad-hoc application deployment is on the wane, managed applications will be a huge boon to enterprise IT, and to users as well. There is still a lot of work that needs to happen before that vision can be realized though, but Apple certainly has as much, if not more, of an opportunity there as anyone.<p>To a quick approximation I'd say that Apple could grow its revenue by a factor of maybe 5-10 in the near future without having to do much heavy lifting, merely by continuing to keep up (and occasionally get ahead) in what it's already doing (in phones, computers, and music). And it could grow by another factor of 2-10 in the near future (10-20 years-ish) if it made significant investments and pushed into new markets. They'll probably do the former, the latter is probably more unlikely.",1295290394

Ignorance at its greatest. As long as millions of people continue to use smart phones, the OS will continue to hold great significance. What ever replaces iOS or Android will be based off them, so it's important not to pass of these OS's just because a new OS will replace them. People are spending a huge portion of their lives on their phones. The OS is what they are interacting with, and even a slight change in the interface or functionality can leave a lasting impression on users. Mobile OS's are very, very important, and concluding that they're useless without any justification whatsoever is simply crazy.",1295288591

It's not just a design sense (like Ive), nor a good sense of what consumers really ""want."" And there are plenty of downsides to this unique gift. (We can all cite plenty of examples.)<p>I don't think we've seen that from anyone else, even at Apple, over the years, so there's no real replacement possible.<p>I think it's even spilled over to Pixar's success, which is pretty amazing.<p>(Maybe Alan Kay rivals it, in a different world.)",1295287347

And of course, if they're smart they simply oversubscribe in a query (or temporally space out a query), and then pinpoint the data they are looking for locally.<p>Given they have 2000+ employees this is just a process that is looking to be constantly abused.  I surely don't expect people aren't talking about it, but I'm nearly as confident that it is happening in a way that most people aren't aware of.  No evidence, but again, I've seen people do worse, with less access.",1295287299

Now its just scary to hear anything about them.  And i use it as a rulebook of how not to do youre infrastructure.  Im amazed facebook works at all frankly.  I also think its one of the ugliest sites ive ever used.  Its what 5 years old now and they still dont even have some basic functionality on it.
