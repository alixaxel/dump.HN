Sending 500k messages a month with Amazon is $50, and with SendGrid it's $400.<p>If you send that level of email a month (which is easy to do if you send a weekly newsletter to a few hundred thousand users) you're now talking about saving yourself a few grand a year with Amazon.<p>Given the ""switch"" can be as simple as changing some SMTP settings, this is a big deal. I don't think the people who jump ship are necessarily hyper-price-sensitive customers.  Amazon is just turning this service into a commodity.",1296021585

2142341,comment,2129755,2130433,0,0,_sebkom,,,"A couple of months ago I decided to use Python for my (undergraduate) dissertation project. I assumed that the newest version of the language is the one to go with. And everything was fine until a few days ago when I discovered finding a library to draw simple graphs that is compatible with Python 3 requires quite an effort.<p>Now I have to either take everything back to 2.7 or keep believing that I will finally manage to work it out with 3.<p>How is that going to kill the ""momentum"" I received and change my feelings about Python? It's not going to change them. I enjoyed every single moment of coding so far, even those very first ones where I kept inserting curly brackets everywhere. So, if it fits my needs, I am going to use it in future projects as well.<p>How is that going to change the industry's feelings about Python? Who knows? But I doubt the industry worries about ""momentum"". If you are using 2.7, keep using it until Python 3 is usable for your. If you are not using Python yet but you want to, do your research beforehand (something I falsely didn't do) and decide what's best.<p>Now, how long is it going to take for the major libraries/frameworks to be Python 3 compatible, nobody can tell. And it's funny as we are approaching the ""3.2"" version already.<p>But, honestly, who cares? Is a number more important than the language itself?",1296021528

Twitter is accessible natively (from their own web page/applications) and via third party applications over their API. I imagine the connection flow goes like this:<p>you -> native twitter -> you<p>Or<p>you -> 3rd party app -> twitter -> you<p>From what it sounds like, that is the path because it is the link to twitter that is being severed[1] and ultimately you can neither make the request for data nor receive a response.<p>Now what if the 3rd party app proxied your requests like so:<p>you -> 3rd party app -> twitter -> 3rd party app -> you<p>That way the 3rd party app would need to be blocked. Which is obviously a much more difficult problem as there are more than one of them. The only downside would be more bandwidth consumption for the 3rd party app.<p>If 3rd party apps routed messages through their ip's wouldn't this instantly become a much more difficult problem for the blockers?<p>[1]I'm talking about lower level blocking here at the dns or ip level.

2142311,comment,2140354,2141513,0,0,vlad,,,"If a data structure can be arbitrarily long, this implies some kind of a data structure involving a linked list to avoid wasting memory.  Unfortunately, it really is a bare-bones linked list, which means that we don't know the length until we traverse it.<p>What would we have done if we knew the length?  We could pick a random number between 1 and the length, and then traverse that many items to get to our random item.  Since we don't know the length, it means the question is, how will you know where to stop?<p>Constant growth for storage means you start with a fixed number of slots (lets call this number X) and keep them through the process.  You could put items into these X slots, such as one out of every ten that you pass.  That would mean you could pick items by rolling a 10-sided dice that shows a 10, and put them into one of the slots.<p>A problem is that you would have to remove past randomly-selected numbers to make room for new ones, and you would be biased towards items that appear later in the series.  This would not be random.<p>And what about a string one character long (in this case, we can pretend we had been given an array, a string, a queue, or whatever) ? What if, at the start, we always select the first item to be the random choice?  That would mean that an abrupt stop would give us the correct answer for a length of one.  Another interesting thing is that we can store item one into a single container, instead of needing X (where X is a constant) slots.<p>What about two?  Well, we would compare the container with item two and decide that the random choice for the container should be either what it already contains (item one) or item two, with a 50/50 split.  Great!  So our algorithm works for a length of one as well as two.<p>This is starting to feel like we've established a base case (what happens when the list has only one item?).  We may be on track to show that constantly looking at the next item and comparing it to the one in the container may just work.  If so, we could have a proof by induction.<p>So if we were at item three where the whole list is only three items long, then a random generator would have picked it with a probability of 1/3.  So if we're comparing item three to whatever is in the container, then if a 3-sided dice rolls a 1, we can set container to be item three.  That works.  But what about the other 2/3 chance, where it could be item one or two?  In that 2/3 chance, we pick the container.  The container contains only one item (the first or the second, whichever one won the first coin flip previously.)  For this to be a valid idea, both item one and item two should have had a fair chance to be in the container currently with a 50/50 split, correct?  And we know that it was.<p>So when we come to item four, we replace the container with item four with a probability of 1/4, or use the value in the container with probability of 3/4 (e.g. 1-1/4 = 3/4, or the rest of the time.)  The point is that at each step, the container contains the random value of the previous n-1 number of items.",1296020588

You are forced to give write permission to every app out there before being allowed to sign in to their site to do trivial things, and then they start spamming your feed and harvesting your data. When you try to turn it off there is no off switch that can be found. It's insane.<p>It's the same level of intrusion as if you wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper and by sending your opinion on local parking fees, the newspaper is given access to your private mail, is allowed to set up cameras inside your house, and asserts that you agreed the newspaper's publisher can have sex with your daughter.<p>What the hell does any of that have to do with submitting an editorial letter?<p>What it has to do is this system ALLOWS them to invade your privacy, so they REQUIRE you to give up your privacy and allow them to invade it in order to do things like post comments or vote in polls that have nothing at all to do with any of what they demand they must have.<p>It's an abusive system that violates consumers.",1296019720
