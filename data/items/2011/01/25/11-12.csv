Square's dongle lets people take payments.  Square could make a new dongle that receives NFC signals and runs it thru the payment processing backend to let people take payments with their phones, the way they do for credit cards.<p>If Apple wants wide adoption, they will have to make payment taking an open opportunity, because there are so many different situations where people take credit cards now.  So Square could plug into that, and would be competing with Apple to provide payment reception hardware and sofware to retailers-- which is the kind of competition Apple really likes, because Apple is in the platform business, rather than the ""selling low volume terminals to retailers"" business.  So, I think Square will be able to plug into Apple's platform, just as they plug into Visa's platform now.",1295953695

This on the otherhand is no more, no less.<p>* I fond you by literally coming to HN, clicking the search link at the bottom and searching for ""feedback widgets""... so there's a good place to start optimizing for potential customer searches.<p>* The only gripe I have is that it would be awesome (and kinda important) if the system emailed you whenever you got a feedback response or answer. The email doesn't necessarily need to contain the full user feedback, but just a notification and link to the full response on the site.<p>* Also once I signed-up and was presented with the code, there were no instructions at all. I've done enough coding/hacking to know that the code probably went in the <head> so that's what I did.... refreshed the page... nothing... moved the code to before </body>... refreshed page... nothing... searched for instructions on your site... nothing... finally discovered that you had to actually add a question before anything displays.<p>So obviously here, it would be an idea to have basic instructions with the code (e.g. ""copy/paste just before </head>""). I'd also have the default ""We hear voices. Do you?"" question added to the user's account as a default that the user can then be prompted to edit. And thus you'd solve both the problems I listed above.<p>* Pricing: please don't charge anything for a basic implementation of this. Perhaps the free option gives you 20-30 user feedbacks/answers per month. Once you hit that limit, the widget just doesn't display to users (and thus no further feedback). Then you could stage it up... $5-10 per month for 50 feedback and so on.<p>Anyway, I hope that helps :)",1295953605

Amazon are using third parties to supply the goods, so one grocery order might be 4 or 5 separate deliveries.
