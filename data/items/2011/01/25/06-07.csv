It doesn't matter what you use to do the viewing, the eye, a ccd, anything. The information is simply not there, no matter how you magnify it.<p>That limit is called the diffraction limit, and it's related to the size of the lens used to collect the light. It sort of has to do with the fact that photons passing near the edge of the lens get distorted.<p>Dawes number is simply a calculation of the diffraction limit.<p>So that ""small dot"" that is really a flag, no matter how well you magnify it, will just look like a blur. The photons that used to show details about it have been scrambled enough that those details are lost.<p>Regarding the two collectors.<p>They are talking about two small telescopes placed far apart. They compare the image collected by both telescopes and using that they are able to synthesize information about the object that is not visible using just one telescope. But it's no longer a matter of just looking at it.<p>I'm sorry that I don't understand it well enough to give a simpler explanation of how that works.<p>I don't know if you read lord of the rings, but there is a scene where Legolas looks at riders at a great distance and can see details that the humans can't. Supposedly because of his keen eyesight. But actually it's impossible. Assuming that his eyes were about the same size as human eyes, he simply can not see those details, no matter how good of a retina he had.
