2111142,comment,2077484,2077484,0,0,max_okcupid,,,"I thought I'd answer a few questions raised below:<p>(1) I've recently made a few updates to the wiki, adding a pointer to the new subversion repository:  svn://svn3.okws.org/okws2/devel/3.1.  I'm still actively checking in fixes and smallish new features, but there won't be any big changes over the next few months.<p>(2) OKWS and all services written for OKWS are single-threaded, non-blocking asynchronous processes.  All  database calls  still go through RPC-to-SQL translators, as mentioned in the paper.  File system I/O goes through libasync's aiod system: a small blocking helper process does the file I/O, and the main process communicates with the helper over asynchronous RPC.<p>(3) The documentation is horrible, I realize.  I never quite find the time to do a good job of updating the wiki, or fully documenting what's there.  If anyone wants to help me on that, please contact me! Variable names often truncate vowels, true.  I'm stuck on 80-column mode and hate line wraps.   If you write OKWS subclasses (as you do when you make new OKWS services), you can add vowels to taste.<p>(4) We actually think that given the size of our team (~10 engineers), we get features out pretty quickly.  When things take a while, it's not that we use C++, it's that either the feature is a challenging technical problem that's deeper than language choice, or there's a ton of front-end work required (i.e., compatibility with two mobile apps and two HTML versions of the  site).<p>As for why we wrote OKWS, and was that a good idea, one important thing to realize is that the landscape was quite different back in 2003 when we started OkCupid.  Since then, threading on Linux has improved, and multicore is where the performance gains are.  Also, we've seen RoR and Django get big.<p>So a good question is: if we were starting OkCupid again now, and if OKWS existed as is, would we chose it over RoR, Django, PHP, etc?   Maybe.   OKWS has some really nice features now that make is worth considering, such as: (a) the tame source-to-source C++ translation system mentioned by aston below.  It's a great way to manage server-side concurrency, and I prefer it over threads.  It's most similar to twisted in Python, but I prefer tame's syntax (perhaps I am biased).  (b) The ""pub"" templating system.  There are of course many HTML templating systems out there today, but the ""pub"" system built into OKWS gives a natural split between front-end and back-end programming tasks; (c) Performance --- we're still serving tens of thousands of pages a second from a few dinky web servers.  These pages are 99% dynamic!  We draw every page from scratch, more or less.  If we wrote OkCupid in Python, we'd need about 10x the number of machines, and our serving bills would increase.  (d) Caching -- the OKWS architecture allows simple single-process caches, which are really fast compared to going to memcache or shared memory systems. (e) Security and robustness --- we're still able to separate code so that one service can crash, while everything else runs without a problem.<p>If you're considering using OKWS, I offer these suggestions: (i) build a good build system, because it's true, C++ is a slow dog when it comes to big recompiles; (ii) never hand-manage memory (i.e., don't use new/delete), but rather, always use reference-counted auto pointers and safe C++ string/buffer classes;   (iii) make sure you can find good C++ developers, they are hard to find!",1295236344

2111092,comment,2109832,2110371,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"Correct about the swarm -- indeed it's not a multiagent problem -- but perhaps a bit unfair regarding the ""dumb machine"" part.<p>This appears to be a ""multi-body"" problem (rather than a ""multi-agent"") problem: that is, there is likely one primary decision-maker which dictates the construction task ordering, likely computed via a partial-order multi-body planner.  That's part 1 of the AI.<p>But there's another part that's equally interesting.  The multi-body planner produces a series of construction steps.  Each step is ordered with regard to certain steps, unordered with regard to other steps (these can be done in any order but not simultaneously), and explicitly declared parallel with yet other steps (they can be done simultaneously).  The quad-roters grab the steps and perform them in parallel when possible, and at least form a queue otherwise.  Last, the quad-rotors have to perform these steps without hitting one another, so there's a significant real-time multi-body path-planning problem involved.<p>Multi-body planning, scheduling, and plan monitoring is nontrivial and should not be so lightly dismissed.",1295234841
