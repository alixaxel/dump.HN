As the GIF example demonstrates, it's not always wise to rely the charity of for-profit companies when it comes to this type of thing.<p>What are the chances of this being a problem in the future? I don't know. I believe it's good long-term in the same way that I believe insurance is good long-term. Taking out insurance doesn't always pay off -- in fact most of the time you'd hope it doesn't -- but that doesn't mean it's not a good thing to do.<p>This is to Google's benefit and, as I said in my original comment, I believe this is at the heart of John's problem with Google. Google positions its actions within a moral framework that never mentions that the actions which it takes are of financial benefit to Google. I don't disagree that Google is doing that and that it's frustrating -- only that basically every company does it.<p>Take for example, Apple. Apple only lets users download apps through the App Store. This is good for users because it means that users can trust the software and developers can easily charge for software and make a living from it. But Apple also does it because it's good for Apple. They make money this way on software that's sold and they can also limit apps which would otherwise compete with their own software.<p>Does the fact they have an ulterior motives mean that it's not good for users? I'd say no. John says no, too. Well at least he does when it's Apple. When it's Google, he seems upset by the dishonesty. I don't mind if John wants to be upset with dishonesty but I think you should make it clear why you're not upset at Apple's similar dishonesty (the reason might be because Apple doesn't frame what they do in such moral terms as Google).",1294811435
