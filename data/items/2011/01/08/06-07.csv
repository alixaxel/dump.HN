2082478,comment,2080342,2080796,0,0,grayrest,,,"You only need to know a few basic pure motions, mostly for moving around: h/j/k/l, gg, G, <count>G, 0/^, $, <C-o>/<C-i>, <c-d>/<c-u><p>The more important motions are %, f/t and the text-objects (:help for a full description). These are the vim power tools and honestly what I use ~80% of the time.<p>The f<char> motion moves forward on the same line up through <char>. The t<char> motion (mnemonic: 'til) works the same but doesn't include <char>. Capitalize to go backwards. You can string this together to get all sorts of useful behavior: change startFoo to stopFoo (ctF), work with TSV (ct<tab>), not have to remember W (ct<space>), etc. I tend to overuse it for things like deleting everything but the semicolon on a line so I don't have to retype the semicolon...but you get the point.<p>The % motion jumps between match pairs (parens, braces, etc), but the important trick with it is that if you're not on a pair, it <i>searches forward</i> till it finds one. This is mostly useful for manipulating function calls and email addresses, e.g. d% deletes a call if you're at the beginning of the function name. Pretty specific use but common use case.<p>Then there's text objects. You mentioned a couple use cases, but they're more general. There's two transitions, i (diw ""delete inner word"") and a (daw ""delete a word""). Most text objects are marked by delimiters (e.g. parens, xml tags) a includes these i excludes them. There's a lot of ways to put these together, a few:<p>- ci[ : replace contents of an array access<p>- da[ : delete the array access<p>- ci"" : replace contents of a string<p>- dat : delete an XML tag<p>- =i{ : realign the current block<p>- zfab : fold sexpr<p>- gqap : wrap paragraph<p>What makes the motions I mention here particularly great is that they tend to generalize well when you repeat them with period and don't rely on you pre-counting a certain number of words, lines, or whatnot.<p>If you're consistently using these motions, you're most of the way there to being a vim expert. The rest is all tricks. You can find your own tricks by noticing when you're repeating yourself or using too many keystrokes. In general, if you're using more than 5-6 keystrokes to do something, there's a shorter way to do it. The shorter way isn't necessarily worth the conceptual overhead, but you'll learn a bit more. You never really stop learning them, but it gets hard to remember once you've been using Vim daily for 5+ years (I'm 10 years in).<p>The most important plugin for tricks is surround.vim. You should immediately install it and add the following mappings:<p>nmap s ysi<p>nmap S ysa<p>nmap s$ ys$<p>nmap sv gvs<p>This lets you operate in 'surround' motions around text objects. E.g. sw( will surround the current word with parens, sp"" surrounds the paragraph with quotes. You can change single quotes to double quotes: cs'"" and so on. The sv map here surrounds the previous visual selection, I use it when I'm doing multiple wraps: sw'sv[sv(<p>Random useful tricks (there are thousands of these):<p>gv selects the previous visual selection. You can V select a number of lines, type colon and replace only in the selected area, then gv to do a < or :retab! or :g/^$/d or something.<p>Check out :help iskeyword, doing a :set iskeyword+=- is useful in CSS, XML, lisp.<p>The vim regex engine is screwy. Pretty much everybody knows this (sigh \+), but it's screwy in useful ways too. When you're doing a replacement, \zs and \ze mark the start/end of the match. If, for example you want to insert something at the end of all strings, :%s/""[^""]\+?\zs\ze""/ foo/g. Saves you from having to do capture groups/backrefs and whatnot. Also, the \k character class matches ""keywords"" (identifiers) for your current language and it's smart \<\k\+\> will not match numbers, for example.<p>If you have incsearch and hls turned on and are working on a tricky regex replace, it's useful to drop out and start oa normal search with / to see your matches highlighted. When you get your match, :%s//replace/g will reuse your search.<p>Know asterisk and # if you don't already.<p>You can save a location using m<letter> and jump back to it using `<letter>. Lowercase is in-file and uppercase is global. I tend to mA when I go looking for something elsewhere so I can get back to what I'm working on easily with `A. You can bounce back to where you just jumped from with ``, but I think <c-o> and <c-i> work better for that.<p>Random vimrc tricks:<p>""make Y consistent with C and D<p>nnoremap Y y$<p>"" I use splits (tabs came later). `vim -o *.c'<p>nmap - :Sexplore<CR><p>map <C-j> <C-W>j<C-W>_<p>map <C-k> <C-W>k<C-W>_<p>""repeats the last command for the entire visual selection<p>vnoremap . :normal .<CR><p>""executes the macro in buffer a<p>nnoremap ' @a<p>vnoremap ' :normal @a<CR><p>""Look up vim ToggleFold on google<p>nnoremap <silent> <space> :call ToggleFold()<CR><p>""mapping for paste toggle<p>noremap <silent> <Leader>p :se invpaste<CR>:echo &paste ? \n""Paste ON!"" : ""Paste off""<CR><p>"" I think the default gp is stupid.

2082456,comment,2082119,2082343,0,0,dkarl,,,"First, that it's possible to speak harshly to children and make them feel ashamed without harming them, if they feel secure in your love.<p>There are many parents who never say an unkind word to their parents but who leave their children feeling insecure and unloved.  There are parents who achieve the opposite.  A child who feel unvalued and insecure may feel most scared and vulnerable when his parents are critical of him, but the fault lies with the child feeling unvalued -- that is where his parents went wrong, not in criticizing him.  The two things are independent.  Parents should concentrate on making their kids feel loved and valued enough that a little criticism won't traumatize them, instead of trying to be so bland and positive that their kids' security is never tested.<p>That's exactly what she illustrates in her two contrasting examples:  ""Once when I was young—maybe more than once—when I was extremely disrespectful to my mother, my father angrily called me ""garbage"" in our native Hokkien dialect. It worked really well. I felt terrible and deeply ashamed of what I had done. But it didn't damage my self-esteem or anything like that. I knew exactly how highly he thought of me.""  And later:  ""I also once heard a Western father toast his adult daughter by calling her 'beautiful and incredibly competent.' She later told me that made her feel like garbage.""<p>That squares with my experience quite well.  Many children of unfailingly polite and supportive parents will tell you they hate their parents' guts, that their parents never loved them, and that their parents made them feel worthless.  Perhaps most of those kids are wrong about their parents not loving them -- <i>perhaps</i> -- but their feelings show how ineffective it is to mask your negative emotions and deal with your children through a rose-colored facade.  Children are quick to sense (or wrongly assume) that flattering words hide a lack of real affection, or even hide resentment, and they know when they're being disciplined by a parent who loves them and would lay their life down for them.  Of course, it's easier to simply suck up to your kids than to take on the much harder task of loving them unshakably and making sure they understand that.  (Easier not just in the sense of being more pleasant, but also in the sense that people often try and fail to convince their children they really love them.  In engineering we would say that something with such a high failure rate has no place in a well-designed system, but I think in childrearing you have to accept that this is a <i>vital</i> step that cannot be designed out no matter how hard it is.)  Being careful never to say anything harsh to your children because they doubt your love and loyalty is like driving extra carefully because you failed to buy car insurance -- it doesn't change your fundamental irresponsibility.<p>Second, that most of parenting is predicated on taking freedom away from children because parents know better.<p>It is better to state that up front than to try to pull off a sham where children are told they have freedom, but at the last second their parents lose their nerve and try to stop them from doing things.  My own parents were a bit like this -- they would maintain the fiction that I had freedom of choice, trying persuade me to change my mind, until absolutely the last minute.  Then they would find some excuse for stopping me from doing what I decided to do.  That was common behavior for my friends' parents, too.  It's better to be honest than to practice this kind of hypocrisy.<p>Third, that hard work and mastery lead to greater satisfaction than dabbling.  No need to explain that here.  Why shouldn't parents teach this to kids with the same urgency and insistence that they teach other facts of life?<p>Fourth (related to two and three), that forcing kids to work can lead to benefits that the children appreciate later.  ""Western parents worry a lot about their children's self-esteem. But as a parent, one of the worst things you can do for your child's self-esteem is to let them give up.""  Americans are schizophrenic about this, accepting it readily in the case of athletics and rejecting it with horror in other areas.  Why is the piano so much different from basketball?  Or we cling to the cop-out of playing the compassionate ""good guy"" and leaving the less pleasant job to coaches and teachers.  Once again, children are sensitive to hypocrisy:  do you approve of the discipline imposed by coaches and teachers or not?  If you do, why are you such a softie yourself?  Don't you love them enough to be tough with them?  At report card time, I always felt most sorry for the kid who got bad grades and didn't get in trouble with his parents.  The other kids are talking about how their parents yelled at them, and this kid gets to say... what?  That he has great parents who love him so much they are nice to him even when he gets bad grades?  He knows that isn't the reason.<p>The article caricatures all of these ideas.  Possibly the author assumes they are alien and unacceptable to American culture and just wants to make them clear and memorable, but the vibe I got was that the author is arrogantly, perversely savoring her readers' inability to accept her ideas.  In either case, the WSJ picked an author whose presentation of these ideas is so inflammatory as to alienate readers.  The article does not make a sincere effort at addressing the predictable concerns of the audience.  That was a deliberate rhetorical choice, by the author and definitely by the WSJ.  If we want to evaluate these ideas fairly, we should imagine how they could best be presented to our own sensibilities and reconciled with our own ideas, instead of allowing the WSJ to dictate the outcome by presenting the ideas in such a negative light.<p>In the final paragraph of the article, the author presents a false opposition where a sincere author would offer a synthesis:  ""Western parents try to respect their children's individuality, encouraging them to pursue their true passions, supporting their choices, and providing positive reinforcement and a nurturing environment. By contrast, the Chinese believe that the best way to protect their children is by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they're capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.""<p>Since the author did not offer a synthesis, it's up to us to provide one for ourselves.<p>P.S.  Here's another interesting angle, better written and more persuasive for a western audience:<p><a href=""http://www.nationalaffairs.com/doclib/20080709_19951195premodernadviceforthepostmodernyoungstevenozment.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalaffairs.com/doclib/20080709_19951195premo...</a>",1294468035

2082446,comment,2081296,2081296,0,0,socksy,,,"I have found from my own experience that ICT teaching is quite shoddy, and a waste of time at best. This has been confirmed by accounts from friends and family at other schools.<p>Most teaching revolves around the ability to use certain microsoft products (Word, Excel, Outlook and Access if you're ""lucky""). In some cases, they may even teach you Dreamweaver. I remember one lesson being taught to create websites in Dreamweaver - we were told to use tables to design the website, told off for viewing the HTML or heck, even changing the view mode so that each panel was a window.<p>I trialled (and have friends and family at different schools that actually did) a GCSE ICT exam, and I was somewhat bemused at a program that simulated XP, in which the purpose was to do a number of tasks (designated by an Outlook lookalike program) such as  create a database, write a word document etc. The program would record every mouse click and keystroke, whilst timing how fast you did each task.<p>It depresses me that that is what people regard as computers in this day and age. The teachers were often primarily of another subject (Art, for example), and refused to teach at a rate faster than ""don't you DARE press OK in that alert! Has everyone got that alert? Right! Now press OK!"".<p>I also find this disappointing:<p><i>“There is confusion between teaching IT, and using IT as part of the learning process,” Mr Fish said.</i><p>This seems to be very fashionable in many schools across the UK. I have no idea why - is French better taught through the medium of computers? Does the use of interactive whiteboards really increase productivity and ability to learn - or even attentiveness amongst pupils? Certainly Maths and English were not helped by an increase in technology, at least in my opinion. And exactly what are the pupils learning about IT in the process?<p>When top CS departments across the UK scorn ICT/IT A Levels/GCSEs, and in some cases appear to treat them as anti-requisites (Cambridge list ICT as a soft subject and I remember Oxford jokingly say at an open day that they look at candidates more favourably if they hadn't been taught ICT before), and when they don't appear to be teaching pupils anything that will be much use in the workforce (or rather, stuff that they don't already know that will be any use in the workforce) - what exactly is the point?",1294467610

Buffett recommends index investing, but also believes that it provides great opportunity for the enterprising investor because of its passivity and ignorance of security values.  Graham did indeed differentiate between the ""enterprising"" and ""defensive"" investor, but did not recommend an index approach to investing, even for the defensive investor, as he specifically recommends that no security should be bought at a price over 20x its earnings (Ch. 5).  Graham recognized that the ""defensive"" or passive investor does not have the time, energy, or expertise necessary to engage in rigorous security selection, but ignorance does not protect an investor from risk - risk here being defined as risk of permanent capital impairment, which is the risk of overpaying for a security.<p>My basic point is that every investor, passive or active, must protect him or herself against the risk of overpaying.  Passive index investing does not protect you from this risk, and is therefore very dangerous.<p>Fully agreed that good investing is pretty much totally dependent on how much work and emotional discipline you're willing to put into it.",1294467558
