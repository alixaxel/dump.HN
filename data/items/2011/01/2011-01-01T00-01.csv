I was a designer/artist, my work from 2006 <a href=""http://detrus.nivr.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://detrus.nivr.net/</a>  When I seriously started at the too late(?) age of 23 I had a lot of motivation, plunged ahead into semi-serious programming projects like a Flash 3D engine, made visible progress, ultimately got overwhelmed and demotivated.<p>Building seemingly simple common things like flashy sites, wordpress plugins, themes with some show/hide effects, sidescrolling 2D games, image pans, charts can turn into a nightmare when you have no foundation. Simple bugs can take weeks of work to fix.<p>These are the kinds of projects n00bs want to do, but it can take a lot more code or effort to do these common things than most can handle. With 2D sidescrollers you can run into localToGlobal problems and if you suck at math, have no clue that you should write a separate coordinate engine instead of using the API for screen positioning, nightmare ensues.<p>When I strayed from the tutorials I was lost. When I saw example code, I was usually lost. There were very few examples that would give the right foundation in the context of building a thumbnail site or 2D scroller. A lot of the code was horrible and I didn't know it. I've seen people here starting with Ruby that have better luck. I've seen people starting in JS that have it worse.<p>Figuring out this kind of crap took months. Yes I still think it's all crap. Learning resources are usually made by people with years of experience, who have long forgotten what it's like to be clueless. Programming languages, APIs, frameworks, engines, are geared for those with years of experience. By programmers, for programmers, or at least for people with a science/math slant.<p>It can be fixed with effort on the scale of jQuery for every single domain. Meanwhile many people who try will lose motivation because they'll fail to accomplish anything presentable after weeks of effort.",1293843347

Typing emails (or Facebook messages or whatever) is much more pleasant on a real keyboard than on a virtual touch-screen keyboard.  Seems unlikely people are going to give up typing in droves.<p>What does seem quite plausible is tablet + peripherals - the tablet basically assuming the role of the old mini-tower computer, angled upright on a stand for desktop use, with keyboard and mouse hanging off it.  (In fact if you also hung a monitor off it there's no reason you couldn't do that with a regular phone.)  I think tablet + dock + keyboard may well become a popular home computer setup in the next few years.",1293843334

With implausible or otherwise manufactured/subjective beliefs sometimes sprinkled in there to make them feel like logical reasons. There isn't anything insightful there - just bigotry.<p>""Neither Google nor Microsoft will ever be able to tailor their software to other manufacturers’ specific (and varied) hardware devices as well as Apple can (and does) with theirs.""<p>Really? Marco Arment can predict the future? Do we lose all hope that people will do anything better than Apple? Even in Marco's little part of the world it sounds outrageously short sighted. You can say what you want against everything non-Apple and that would of course be your opinion (as opposed to universally accepted truth) - but this is going too far, even for Marco Arment class of people.<p>He goes preaching about Apple's integrated experience, ""superior everything"" and ponies - but you know what the whole world is not buying the iPad universally - Samsung sold a million Galaxy Tabs, Androids are already outselling Apple worldwide and reason for that is not that the people buying them are stupid - people just have different needs and tastes.

At that rate, I earn between $10 and $20 per day, or $300-$600 per month. Although I consider that revenue to be an astounding success, it is less than half of what you're making right now through the few customers you have.<p>I agree with cabinguy that a free trial system seems to be your best bet. Don't pull a bait-and-switch with the prices, but offering a 1 month trial that shows how easy and efficient your app is seems like a great way to hook potential customers. Maybe your price point <i>is</i> a little high, and you could be willing to let customers wrestle it down to, say, $200/month. Pricing is difficult, and especially without knowing your niche it's a little hard to say, but the rule of thumb is that if people say it's too expensive, it probably is.<p>Alternatively, you could meet somewhere halfway and offer a six month ""special price"" at $100/month or something to see if you can hook people in that way.

Some larger companies have policies about not telling you, but any small company probably won't mind answering a polite email with a reasonably straightforward answer. And in larger companies, you should be asking each individual interviewer for a business card to follow up with a thank you email, so you could reach out to them directly; they aren't as sensitive to the HR policies.<p>You get an email saying ""We're sorry..."" and you just reply ""Thank you for the opportunity. If you don't mind, I'd appreciate any information you are willing to share about your decision. I'm always looking to improve myself and rely on your honesty to identify my grow areas.

My oldest son has said that when he was a kid, he couldn't comprehend stereotypical jokes about interfering in-laws and the like because he never once saw that in his own family.  My ex was career military, so we didn't live near either of our families.  That simplified that aspect of it.  But I imagine we would have drawn pretty clear boundaries in that regard anyway, even if circumstances had been different.  What goes on in the marriage has to be between the two of you and the rest of the world can go screw itself.  If you can get that piece right, the marriage can withstand quite a lot, for many years.<p>Congratulations!

2056846,comment,2055878,2055878,0,0,tptacek,,,"A few more tips, if I may be permitted to leverage my own experience and the experience of my friends and acquaintances:<p>* <i>Avoid personal drama</i>. I suspect that in more cases than we realize, management-level changes happen simply because people stop working productively with each other. In particular, you need to be prepared to DISAGREE AND COMMIT; to be able to signal that even in cases where you disagree about the direction of a decision, you aren't plotting behind the scenes for its failure.<p>* <i>Stay close to the money</i>. Most of you are tech people. As a tech person in a moving company, you can basically be doing three things and still be perceived as someone who is executing: you can be shipping product improvements, you can be doing ""marketing engineering"" (ask Patrick what this means, but, briefly: ""things that improve customer acquisition or customer LTV""), or you can be talking to customers/the market. There seems to be a huge trap for techs in startups in the ""CTO"" and ""Chief Scientist"" and ""Architect"" roles; AVOID THEM.<p>* <i>Be strategic about roles and hiring</i>. This stuff about palling around with the board may be important, but from what I can tell, the game is won or lost on the org chart. Don't hire people who are going to ladder-climb around you. This is one aspect of Startup Soap Opera Drama that is not overhyped: the market is lousy with people who, for good reasons or bad, have a primary goal of being one of the key people on the m-team. A simple trap to avoid: if you're the Dir/E, be <i>very</i> careful about who the VP/E is; if she can't be you, aim for your kid's godmother. Similarly, if you're in Product Management, even as VP/PM, be very careful about VP/Marketing.<p>* <i>Be careful about demotion</i>. Clarifying special case of the previous note: in a lot of biz cultures, there's basically no such thing as a ""demotion""; usually there's only termination, lateral moves, or ""constructive"" demotion (hiring SVP/M to oversee and eventually consume raw the VP/M, then EVP/M for the SVP/M, etc). If you allow yourself to be demoted, and your m-team is a bunch of assholes (not an infrequent occurrance), you can be perceived as weak.<p>* <i>Keep zeroes out of the m-team</i>. Human resources doesn't belong in the m-team. The Dir/M in a single-product company where a VP/PM handles 99% of marketing doesn't need a seat at the table just to represent ""Marketing"". The less vital a role is, the more likely they are to be a magnet for bullshit politics.<p>* <i>Be customer facing</i>. I think I said this already: if you aren't committing code that the company will sink without, you should be meeting customers or partners constantly. Be very careful about getting sucked into the conference circuit. It's easy to convince yourself that a particular conference is important to your business but be perceived by everyone else in your company as a tourist.<p>* <i>Be on the same page with your board</i>. In two of the cases I've been directly involved in, the conflict underlying a planned coup was at the level of ""are we going to grow the business or are we going to position the company to get bought"". It seems like you need to have an eye for the kinds of decisions that involve liquidity. Early on, your board may be worried that you're tilting the game for an early exit; later on, especially if you aren't on the original founding team, you may be perceived as an obstacle to bizdev when your VC just wants to get rid of a board seat gracefully. You don't have to agree on every decision, but it seems like you really do have to be perceived as having aligned interests.<p>* <i>Be extremely cautious with metrics</i>. Anyone who's ever managed a sales team knows about ""sandbagging"", where the guy running a region lowballs the numbers so he can sail over them and collect bonus accelerators. A lot of devs have a natural habit of being optimistic --- about schedule, about  product adoption, about support costs, about COGS ---  all of which gives the management team ammunition down the road.",1293840699
