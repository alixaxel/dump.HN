I've really only heard this from Mac fanboys who seem to forget that Windows has a 90% market share.  Tying Windows Phone 7 to Windows 7, a great OS by any definition as well as a very popular one is a stroke of genius.  People will look at their smartphone and think, ""this is a small computer"", rather than, ""this is a fancy phone"".  That gives Microsoft huge leeway to push their Windows integration line.  It doesn't have to look or feel anything like Windows for the average consumer to realize that they can sync their emails, access their office documents, get on Internet Explorer, etc.",1294019856

The system worked, but was slow and miserable to use. I fiddled with several settings on my wireless router but couldn't get it to do anything. I took it to work and tried it on their wireless with a much better result. While there I filed a problem report at the customer support website (http://www.google.com/support/chromeos/bin/request.py?contact_type=device_issue). I received an e-mail confirmation from a bot and was immediately concerned that my problem would get filed among thousands of others and I would never get contacted. I was quite wrong.<p>The following business day I received a personal e-mail from the Google Ninja assigned to my case. He wanted to know the most convenient method and time for contacting me (Google Talk, phone, e-mail, Skype were all options). Some phone tag resulted, but he ended up diagnosing the problem, doing some bug searches and found I was experiencing the bug reported here: http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=10249.<p>After this diagnosis he thanked me for my time and informed me that any further issues could go directly to his e-mail instead of through the website.<p>I realize that this support is specific to a developer testing program, but it was certainly a great experience.
