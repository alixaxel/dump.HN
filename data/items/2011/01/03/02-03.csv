However, I'm getting a teeny little bit tired of people who -- out of good intentions -- make it sound like architecture (and clean code and whatnot) isn't important at all.<p>There's a reason you should pay attention to the state of your codebase. Or rather, there <i>should</i> be a reason for it, one that is better than the intellectual equivalent of wanking. If you're trying to make your code ""beautiful"" just because you've heard that it's good to keep it ""clean"" and to ""follow every coding standard you've ever heard of"", then you're wasting your time.<p>However, if you're refactoring your code because you found yourself doing the same thing for the 10th time (with small differences), then it's time well spent. If you're spending a bit of effort to structure your code in a way that will help you avoid shooting yourself in the foot (because you've been there and done that and it's no fun at all), then it's effort well spent. And guess what? That's what architecture is all about.<p><i>Your users don’t care about architecture, they only care if your app works.</i><p>Architecture is what keeps your app working over time.",1294023541

2061831,comment,2060504,2061734,0,0,Symmetry,,,"As the other commenter pointed out, I'm talking about instruction predication (also called conditional execution) instead of branch prediction.  In any ISA you have branches that might or might not execute depending on some conditions.  With ARM, the first four bits of every single instruction - not just branches but loads and stores, addition and subtraction, etc - are used to specify under what conditions the instruction will be executed - so you can have small 'if' statements that don't actually need any branches when they're compiled.<p>All that is really pretty awesome if you're designing your processor to go in order, but if you want to try out of order execution it becomes more complicated.  Now you have to check every instruction to see if its predicated, and if it is you now have a new dependency on the previous arithmetic instruction even if there isn't any data dependency between the two.  Of course you could argue that if you find a predicated instruction in ARM code then its replacing a branch that would be in x86 code, and that overall your job is no harder.  And you could go back and forth arguing over it.<p>The important thing to remember, though, is the things that give the ARM ISA inherent advantages when you're making low power, in order processors aren't necessarily advantages when you're talking about high performance, high power processors.",1294020893

The Debian maintainers chose not to adopt this.

There's no reason that a .deb couldn't simply <i>wrap</i> a .gem and use the RubyGems infrastructure to install it into a ""protected"" area (preventing 'gem remove' from working, per the modifications noted above). A .gem can even be a repackaged version that includes platform-specific compiled code so that it could be distributed to machines without compilers (this is one thing that could be improved for RubyGems; allowing users to gemify a built gem for deployment purposes). I've suggested this in the past and it's been met with derision from OS maintainers. I don't understand why: as I understand it, this is what happens with BSD ports of gems.<p>So no, the Ruby community hasn't thrown rocks from the sidelines.
