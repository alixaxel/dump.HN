Space is not made of characters, it's made of space (in metal, it's made of tiny shims of copper, brass, or lead).<p>Any use of the space bar in a computer typesetting context is just a hint to some algorithm regarding how much space you want put between the characters on either side. TeX doesn't put ""1.5 spaces"" between sentences; it puts glue that is slightly stretchier than the glue it puts between words.",1295031584

I think the CMS used for that site must be substituting one type of space character with another in Unicode, or something like that, so that the browser does not ""know"" how to collapse the two whitespace characters into a single whitespace character.<p>When I copy the two whitespace characters between sentences there into separate text files that contain nothing but those whitespace characters, then `diff a.txt b.txt`, the result is that they differ, so there is definitely some difference between the two types of whitespace characters used between sentences.<p>I've written a text formatting tool designed to preserve multiple whitespace instances on the Web.  It used `&nbsp;` for the first of every pair of standard single space characters.  Apparently, this CMS is doing something similar, but even tricker because it doesn't show up in the source as an HTML entity, and perhaps less well thought-out because for some reason the nonbreaking version space character used is the second of the two (which results in weird ghost-spaces at the beginnings of lines sometimes, as you discovered).",1295031451

Work with Scheme and Haskell enough and you'll find yourself writing some convoluted things to maintain purity. The problem with purity is that while it makes somethings much easier to express, there are times when you have to stop and ask ""how do I express this"", I find common lisp always gives you some way to express anything, but leaves you asking ""how can I express this better?""",1295031335

Yeah, the bubble might have another couple of years left. If you get in now and get out when the crash hits you'll make a modest profit.

If, for instance, a sentence ends with an abbreviation, and the next sentence starts with a proper noun, an algorithm would detect a run-on sentence and would have to resort to tearing the grammar in the two adjoining sentences apart to figure out where to split them.<p>If there is a double space between sentences, the problem is reduced to a trivial string splitting operation.<p>Furthermore, any app that visually displays the text should know that some people use two spaces between sentences, and can trivially correct for this if it's implementing its own fancy typography.  HTML already ignores multiple contiguous 0x20 spaces.  Any text rendering algorithm fancy enough to implement good typography can likewise simply ignore the double space.<p>Double spaces between sentences have no mandatory effect on visual layout since layout algorithms can ignore the extra space, However, it can have a significant effect on the speed, if not accuracy, of text parsing algorithms.",1295030674

And in a given case it may look like that's what's happening.<p>But lawyers are constrained by legal ethics rules, which really do require us to put our clients' interests above just about anything else:<p>1. Lawyers are required to be zealous advocates for our clients' causes. That's a universal feature of legal-ethics rules in the U.S., and AFAIK in most other countries too.<p>2. Once we take on a client representation in a given matter, we're not allowed to fire the client except in limited circumstances or with the client's agreement. If the client goes flaky, we may be stuck with him / her / them / it.<p>3. Lawyers can, should, and typically do advise clients about the potential downsides of a given course of action, including bad PR. But in the end, unless the client is asking us to do something illegal or unethical, it's very likely the client's call, and there may not be much we can do about it.<p>The foregoing can sometimes be a convenient excuse for lawyers to do unsavory stuff on behalf of their clients. But the alternative might be a system in which lawyers were allowed to bail out on their clients at will -- and in which people with unpopular causes were unable to get legal representation. I don't think many people would want that kind of system, especially when they realized that someday they might be the one who couldn't get a lawyer.<p>[/rant]",1295030547

The money supply is independent of the price of goods and of the price of currencies (exchange rates).<p>Seemingly, a larger overall quantity of dollars in existence would seem to predict a decline in the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, but the monetary policy decisions that resulted in increased money supply are intended to achieve relative price stability.<p>For example, the dollars introduced to the economy and lent to banks had the effect of encouraging banks to make loans, which helped increase demand for products and services, which helped prevent prices from falling.<p>Also, many of the dollars are being used as reserve capital after the market price of various securities which had been used as reserve capital declined, leaving the entities under-capitalized.  All this was done in an attempt to keep interest rates low (in effect a price target) and prevent banks from being forced to stop lending money...<p>So I think the bottom line is that the behavior of consumers and firms can account for so much variability in supply and demand that the money supply can expand greatly and prices can still say roughly constant... the other side of the coin being that monetary policy was used to keep prices relatively stable, in this case by keeping the credit infrastructure status quo alive.<p>edit: Of course, if the Fed gets it wrong or lacks the will to raise interest rates when necessary, hyperinflation can result, which would impact exchange rates.",1295029362

With that settlement in place, those parties received what many considered a windfall ($20M cash and 1.2 shares of FB stock, originally valued at $45M and now estimated to be worth $150M). Should it be set aside, however, the settlement value of such claims today would be astronomical. Why? Because these claims (unlike those of Mr. Ceglia, who filed a claim nearly seven years after the fact claiming an ""84% stake in Facebook"") were timely brought and have overhung every round of financing that FB has done from the beginning. In other words, existing FB shareholders have at all times been aware, in making their investment, of the risk that they could potentially lose everything should ConnectU prevail in its claims to own the FB IP. That is a devastating outcome for FB shareholders, of course, but the claimants here (unlike Mr. Ceglia) cannot be accused of laches or foot-dragging in ways that make the timing of their claims inequitable and therefore unenforceable. Thus, should they get this settlement set aside, FB would be faced with years of future litigation during which a serious question mark would hang over the entire value of its company. Hence, no IPO; hence, a far higher cost of any financing down the road. The stakes are high in this case.""<p>Money, then, would appear to be the main driving element here. By playing with house money, the twins stand to gain by continuing to leverage their legal threats. That is why this whole thing has taken on a Terminator-like quality. In the end, they will either run out of legal leverage or they will be paid off. Time will tell on which it will be but I doubt that they will back off gracefully regardless of any windfall they might have already received.",1295028545

Since word processors make available the same fonts used by typesetters for printed works, many writers, influenced by the look of typeset publications, now leave only one space after a concluding punctuation mark. In addition, most publishers' guidelines for preparing a manuscript on disk ask professional authors to type only the spaces that are to appear in print.<p>Because it is increasingly common for papers and manuscripts to be prepared with a single space after all concluding punctuation marks, this spacing is shown in the examples in this handbook. As a practical matter, however, there is nothing wrong with using two spaces after concluding punctuation marks unless an instructor requests that you do otherwise. Whichever spacing you choose, be sure to use it consistently in all parts of your paper--the works-cited list as well as the main text.

No matter how nice it would be to force backups -- IT can't override the fucking dean. Researchers are to be given autonomy is the usual directive. This leaves IT to provide easy access infrastructure, but not go that last step, as they are forbidden.<p>Are you sure your customers love your ""DO AS I SAY IT IS THE ONLY WAY DAMMIT"" attitude? Having dealt with sanctimonious asshats like you many times, and further talked to the mormons and jehovia's witnesses at my door, I realize my words won't sink in, but I will make a futile attempt anyway: Give up the judgemental bullshit. Your way is not the one true way. Your smug little smirk makes lots of people fucking hate you, and you know what, you don't even realize they smile and agree with you just to get you to shut up and go away.<p>tl; dr- go jerk off to your authority some more, the rest of us have real worlds to live in.",1295028065

For the one occasion a year I use XPath, W3Schools has a nice refresher and function reference.<p>Sure, the information may be imprecise or just plain wrong, but we have to remember that this is for absolute beginners. Merely having errors does not make w3schools worthless, and a lack of errors does not make alternatives better.<p>The material on W3Schools is split into bite-sized chunks, along with numerous examples, references, quizzes, try it yourself areas... None of the alternatives suggested are this well organized.<p>Just think what kind of HTML tutorial could have been created with the time and effort it took to build w3fools.com.",1295028032
