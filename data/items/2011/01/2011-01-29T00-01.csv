It's a nice feather in your cap (the offer) but I would certainly avoid selling out until the cards are in your favor. Don't let yourself believe that because they're a large tech company they can put an offer down and you have to accept it.<p>Don't take it just because it came along, take it because you want it. You wouldn't date a girl (or guy) you weren't interested in just because it fell in your lap would you? Well... of course you <i>might</i>, but think about it. Also, I wouldn't get too anxious about the timeframe here. They've been courting you for 1.5 months, I can't see their offer and all that you guys have worked towards suddenly vanishing. They might have 8 figures they're willing to send your way, which gives an impression that they have the upper hand, but they're buying YOUR product, you have just as much leverage if not more. Take the time to think it through, write down the pro's and con's and compare the lists.<p>It sounds to me like you've sort of convinced yourself it is a bad idea, and you're putting that on the shelf at the sake of naiveté to find help from more experienced people.

Except it's more like everyone's garden hoses somehow reach the building with no loss in PSI, and it's a few dozen people each with their own paltry residential water supply.

Like many idioms relating to the intimate aspects of how a culture sees the world, it's nearly impossible to accurately explain -- it's variously translated as ""void,"" ""space"" or ""interval"" -- but it essentially describes how emptiness interacts with form, and how absence shapes substance. If someone were to ask you what makes a ring a meaningful object -- the circle of metal it consists of, or the emptiness that that metal encompasses? -- and you were to respond ""both,"" you've gotten as close to ma as the clumsy instrument of English allows.<p>While Jobs has never invoked the term in public -- one of the aspects of his genius is the ability to keep even his most esoteric assertions in the realm of the instantly accessible -- ma is at the core of the Jobsian way. And Jobs' single-minded adherence to this idiosyncratically Japanese principle is, ironically, what has allowed Apple to compete with and beat Japan's technology titans -- most notably the company that for the past four decades dominated the world of consumer electronics: Sony.</i>",1296261398

They will get something that's already been invented and study it until they thoroughly understand it. In some cases, they understand it better than the original inventor. Out of that understanding, they will reinvent it in a more refined second-generation version. That strategy works only when what they're working with isn't changing very much. The stereo industry and the automobile industry are two examples. When the target is moving quickly, they find it very difficult, because that reinvention cycle takes a few years. As long as the definition of what a personal computer is keeps changing at the rate that it is, they will have a very hard time. Once the rate of change slows down, the Japanese will bring all of their strengths to bear on this market, because they absolutely want to dominate the computer business; there's no question about that. They see that as a national priority. We think that in four to five years, the Japanese will finally figure out how to build a decent computer. And if we're going to keep this industry one in which America leads,we have four years to become world-class manufacturers.
