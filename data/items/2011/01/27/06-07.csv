2146868,story,,,2,3,solipsist,"Ask HN: Can Hacker News be considered a social network?",,"Social networks usually attract a wide range of people. However, LinkedIn is a great example of a social network that targets a more selective audience than other networks that preceded it. The people who use it are usually professionals looking to make connections online. Quora, StackOverflow, and other sites that started out as Q&A services have show potential in the social networking market as well.<p>So I was wondering if we could start calling Hacker News a social network. While HN has always been a place for inquisitive minds to share links and ideas, it has also become a place for people to connect with others who have the same interests. It may not be the social network most of us are used to, but it does provide the same uses (interacting socially with others) under a different context. One of the reasons why we can consider HN a social network is the fact that many of use use our real identities rather than anonymous ones (a group that I ironically don't belong in).<p>Anyways, I wanted to hear other people's opinions on naming HN a social network. While categorizing HN as a social network may not have that many applications, the discussion around it can help clarify the true purposes HN serves and new online areas the site can expand in to.",1296110047

I use them on the rare occasion myself, but everything is good in moderation (so they say). A constant flood of Ask HNs has brought cause to make the threshold of up-votes required to front-page an Ask HN higher than a normal post. This means that people with worthy questions or review my startup type posts have a higher chance of getting washed aside when the people who do care about those posts aren't all surfing HN during that short window of opportunity. So basically it's a feature that I think gets used too often for too trivial of things. I don't want to risk getting too personal here, but most of your Ask HNs are too trivial of things.

Developers started out initially building an application that needed access to (for instance) Yahoo! Mail. Unfortunately, there's no way in the Yahoo! Developer Network to ""upsize"" an application ID or consumer key after it has been created. You can't go back and say, ""You know what? My application could be 2x as awesome if I added Yahoo! Address Book support."" As a result, developers requested the kitchen sink: Yahoo! Mail, Address Book, Calendar, Flickr, Profile, MyBlogLog, Delicious, Fantasy Sports, Messenger, Updates and so on. In addition, each of those services has different permissions ranging from Read-Only to Read/Write (see <a href=""https://developer.apps.yahoo.com/dashboard/createKey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apps.yahoo.com/dashboard/createKey.html</a>).<p>Google did a better job of this with their OAuth flow, allowing a ""scope"" to be passed in the authorization request so applications can dynamically select what they want access to (<a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/auth/oauth.html#Scope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/auth/oauth.html#Scope</a>). This means applications don't have to ask for the world up front when registering. Unfortunately it doesn't fix the ""OAuth will murder your children"" problem.<p>Ultimately it's a user experience problem. As the article points out, add too many checkboxes and it becomes too complex. The average user doesn't pay attention (like reading a EULA) and in several cases they're not going to understand the scopes presented to them anyway. Read/Write is pretty clear to most of us, not so clear to my mother.<p>As an amusing aside, I went to log into Hacker News using their Clickpass integration to sign in using my Yahoo! account. Clickpass does the OAuth song and dance and requests read/write access to my Address Book. ""<a href=""http://www.clickpass.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clickpass.com</a> is asking you and Yahoo! for the ability to automatically sign-in as you to your Yahoo! account through a service or application that is provided by <a href=""http://www.clickpass.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clickpass.com</a>, and to read and store to your data in Yahoo! Address Book."" Evidently OAuth will not only murder your children, it will wipe them from your Address Book, too.",1296109014

When we first started testing our site in January '09, our ""click here to verify your email address"" emails were going to spam, and it was a major bummer.  After a week of calling ~100 of our friends with @gmail accounts to sign up and mark the email as not spam, our messages finally started going through.<p>I have no idea if that's a normal sample size, nor any proof that that's what made the difference.  Regardless, I strongly believe that having lots of people go to their spam folder and mark you as not spam has a huge effect; if I was designing a spam filter I'd definitely weight that feedback heavily.  If you can somehow build that into your app (i.e.  make people verify their email to continue), in the long term it should solve your problem.  In the short term, your UX will be a little worse and you'll be constantly wondering how long it's going to take until google trusts you.
