I would think the difficulty of scaling is not any kind of smooth function, but very easy or very hard depending on the bottlenecks you hit at any particular point.<p>You are right it's not a smooth function. This isn't just about numerical aspect, it's figuring how to get over a hump: going from one datacenter to two is much harder (not even twice as hard) than adding a rack to two datacenters or adding a fourth datacenter when there are five.<p>In other words, when you're at scale you have tools available to operate at that scale.

2058862,comment,2057704,2058685,0,0,st3fan,,,"So I just signed a full-time contract with Mozilla and I will be starting as a Mobile Software Engineer next week. Mostly focusing on iOS development but also other platforms.<p>This is quite a change for me. For the past 15 years I have been doing consulting work and startups on my own and I've always been in charge of my own time and plans. I had never really considered a 'real' job until I started working at Mozilla. That is how awesome they are.<p>I started working for them in August as a contractor. On the Sync client for iOS, Firefox Home.<p>It did not take long before I noticed that Mozilla operated very differently than most companies that I had done work for. Mozilla is all about quality and doing the right thing versus maximizing profits and keeping shareholders happy. For me that was a real eye-opener and a change that I was looking for in my professional career.<p>One thing that I love about Mozilla is that we work in the open. There are no secrets. I have friends at companies like Apple and they are not allowed to talk to their spouse about what they do. That is horrible. Mozilla is completely the opposite. Everything that I do is open. It is part of the mission. It is highly encouraged to share, collaborate and participate.<p>But don't think this is all easy. Mozilla's mission does require a lot of hard and professional work, organization, deadlines and crazy hours. But I don't care about so much, because it is fun to do that, and because you know it is not to make your CEO rich when they IPO, instead you do it to make the (digital) world a better place. Different mission. Different kind of reward.<p>I've been working in Toronto office and at home since August. Together with great people from a team distributed over Mountain View, Germany and France. We meet on IRC, email, and phone conferences.<p>I've also been to Mountain View to participate in the quarterly work week, where all Mozilla people from all over the globe get together to meet and to get stuff done. Pretty awesome to get almost 300 smart folks together.<p>I personally don't think money should be the biggest motivator, but the compensation is excellent. Competitive salaries, good benefits, lots of perks. Mozilla takes great care of their biggest asset: people.<p>This will be a great year :-)",1293926200

Its primary function is to salvage energy from carbohydrate not digested in the upper gut. This is achieved through fermentation and absorption of the major products, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which represent 40–50% of the available energy of the carbohydrate. The principal SCFA, acetate, propionate and butyrate, are metabolized by the colonic epithelium (butyrate), liver (propionate) and muscle (acetate). Intestinal bacteria also have a role in the synthesis of vitamins B and K and the metabolism of bile acids, other sterols and xenobiotics. The colonic microflora are also responsive to diet. In the presence of fermentable carbohydrate substrates such as non-starch polysaccharides, resistant starch and oligosaccharides, bacteria grow and actively synthesize protein. The amount of protein synthesis and turnover within the large intestine is difficult to determine, but around 15 g biomass is excreted in faeces each day containing 1 g bacterial-N.

Recent evidence, primarily from investigations in animal models, suggests that the gut microbiota affects nutrient acquisition and energy regulation. Its composition has also been shown to differ in lean vs obese animals and humans. In this article, we review the published evidence supporting the potential role of the gut microbiota in the development of obesity and explore the role that modifying the gut microbiota may play in its future treatment. Evidence suggests that the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota facilitate the extraction of calories from ingested dietary substances and help to store these calories in host adipose tissue for later use. Furthermore, the gut bacterial flora of obese mice and humans include fewer Bacteroidetes and correspondingly more Firmicutes than that of their lean counterparts, suggesting that differences in caloric extraction of ingested food substances may be due to the composition of the gut microbiota. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide derived from the intestinal microbiota may act as a triggering factor linking inflammation to high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Interactions among microorganisms in the gut appear to have an important role in host energy homeostasis, with hydrogen-oxidizing methanogens enhancing the metabolism of fermentative bacteria. Existing evidence warrants further investigation of the microbial ecology of the human gut and points to modification of the gut microbiota as one means to treat people who are overweight or obese.""",1293925790

(Rhetorical question.)<p>To illustrate with an extreme example, lactose is a sugar and carries energy, but some people can digest it (and their bodies will get the full complement of calories from it), and some people can't (it'll get digested by bacteria and they'll get gas and feel unpleasant; I'm pretty sure they don't get calories from it).  It is incorrect and stupid to say that an item of food with significant lactose component carries ""N calories"" without specifying whether the person who eats it can digest lactose.  Likewise, with cellulose, I think cows get a lot more energy out of cellulose than humans can.<p>Also, it seems likely to me that people's digestive systems' performance varies with ""outside"" conditions in the body.  For example, I've heard that being pumped full of adrenaline puts digestion on hold; and subjective experience suggests to me that if you eat a lot of food (over a period of, say, a day), your system will send it through pretty quickly, without digesting it fully.<p>I suspect there are a lot of other situations in which one's body doesn't get all N calories from an ""N-calorie"" item of food.  I suppose that if that happens, then the remaining part probably will be digested by bacteria, and one may notice symptoms of... oh, hey, there's a name for this, ""indigestion"".

2058822,comment,2058398,2058398,0,0,mkn,,,"<i>Since a pound of fat is roughly equal to 3500 calories, this means you accumulate roughly 7000 calories worth of fat every year. Divide that 7000 by 365 and you get the number of calories of fat you stored each day and never burned  roughly 19 calories. Let’s round up to 20 calories, so we have a nice round number. (In the new book I discuss this issue in a chapter called ""The Significance of Twenty Calories a Day."")</i><p>He neglects the metabolism one needs to maintain that fat tissue each and every day. One rough rule of thumb is 11/cal/day/pound to maintain your weight. Being 40 lbs overweight thus takes not just his (apparently trivial) 20 calories per day to gain that weight, but 440 additional calories per day to maintain it. If the weight was truly gained in a linear fashion, that's an average of 220 calories per day to maintain it, above the 20 per day to gain it. This is the real math. This is why weight gain and weight loss correspond to gross caloric intake and expenditure. The dynamic equilibrium of an organism's weight is a feedback mechanism <i>in which the mass of the organism appears as the magnitude of the gain on the negative feedback term.</i><p>Someone who is truly obese, say someone who is 300 lbs who should 180 lbs, for example, is running an ongoing daily calorie surplus of 1320 calories through diet and lifestyle, not the 60 per day that Taubes would suggest. This is not an insignificant disparity, and this guy's work will be truly harmful wherever it is--help us all--taken seriously.<p>I could maybe take the rest of his ideas more seriously if he were not so obviously wrong right out of the gate.",1293924931
2058821,comment,2057633,2057633,0,0,tomkinstinch,,,"I find it appalling that there are adults who are unable to prepare food for themselves.<p>I'm a college student. I cook every day by choice, not for financial reasons (though it is less expensive). For me, cooking has manifold appeal. Through cooking it is possible to:<p>* Cook meals that taste better than those that come from a restaurant or out of a box. This takes quality ingredients and some skill. Those just getting started with cooking may not make anything that rivals food from a fine restaurant, but with practice it's possible. I can adjust recipes to my own tastes, or invent my own recipes by combining ingredients in ways that I think will work well. Recipes are simply lists of instructions that consistently yield good food, and are not unlike programs. The ingredients are the parameters, and recipe steps are functions. Execute the program correctly, and quality food will be returned. Functions are modular, and learned techniques can be adapted to new foods. It's about ""understanding"" ingredients and styles of cooking. Think of a cookbook as lessons on culinary design patterns.<p>* Eat healty fare. By cooking, I can prepare meals with balanced levels of nutrients. For me, that means hitting the major food groups, with reduced levels of refined carbohydrates and salt.  Unlike packaged food, what I cook for myself has low levels of preservatives, no synthetic flavors, and no artificial colorants. Once you start to cook for yourself, food from chain restaurants and prepackaged food begin to taste like cardboard. I also have anaphylactic allergy to certain foods, so for me it is also a way to ensure that meals are safe.<p>* Save time. Cooking can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the meal. I can prepare food in bulk, and either eat for the week or freeze food for the future. I regularly have homemade chicken stock on hand and frozen in the freezer. It has less salt and more flavor than store bought stock, and costs nearly nothing to produce.<p>* Relax and enjoy myself. I have other hobbies, but I cook for leisure. For me, spending an hour or two to prepare food is better sitting in front of a video game or television. I can move around a kitchen, experience a variety of smells, sights, and sounds--without leaving the house. It gives me great pleasure to cook with others, and to share good food with friends. Unlike alcohol or other staples of revelry, food is life-sustaining--we have to eat.<p>* Be a responsible consumer. Sustainability has become a buzzword these days, but cooking is one surefire way to reduce our environmental impact. Food I prepare myself does not depend on a factory system for production, packaging, or marketing. Where I live, in Rochester, NY, we are fortunate to have a fantastic farmer's market. I go to the market each Saturday and buy enough food for a week for less than the cost of a single meal at a mid-range independent restaurant. I don't usually go with specific recipes in mind. I typically buy vegetables that are in season, or those that look particularly fresh. I can talk to the men and women who grow the food. In an economy dominated by corporations, monetary voting is one of the most important actions we can take. I cast my ballot for local food. It supports the regional economy, and local food does not need to be trucked in. Local food it is allowed to truly ripen, and it does not lose nutrients on cross-country journeys.<p>* Experience aspects of other cultures. I have roommates of European, Hispanic, Russian, and Indian heritage, and we each approach food differently. The cabinets in my house are stocked with all kinds of spices, for different kinds of traditional meals. I've experienced new flavors, and truly learned which ones I enjoy. I've come to revelations that some recipes from my German grandmother may, just maybe, taste better with a little dhal or mole.<p>I consider myself fortunate to have parents who, while modest cooks, instilled in me the importance of knowing how to cook. Cooking is traditionally something passed down within families. By forgetting to cook, we lose that part of our heritage.<p>---<p>Cooking is a perfect hacker activity, in my opinion. It is systematic, affords many of the same challenges as a chemical experiment, and has countless variations.<p>When I cook, I think about how salt, temperature, pressure, and humidity can each help me in the kitchen. Knowing about vapor pressure, osmotic balance, chemistry, and biology can only contribute toward good meals.<p>I enjoy knowing what happens when I deglaze a pan with wine, sear meat, use a pressure cooker, and I enjoy when I sneak a vacuum pump into the kitchen to help with marinades or sauce reduction.<p>---<p>So you want to cook, you say? What gear do you need?  I’m sure others here would be able to offer better advice, but I'd suggest a heavy sauce pan (I prefer cast iron or stainless steel, though I use a non-stick pan for omlets), an 8-10"" chef knife (with something to sharpen it, like a sharpening steel or an upside-down ceramic coffee mug), a large stock pot (with cover), a large cutting board, wooden spatulas, a whisk, a roasting pan, mixing bowls, measuring spoons and cups (and/or a scale), tongs, and a strainer. There are countless other implements, but the aforementioned will get you 80% there. A thermometer can be handy if you're cautious or curious.",1293924928

We evolved to be susceptible to polio, tuberculosis, and plague and to live to ~30.  Just because it's <i>natural</i> doesn't mean it's optimal -- science and technology can, when judiciously applied, add a lot to the quality (and length) of life.<p>Additionally (and importantly) evolution is only a factor up until age ~30-35 (child bearing/rearing age).  Evolution plays no role in protecting us from most modern afflictions (obesity, alzheimer's, cancer, etc).  You can have your ""evolutinoarily optimal"" paleolithic diet; I'll take my chances with modernity.",1293923730
