2130155,comment,2127937,2128207,0,0,misterbee,,,"One specific and ubiquitous example of webspam has been driving me nuts this week: An enterprising spammer has won huge on Amazon Web Services (AWS)-related keywords.<p>For example:\n<a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=aws+s3+emr+pig"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=aws+s3+emr+p...</a><p>Result #4 at the moment is ""AWS Developer Forums: Interactions between S3, EMR and HDFS ..."" on <a href=""http://www.hackzq8search.appspot.com/developer...com/.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackzq8search.appspot.com/developer...com/..</a>.<p>What's sublime about this example is that:<p>1. hackzq8search is  clone of AWS's websites amazonwebservices.com, aws.typepad.com, etc<p>2. hackzq8search is hosted on appspot.com, Google's App Engine domain<p>3. hackzq8search is over quota, so the site doesn't show any content anyway.<p>Yet this site was the top search result, beating out the site it was cloning, time and time again on my AWS/EMR-related searches this week.<p>The one mitigating aspect as that hackzq8search's URL naming scheme is easily decodable -- the hackzq8search URL includes the full URL of the cloned URL, so I can write a Greasemonkey script to extract the proper original URL.<p>I found a glimmer of optimism in that the site has been slowly fading in SEO-success this week: I complained about <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=aws+s3+security+sox+pci+dss"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=aws+s3+security+sox+pc...</a>  on Thursday, but on Friday the hackzq8search Search Result was gone from the first search result page.<p>It's still not hard to slam some AWS-related keywords into Google and get these bogus results, though.",1295682734

Most of the companies that totally missed the boat on competing with the iPhone are in a much better position today. HP/Palm & RIM of course but also Microsoft who I think has an opportunity to make inroads in the tablet-as-productivity-tool market someday. Any of these companies could stand to capitalize on Google's cat-herding problem or Apple's authoritarian pitfalls.

Even in your\n'fun' projects you have shown a real knack for delivering something\ndesirable and useful enough to gain traction.<p>The traction <i>results</i> in an increased support workload. On the\ntechnical side, the traction <i>results</i> in an increased server workload.\nSince you are not profiting from the traction, you are unable to scale.<p>You get the same amount of time in each day as everyone else, so if you\ndon't plan to scale, the time you have will become impacted with things\nyou would rather avoid.<p>Selling off your side projects is an answer but it is not the optimal\nanswer. A better answer is two fold; (1) find a way to profit from the\ntraction, and (2) use those funds to hire someone to take care of some\nof the added workload.<p>Every successful entrepreneur learns to manage the constant cycle of\nacquiring new responsibilities and then delegating those new\nresponsibilities to others.

If you fund as many companies as we do it's unavoidable you'll end up with some overlap. Even if you tried not to accept competing companies, you'd still get overlap because startups' ideas morph so much. The way we deal with it is that when two startups are working on related stuff, we don't talk to one about what the other's doing.<p>In practice it has not turned out to be a problem, because most big markets have room for several slightly different solutions, and it's unlikely that two startups would do precisely the same thing.",1295681538

You just <i>don't</i> get spectacular growth numbers in those scenarios.  Doesn't mean you can't squeeze the monopoly position to make great profits of course, but those profits aren't going to increase exponentially year after year without cease.<p>Apple on the other hand has been recently expanding into new markets (okay, some older ones too, and some borrowed and some blue) at an enormous rate.  People laughed at them when they said they would enter the phone market.  People laughed at them when they said they would enter the tablet market.<p>In fairly short order, they've totally disrupted <i>and defined</i> those two markets.  Now personally I believe that their dominance in those markets will be short lived, but I think they will continue to lead the direction of those industries long after their market share has dropped below 10%.<p>Google's done what?  They have a really nice e-mail service... but apart from that and the search/advertising thing what do they do?  Oh, they bought youtube and slapped ads all over it... yeah... great work guys, but not exactly what I'd call innovative.

2130131,comment,2129707,2129707,0,0,danilocampos,,,"I'm not qualified to comment on the fuzzier elements of psychology here, but rich parents <i>do</i> matter in some pretty practical ways.<p>Most dramatically:<p>Rich parents know interesting people. In many cases, wealth is a function of trust combined with ability. You don't (usually) get wealthy by hiding in your basement and never talking to anyone. So along the way, you meet good people and build relationships.<p>Conversely, the less wealthy a parent is, the less likely they are to form relationships with people who can benefit their children. At the extreme end: if your mom is a fry cook at McDonald's, what benefits are her colleagues able to offer you? How many of those connections can benefit your future?<p>On the other end, if your mom is Marissa Mayer, you're in much better shape. 14 and want a summer job? I bet she knows someone who could give you some interesting, mind-expanding paid work. 19 and looking for a college gig that can help you get a great job after your graduate? etc.<p>It's anecdotal, but growing up in a household that wasn't at all wealthy, I can point to this as the greatest disadvantage I faced. I wanted to learn programming, but we didn't know anyone who knew anything about that. I wanted to know anything at all about computers, and I was on my own. Not an insurmountable problem – I taught myself. But I know access to mentorship at an early age could have made a huge impact.",1295681130

They stop resellers like Psystar, and they've broken a few things which appeared to be ancillary to moving their own products forward (Atom CPUs), but they could be far more annoying about it every point release if they really felt like it. Early on, they also needlessly released a few fat binary hardware drivers for ethernet, sound, and wifi devices that have never been bundled in a real Intel Mac.<p>Apple certainly has the means to stop it, but I don't think they mind the fringe hackers running OSX.  I've seen a few people converted by it, and I own a few real Macs plus the hackintosh as well, and I suspect most people who hackintosh are Apple customers of some degree.
