CPAN _is_ the killer app. It's a HUGE, extremely easy to install module/library archive. Perl's modules aren't spread around everywhere but neatly and nicely collected there and you just do a ""cpan Foobar"" and get Foobar with all possible dependencies included.<p>Which is something what many languages (some still don't) have these days one way or another but really nothing compared to CPAN in number, service, search, testing facility and so on. You plainly _never_ have to bother searching your ass off to find some library you might need.<p>Moose is Perl's OO system - as with JavaScript you can do different OO styles with Perl and Moose is a framework to do a role/trait based (please see Smalltalk for details or Perl 6's spec) OO with a heavy twist on metaprogramming.<p>Perl is for writing things like Amazon or the IMDB and keep it running for 12 years in a row or for creating Nagios and SpamAssassin to watch over half of the Internet. Thanks to Perl, everybody can easily imagine what push, pop, shift, unshift on Arrays/Lists does and thanks to Perl everybody has very shiny Regex these days. That's why Vim has a magic/nomagic flag and what the P in PCRE stands for. The Ruby world gladly thanks Perl's DBI after which it modeled its own database interface.<p>That's what Perl is about. Sharing shiny features and establishing a culture of ""getting things done who run really fast"".",1294588795

Patton did exactly that (""survived the politics and bureaucracy of a peacetime military""), from before the Mexican expedition or whatever it's called through the post-WWI period.  Heck, one of his officer evaluations said something to the effect that he was a real pain in peacetime ""but would be invaluable in time of war"".<p>Granted, in today's ""zero defects"" system that wouldn't have happened, but at least prior to WWII we weren't that insane.  On the other hand, in peacetime prior to the Cold War the military was generally on starvation rations and retaining capable men was a major objective, sometimes to the detriment wartime effectiveness.  E.g. the IJN frequently cleaned our clock in night time action, even when we had an advantage in RADAR, since our Navy hadn't seriously exercised at night prior to the war.<p>The latter is based on my current study of the WWII US Navy in the Pacific and specifically a couple of biographies of two of our best Admirals in it, Mark Mitscher and especially the more detailed one on Arleigh Burke.",1294588307

However, FPS that use a little state prediction become much more complicated.<p>Ideally, FPS would run two versions of the game world, what happened, and what the players see, with more information being sent about what happened close to the player helping the version that players see be more accurate.

(Just tried to log back into it after probably over 10 years but the forgot password link doesn't work) I read the Camel book cover-to-cover and giggled at the footnotes.<p>While I loved the language, I can't imagine going back to it. Now perl programs look like cat typing to me. It was way too expressive. The TIMTOWDI mentality meant that I could never read code I didn't write myself, and even some that I did. It was terse and dense like poetry and hard to understand - like poetry. To really ""know"" the language meant knowing a huge surface area full of exceptions and special conditions.<p>Sure, you could limit yourself to certain best-practices and styles but it was like being handing the keys to the porsche and told to only drive 35. At every turn, the language was begging you to flex that newly acquired knowledge of special syntax. The obfuscation contests, the perl poetry, the quines… Many languages have this failing in my opinion and it certainly matters more when you're working in a large team (hence, rigid boring old Java) but Perl taught me what it was like to go too far down that path.<p>It is what I would call a write-only language.",1294587584

2085589,comment,2085276,2085452,0,0,Su-Shee,,,"Sure, there are plenty of reasons of the whys and whens - on the other hand, we could easily ask ""why didn't everyone choose Emacs when textmate's development came to a halt"" or ""Why didn't people choose Python as their web language of choice when they didn't like PHP"" or ""Why not Bazaar instead of SVN"" or why Ryan Dahl chose JavaScript as a base language for Node.js and not any of Python, Ruby, Perl, Scheme, Lisp or Lua - but JavaScript - and so on. (As others already pointed out below so I'm summing this up in one sentence here..) Thankfully we have plenty of options to choose from nowadays.<p>And yet I'm still convinced that the choice of Git over Bazaar has something to do with the smoothness of Github and with ""It's from Linus!"", the choice of Ruby/RoR with the image 37signals so nicely projects, that JavaScript's recent rise and massive change in perception comes thanks to Douglas Crockford and Erlang would have probably stayed in its niche if it wasn't for CouchDB.<p>So I was surprised and amazed by the change in perception of Vim over the last year and therefore I blogged about it.<p>And yes, along your examples Perl faced a similar situation around 2000 (so thanks for the well chosen examples) and decided to do Perl 6 to re-ignite the Perl spark.
