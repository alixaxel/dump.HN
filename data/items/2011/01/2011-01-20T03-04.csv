The Android app is so janky that it may as well not exist.  It's been three years and I still can't receive picture messages.  Text messages get dropped 20% of the time, and you have to choose between having them forwarded to your cell phone with contact names inexplicably prepended to every message (often resulting in long texts being split up into 3 or more parts that get delivered in the wrong order) or having them delivered via pull notification on the Android app, which <i>might</i> notify you of new texts within 24 hours.  Sometimes, calls will instantly disconnect when I pick them up.  There is no support.  There is no hope.  There is only Google, the Fortress of Customer Solitude.",1295495908
