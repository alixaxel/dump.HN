We will increasingly see more and more apps falling over to the iOS ""dark side"" and culminating with the release of Lion.<p>Personally, while I loved my iPhone and think the iOS is a great thing on a small screen I'm not a big fan of the iPad.  Let me re-phrase that, I'm not a big fan of the iPad's launcher.  Anyway, Lion will be a big UI step, probably in the direction of iOS and away from OS X.  That kind of makes me sad and worried about the future of Mac products.  On the other hand, I'm very happily a Ubuntu and Android user and maybe they will pick up the torch and grow better and better.",1294386772

I've run several marathons and ultras and have done quite a bit of experimenting on my body over the years. I managed to borrow a copy of this book tonight and pounded through quite a bit of it.<p>From what I read, it's actually 4 weeks of bone/muscle/ligament conditioning, followed by 12 weeks of running training -- IF you can run a 5K at an 8:00 pace or faster. If you can't, then yep, you guessed it, more training time.<p>This is doable and pretty much falls in line with conventional training (though Tim reorganizes it a little bit, and throws in the all important and generally under-emphasized benefits of cross-training), but it isn't ""in 12 weeks"" at all.<p>I've done quite a bit of iterative experimenting with cross-training (especially cycling and swimming) and it unilaterally improved my running speeds and my long run recovery times.<p>His graphs and charts seem rather superfluous to me. Meant to intimidate rather than inform.<p>I'm not so concerned about permanent damage because of the initial 4 week conditioning process. If you're not already a seasoned runner, this program will take you as long or longer as Galloway or Joe Henderson's training plans.<p>His advice and data are solid, but don't meet his ""in 12 weeks"" mark. As far as I know, he still hasn't actually run 50K.

Though I feel in the minds of a lot of people ""something that are you are"" is more likely to be fair game for rumor and ridicule than ""something (especially a trauma) that has happened to you."" I.e. confiding a tragedy/trauma to someone will more universally be perceived as 'serious' and 'a big deal' in terms of keeping confidences.",1294383935
