Bernstein's response to the cache poisoning flaw published in 2007, to which his own popular djbdns server was not vulnerable. Unlike DNSSEC, DNSCurve doesn't change the schema used for DNS data, but instead simply allows a DNS client to securely ask a question of a DNS server without allowing that question to be read or tampered with.<p>In a DNSSEC world, an attacker who broke into a cache server might (with many very important caveats) not be able to inject fake DNS data directly into RAM, even with control of the machine itself. DNSCurve does not provide this protection.<p>In a DNSCurve world, an attacker with control over the network would not be able to tamper with or even read the DNS queries sent from your desktop machine to a DNS server. DNSSEC, in its commonly proposed configuration --- the one overwhelmingly likely to form the basis of any DNSSEC adoption to occur† --- does not provide this protection.<p>Kaminsky favors DNSSEC; Bernstein in fact calls him ""the marketing department for DNSSEC"".<p>† <i>I'm bearish on DNSSEC for reasons beyond its security issues, which I think --- at least at the protocol level --- are marginal.</i>",1294372579
2078487,comment,2075239,2076305,0,0,pak,,,"IIRC from the last time I browsed through jQuery source, attr('css', ...) is used internally but didn't look like it was meant to be exposed as a public method.  And I never remember seeing this sort of special case in the docs.  So, I wouldn't recommend using it in kosher jQuery code.  A lot of things in this article seem a little dated; almost every tutorial now covers the $(function() {}) shortcut, and event binding is something I wouldn't know about jQuery?  Really.<p>Note to jeresig: this article illustrates a beef I remember passing on when the jQuery docs reorganized; it works well as API reference now, but before, introductory text for each section of the docs describing things like event namespacing made for a nicer introduction to beginners like me, as well as the structured sub-organization of methods within each section.  Now, it's more of an alphabetical method soup, so a lot of beginners probably never bother to learn that event namespaces exist, or what the jQuery event object does.  For example, you can only get to the documentation on the event object from <i>within</i> the documentation for <i>methods</i> like .bind(), which I find odd.  (How would a beginner know that it even existed unless they went specifically to the .bind() docs in an alphabetical list of other cooler sounding methods?)",1294372558
