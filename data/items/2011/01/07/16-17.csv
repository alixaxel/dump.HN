Contrary to what a lot of people will tell you, it is fine to change the history of a pushed branch -- especially for the most recent commit -- so long as other developers adopt a policy of rebasing after fetch.  Here is a concrete example:<p>(bare repo): # Make sure receive.denyDeleteCurrent = ignore<p>(Dev A): git push<p>(Dev B): git pull --rebase  # you can make this the default for a particular tracking branch so it is just ""git pull""<p>(Dev B): # do some work<p>(Dev B): git commit<p>(Dev A): git commit --amend<p>(Dev A): git push origin :master  # Deletes remote master.  Not required for shared branches -- those can simply be replaced -- but ""master"" is usually the ""current branch"" for a repo, so it bears knowing.<p>(Dev A): git push origin master:master  # And now we replace the remote's version with our local version.<p>(Dev B): git pull --rebase  # Updates pointers and applies the new commit on top.<p>Yes, if you do even more devastating history changes than this, Dev B needs to dig a little further on why his rebase is going haywire.  THIS is why people fear the history change; it is sometimes extra work for downstream developers to handle the rearrangements (and we developers like to be lazy and for everything to work smoothly the first time).  Thankfully, downstream developers can solve these problems with a few git tools, including ""rebase --onto"" and cherry-picking.  But in the case of a quick and simple commit amend, all is well.<p>Alternatively, you can code review, but sometimes people are in a rush, and you run into this situation.  In most environments, I wager it will be okay, especially if there is communication on the changes and reasonable education on version control theory.",1294417589

Of course not.<p>And what happens when a high-tech growth company climbs up from a small negative earnings to a small positive earnings?  Suddenly instead of having an undefined P/E, they have a very high P/E.  This is reasonable.  A solar power company with 500m in sales and 1m in earnings that had 200m in sales and hugely negative earnings in the previous year could very well be worth over a billion.

Now it's flat-out impossible, as near as I can tell. If you care about display quality just about your only choice is WLED or Dell's BGR-LCD, which tends to be only intermittently available from them anyhow. These are <i>better</i> than a standard TN display, in that there at least exist angles you can view a 15"" or 17"" screen without being able to see glaringly-obvious color fade on the top and bottom of the screen, but they're still not perfect.<p>I just got a Studio 17 with that; 15 is your only other choice but for some reason it was much more expensive and I couldn't justify it. (I am a fairly large man, 6'4""-ish, so a 17"" laptop is much more comfortable for me than most, I actually sort of like it but I very much believe I'm the exception. Seeing this machine on my wife's lap is a bit comical looking, especially now that I'm used to seeing the little netbook.) On the bright side, 17"" laptops are nowhere near as clunky as they were in 2007. They're still 17"", of course.<p>Unfortunately, my first ""real"" laptop, I accidentally acquired an IPS-based laptop, and it has spoiled me. All I wanted was the higher res, got the higher quality without even knowing there <i>were</i> quality grades at the time.<p>Resolutions I don't care about as much. My preferred layout is two emacs windows next to each other and I often chop those in half vertically anyhow. At 1920x1080 I can get three next to each other. Terminal off to the side (covering what usually ends up being the tertiary window anyhow), web browser and associated stuff on another virtual desktop one keystroke away.

He is also known for having sided with a female professor in a sex discrimination suit at Caltech - again, very ahead of his time.<p>I also recall that at least some of that rep came from his use of stories that were presumably sexist, such as stupid driver (woman), smart cop (man). But according to Feynman, it was his critics, not him, who assumed that the smart cop was male, so the egg was on them.<p>Finally, a lot of people conflate Feynman's womanizing with sexism, and I think the guy should get a break for trying to find solace in as many women's arms as possible after watching his wife slowly die from cancer.",1294416125

What would be cool is to have a standard like:<p><a href=""http://somewebsite.com/services.json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://somewebsite.com/services.json</a> (or services.xml)<p>whereby the 'services.json' file would describe what 'actions' and 'data' is available programatically ('search', 'subscribe', 'contact details', 'product catalog' etc).<p>ch, I really appreciate the feedback, this is exactly why I posted this on HN! Please don't think of my response as being in anyway aggressive or defensive :-)",1294416118

My favorite story of Feynman is his calculation of the size of the first nuclear explosion and then driving to just a few miles outside the blast radius (much closer than his colleagues were willing to watch from).  That's a level of mental confidence that I can't even begin to imagine possessing.<p>Surely You're Joking is a great read - one of those ""drop what you're doing and read it now"" kinds of books.",1294416083
