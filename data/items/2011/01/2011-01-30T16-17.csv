2158428,comment,2157703,2158097,6,0,telemachos,,,"A favorite passage about argument from Robert Nozick's <i>Philosophical Explanations</i>.[1] It's a long quotation, but worth it, I think:<p>The terminology of philosophical art is coercive: arguments are <i>powerful</i> and best when they are <i>knockdown</i>, arguments <i>force</i> you to a conclusion, if you believe the premises you <i>have to</i> or <i>must</i> believe the conclusion, some arguments do not carry much <i>punch</i>, and so forth.  A philosophical argument is an attempt to get someone to believe something, whether he wants to believe it or not.  A successful philosophical argument, a strong argument, <i>forces</i> someone to a belief.<p>Though philosophy is carried on as a coercive activity, the penalty philosophers wield is, after all, rather weak.  If the other person is willing to bear the label of ""irrational"" or ""having the worse arguments,"" he can skip away happily maintaining his previous belief. He will be trailed, of course, by the philosopher furiously hurling philosophical imprecations: ""What do you mean, you're willing to be irrational? You shouldn't be irrational because..."" And although the philosopher is embarrassed by his inability to complete this sentence in a noncircular fasion - he can only produce reasons for accepting reasons - still, he is unwilling to let his adversary go.<p>Wouldn't it be better if philosophical arguments lef the person no possible answer at all, reducing him to impotent silence? Even then, he might sit there silently, smiling, Buddhalike. Perhaps philosophers need arguments so powerful they set up reverbarations in the brain: if the person refuses to accept the conclusion, he <i>dies</i>. How's that for a powerful argument. Yet, as with other physical threats (""your money or your life""), he can choose defiance. A ""perfect"" philosophical argument would leave no choice. (All emphases Nozick's.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC&lpg=PP1&ots=e7pynCwXH1&dq=%22philosophical%20explanations%22%20nozick&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC&lpg=PP1&#3...</a>",1296406687

And then some big telco coming in to try to undermine it. We've seen the same story again and again, over the globe. There is nothing unique to Canada in that.<p>As to Bell being a monopoly, that's a bit laughable of a concept now. I haven't used any Bell services for personal use in well over a decade, despite being in the center of Bell territory.<p>As to Canada's situation, it regularly ranks in the top tier of broadband penetration and broadband speeds. It sounds like you're the one using your anecdote inappropriately, because actual metrics refute you.<p><i>They'd gladly put their own infrastructure in to the ground, only they're not allowed to.</i><p>You're conflating issues. Because of the in-the-ground angle, companies are allowed to terminate twisted-pairs at the switching station, providing their own voice or data services. We recently hooked up a business backup high-speed ADSL line, the line provided by Bell, with the data provided by Cogent. Our primary data service, by the way, is provided by the electric company who have a distribution network of fiber.<p>What is changing is if Bogent terminated that line, but instead of providing their own infrastructure they simply leached off of Bell's. That was put in during the ""Soviet style"" control.<p>Again, this is all a bunch of people inventing a reality where they can have their free lunch. It is a tiny percentage of people making a loud noise, trying to burn it all down to get their way.

    - Restore the ability to browse the rest of the Internet.  Make
      available the viewpoints from the rest of the world as an alternative
      to government propaganda.  
</code></pre>
In order to facilitate these three aims, I propose the establishment of new or adaptation of existing Open Source projects:<p><pre><code>    - A DIY packet radio uplink kit.  
    - A one-click install for installing a Fidonet node on an older laptop 
      with a modem
    - Inexpensive WiFi-based ""Text messaging"" handsets.  
    - Open Source software to convert netbooks and smartphones into encrypted 
      communication devices
    - Weatherized WiFi communications cells which can be hidden, plugged in, and 
      abandoned (With some UPS capability to give immunity to power interruptions.)
    - A low cost ""pirate cell tower"" which can be used to re-enable SMS comms
      on conventional handsets when the government deactivates mobile service
</code></pre>

The free market provides for free competition between individuals where all transactions are voluntary and no force is used to interfere with any interactions between parties. In a corporatist/fascist environment the government uses force to interfere in nearly all aspects of the market. In fascism, corporations end up in bed with the government and the corps use that power to get what they want while the government sells the idea by using propaganda to fool people into thinking that ""it's all for your own good"".<p>When the government is in charge of setting rates for internet access this is the farthest thing in the world from a free market. What it is, is soviet style socialist central planning.<p>But there seems to be a strong desire to blame the free market for all woes, despite the obvious government interference in all aspects of these interactions.<p>What is free about having the government set the policies for internet charges?<p>In a free market the government wouldn't be involved at all, and the rates would be determined via competition.<p>Take a look at markets that are relatively more free, such as the cell phone market and the market for computer chips. Quality and features improve while prices go down over time.<p>When I admire my HTC Android phone I marvel at the quality and features and the amazing technology. This is the result of healthy competition.<p>Take a look at markets where the government is involved such as health care. Quality and choice are reduced while prices go through the roof.

But unfortunately for their social standing, and fortunately for people who are interested in facts, I know what I talk about.<p>Let's think about this carefully. If the models predicting the changes through emissions are so accurate, why does the outlook get so drastically worse every year? It's because the system that you refer to as our climate in reality also includes gravitational and magnetic factors. This introduces huge oscillating systems. If physics today has no confirmed understanding about the role of the gravity on the climate, and how a gravitational field is maintained, how could they rule out factors that would influence gravity? In fact, there isn't a real understanding of gravity in mainstream physics in the first place. But they discard questions about its influence like they know.<p>It's extremely concerning to me that so-called scientists are more concerned about being accepted by their peers than about getting the information we need to save our own lives.<p>Go ahead and downvote, but karma on hacker news is the smallest price to pay if I can find even one person who wants to confirm what I'm talking about.",1296403716
