Basically instead of applying a filter like levels to an image you make a levels layer that applies the levels affect to everything underneath it.  The original data is untouched, and you can tweak the levels at any time.<p>I'm strictly a hobby user for photos I take, but without support either 16 bit colour or adjustment layers GIMP is not good enough for me.

Presumably you don't have to satisfy everything in each level to be considered satisfying that level; otherwise if your entire family dies in a plane crash, you can never achieve MH3 again, and if you never got MH5 before that, you're permanently fucked.<p>2. If you get to MH4, but then your town gets hit by a neutron bomb, killing your wife, family, and friends, you get your MH3 knocked out, but your MH1, MH2, and MH4 are all still intact (MH4 because you telecommute most of the time, so your career is intact). Are you immediately eligible for MH5, or do you have to regenerate your MH3 first?<p>3. Interesting corner case: Say you get to MH3 by virtue of being raised in a rich American family. At age 18, you fly somewhere to visit a college by yourself, and your entire city gets blown away by a neutron bomb. You now have no friends or family, but life insurance on your family pays off handsomely, so you are at MH2. You decide to become a soulless driven businessman, and you do fine; you get promoted, everybody respects your competence, you respect other people's competence, etc, but you have no friends and no companionship. It would appear that you have reached MH4, but you never got there while you had MH3; does this count as MH4? Or do you deny the possibility of this scenario?

Concise and clear is even better. Concise, clear and funny, better still. Yudkowsky doesn't do too well on conciseness, but I think he does just fine on clarity and humour.

So also with ""epistemological state"".<p>What do other users of such terminology mean by it? I just asked Google for <<<""epistemological state"">>> and of the first page results I reckon: first one is this discussion; second one is EY's meaning; third is ambiguous; fourth is yours; fifth is EY's; sixth is EY's (and says in so many words: 'Philosophers tend to suppose that one's ""epistemological state"" is constituted by beliefs'; the authors are philosophers); seventh is yours; eighth is ambiguous but I think nearer EY's; ninth is a sort of hybrid, nearer to yours; for the tenth (of which I can see only the snippet Google provides, the rest being behind a paywall) I can't tell. Some of those hits are from people whose use of philosophical language I wouldn't trust for an instant, but at least four seem reputable. (I am not sure whether to be relieved or alarmed that the ones that look reputable to me on other grounds are also the ones that favour EY's usage; perhaps I'm suffering from some bias or something.)

This means that running the specs does <i>not</i> halt the main thread and specs can schedule blocks with assertions on the runloop for later execution. For now it's only in time (seconds), but this could be extended to use KVO to trigger running the block of assertions etc. I'm still working on the iOS runner, but there is a bug with Nu on iOS that I have to work on first. However, if you do want to try this out please let me know.<p>* MacBacon [5]: A fork of Bacon, for MacRuby, with the exact same runloop-aware code I implemented in NuBacon backported to MacRuby. Nota that I haven't used this code in a project yet, but needed it for a project I'm starting on today.

2091515,story,,,1,1,elmarschraml,"Ask HN: Best resources to learn about design?",,"Being a programmer, I lack a natural sense of design, and not every project requires or allows to hire a professional designer.<p>In short, I want to become better at making things look good. I like to believe that I have good taste, as in recognizing good design as such, but am pretty hopeless about creating good designs myself.<p>What books/blogs/websites have you found helpful to learn more about design?<p>Some suggestions of my own:<p>- Usability overlaps with design quite a bit (making things pleasant to use, getting rid of clutter etc), so books like Joel Spolsky's user interface design for programmers, Steve Krug's Don't make me think, or Alan Cooper's About Face can help with design, too.<p>- Robin Williams: The Non-designer's design book. Short, to the point, and teaches the basic principles.<p>- Blogs: Smashing Magazine and Six Revisions.",1294740856

I hung out on a forum dedicated to hardware at about that time, and the paradigm shift that Intel's Core 2 chip caused was insane.<p>Within literally weeks AMD was old news and Intel was king (this was after a couple of years of outright dislike of Intel as the ""big corporate"").<p>AMD beat Intel to 1GHz, X64(proper) and Multi-core(proper). But Intel produced a brilliant and quality line of chips in Core 2, which has left AMD basically floundering for nearly 4 years now.<p>I think that's fine. In a few years, with luck, AMD will produce a killer chip that leaves Intel scrabbling. Such competition is good :)",1294740819

This was according to leaflets in my doctor's waiting room produced by the coffee growers association or some group like that. I showed my doctor one of the leaflets and he went to the waiting room and removed them all.<p>He advised me to ditch coffee, which resolved what was otherwise going to be a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (which is a diagnosis of exclusion of a disease that not everybody agrees even exists). If you're feeling tired, try giving up any drugs that affect how awake you are.<p>(And go to a doctor. Plenty of engineers don't eat right as well as not sleeping right, anaemia feels absolutely terrible but is so easy to diagnose and treat)",1294740216
