It was before the term ""Net Neutrality"" even existed (which is what makes it such a pain--I can't for the life of me find the original article).<p>I think I originally saw the plan on Slashdot, after which there was a letter signed by a ton of interest groups (more than just the CC & ACLU, way more) opposing the plan.  That unity didn't last long--they were afraid and ran straight to the lobbyists.<p>People saw good reason to worry that they wouldn't just give up and came up with the name ""Net Neutrality"" for the cause, but... then we started getting split up.  At first, they were questioning, ""Is this really needed"" and ""What the heck does 'Net Neutrality' mean?""

2083777,comment,2083364,2083682,0,0,btilly,,,"All simple proofs which have contradiction at their center can be rewritten using the contrapositive.  The contrapositive is the statement that A implies B is the same as not B implies not A.  (The equivalence can be seen from the fact that both statements are equivalent to saying that you cannot have A and not B true at the same time.)<p>For a formal version you can search for Gödel's 1933 proof that intuitionistic and classical logic are equiconsistent.  Meaning that a contradiction in one would have to be a contradiction in another.<p>Half of this is easy.  Every proof in intuitionistic logic is a proof in classical logic.  So a contradiction in intuitionistic logic is a contradiction in classical logic.<p>The reverse is much harder.  For this he created a procedure that can take any proof in classical logic (where proof by contradiction is allowed) and convert it into a proof in intuitionistic logic (where proof by contradiction is not allowed).  In the conversion the statement being proven may change (classical logic and intuitionistic logic very much do not prove the same statements).<p>The interesting thing about the procedure is that the converted proof is a proof in classical logic, of the exact same statement that the original proof proved.  But it doesn't use contradiction.<p>That procedure is the source of the principle that is mentioned.<p>(Incidentally this proof is a large part of why constructivism came to be abandoned.  A major argument for constructivism was that being careful in your reasoning might avoid potential paradoxes around infinity.  Gödel's proof showed that all of the extra effort gave no such reward.)",1294515808

2083745,comment,2081321,2082986,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"It's not a contradiction, you don't understand. Faith is the serious belief that something can happen or is real. When a scientist embarks upon a hypothesis, he does so because he has <i>faith</i> that something valuable may come from experimenting on that hypothesis, which is a hope for value not yet seen. Faith is not just a belief or hope, but it is a set of works accomplished in the attitude of that hope, so the scientist, by faith, continues his experiments on a hypothesis.<p>The same process occurs in the spiritual and religious realm with regard to faith. Religious people hear that certain information and/or manifestations are available to them, and they have faith sufficient to follow the path outlined. As they do so, they find their initial faith validated, and then they continue to have faith on the next point outlined in the scriptures, and find that faith validated, and so on.<p>Faith is not knowledge; faith is a stopgap on the way to knowledge, and it's a principle necessary for healthy or reasonable conduct in all forms, which is part of why religion requires such an emphasis of faith. If a man obtains all knowledge, there is no more need for faith, because he knows everything of himself and has no need to believe something without a formal proof, as he has already received a formal proof of every true thing, which can only happen as that man has sufficient faith in true things to experiment and learn of their truth with help from God.

It took them two months to process the complaint after one of the VideoLAN developers made it, but they followed through on an action that ""a VLC developer"" initiated.<p>With respect, if a developer representing VideoLAN complains to Apple, and another developer representing VideoLAN and claiming to be in charge approaches and tries to ""work it out"", Apple is not going to step into what appears to be an internal dispute. I am never an Apple apologist as I think they're a bit heavy-handed with the App Store, but in this case, how would you expect them to act?<p>This is what ""a VLC developer"" wanted, and he got it.

And by ""the hard way,"" I mean ""through your own company.""<p>Yes, you do indeed have to read and/or listen to some podcasts, but you'll benefit in many ways that far outweigh the time you spend reading.<p>One of the core principles of the lean startup is to learn from customers so that you can build a product that people actually want and are willing to pay for. It gives you ideas on how to do this. It also tells you to stay lean and be ready to pivot; to not be hard-nosed to  press forward on your original path, because that may not be the best thing for the business. Does this sound like advice that you should be ignoring?<p>The lean startup methodology isn't the only way to success, but it does seem to be helping people.

He criticizes studies that disagree with his assertions (like The China Study), while promoting studies that are <i>far</i> less convincing that happen to support his opinions. Several of the studies he cites about ""leaky gut syndrome"" seem to be based on watching chemical reactions in a petri dish, which is nearly nonsensical when trying to understand a system containing billions of organisms.<p>""Leaky gut syndrome"" is, historically, an alternative medicine diagnosis, and conventional medicine doesn't really have much science on the subject. That's not to say it's completely fabricated, just that whenever someone is a ""leaky gut syndrome"" expert, as Robb Wolf is, there will be tons of people who will go see him, get his ""treatment"" and feel better for a while because of placebo effect. Everybody in the chain believes in the disease and the cures, so it tends to work a lot of the time, at least long enough for it to be considered a successful case study for Wolf's purposes.<p>That said, where there's smoke there's often fire, and there does seem to be a lot of smoke around grains in the human diet, and some of the fire may be caused by gluten. So, in the interests of keeping things simple, I've cut gluten out of my diet during the week. On ""cheat day"" I eat plenty of grains, mostly brown rice, as it's a food I love (with curry and such), but also pastries and breads and beer.<p>I don't really buy the leaky gut syndrome argument, as wheat has never caused me intestinal distress, while numerous other foods have due to always having had a sensitive stomach, but I'm willing to take a chance on the idea that wheat and gluten <i>might</i> have negative outcomes. Also, eggs are shown to help burn fat and build muscle, so I eat a lot of organic eggs from free range chickens (4-6 per day), and I've also added mussels and shrimp back into my diet (the first meat I've eaten in 17 years, and the only meat I can feel ethically comfortable eating).",1294514168
