2150736,comment,2149105,2149105,0,0,trotsky,,,"I think people are misunderstanding this report, which is surely their intent. This isn't a chart of how well each ISP performs in general, or even how well they perform in relation to each other.<p>As a baseline, all of the ISPs on this list that I've used (ftth, coax and dsl providers) have been able to push to 90%-100% of quoted line speed 99% of the time.<p>What this chart shows is netflix performance, which is quite different than general network performance. What goes into netflix performance? Total netflix service load, CDN pop load, CDN circuit size, SLA/QOS terms, the choices the netflix client makes about adaptive bitrates and shaping the  provider applies to the traffic.<p>Take a look at the US chart and note the correlations in spikes and dips across all providers at certain times - 10/21 peak, 10/23 valley, 11/13 valley etc. These are indications of aggregate stream load netflix wide and are an indication that netflix manages their peak throughput to be pretty close to their max throughput (as well they should). But it's also a strong indication that if 10% of netflix customers switched to a competitor overnight average stream performance for netflix would jump noticeably, perhaps even 10%.<p>How their adaptive streaming works is another huge factor. First they measure your current performance to the CDN POP and then explicitly chooses to use only 60% of that[1]. So add 40% to all the ISP numbers out of the gate. TCP+HTTP overhead is another ~4%. Downloading something else while you stream? If the streaming sees more than a few headroom faults (ie 1000ms worth of data takes more than 600ms) the system will quickly adapt down in bitrate trying to do its best to never hard fault (buffering). It likely is considerable more conservative in moving the stream speed back up. Customer using 802.11b? Max throughput there is ~5mbps, so netflix will use a max of 3mbps. In an urban area on a congested channel? You may only see 1-2mbps at times. Microwave on? etc.<p>Lastly, with the news that netflix is 20% of ISP traffic at night the network providers have every incentive to manage that traffic down. Look at the best US performer at ~2700kbits. The fastest HD stream is 4800kbits - Nearly twice the speed. Worst case if an ISP allowed full rate streaming they might increase their peak network load by 10% or more.<p>Who was it that announced netflix is now 20% of night time traffic? Our old friend sandvine, provider of the DPI gear made famous by comcast using it to throttle bittorrent. This tells us two things - 1) sandvine is on net at at least a few major broadband providers and 2) by announcing that number they are implicitly telling network managers that they can help reduce that traffic.<p>Netflix makes it very easy to do fine grained control on bitrates. If you are watching the HTTP headers you know exactly which customers are on which stream rate without having to count the throughput. Most users won't notice a QOE change from 4800kbits to 3200kbits. Want to cut your network traffic? Use DPI to identify the higher rates and label them bulk-toofast. Then either explicitly rate limit them, give them a low queue priority or simply route the acks through a big buffer under performing router or indirect route. Once the adaptive bitrate slows down to a rate you like switch the label. The more subtle of these methods are much, much harder to detect than the comcast RST's were, and wouldn't technically violate any net neutrality rules in place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.breakingpointsystems.com/community/blog/emulating-netflix-delivering-video-through-the-cloud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.breakingpointsystems.com/community/blog/emulating...</a>",1296187124

Paul Graham says that jobs are bad things (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html</a>) and you should be an entrepreneur instead.<p>The problem is that something like 90% of startups will fail. I bet there are more than a few people on HN who have worked on a startup while receiving unemployment benefits. So if you're on unemployment benefits and decide to do a startup under the table, there's at least some chance something good will happen.<p>The chance that nothing productive will come out of people working in the unemployment GULAG digging the Great Mexican Ditch (btw, wouldn't it be cheaper to hire Mexican laborers to dig it?) is 100%.<p>Of course, none of this applies to you, because you're a special entrepreneurial snowflake. No one you know or care about has ever, or will ever, be unemployed. But everyone else is supposed to be your wage slave, willing to move across the country to work on your social media startup, cleaning toilets for stock options (because, you know, janitorial services is a dead industry). Either that, or they're a welfare queen spending their days snowboarding and playing x-box while sipping champagne and smoking cigars rolled from your tax dollars.<p>And fuck their safety net and their medical care.<p>This is why I have no problem calling out ""libnerdtarians"" and other social conservatives.

The whole problem is that they DO provide a diminished dose of what healthy socializing provides and continually suppress the motivation to seek out something more substantial. It's sort of akin to snacking on junk food all day long and never eating a real meal. Sure, you can keep yourself from getting hungry, but you're not getting any actual sustenance, and in the long run you will experience feelings way more unpleasant than hunger if you keep it up. It would probably be better if those foods provided no hunger satisfaction at all. Then people could enjoy them occasionally for the taste, but wouldn't be tempted to use them as substitutes for real food.<p>Personally, I quit Facebook a few weeks ago, and I've been much happier and more productive for it. I might go back at some point, but honestly I don't even feel the urge anymore. I'd rather just be alone when I'm alone. Get work done, sort out my thoughts, etc., and then when I feel like being with people, I'll make the effort to call around or round some people up. Overall I find myself getting more out of both kinds of experience. I've also noticed, strangely enough, that people have tended to seek me out more since I quit Facebook, I suppose since they no longer have an easier alternative for keeping up with me, and when we meet up, it feels like there's actually some catching up to do, as opposed to the feeling that you already know everything that's going on with a person because you constantly post on each others' walls and read their status updates.",1296184972

It breaks every so often and you have to wait a day or so for it to get fixed. A 'feature' of this unofficial client is that it doesn't play any of the ads on free Pandora accounts. So Pandora probably isn't very happy with that.",1296183817

It would interface directly with my brain so that there would be no chance of my mouse slipping and clicking 'OK' when I meant 'Cancel'.<p>Oh wait... that would be incredibly time-consuming to implement, would very likely only marginally improve the experience for the majority of users, and would be plagued by edge-case pitfalls.",1296183810

Being at google is a recipe for complacency. Quitting your job is incentive to actually figure out how to build something good.  Because it's do that or fail.",1296183786

(Obviously try to get clarification and more info, etc. this is assuming you were not able to.)<p>Nevertheless, in the back of your mind you should try to remember the bug and maybe you'll come across something that will let you figure out what it was.<p>This doesn't scale so well for OSS projects, but if it's paid work and the bug came from your client then you better track such things, even if you can't immediately fix them.",1296183674
