You could deny or approve one permission at a time and the developer had to handle it (and by handling that really meant always checking for permissions before actions and bugging the user for the permission whenever they tried something that required it). As a developer I prefer the new way, which is also how Android development works. Giving line-item veto to a user is a terrible idea. If they don't like the permissions, don't use the app. It's good for Facebook's api too because now people aren't constantly checking which permissions are available before they do something, probably reducing the stress on the API quite a bit.",1295222158

System domain knowledge and problem domain knowledge are both at least as important as language domain knowledge.<p>I've never needed to hire ""a Perl programmer"", I've needed to hire people in much more specific categories like ""someone to work on a webapp written in Perl for a travel company"" - where system domain knowledge (knowing about things like SQL injection, XSS, character encoding, SOAP and it's lack of and ""S"", session management in http, authentication and security), and  problem domain knowledge (some understanding of the travel industry, ecommerce, online credit card transactions) is at least as important as their Perl knowledge. I suspect in a lot of cases it'd be easier to buy a copy of Perl Best Practices for a candidate with strong system and problem domain knowledge but limited production Perl experience and have then thrive in the above role, compared to someone with a complete understanding of Perl's syntax and gotchas who's never worked on a consumer facing web app. By the same argument, all the ecommerce specific perl web app experience in the world won't on it's own win you a bioinformatics/data mining job (with me) over a Python or Java guy with in depth biology knowledge...<p>On an even higher level, it's easy to poke fun at Google/Microsofts hiring gameshow style questions, but they're trying (however badly) to identify/recognize problem solving skills, which are completely language agnostic. A solid grounding in algorithms and data structures, and the ability to do back of the envelope calculations based on reasonable assumptions/estimates (with supporting reasoning and error bounds for those estimates) is a very different skill to ""just programming"", and people possessing those skills, while in a small company will still be ""a programmer"", in a larger shop (like Google) would have a role perhaps better described as ""project architect"" or ""system designer"". Being able to answer with good explanations behind your reasoning ""how many gas stations are there in America?"" or ""why are manhole covers round"" might not be relevant if your hiring a programmer to modify Wordpress or write a Magento plugin, but people who _can_ discuss and answer those sort of questions are demonstrating a much higher level of skill than just knowing whether arrays are passed by value or reference in programming language de jour...",1295220544
