I am reminded of another Princeton suicide, Manzili Davis '06 drove to California during spring break of his senior year, rented a storage unit and took his life inside of it.  It was weeks before he was found.  <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S14/54/83M99/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S14/54/83M99/</a><p>We had mutual friends and I met him a few times.  He had his own ""darkness"" just like Bill Zeller.<p>I do wonder if places like Princeton bring out the darkness in people there.  I enjoyed my time there but spent the last year of it in and out of counseling and more depressed than I ever hope to be again.<p>There were some good counselors there in the health center who were kind and patient.  It's too bad Bill wasn't able to connect with one of them.<p>A lot of the problem is with the town.  The ""town"" of Princeton is a sham propped up to impress visiting students.  There's really not a whole lot there.  Meanwhile, students are required to live in dorms all 4 years, which gives them a really artificial ""home life"" that doesn't help ground you very much either.<p>I lived and worked in the town of Princeton for two years after graduation and it was a thoroughly depressing and isolating experience.  Unless you're a member of the university community, there's just nothing there to get excited about.  You have to leave on the train for the day to do anything interesting.",1294315190

2074942,comment,2074109,2074601,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"<i>I think what saddens me most about this note is his experience with counseling professionals</i><p>I can relate to that part of the note. With one (minor?) exception, I've never seen a proper doctor about my issues, but I've been to a number of counselors over the years. Almost all of them have been completely useless to me, because I can clearly see that I'm <i>not</i> safe there.<p>I think it's a bit like the situation Mr. Zeller faced. I don't want to go far into my issues, because this isn't the place for that and, even if it were, my issues are nothing compared to his, but suffice it to say that in high school I was pretty concerned about my ability to manage my anger. I managed to tell a guidance counselor this, one I'd known since I started high school (she had first been my French teacher, then was assigned to me when she transitioned into counseling), and asked to be referred to a counselor before I hurt someone.<p>When I was with the counselor, however, although I was there explicitly because I was worried about hurting people, I was always measured in my responses. I limited what I said because I was always trying to determine where exactly the line was where a counselor becomes legally obligated to report me to someone, and I tried my damnedest to stay on my side of that line. It limited what I said, and it limited how much I could get out of the experience, and so ultimately everything broke down and the counselor more or less told me to come back when I was willing to actually talk. I ended up getting basically nothing out of the experience, except for some extra time with my grandparents since they lived near the counselors office. Considering my grandfather died in April, and I still think of him every day, I suppose I should be grateful for the experience because even if I got fuck all out of the actual counseling, I still got to see my grandparents more.",1294314339

Different people can do different things with multiple focal points and varying UI orientations.<p>Advantage #2: Identification of non-capacitive objects. For example, imagine a car customization app. The idea being that you'd sit with a salesperson and work through options together. Place a key on the table and a 3D model of the car that matched that key would drive onto the scene and then park next to the key.<p>Hopefully someone can figure out a form factor and price point that can capitalize on these advantages.",1294313741

So, in brief:  Physics is very different from medicine.  If you drop an apple to test gravity (per second per second measures, etc), the apple does not make a zillion and one choices that impact how it falls.  But when you try to figure out what does and does not impact human health, people do make a zillion and one choices which impact the study outcome.  There is also quite a lot of evidence that most studies concerning human health have serious flaws.  Last, I would say that ""peer review"" is a form of social proof.  Given how poorly that point is going over in this discussion, I will skip attempting to elaborate.<p>Peace.",1294312819

Nvidia has been willing to build a CPU for a long time. And it's a well know fact that it has been barred from market entrance by Intel patents. ARM is beefing up its CPU line beyond mobile sector, so it's a logical choice.<p>As for power, well don't forget it'll be associated with a GPU, so the power advantage could easily be offseted by GPU hungriness. Time will tell.<p>On the other hand, tight integration and great compiler could allow Nvidia to tap into the GPU number crunching power through CUDA.<p>Still, it's not easy, just look at how the Cell hardly lived up to expectations.

It's an interesting topic that I want to develop and I'll charge on.<p>On the topic of intergenerational wealth, it's not enough to say that you can keep a lump of wealth. During the 300 years you talk about, governments rose and fell, and currencies and sovereign debt with them. In order to stay above water, you have to float your position across multiple regimes and positions. Or keep it in a lump of gold. That didn't do that - they worked money hard.<p>Rothschilds took on huge positions in the Napoleonic wars that could easily have gone wrong. They then would have lost it all due to poor timing over the end of the waterloo campaign but leveraged up by taking an audacious position on sovereign bonds that paid off and made them even richer. My point is, they gambled the house at several points.<p>Part of what's striking about the Rothschilds specifically is that they kept a healthy mindset across several generations.

A sports coach can force a player out of the games or out of the team if that player doesn't attend the practices. Teachers have no such power: students can't be forced to practice the material out of school, and they can't be removed from class for not practicing.<p>1. Standardized testing reflects, at best, decently the purpose and aims of general education. \nA competitive game of fotball, on the other hand, reflects perfectly the purpose and aims of football training. Simply said, the purpose of sports is to train a player to win the game. The purpose of general education is not to write a test successfully. Rather -- it <i>shouldn't</i> be the purpose of general education.<p>The purpose of education is to disseminate knowledge and critical thinking skills. That purpose needs to be measured in a correct fashion.<p>Think how silly it would be, instead of a competitive game of football, that each team was given a set of drills to perform, on their own, on an empty field, to prove their worth in football. It'd be absurd. It doesn't fit the purpose of their training. \nThe purpose of education shouldn't be to pass some tests.<p>A more constructive conversation, I believe, would be to find places, distinct disconnects if you will, where the method used to measure progress and achievement in education does not reflect the purpose and aims of education.",1294312155

I saw other commenters doing this on HN about this particular article and the irony struck me as astounding.
