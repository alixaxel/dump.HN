The ""Standard"" version (they've renamed it to something else, now) has lower quotas and no (non-bulletin board) support.  It also now has a cap of 50 seats (used to be higher).  For a while, you could only do video hosting and some other things on the business/""Premier"" plan; not sure about now.<p>Academic/non-profit is ""free"", but you have to prove your status somehow.<p>I still argue it's a bargain for the ""average"" business, compared to trying to host and manage this stuff yourself.  I don't know how good the support is, though -- the rest of Google's individual / customer level support leaves me rather doubtful.  I also don't know what happens when the subpoenas start flying.<p>If they ever establish HIPAA compliance/certification (I don't know whether it is worth their while), they may get a ""bazillion"" health care providers.  Especially if that ""whatever is currently their health records management offer"" thing works out.<p>But that would put them in the middle, as the records holder, of an awful lot of litigation.  From that perspective, it might be a real loser for them.  (Maybe the lobbyists are already working on this vis à vis some favorable legislation.)",1295715521

So, don't even try. Even if you talk fast enough, the audience won't get it. I'd expect 10 minutes be enough for a high-level overview of the paper, but if you can include just one bit of technical information which you think is the most valuable bit, that would be brilliant.<p>* reading from slides is an atrocity, so don't.<p>* and having too much text on the slides isn't cool either (the same applies to bullet lists, unless you absolutely have to). If you do, expect many people not to listen to you while they are reading the slides. So, only include large bodies of text if it's some code. And even then, format it nicely (color helps, but don't rely on it to convey useful information).<p>* ""pictures are worth a thousand words""... unless they are badly drawn. But a good picture is a great alternative to large bodies of text.<p>* practice your talk, especially if you haven't given many of them. That makes huge difference in how well you perform. And remember, a technical talk is still a performance.<p>* if you are worried that your mind would go blank once you  take the stage, hard-script the beginning of your presentation and read from the paper. Eventually, you will warm up and won't need it anymore, but it's great to quickly overcome stage fright and the like (helped me a great deal).",1295713671
