Java has some weak spots, but the really bad things (and the most criticized things) are not in the language per se.<p>E.g. the complete over- and abuse of XML for anything. Complex Ant build scripts. The whole EJB disaster (the older versions, that is). Bad APIs (though in all honesty, most of the really bad ones are 3rd party and not from Sun). The over-use of dependency injection, beans, etc. without a justifiable reason.<p>Many of these things are just stuff we learned to do better by now, for example JSON and/or Yaml over XML configuration, and convention over configuration. That lower overhead and higher understandability are more important than some would be architect's dreams. On some things the jury is still out (e.g. more or less functionality in basic classes like String, List, ...).<p>Overall, I think some people are overlooking the many benefits Java has made available to the main stream. It's entirely possible to write beautiful Java code, you just have to go the extra mile of leaving the convention sometimes.",1295005712

In Java generics are practically implicit type-casts and nothing else.<p>About verbosity ... clear conventions are a lot more effective for readability and learning.

    import pdb

That opens up a Python debugging console at the current point of execution, and you can inspect ""obj"" for its type / members and also modify its state.

2103214,comment,2102564,2102794,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Good tools combine powerful underlying systems with abstractions that bring the necessary complexity of the system into a realm that is manageable by users. When done well it can make a tool that took a tremendous amount of effort and which encompasses a great deal of complexity look effortless and simple. And more importantly be intuitive to use.<p>If you look at a tool like a hammer both Spolsky and DHH would likely say that it was a simple tool. But that simplicity underlies a lot of complexity. The simplest hammer, the sort that a parody of DHH's ideals would lead you to believe he would advocate building, would be a simple suitably sized and shaped rock. Modern hammers are built using centuries of experience and a great deal of research. A great deal of metallurgy has gone into refining the exact variety of materials used in the hammer head as well as in the manufacture of it (drop forging). And not just in ensuring it is of a certain quality, but in ensuring that it is precisely suitable for its intended tasks. A great deal of research and experience has gone into shaping the head and the handle, and in their construction. Ergonomics, durability, efficiency, cost, etc, all of these factors are carefully balanced in the end product. When you hold a hammer you don't need a manual, it's operation is obvious and intuitive. The best tools work that way. It takes a lot of effort to learn how to drive an automobile properly because it is a complex task, yet the fundamental interface is nevertheless (today) very straightforward and intuitive.<p>Take a moment to think about all of the various tools you use routinely, from silverware and pocket knives to automobiles and cameras. Are these tools simple or merely deceptively simple? How do these tools take control of the inevitable complexity underlying their operation? How do they bridge the complexity gap between the ""user interface"" abstraction and their fundamental operation? What characterizes better tools of each sort from lesser tools?<p>The same applies to software as well. The language we use in describing software and its use is today incredibly crude and barely suitable for the task, which leads to many debates where neither side is capable of fully articulating their meaning and people are left with half-ideas of what either is trying to get at.<p>I don't think Spolsky or DHH are necessarily arguing in opposite directions, I think they are trying to articulate the complex nature of something that is difficult to convey. Elegance is perhaps one aspect of it, but there is no single word that fully describes the concept that either is trying to get across, I think.<p>Edit: Another perfect example: I occasionally use an infrared thermometer in the kichen. It is supremely intuitive to use. It is vaguely gun shaped, fitting easily in the hand. It has a single button, a trigger, and an lcd screen that displays temperatue and units. Pressing the trigger once generates an instantaneous reading which is displayed on the screen for several seconds. Holding down the trigger generates a continuous reading, updating the display perhaps a few times every second or so. Releasing the trigger leaves the last reading displayed as above. When taking a reading a red laser marks the targetted spot. The battery compartment can be opened without tools but is designed such that the act of using it will prevent the compartment from being opened.<p>When you consider the complexity of such a device, how many various pieces have to be put to use (such as optics, sensors, processors and software to analyze the IR spectrum within a narrow beam and determine a temperature to high accuracy, not to mention all the supporting components like the laser pointer, display, body, power system etc.) it gives a greater appreciation for the incredible elegance of the tool.",1295005588

2103208,comment,2102905,2103056,0,0,srgseg,,,"<i>Explain to me how: Map<String, Pair<Integer, Set<String>>> data = new HashMap<String, Pair<Integer, Set<String>>>(); is useful.</i><p>Firstly, in Java 7 or in Java 6 in a modern IDE, you only have to type:<p><pre><code>  Map<String, Pair<Integer, Set<String>>> data = new HashMap<>();
</code></pre>
So let's break this down: if I was using another language, I could just do:<p><pre><code>  var data = {};
</code></pre>
But consider what you've now lost:<p>1. If your code was just a simple associative array, not much. But if you have a complex nested data structure, you need to now put a comment somewhere so you don't forget what you're storing there. You can get into serious problems when multiple programmers are working on the same project if you don't clearly describe your data structures, and so you're not really saving on typing by writing Map<String, Pair<Integer, Set<String>>> because you'd have to document that in a comment instead. Since people are lazy when it comes to commenting code, Java therefore forces a degree of self documentation into data structures.<p>2. I notice that you're storing a Set of Strings (Set<String>). As I'm sure you know, this means you can throw a bunch of strings into the set without worrying about duplicates. In Javascript, this would be messy. Since there is no 'Set' data type in Javascript you'd have to have an associative array where you store the string as the key and 'undefined' as the value.<p>3. HashMap isn't the only kind of map. In Java, you could use a TreeMap so that content is sorted in key order. This saves you code later by not having to take the associative array, converting it into a list, and then sorting the list.<p>4. In addition to TreeMap, another extremely useful kind of map is the ConcurrentHashMap, which allows you to manipulate the Map simultaneously from multiple threads (e.g. multiple simultaneous web request threads) without getting concurrent access problems or having to write your own synchronization code.<p>5. Tons of other really cool data Java datastructures available to you in the Java libs. E.g. WeakHashMap which won't prevent referenced objects from being garbage collected if they are dereferenced elsewhere, and LinkedHashMap which is useful for guaranteeing the order of stored objects even if they are removed and reinserted.<p>So although I agree that var data = {} can be more convenient in simple cases, that's not to say Java's approach has no upside.",1295005247

Here is the full quote:<p>""The simplest approach to redundancy is a ""hot standby"" server that has access the transaction logs of the production machine. If the production server dies for any reason, the hot standby machine can roll forward from the transaction logs and, as soon as it is up to date with the last committed transaction, take the place of the dead server. As a bonus, the hot standby machine can be used for complex queries that don't need to include up-to-the-second changes. For Oracle 11g, look for ""Oracle Data Guard"" to learn more about this approach.""<p>If you think that is FUD take it up with the author.<p>The $20'000 Dell server is (guess what!) a quote from the article:<p>""It is difficult to find realistic benchmarks for the kind of database activity imposed by an Internet application. The TPC-E benchmark is probably the closest among industry standards. TPC-E is a mixture of fairly complex reads (SELECTs) and writes (INSERTs and UPDATEs) into an indexed database that gets larger with the number of SQL statements that are attempted for processing. The ""transactions per second"" figures put out by the TPC include both reads and writes. In 2010, a moderately priced Dell 4-CPU (32 core) server hooked up to, literally, more than 1000 hard disk drives, processed about 2,000 transactions per second into an 8-terabyte database.<p>The authors crowd-sourced the question in this blog posting and for smaller databases that can be stored mostly on solid-state drives, it seems as though a modest $10,000 or $20,000 computer should be capable of 10,000 or more SQL queries and updates per second.""<p>So the argument is that an expensive server is the RDBMS solution for scalability.
