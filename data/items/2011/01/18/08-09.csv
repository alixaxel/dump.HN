Frameworks and SDKs cannot overcome shortcomings of your language and/or language implementation (and often you don't have the luxury to switch gears, because there is only one reference implementation).<p>When I studied Erlang's support for concurrency, I realized how hard it would have been trying to do that in another language.  Yes, you could somewhat manage to replicate that, but:<p>- your language implementation could lack microthreads, thus impacting how concurrency would scale;<p>- you may need to follow some protocol in using the framework, otherwise you could fall into one of many pitfalls, which aren't there in the language you're using as a model.",1295341180

Just because most people are uninterested in making predictions doesn't make them especially hard. Just about everything he's claimed as 'correct' was being researched in some form at the time he made the predictions, and was certainly in science fiction long before that.<p>So considering that, mostly he put dates on a random set of things coming to pass. Then he uses extremely generous criteria to define when something he predicted has occurred and essentially throws out the actual timeframe when doing so. And that was the only bit he really predicted in the first place.<p>Somehow it works on people though. Just go ahead and anoint him your High Priest, save yourself the confusion.",1295340451

It's true that no inventory is lost when a product is downloaded and in some cases no sale as well.  But you'll never convince me (and it's impossible to prove) that every single person who ever downloaded any software wouldn't have purchased it had they not had the option of stealing it.<p>The issue is that software has huge up front costs.  If people were to follow your ""morals"" there would be no reasonable way to recoup those up front costs, since it would just be ok to take what you want.<p>I do tend to think that the fact that the creator continues to get full price long after they've past production costs and made a healthy profit could use some scrutiny (i.e. is there a better way to do this), but software is hardly the only industry where this is the case.",1295338576

It presents a quandary: Facebook's main (only?) source of revenue comes from advertising, but if they make too much too public too soon, they'll lose their entire user base. So, they've been making changes over the last few years that greatly facilitate advertising, while minimizing the rate of increase of user dissatisfaction.<p>It bothers me enormously that users have complacently allowed Facebook to operate in this way. What's more fascinating is the level of innovation we see from a company that employs over 2,000 people: it's not too incredibly impressive. I'm sure most of their work is in maintaining their 60,000 servers, but even still, for the amount of salaried engineers they have, wouldn't we expect something more impressive than a product that has remained relatively unchanged for the last few years?",1295338377
