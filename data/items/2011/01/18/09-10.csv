We've largely given up on Hotmail, but then everyone who uses hotmail seems to be aware that it marks <i>everything</i> as spam and so they check their spam box as often as their inbox, from the looks of it.<p>It's a nice convincing argument. It just hasn't borne out in practice for us. Email is critical to us, and it gets delivered just fine the vast majority of the time. We've had about 2 cases in 3 years where we needed to intervene manually to talk to some kind of ESP to get us unblocked, because they'd randomly decided to blacklist our IP.

They told me a ton of interesting things about how this stuff actually works.<p>Getting high deliverability is actually incredibly complicated. You need a dedicated IP address to send mail from, which you need to be whitelisted by the big ESPs (E-mail Service Providers). To get it whitelisted, you need to ""warm it up"" before you start using it properly. You need to be very careful about setting the right headers. You need reverse DNS configured correctly, you need SPF and DomainKeys set up, you need to make sure the IP/domain you are sending from hasn't previously been used for spam... and even after all that, you probably need to set up a relationship with AOL/Gmail/Yahoo etc to make sure your stuff gets through. You also need to watch for their bounce / rate limit notifications and dial back your sending rates to match.<p>There's a whole lot more to it than just setting up an SMTP server.",1295344390

We mostly spend our energy to produce poop and move physical stuff around pointlessly), it will already have a lot more energy to spend on computation than we do today, and then if it really needs more there's millions of times more energy available just one AU away, easily harvested if it's already figured out how to do so efficiently on Earth.<p>So my point is, there may be a Malthusian limit of sorts, but by the time we reach that, the bottom part of the S curve is so far behind that we can't even remember it anymore.

Further, we're mostly <i>worried</i> about the prospect of AI, rather than naively hopeful for some geek rapture, because self-improving AI is likely to turn out quite badly for us unless we're exceptionally careful.<p>""Faith"" only enters into this when deciding whether you believe the probability that we can build self-improving AI any time soon is significant or not, and I'd argue that it's not so much faith as slightly-educated guessing (predicting the probability of a tech breakthrough is an extremely difficult thing to do, so sure, there are high margins of uncertainty).  You may disagree as to whether that probability is 1% over the next 20 years or 1% over the next 100, but we're hardly talking about the odds of virgin-birth here, so I find it completely unfair to call the whole idea ""religious""...frankly, either of those probabilities is, IMO, worth worrying about, given the stakes.  And you're flat out delusional if you don't admit a 1% chance of strong AI within 100 years.<p>I was going to more specifically tackle the other claims in this post, but ultimately, it's not worth it.  When it comes down to it, Szabo assumes that the main thing that would make strong AI ""easy"" (or at least relatively easy), the existence of a general algorithm for reasoning, doesn't exist.  If you take that as gospel, then sure, it's going to be pretty difficult to construct AI.  I can even see why he'd think that, having used genetic programming and other ML techniques and finding little success (IMO we haven't pushed the genetic programming paradigm anywhere <i>near</i> far enough, but that's a story for another day).<p>Plenty of people see things differently, and think that a general purpose intelligence algorithm is within our grasp; I'd argue that there's some loose evidence that human cognition largely owes itself to exactly such an algorithm, though in our case it's probably a bit more complex than we'll be able to come up with from scratch.",1295343167
