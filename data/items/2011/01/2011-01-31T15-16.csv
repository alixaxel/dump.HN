2161877,comment,2160887,2161450,0,0,acconrad,,,"In truth it shouldn't be news, because it is simply one man's (one user's) opinion. The reality is that Scoble is a tour de force of the tech world: the man has a power with his words to change the course of how startups can gain (or lose) fame/funding/etc. In the case of Quora, they have the accolades to withstand the storm a bit better than most startups.<p>I think the message here is that even a prominent tech figure can be quelled if he breaks the rules. I think an underlying message here is that the power of the people still rules supreme - what this community can take away from this exchange in Scoble v Quora is that the power of the people still win, so if you can build a compelling piece of software that appeases your customers, even if the critics don't like your product, you can basically give them the finger and tell them ""xx customers couldn't disagree more!""<p>Remember that he may be a juggernaut, but the bigger they are the harder they fall, and to not let one man's negative comments on what you work on deter you from your course.",1296489561

The conference call gave a hint, Apple is spending $3B to prepay for supply of some new components.  Which Android manufacturer can do that?  Samsung probably has the best chance since they source a lot of components themselves (heck, they build some for Apple).<p>The current Android tablets are not significantly cheaper than the iPad (especially considering the smaller screens).  Apple with the iPod started at a high rate and kept moving the price point down to make life very difficult for competitors.  If Apple keeps the current iPad and makes it the new entry model at a lower price point (much like the iPhone), then the problems for other manufactures will be increased.<p>At this point, I really think HP will surprise a lot of people, but I don't seen the Android tablets (or Blackberry with its bizarre connectivity requirements) being major competitors until they resolve their pricing issues.",1296489545

Troll economics, anyone?<p>People also overestimate the degree to which the US is capitalistic. Government spending in the US is now around 40%, with the free-market days of the pre-WWII era long replaced by a heavy-handed state that has never shrunk meaningfully. Maybe we Scandinavians run our bloated government bureaucracies more efficiently in our comparatively small, historically homogenous societies, but they're certainly not the reason we're rich. We're rich because we've been relatively free and capitalistic for a long time, also historically enjoying relatively low political corruption and a strong rule of law. At least that's the picture as I see it, being an Icelander that has lived and worked in Denmark I feel I grok the way these relatively small communities of my kinsmen work on a gut level.<p>One more thing: New Hampshire is one of the richest states in the USA, has about the same population as Norway and has a higher GDP per capita. If we're going to compare the US to Norway (one of the richest European countries) while excluding other much poorer countries from the equation, we should also compare New Hampshire to Europe to put things in proper perspective.",1296487763

Because unfortunately (in my opinion) news has become as much about whos delivering the information as what's being said.  And I use the word ""said"" because many times whats written or spoken isn't even what I'd call reporting.  Take Wikileaks for example ... much of the main stream media reporting on Wikileaks has placed as much prominence (or more) on Julian Assange as they have on the trove of information thats been exposed.  Cable-""news"" has built brands around their personalities that pass off editorializing as reporting.  This has resulted in viewer loyalty to the point where many of their viewers threaten to go elsewhere if their favorite newsreader isn't retained.  This ""story"" has all the ingredients to fit into that model ... two prominent internet personalities (Arrington & Scoble) without enough followers, fans and haters to ensure that there'll be people on either side to fuel the fire using their platforms to promote their opinions about stuff.<p>Is it news?

Unlike e.g. Dell which only makes money on huge amounts of shipments due to low margins, Apple can ship comparatively few units and make large profits.<p>They must know that their dominance in the smartphone area was always a temporary thing - they were never going to persuade the entire world to buy one of two iPhone models available at any time. Their lack of any attempt to create an entire iPhone ecosystem to cater for the spread of users (i.e. the ""free, just about adequate phone"" that dominates most peoples choice) shows this. This is entirely separate to their iPod strategy, which scales from those with only a handful of dollars (the shuffle), all the way up to the ""Smartphone without a radio"" iPod Touch. In the phone space, they seem to have chosen the same battle as their computing space - the high end, high margin, ""people willing to pay for the experience"" market share which contains vast profits. If no serious competitor had appeared (as, bizarrely, happened in the MP3 space), then they might have eventually released an iPhone Nano etc. But given that other players are now in that space, they've just surrendered it, rather than fight a battle they can't win. Were they to open up iOS or release a spate of iPhones covering enough of the usage/price spectrum to compete, they'd lose a large amount of the Apple ""experience"", damage their premium brand, and risk losing the entire game.<p>Their battle is to maintain enough market share to ensure development for iOS, and to ensure that Android devices end up being (mostly) the choice for mass market, race to the bottom, cheap at any cost devices. If Android starts to seriously infringe on their premium space, then they should be worried and can be considered to be losing.

But given the typical bill likely be $70/month+ for 2 years, $100 difference on ~$2000 total is likely not a huge difference. If anything, I would argue that US consumers are largely basing their decision on carrier first, then handset.<p>What would be an interesting and insightful stat is to see what AT&T's handset breakdown is because you can expect that Verizon will follow a similar trend.<p>> ...  it also has a major downside. It means that users have only a limited choice of handsets<p>For most consumers, lack of often confusing and sometimes meaningless decisions (eg what is the practical difference, for the user, between an Evo and a DroidX?) is a plus not a minus.<p>Price matters in developing countries, sure. But the iPhone is a premium product. No news there.<p>As for pricing outside the US, let me give an example from Australia. I bought an iPHone 4 ~2 weeks after launch on Telstra, the nation's largest (and best) carrier.<p>For the 32GB model I paid $299 upfront and then $49/month for 2 years, totalling $1500 over 2 years. The retail price of the handset is $1000 so for $500 I get 2 years of service.<p>What does that $49/month buy? 2GB of data and $400 of ""credit"". Basically unlimited SMS, that credit can be used for data overages (at a pretty exorbitant rate mind you) and of course calls (at about 60c/minute).<p>Also, in Australia, like pretty much all of the developed world outside North America, you only pay for MAKING phone calls and SENDING text messages. You pay nothing for receiving either.<p>But the economics mean that my phone service, after you factor out the handset, only costs me ~$20/month. The HTC Desire, a similar handset, is priced at about exactly the same.<p>> The rise of Android in the smartphone sector nullifies Cook's arguments against Android in the tablet world because precisely the same dynamics are at play<p>Uh... no they don't and no they aren't. For one, many if not most iPad users use the iPad on wifi only, typically only at home. I would also argue that many who own 3G models (like myself) don't even have a 3G service attached to the device. What's the point? The nearest Starbuck's with it's free wifi is never far away.<p>The entry point for the iPad is $500. The competition seems to start at $700 (Xoom) with everything thrown in. Thing is, not everyone wants that extra stuff.<p>And let's not forget--and this is important--that Apple's competitors are always chasing <i>last year's model</i>. Comparing these new releases to the iPad are pretty meaningless since the iPad is about to be replaced and those products (excluding the Samsung Galaxy Tab) <i>aren't even shipping yet</i>.<p>Lastly, Samsung claims to have sold >2 million Tabs. I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out where and to whom because I've yet to see one in the wild. Korea? I'd love to know how many they've sold by country and also a qualification saying they mean sold and not just shipped.",1296486236
