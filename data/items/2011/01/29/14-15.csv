Do they just forgo it since their young and it's unlikely they will need it or are there affordable plans you can get when you don't have insurance through your employer?  I've looked around the Internet but can only find vague information on the topic.<p>For example this <a href=""http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/2009IndividualMarketSurveyFinalReport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ahipresearch.org/pdfs/2009IndividualMarketSurveyF...</a> document seems to indicate that someone in their late 20's would pay just under $2,000 on ""average"" but the numbers seem to range wildly with location and some family plans going as high as 13k per year which seems ridiculous.<p>Edit: This thread though it contains helpful responses confirms my suspicion that getting non employer health coverage is a complete CF.",1296313189

It gives people the chance to look through the code for vulnerabilities and it allows competitors to look at any techniques they're using.  But the worst part is that they're a computer security company that couldn't keep their source code secure.  Clearly, accidents happen even when one has the best policies and such in place.  Sometimes it's merely chance as opposed to an indicator of something in a statistically valid way.  However, it's still embarrassing.  I don't find that there's a lot of testing of the efficacy of anti-virus software out there and so purchases are partially made on faith (would love to know if I'm wrong here since I'd be interested in the results).  Anyway, as a purchase made partially on instinct, this makes purchasers feel less happy in their gut (so to speak).",1296312674

I didn't intend it to be taken as representative of my understanding. However, from your exposition, it seems fitting.<p>I'm firmly against all examples of zero tolerance. From your example, I think 500 disturbances of peace and destructions of property is far worse than one realization of a work hazard. I would draw the line at perhaps 10. There used to be a principle that it is better to let 10 guilty men walk than convict a single innocent - do you not subscribe to this either?<p>I'll clarify what I meant with the juxtaposition of encryption and forceful resistance:\nencryption is a justification for occupied searches, since you need to confiscate the electronics while they are unlocked. I don't know if that's actually done, though, since it's my understanding that the electronics are routinely removed from the premises and disconnected in the process. This scenario does not warrant the use of any force.<p>Armed defense is a justification for surprise arrests, since you need to arrest the suspect when they're not in defensive positions. A good time to do this is during ingress or egress. This situation does not warrant the use of devastating force.<p>The only reason to assault a dwelling with shock tactics would be to capture armed resistance in the act of handling evidence. Perhaps that's an actual worry for the FBI, who seem to assume all of their suspects are paramilitary, but I don't think it's a reasonable worry in the majority of cases, even the ones handled by the FBI.<p>I hope you now understand better where we disagree.",1296312315

Now that I have an startup, I would like to know if it is ok for me to use a Community Edition of a database (or other software/libraries), for a project which is not open source (a project for a client, for instance). The most common case would be MySQL, but I'm also looking at databases like VoltDB, MariaDB, Drizzle. I don't know what do licenses such as GPL3 allow and forbid me to do. Perhaps I don't have to worry as long as I don't modify the database source code, and if I do so I must provide source code of my modifications?",1296310044

2155413,comment,2153681,2155271,0,0,roel_v,,,"""The police are also <i>usually</i> not treated like an invading army""<p>(emphasis mine)<p>This shows you don't understand the point (I'm not so much talking about this specific case or even raids on computer criminals anymore, rather in general). The exact point is that <i>sometimes</i> it does happen, but you don't know why. That's why you need to treat <i>every</i> opportunity, no matter how minute, as more dangerous than it actually is, or than you actually think it will be, because the consequences are so out of balance.<p>Let me put it this way: do you feel that 500 unnecessarily forceful raids, each destroying a door and 2 pieces of furniture, and taking a night of sleep away from 500 individuals, are better or worse than 1 policy officer shot in the leg (not even deadly)?<p>I think the shot wound is worse, and therefore wouldn't mind authorizing a raid even when I'm not 100% sure there is acute danger. Actually I'd authorize when there's even just a 1% chance of forceful resistance with a knife.<p>(the trade off may get different when suspects are harmed in the raid, I'm assuming sufficiently trained police people)<p>""and weighing the probability of encryption against the probability of forceful self-defense,""<p>This I don't understand. I'm quite sure no suspect will try to fire at policeman with their Truecrypt USB drive.<p>""If for some reason there's reason to believe that the person is working next to both a loaded gun and an encrypted disk""<p>The 'and' between 'loaded gun' and 'an encrypted disk' should be an 'or'. Just one of the two is enough to warrant force.<p>Assuming that, well that's already the trade off being made. I just think you underestimate the amount of criminals using encryption. Even if only 5% of them do use it, that already makes it likely enough that any random one (because remember, before you enter you don't know what you will find) will use it to warrant force.

I just can't come up with any situation where I'd actually use it to write code.<p>Try pulling up a source file.  Any file, any language.  Type in the name of one of your objects, then a period, then hit CTRL+SPACE.  What comes up?  A list of strings that contain your object name, picked by matching text from the source.<p>Really?  In 2011???  Why are people still using text editors that autocomplete based on text?  Why are people still getting <i>excited</i> about them?<p>Editors have been background compiling and autocompleting based on context for over 10 years now.  If you write code for a living, you should be using one.  It will make your life easier by an order of magnitude.<p>I think we've moved past the point where we need to treat code as if it were simply text.
