THEY WILL TRY TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT SURRENDERING TO ANY OF YOUR COUNTER REQUESTS IS A VALUABLE CONCESSION. IT IS NOT. THEY HAVE SET THE OFFER FAR TOO LOW FOR THAT SPECIFIC REASON !!! DON'T FUCKING BUY IT !!!<p>Guys, you have to learn to play bitches: i) be very patient (time is on your side, you are profitable), ii) talk to other interested parties (i.e. confront the offers to raise the price, and yes I mean multiple rounds; one shark smell blood? get more sharks in the pond! now is the right time!!), iii) don't show you cards, reveal your intentions or commit now, because you are in the process of finding what your intentions are and it depends of theirs too, iv) set YOUR own rules ON THEM whenever necessary (have no hard feelings about it, because they don't have any for you by making a low offer; from your own description, they are not being nice to you), v) never ever buy into whining and strong or manipulative emotions from other parties, they know how to play bitches like you don't (and sometimes, bitches fake friendship, caring and honesty very well; they send the nicest guy/lady, the one that has the highest chance to win your sympathy; it is nothing more than fucking smoke to get a better deal than they actually deserve; YOU did the hard work).<p>If you don't feel comfortable enough, find an independent professional negotiator with strong AND proven experience who can do that job for you. Discuss the limits within which you are ready to sell and list what you consider acceptable and unacceptable terms. Be honest and candid about it, no early concessions. Then, (re)open discussions starting with the double (at least).<p>Reward the negotiator with a percentage of the deal. Pay him well, because he/she will obtain a value that you will never ever be able to obtain yourself considering your experience in negotiations.<p>The hardest thing to understand (or to remember) is that 'no deal' is better than a 'bad deal' in your case. You must be ready to consider that option as the best option, especially if there is no zone of possible agreement between you and the other parties. Negotiating IS PRECISELY about finding out if there is such a zone.<p>And don't listen to those saying you should turn the offer down because 20% 'is an insult'. They are ignorant morons of no value (really). Now is SURELY NOT the time to quit discussions.<p>You are in the power position, but you don't act like you know it, or that you know how to play it.

2154400,comment,2154106,2154106,0,0,LorenFykes,,,"I agree with the first comment here. You should never be afraid of consulting your lawyer or bankers/financial consultants. It sounds like they want to keep you in the dark if it really is as you describe. Also, if you are already profitable, then your need is probably more growth and market-oriented rather than selling, and you'd be better finding a partner who wants to help you guys grow rather than take away from you what you've built and giving you paper for it in return. In other words, helping you to build the value of your OWN equity/paper than theirs, which essentially you'd be doing if you sold and received more paper than cash. You built this business presumably because you wanted to work for yourselves and not the ""man"", so consult with lawyers and trusted others on how to get investment to grow and hang on to what's yours, and if they're that surprised you haven't had more offers, there are likely other partners that ""feel"" right. You don't have to put out for the first date that comes along.",1296267411

There is a lot of talk about American semiconductor companies' losing ground to Japanese. How will you keep the edge?<p>JOBS: Japan's very interesting. Some people think it copies things. I don't think that anymore. I think what they do is reinvent things. They will get something that's already been invented and study it until they thoroughly understand it. In some cases, they understand it better than the original inventor. Out of that understanding, they will reinvent it in a more refined second-generation version. That strategy works only when what they're working with isn't changing very much—the stereo industry and the automobile industry are two examples. When the target is moving quickly, they find it very difficult, because that reinvention cycle takes a few years.\nAs long as the definition of what a personal computer is keeps changing at the rate that it is, they will have a very hard time.",1296267376

It seems that you must manually configure twitch when a new application is added (although I'm not certain if it defaults to something for new apps...); whereas Quicksilver automatically indexes your applications.\n2.  You add key bindings, but lose the additional functionality that Quicksilver offers in its plugin system (sending mail, opening a web page, etc.).\n3.  Quicksilver is free.<p>All of these things considered, you have one major advantage - Quicksilver is not in the app store (and I don't see it getting there).
