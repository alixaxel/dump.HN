I'm on my third provider and same number, and I don't believe I was ever charged to port. If you're switching providers anyway, they're happy to get you and they'll port free.<p>The author's specific scenario (abroad, US number) may be worth it for the author.

In addition to project awards (which are significant as you say) there are individual bonuses and stock refreshers for top contributors that can also be 'significant'. Sorry for the vague terms. Further, getting promoted to the upper levels can be rewarding as well.<p>But you are competing against 'top-notch' (to quote op of this thread) engineers for those types of awards.

Very impersonal with very rigid process, and, at least initially, focused on the wrong sorts of things looking to try to find ""easy outs"" to filter folks. They weren't looking for why I'd be great for them, only for how I might be imperfect. That said, I gave them the same treatment in return. In return, from my perspecitve, I think, ""Twenty thousand employees and what that entails. Arrogant attitude. Big emphasis on code performance optimization rather than innovation or entrepreneurship. High share price, post-IPO, lots of FUIFV folks already. Low job title. Uninspiring pay rate. Don't care about their cafeteria. Don't <i>want</i> to live a Google-oriented life."" Therefore... no. Those were my own easy outs.

All these comments make valid points, but as a person who has learnt Java as his first language feel that it opened me up to learning other languages quicker because of that fact that I found languages like Python much simpler, whilst I find many 1st-language Python students to be much more defensive and 'clingy' to Python because of its simplicity and directness.<p>While Python may be an easier language, I find that it is more difficult to debug than Java at times due to incompatible spacing alone, but that's beside the point.<p>I think that students should be able to decide their first language. I was 'stuck' with Java, but I don't regret it at all. In fact, after having transferred to another university with students having started with Python, I find that I'm ahead in terms of concepts dealing with OOP. I know that Python can do this as well, but Java (for better or for worse) shoves it down your throat.<p>So can't we all just get along? :)",1296014084

2142034,comment,2140354,2141871,0,0,strlen,,,"> So if Google and Facebook are the sexy places to work, and can offer programmers less<p>They can, but they do not. The average salary may be lower as they hire more engineers out of college, but if you're an experienced engineer and have other offers, you'll get a good deal. There is, however, another other angle: they want 99 percentile talent, but are in the 75th percentile compensation wise. So a $130,000 ($100k + 30% bonus) at Google could easily be $150,000 elsewhere. However, this market value may not be realized until the said person has been at a 'brand name' company i.e., some will leave because having been at Google has made them much more valuable in the eyes of employers.<p>> Oracle? Something else?<p>Oracle pays worse, actually. Unlike Google and other companies, they also have strict rules about salaries for people with X years of experience: many excellent engineers left Oracle (and yes, Oracle can attract excellent engineers -- mostly to their database and middleware divisions) because they were told by their managers they wouldn't be able to receive any recognition for their work until they have spent N years at the company.",1296013512

Some of the achievements require the Medic to either become an offensive player, or intentionally make bad choices. The more players tried for achievements, the worse your team did. For future achievements releases, Valve changed the focus of achievements to reward class strengths, showcase new features, reward good behavior, or highlight awesome events.<p>A Visual Studio achievement like ""Job Security"" would be terrible. It just encourages bad practices. I don't want to fix a bug in a 30-line Linq query, or understand if it does exactly what you say it does. In fact, its opposite is a better achievement: ""If You Linq, You Will Miss It: Write 100 Linq queries with 3 lines or fewer.""
