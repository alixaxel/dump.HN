More than half of the total\nvotes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same\neither way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214 votes\nto rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual votes at\n<a href=""https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-jenkins-vote"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-jenkins-vote</a>.<p>So what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We've registered\njenkins-ci.org, though it's empty at the moment. In the coming days, we will\nbe renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-<i>@googlegroups.com,\nrenaming the Twitter account from @hudsonci to @jenkinsci, and renaming our\norganization at Github from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure\neveryone had notice ahead of time that this was happening, so that no one\ngets surprised by changes to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the\ninitial, interim governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and\nOracle are willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue\nin that role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The\ninterim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance\nprocess going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes (including\nthings like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in public, on these\nlists. We're working to get the JIRA and wiki contents migrated over to the\nJenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get that done in the next\ncouple days.<p>Putting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting, and\nespecially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the Jenkins\nproject and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle's project, nor CloudBee's\nproject, nor my project, nor Kohsuke's project - it's the community's\nproject, and it's going to thrive.

They were people who had a startup, or were contemplating doing one. Generally, they were smart, ambitious and technically astute.<p>Over time, those traits regress to the mean, as people come upon the site based on more and more random hearsay, wade in and contribute. If they are marginally less smart or astute, they still aren't bad actors; but the group's average declines, and asymptotically approaches the population mean.<p>And this more diverse population isn't as homogeneous.
