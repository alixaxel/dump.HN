I followed your links, and what I found is this: A media corporation refuses to disclose a report on an internal investigation on how it conducts its affairs. Yes, it bothers me that a public service body is stonewalling about an internal report. But when I transfer the setup to US say, it is not what I would call, unheard of.<p>I am certainly willing to concede, that it is not transparent, but isnt calling them to possess a ""well-known"" anti-Israel bias exaggerated ?",1296377683

2157709,comment,2157157,2157409,0,0,saurik,,,"This comment is totally unrelated and is itself a strawman. Yes, it is easier to use GitHub: I will not argue that fact. However, using GitHub will cause people to be pulling from GitHub, and GitHub may go down. This is a tradeoff, and is one people use a lot: you use a shared platform and give up control of the URL to get easier outsourced hosting. But to argue that git's decentralization solves that problem is disingenuous: it means that people could theoretically still pull your repository, but only after finding out what that fallback URL is and manually resetting their origin, which 90% of git users don't even know how to do. Meanwhile, many people are willing to spend the five minutes it takes to learn how to run their own server and want to avoid this tradeoff by hosting their own stuff on their own hostnames so they can publish stable URLs, but /can't/, because they like GitHub's social features, none of which (due to the aforementioned distributed features, humorously) actually require GitHub to be the canonical repository URL: if you want to use GitHub, you are going to have people cloning and pulling your GitHub mirror (or even worse: adding your GitHub mirror as a submodule) and when it goes down they are going to get errors, and you will have no control over it. That sucks.",1296377328

2157707,comment,2155654,2157593,0,0,nitrogen,,,"I wonder if you're confusing reality with Rand novels.  As far as I'm aware (since I'm not one of them), most wealthy people aren't trying to impress anybody.  They're just enjoying their lives, relatively quietly.  The incentive provided by wealth is not status, but enjoyment.  A BMW is much more enjoyable to drive than a Buick.  Go ahead and pry all the logos off my car, it'll still be more fun to drive.<p>What's more, ""status"" is only a proxy for wealth and power.  Status is only as useful as the additional influence it brings.  Consider it from an evolutionary biology perspective: higher status means higher capability to support mates and offspring.  If you take away the additional wealth that brings higher status, then the higher status is lost as well, as it doesn't actually signal a higher capability to provide.",1296377267
