I think the ecosystem created around large government contracts is pretty significant, and that it would cease to exist without government spending, which naturally would decrease economic output in that a lot of people would be unemployed, a lot of businesses whose customers are the employees of these businesses would shut down, etc etc.  It is most obvious in the case of military spending related to manufacturing, but just think about it for medicaid as well.<p>I think you're off your rocker with this one.",1296374196

Ok, may we proceed?<p>The original point is this: ""There's a potentially dangerous line that the US is approaching where... a majority of the population will not be paying income taxes at all.""  That statement contains two contentions: 1) the US is approaching the line where 50% of the population will be paying no income tax at all, 2) this is potentially dangerous.<p>The first contention hasn’t been disputed.  The second is what I believe we are debating.<p>You interject that the whole discussion (""the income tax debate"") is ""misleading""/""disingenuous"" because it doesn’t consider payroll taxes - something that ""lower middle-class people"" pay a disproportionate amount of (relative to their income) compared to ""wealthy people.'<p>I attempted to point out that payroll tax isn’t really relevant to the question because everyone pays the same rate up until the point that the tax is capped, which is commensurate with the point at which the benefits are capped.<p>I will give you that $100,000 per year isn’t all that ""wealthy.""  And I'll give you the following:  A person making $500,000 will pay 2.77% of wages in payroll tax (6.2% of the first $106,800, plus 1.45% of total wages).  A person making $200,000 will pay 4.76% (same rules).  People making $20,000 and $100,000, will both pay 7.65% (same rules).<p>If I am wrong that the employee pays half of the payroll tax (7.65%) and the employer pays the other half (another 7.65%) please let me know.  However, I don’t feel it is relevant to the central question under debate.<p>I don’t feel your point about payroll taxes is significant enough to dismiss the question about income taxes.  Is the 50% threshold ""potentially dangerous"" or not?",1296372033

However, it should be equally obvious that some is; surely the anti-Semites that do exist will criticize Israel.  So the question is how to distinguish the legitimate criticism from the anti-Semitic criticism.  I don't have an answer to this question, unfortunately.  One (flawed) test that's often proposed is to see whether the criticism is proportional to Israel's wrongdoings as compared to the wrongdoings of other countries.<p>In any case, while I agree with what you're saying, quite often people say pretty much the same thing as a sort of misdirection to deflect criticism of their own criticism of Israel, no matter how unfair or misleading or just plain dishonest it is.

2157593,comment,2155654,2157283,0,0,alsomike,,,"Actually, I think status markers created by the government would be far, far more appealing to the wealthy. It's like Hegel's master-slave dialectic - a master doesn't feel like a real master because he knows all the struggles and difficulties of maintaining his position. If he really is a master, not just an ordinary man who finds himself with power, why does he have to work so hard to maintain it? The only time he really sees himself as a master is when he catches a glimpse of himself as his slave sees him, and paradoxically, this makes him dependent on the slave's recognition of him. The master is desperate to impress him and provoke envy. That's why in all Ayn Rand novels, the protagonist's problem isn't just the fact that the masses interfere with his projects and thwart his greatness - the problem is that they do this because they don't recognize him as superior. That's what really burns. The whole purpose of going Galt is to force society to recognize them.<p>If the rich are so desperate for our approval, why not give it to them? They don't need to play stupid and wasteful status games to seduce us into admiring them, they can compete with each other, we'll add up the score, everyone gets ranked and that will be the end of it. OK, maybe there will be an awards ceremony on TV every year.<p>The main obstacle to this system is that most of the rich wouldn't go for it because they'd never admit that they crave recognition from people they consider inferior.",1296371315
