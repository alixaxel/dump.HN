So yes, Kuhn's ideas represent an idealized view of what science (perhaps) should be, and as such are interesting to the same small group of people as find Plato's notion of shadows on the cave to be interesting.

So you've got a single-lane highway, packed with cars going 200mph? Accidents will be exceedingly rare? No matter how rare that accidents end up being, they will be national (if not international) news stories just due to the amount of cars/injuries/deaths involved. How many people are willing to hop right back onto a theme-park roller coaster right after one of the cars flew off and killed everyone riding in it? Terrorist attacks on the level of 9/11 are exceedingly rare, but that doesn't stop all kinds of silliness from spawning from it.<p><pre><code>  > Future cars will be much more efficient, and will be electric so

This is like the assumption that there is no need to spend all kinds of time worrying about alternative fuel sources, because as the price of oil goes up people will just auto-magically develop new and more efficient fuel sources. It's a law of nature, don't-ya-know! Housing prices will <i>always</i> keep rising. The economy will <i>always</i> keep growing. Trends are always positive, never negative.

SDC's, along with robotics, will eliminate the need to drive to the grocery store, or any store at all. And telecommunications surely will be pushing back against the need for central offices.<p>My hope is that SDCs will allow us to form more human-scale communities outside of the city, where we can live largely on foot, with local necessities (restaurants, bars, parks) within walking distance.  All the crap that clogs up our cities and forces us to drive (stores, mostly) will be distributed to a network of warehouses that we will never visit.<p>We may take cabs more often from place to place, but I think overall SDCs could help us drive less.<p>It's all wild speculation at this point, but I think it's very interesting to see what will happen.",1294114960
