2141773,comment,2139000,2139000,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I know very little about trading but even I can see a whole bunch of red flags here. Firstly, if it has just made it to the news then its probably a decade too late to take advantage of. Recently there was a news article about how firms have software that reads and operates based on news events. Except that this recent 'news' article was about something that had already been happening for years. Secondly, twitter contains a subset of information in the market. No surprise that there will be some correlation.<p>Then: predicting up or down movement of a stock is very vague. At what time scale, what sort of trades are required and what sort of response times to execute. What are its drawdowns like, does it account for taxes, commission fees etc. Next, use of a complex nonlinear learning model with lots of parameters - raises alarm bells - these tend to be very susceptible to noise, trading data is highly correlated and typical regularization methods often do not suffice. Then there is the whole issue of over-fitting in general, data used to train on (size, survivor bias, accounting for splits and what not) which makes the whole thing very hand wavy. Without additional info as basic as rate of return, the stated 83% accuracy is meaningless.  Like with all things, its easy to get results that work within the limited and safe confines of academic testing but actually shipping a working product is another story.<p>There has always been a draw to beating the stock market. And these days there is nothing more romantic than doing so using Artificial Intelligence! But I think the most important part of any trading strategy is to be made up of parts that are constantly being swapped out and replaced based on research. you can't just throw a machine learning algorithm at it and think job done. The thing will likely only profit for a couple microseconds. however, as an aside, I would not be surprised if one of [anti]spam/virus/botnets or HFT wars will one day produce AI.",1296006994

My name is Josh, and I'm the CEO of Omedix.  Our company's mission is essentially to deliver Web 2.0 to mainstream healthcare.<p>I am a geek, as are many of my coworkers.  We're based in Scottsdale, AZ which has a decent concentration of technical talent, but nothing close to Silicon Valley or Seattle.  We're looking for engineers who are exceptionally talented and shine particularly well at architecture.  That is, the engineer should be able to take a problem presented by a non-technical person, and translate it into a well-defined and simplified problem that can be solved with a deceptively simple elegant architecture.<p>""Architecture"" is just one skill we're looking for, but it seems to be a proxy for most of the other skills we care about.  We've posted on Craigslist and tried networking around the city.  We're about to try posting on LinkedIn.  Posting on Monster.com was pointless.  A friend of mine who's also recruiting tried posting on Dice.com, but again to no avail.<p>So here's my question to the Hacker community.  The readers and contributors of this community are pretty much the kind of people we're looking for -- passionate about technology, smart, entrepreneurial, excited about the possibility of making a difference, motivated by the belief that you can do it better than most of the others out there.  So the community is actually a perfect audience for this question, and I believe all of us would benefit from hearing the responses:<p>What is the best way for early-stage companies to recruit great software engineers?<p>For further feedback, you can see the current job posting in question at:\nhttp://www.omedix.com/careers/software-engineer/<p>I appreciate your responses, and nice to meet everyone!<p>Josh",1296006749

One of the points that Seth Godin makes—that I didn't have space to go into in that short writeup—is that it's a good habit to determine what would make you quit something before you even start, this way you never quit because the short term pain is too great. This also helps prevent you from getting blinded by pride and sticking with something too long (He uses the example of Nixon and the Vietnam war in the book).<p>I think the book does look at it in a objectified way, and in the signature Seth Godin way that is both simple and deep for his fans, and too obvious to his critics.<p>Note that The Dip is actually a super short book, maybe 75-80 pages. \nTo veer off topic a bit I think this in itself is interesting, and a trend I'd like to see more of. Not just because people are busier than ever, but because publishers push writers to ""fill out"" so many business books when the core point could be made in less than 100 pages.

But it pains me as he describes system after thoroughly redundant system adding to the costs of these reactors.<p>I'm much more familiar with PWRs (Pressurized Water Reactors) which yes, are a bit smaller and less efficient, but the plans and schematics are like a first time run through of a problem.  Nothing re-factored, nothing elegant, just plain and simple brute force design to make it work.<p>There's no reason for four diesel generators when two would do.  There's no reason for multiple chemical volume and control systems.  There's no reason for 6 foot thick, steel re-barred concrete containment in a negative void coefficient reactor!<p>My take-away from working in the industry is regulation severely impedes innovation.  I fear that our greatest discovery since fire is languishing.  Nuclear energy will be used to great extent in the future, but I can't stand the current delays.  Energy is conceivably too cheap to meter in it's current form.  You could conceivably pay, not by your kilowatt-hour, but a fixed monthly subscription to unlimited energy.  Just think about what you could do with that!<p>Edit: -- Misread the article.  PWR's are less efficient than AGRs",1296004639
