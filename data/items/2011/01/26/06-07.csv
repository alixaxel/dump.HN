This is crucial for many online algorithms.  For example, imagine that you're FaceBook and you're trying to display a News Feed of a <i>massive</i> number of events coming in from a large number of apps.  You don't have the computational power to handle all of them, and so you need to drop some of them on the floor.  How do you fairly drop events and display only a random sampling of them?",1296025163

It's easy to prototype a feature, which is basically what a startup is.  It's much harder to predict that feature's impact on all the <i>other</i> features in the system.  Oftentimes those same new innovations have already been tried and rejected by the big companies because they result in unacceptable quality losses elsewhere.<p>Occasionally, the startup is <i>right</i>, and consumers care more about the innovations that they introduce than the features that conflict with them.  In that case, the startup displaces the big company and doesn't remain a startup for long.  But more often, as the startup grows, they run into the same issues that led the big company to reject the innovation in the first place.  At that point, they hit a brick wall in their growth, and they either have to become lame like the big company or forego the users that need those conflicting features.",1296024408

And overestimating what can be covered in a single period in a room full of 12-14 year old kids, no matter what language is used.<p>Part of why the class takes so long to cover a HelloWorld program is that I explain each item, provide counter-examples (wrong class name, wrong signatures for main(), multiple main()s, adding other classes and methods to the file, etc. And seeing the error messages that come with different and interpreting them. We're not just copying a canned program off the board into a text editor (even at that, how good a transcriptionist do you think a 13 year old is? They can find _amazing_ new errors in 10 PRINT ""HELLO"".)<p>And yeah, there's still a lot of black magic. But I contain it, identify it, and cut away at it through the course of the class. Coming back repeatedly to the same subjects as I do so turns out to be a pretty effective way of fixing concepts in students' minds.<p>I appreciate that you might do it differently. Python was among the languages I considered for the class, I've blogged my reasons for going to Java. I revisit my choice of language after each school year. Each year so far, I've come back to Java as best serving the purposes of my classes from among the choices I have, warts and all it does the job.<p>I do expose the students to python, we go out to python.org and spend time on the online interpreter. We also try out ruby and C using online versions.<p>The sorts of expansions on the basic lesson that you describe are things that I already do. It just doesn't happen in the same class period as the HelloWorld program. There isn't time, and even if I did add more to one period, it then wouldn't stick, at least not in the class format I've got to use.<p>I also think you have some misapprehensions about how much material you can throw at a classroom full of kids using balky old computers. No matter what language I use, there's a limit to what you can reasonably expect to cover while still providing time for students to go through the mechanical parts of the exercise (typing and running the program, interpreting the results).<p>So far I haven't found Java to be an obstacle in that regard. And Java allows me to do what I want in class.<p>You also want to know why I use the tools I do in class. That's a whole different discussion. But the short answer is that we use the tools we already know, to keep the number of new things to a minimum at any one time. We'll be introducing an IDE later (Greenfoot.) I'll be using its facilities to teach object oriented concepts more fully than I can with text, as well. Plus, once we've gotten used to using it as an IDE, we'll be rolling in the elements of the Greenfoot framework. That will give us graphics and sound, which we'll use to get immediate feedback on the operation of our code.<p>I discuss my use of the command line when introducing programming in another of my posts. The purpose of the class is to know the system as well as they can from as many angles as they can, among them programming. This isn't a programming class, it's a general computers class that I've decided to expand beyond ""keyboarding"" and MS Office boredom.",1296024283

A 12px font should have each glyph fit within the same 12×12px square. Exactly where the characters are drawn in that square, and at what relative size, is up to the designer - but usually they're drawn so that the em covers the distance from the bottom of lower-case descenders (j, p, q, y) to the top of ascenders (b, d, k, l).<p>Historically, in the days when a ""font"" meant ""a set of metal blocks of uniform size with a glyph engraved on the end of each one"", the ""font size"" was the height of each block of metal, which was an important thing to know when all the metal blocks used to set a page of type had to physically sit next to each other.",1296022966

2142373,comment,2141562,2142211,0,0,callahad,,,"I illustrated the post with Python since it's my language of choice, but honestly, many of Python's benefits as a teaching language apply equally well to other modern languages.<p>If we can agree that experimentation is one of the most powerful ways to develop an understanding of a system, then by going with Java, you're consciously eschewing languages which support that goal by being:<p>1. Interpreted. It's hard to overstate the value of an interactive interpreter, which is in many respects akin to having a second instructor available for the students, on-demand. It can instantly answer questions about its environment, it makes exploration and experimentation trivial, and it's great when lecturing, as you can immediately explore any ""what-if's"" that your students raise.<p>2. More expressive. Aphyr demonstrated this pretty eloquently in another comment, but the less code that it takes to accomplish a task, the less code you have to understand before you're able to build something useful, and the easier it is to experiment as you go.<p>3. Multi-paradigm. If you're teaching someone programming, you want to be able to expose them to procedures, functions, objects, methods, recursion, etc. If you can do all of that in one language, you lower the mental barrier that your students must overcome before grasping each successive topic.<p>I believe that those facilities are great assets for both exposition by the teacher and exploration by the students, and I do not immediately see a compelling argument in Java's favor which sufficiently justifies foregoing the above pedagogic benefits. If the goal is to teach and create understanding, then surely the instructor should employ the tools that most readily support that objective.",1296022773
