There are arbitration rules for the inevitable disputes over what's ""comparable"".<p>They're also required to respect net neutrality wrt video content, and to preserve standalone internet access.<p>Lastly, there's a really weird-looking condition saying that they should try to preserve local news reporting at NBC-owned local TV stations by finding and partnering with local non-profit reporting cooperatives ""within twelve months of closing"".<p>The above is a condensed and (over?)simplified version of what was already a condensed and simplified version of a longer legal document --- but it might at least help you decide whether you've got an interest in reading the whole megillah.",1295751455

2131641,comment,2130771,2131602,0,0,nbpoole,,,"And none of these posts you're referencing are at all relevant to the issue at hand (unless you're taking the position that PHP is Pure Evil as a language, which is an entirely separate issue)! ;-)<p>The question at hand isn't whether it's easy or hard for someone to write secure code in PHP (my opinion: it's not easy, but it's certainly possible). The issue brought up in the article is that a lot of the top search results for ""Free Wordpress Templates"" lead you to templates containing obfuscated code, some of it malicious. That isn't a language issue: as many people have pointed out to you, it's a consequence of running untrusted code.<p>Now, you can certainly debate whether or not this is a Wordpress issue. On the one hand, the Wordpress team could choose to write their own custom templating language that doesn't include the ability to do things like eval base64 strings. But if they did go down that path, they would also be severely restricting what theme developers are capable of doing (and that wouldn't solve any issues with JavaScript or any number of other subtle issues that malicious authors could introduce).<p>My personal take is that this is a case befitting the quote ""with great power comes great responsibility."" That is, the people running Wordpress blogs need to be aware of the risks when they install plugins or themes. The Wordpress team has built tools into Wordpress that encourage people to download and update plugins and themes from Wordpress.org, which is seemingly more legitimate than these random sites (I'm not sure if there's a formal evaluation process for plugins/themes submitted there). Beyond that though, I don't think it's the fault of the Wordpress developers if people choose, whether out of ignorance or carelessness, to download and install random themes from the Internet. I mean, I don't blame Microsoft if I go searching for ""free [software name]"" and end up downloading a virus. ;-)",1295750958

It makes research less efficient and more difficult.<p>If I actually want to learn about something, I either want a truly cinematic experience (like BBC's Planet Earth or Carl Sagan's Cosmos) or I want to get the raw details (Wikipedia, books, etc.). Generating a video of already-existing content that's neither truly cinematic nor efficient makes very little sense to me.<p>EDIT:\nA good example is the Khan Academy or Open Courseware actually. Qwiki is great for summarizing information you already know (why would I need a web site for that?), while human-generated content can actually disseminate topics to an extent that fosters learning.",1295750876

2131630,comment,2130771,2131607,0,0,lkrubner,,,"Or, here is another:<p>------------<p>But PHP has more than a few security bugs: in many ways PHP is fundamentally flawed. The program, whose initials originally stood for Personal Home Page, was designed without much thought given to security. Many of the PHP features that make it really easy to write a Web application also make it really difficult to write one that's secure.<p>All of this matters just now because Stefan Esser, the founder of the Hardened-PHP Project and the PHP Security Response Team (which he recently quit), has threatened to make March the ""month of PHP bugs."" By that, Esser means that he is going to be releasing a series of security bugs in March that show the world just how unsecure PHP actually is.<p>What's driving Esser is both a desire to make PHP more secure and a good touch of anger and resentment at the current PHP developers who have taken many of his security patches and incorporated them into the program without giving Esser any credit. You can read more about his motivations in his blog entry and in the interview that he did with Security Focus.<p>How will this affect users of the Web? Well, a recent ""Month of Bugs"" project aimed at Apple identified a number of security problems that the company was apparently unaware of, but it didn't result in any serious worms or threats to Apple users. This month of PHP bugs might be a similar bust. On the other hand, Apple was able to push out a fix to these problems using the Mac OS Software Update feature. PHP has no such feature, and many ISPs run kind of elderly (and buggy) versions of the program.<p><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/garfinkel/17538/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/garfinkel/17538/</a>",1295750338

I'll here post some of the many criticisms that have been aimed at PHP over the years:<p>Andrew van der Stock writes:<p>--------------<p>For some time, I’ve been worried about the direction of PHP. As many of you know, I helped write XMB Forum and now help write UltimaBB. XMB in particular is an old code base, and UltimaBB, a descendant from XMB. I’ve done a lot to protect that code base from attack, and luckily, we’ve been missed despite some doozy and silly security issues. After writing PHP forum software for three years now, I’ve come to the conclusion that it is basically impossible for normal programmers to write secure PHP code. It takes far too much effort.<p>PHP needs a proper security architecture, and support for newbie programmers. PHP’s raison d’etre is that it is simple to pick up and make it do something useful. There needs to be a major push by the PHP Development team to take this advantage, and make it safe for the likely level of programmers – newbies. Newbies have zero chance of writing secure software unless their language is safe.<p>Think about Logo for a minute. Logo can do some interesting things, but it is not a commercially useful language because it cannot do much. But it is an excellent teaching language. PHP is like Logo – it’s a simple and easy way to get into serious web development. It is possible to write large applications in PHP, so it is useful at that level. But it is inherently unsafe as it can do far, far more than Logo.<p>There are so many ways to break PHP that it is impossible for even experienced security professionals like me to code in it securely all the time. There are nearly 4000 function calls, and many of them have unintended consequences or have been inappropriately extended by something else.<p><a href=""http://www.greebo.net/2006/01/04/php-insecurity-failure-of-leadership/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greebo.net/2006/01/04/php-insecurity-failure-of-l...</a><p>---------------<p>Tim Bray put together a collection of links regarding criticism of PHP:<p><a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/17/PHP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/17/PHP</a><p>On that page, there is this from Dominic Mitchell:<p>""I’m in 100% agreement with you about the whole PHP thing. Every time I’ve looked at PHP, I’ve been unable to find out how they use placeholders in code that talks to the database. Yes, every database adaptor provides a quote function, but nobody uses it (consistently). And people wonder why PHP code is always full of security holes. It’s a real shame, as I can see that there’s a lot to like in PHP. But it really needs to clean its act up to appeal to people coming from other programming languages, instead of just people coming from dreamweaver. I actually heard David Heinemeier Hansson (sp?) talking about rails the other day. One of the key points he made is that it should be easy to do the right thing. That’s why Rails hits a sweet spot for me. But when you look at PHP, yes, it’s easy to code, but it’s not easy to do the right thing. That’s where it falls down.""<p>The point that Hansson makes about Ruby is worth thinking about in the context of PHP security. Does PHP make it easy to write secure code? Does it help programmers do the right thing? The defaults in PHP, and the underlying assumptions of PHP, all tend in what direction?<p>Of those links, Jonas Maurus's post is also well worth reading:<p><a href=""http://maurus.net/resources/programming-languages/php/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maurus.net/resources/programming-languages/php/</a><p>Aristotle Pagaltzis sums up the underlying problem:<p>""All of these flaws are interconnected; the morass is simply the result of the language being a templating system that grew too big for its breeches. I don’t believe the problems can be corrected in any sensible fashion; PHP will always be a templating system, however much it may be straining against its clothes.\nAnd let me tell you, it’s still a great templating system! If all you need is to write a web app that consists of two pages, running four queries over a five-table database, there is nothing that will get you up and running faster.""<p><a href=""http://plasmasturm.org/log/393/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plasmasturm.org/log/393/</a>",1295748766

2131596,comment,2131214,2131214,0,0,jessedhillon,,,"I really appreciate the approach of the Python dev team. It's methodical, deliberate and patient; the exact opposite of how I feel the PHP team has managed that project. Features in PHP seem to be decided upon and implemented in a rather hasty and whimsical manner. A couple of examples come to mind:<p>- PHP access syntax is completely inconsistent.\nAccessing a method/member of an instance is $foo->bar; a static method/member of a class is accessed as Foo::bar; and namespace access introduces yet another syntax, Foo\bar\baz.<p>- Another example is the introduction of anonymous, first-class functions.\nFor five major versions, functions were not first-class, and existing libraries and frameworks were written to accept function names in-place of the actual functions. One point-release changed all that, and the result has been a predictable clusterfsck of inconsistency. I wish the PHP team had planned for a long-term adoption of this feature: first-class functions are a fundamental part of a language's character, not a whimsical bolt-on.",1295748498

2131594,comment,2131221,2131480,0,0,binarybits,,,"There's also a countervailing bias that I suspect is far more important: most wrongly-convicted defendants have no way to prove their innocence, and so we never learn that they were wrongly convicted. Many criminal defendants are not sophisticated about the law, and their cases are handled by overworked public defenders. The courts in many states are extremely stingy about giving defendants access to evidence or legal appeals post-conviction. So even if potentially-exculpatory evidence emerges, the convict often can't do anything with it.<p>This is one of those statistics that will never be known with any precision, but even if the number of known exonerations is small (which I don't know to be the case) that doesn't prove that the number of innocents in jail is small.",1295748358
