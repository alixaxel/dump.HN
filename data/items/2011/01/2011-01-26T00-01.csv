2141650,comment,2141463,2141463,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"There's really an enormous amount of hype around NFC, and the fact is that the readers are still really expensive. We've been operating on the assumption that barcodes will prevail because they're about 10X cheaper to read, and the recent Starbucks nationwide rollout of barcode-based mobile payments supports that.<p>Also unless I'm missing something the Android 2.3 NFC spec is pretty incomplete. It lets you read an NFC tag with a phone but not broadcast as though your phone were a tag. This means that you can't really do mobile payments after all (again, I might be missing something obvious, but I don't think so). Hopefully if this really is an omission it will get resolved with the next release of Android. For now there's not a whole lot we can do with it.<p>Anyway, NFC is great, but in reality scanning a barcode isn't that much harder or faster, and it's certainly cheaper--it's been working at grocery stores for years.",1296003557

With graphics you're golden: either it's AMD (uncommon) and it has working FOSS drivers out of the box, or it's Nvidia where you have working FOSS drivers sufficient for work needs, and proprietary drivers sufficient for whatever gaming you could possibly be doing on linux.  With wifi, you're almost always golden these days.

2141636,comment,2141562,2141562,0,0,aphyr,,,"Java isn't impossible for students to learn. I suggest, however, that it is not the best choice; because when it comes to learning how to program you want a language which is maximally expressive with a minimal amount of work. It artificially restricts the problem space you can tackle by making simple things more complicated than they need to be.<p>When you're writing an algorithm to count words in a file, would you prefer<p><pre><code>  string = File.read 'path'
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>  StringBuffer fileData = new StringBuffer(1000);
  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
          new FileReader(""path""));
  char[] buf = new char[1024];
  int numRead=0;
  while((numRead=reader.read(buf)) != -1){
      String readData = String.valueOf(buf, 0, numRead);
      fileData.append(readData);
      buf = new char[1024];
  }
  reader.close();
  string = fileData.toString();
</code></pre>
How about introducing anonymous functions? How much time will it take you to explain the intricacies of creating an anonymous subclass whose only purpose for existence is to encapsulate a single instance with a single method, inside which all variables from the containing scope must be marked as final? Or would you prefer something like Smalltalk?<p><pre><code>  [ :x | x * x ] value: 2
</code></pre>
Sure, students can wrap their heads around both. But the important thing is the <i>concept</i>, not the <i>expression</i>. After all, if they go on to program in the real world, they'll be adapting their knowledge to different languages.",1296003342

(Good copywriters that understand your business are very very, <i>very</i> hard to find.)<p>Here's a random example paragraph:<p>""The SnapBill billing system is a fully-featured online billing automation engine. The system is secure and easy to use.Sending invoices, quotations and statements for recurring or subscription based services has never been so simple. Add your own services to SnapBill and allow your clients to order them via a branded and secure online order centre. Accept payment from your clients through any of our supported payment collection channels.""<p>So what did you just tell me there? ""We let you easily bill people, send invoices and accept payments"". That's a much better sentence, but even that you can remove because by the time we've arrived at this paragraph we know that you do online invoicing and payments. In other words: remove this entire paragraph. And most of the homepage is like that.<p>Another example: your first paragraph:<p>""SnapBill is an online invoicing and billing system with service provisioning capabilities. SnapBill is perfect for all businesses, especially those providing services requiring an automated recurring or subscription billing system and payment collection facilities.""<p>Are you trying to say that this is aimed at Saas companies? Then just say it. No real person will understand that paragraph, at least not anyone you'd want to date. Just say something like (if I am right): ""Invoicing and billing for online subscription services.""<p>Remove redundancies and marketing speak.<p>As an example, ""SnapBill is perfect for all businesses, especially those"". Read that twice. You're basically contradicting the first part of the sentence (perfect for everyone) in the second part (perfect for some especially).<p>So guidelines to do your own copy-editing:<p>1. Remove, remove, remove. Remove words. Remove filler. 
2. Think what you're trying to say. With every sentence and paragraph, what are you trying to say. Then say it as clearly as you possibly can. 
3. Show it to target audience and ask what questions they're trying to answer. Then answer those.<p>Good luck!",1296002938

2141609,comment,2140610,2141152,0,0,dfox,,,"There is probably no USB Host-side interface that really implements USB current-limiting completely. Common solution (used on Intel's reference designs) involves placing solid-state fuse into +5V line (preferably for each port) and sensing if it trips (by routing +5V from actual connector to USB controller IC). Rating of such fuse is typically significantly larger than 500mA (which is maximal allowed current). Truly correct implementation of this would have array of such fuses in different ratings and would switch them according to required current declared by connected device (I don't know of any USB controller or hub IC that actually can do this, not to mention that such thing would be order of magnitude more expensive, which explains why it's not mandatory and why nobody does that).
On the other hand there are also pretty common solutions that simply do not do current limiting in any way (or have non-resettable fuse soldered onto board).",1296002692

I'm interested if someone can give a little more detail as to how the author explains and turns into a procedure, the process of understanding and the actions of when to quit.<p>Two quotes the site claims are, ""If you can't be the best in your class, you should quit"" and ""Quitting does not make you a failure, you quit to avoid failure."" It struck me as a little dangerous and possible that if this is the kind of understanding that results from the book, people might skip out too quickly - something that I see in education too often when persistence and effort could have done wonders. In my opinion, it is very important to know when to ADMIT failure (as opposed to avoid failure) and learn from it. Surely it's also good advice that at some points in our lives we should know when to cut our losses and move on to the next thing. Does this book do this in a deep and objective way?<p>There is a lot of evidence that people are pretty poor at assessing themselves. Second, the idea of failure avoidance is a common trait of people with fixed implicit theories of self and low effort-belief (traits correlated with lower performances, at least on tasks in the domain of education.) Third, people are really good at justifying their actions to preserve their self concepts. Ingredients that unless accounted for, seem like they could be dream killers with a slight push called ""go ahead, quit.""<p>Now, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt that the actual book probably goes much more in depth as to when and how to make this sort of assessment but I thought I'd bring it up.

The concepts are basically the same, but you gain the incremental benefits by not starting from a new codebase. Rewrites always suffer from second system effect and disperse your efforts away from the actual problem. Rewrites are the economic equivalent of quantitative easing, it's just a nice way to avoid dealing with the actual problem while pretending to fix it.<p>The process I always use for refactoring an existing project is to first isolate the code that you want to remove, then create an interface that so that the new interface is EXACTLY the same as the isolated code and then build a new implementation that utilizes the same interface. Then you change the interface so that the leaky abstractions from the old interface are gone.<p>This is the process I used to migrate from OpenLDAP to SQL Server. And yes, there was a DN field in SQL Server for many years that emulated the DN structure of LDAP, and we had a bunch of hacky stored procs that would emulate LDAP semantics for search.<p>Rewriting is the 'easy' answer, but its usually not the best. Even if you're 'refactoring' your app to another language it's usually best to create some bridges so that both work in parallel, if you have a web app use some proxy hackery, if you have a desktop app, use IPC. I've switched apps from Perl to ASP.NET using this method.<p>The other thing that refactoring in this manner benefits is team cohesion, by switching languages slowly it allows the people proficient in the old language to add a lot of value to the new team, transfer knowledge slowly, and also get up to speed on the new language. When people feel like they are going to be out of a job when the rewrite is complete they will not be thrilled about it. When they have an opportunity to learn a new language, contribute meaningfully to getting rid of things they always hated, they will be much more engaged.",1296001738

2141513,comment,2140354,2140354,0,0,Smerity,,,"I applied for a summer internship with Google between 2009-2010 (remember: Australian summer!). I ended up making it through but even for an intern there were four rounds of phone interviews. To be honest I actually enjoyed those interviews though I did spend a long time preparing for them. I also enjoyed being able to poke and prod and ask questions.<p>The process was grueling however and I know a large number of my highly competent friends never made it through. Some of it is due to Google having a policy of ""assume the worst"" in order to try and reduce the number of bad hires but I think some of them was as the interviewers were too harsh. One of them had a phone interview ended almost immediately if not getting (what to me seems like a trick) question.<p>""Given an infinitely long linked list which you can only traverse once select a random item with O(1) storage.""<p>Google tried to get me as an intern again the following summer but I'd decided to instead intern at a local startup[1] that are doing well. The CEO trusts me, gives me enough power to really help the company and is showing me how a real startup works, both good and bad. It's an atmosphere that Google just doesn't have anymore.<p>To be honest I do miss a number of things from Google, such as the stunning internal developer tools, the academic/computer sciencey atmosphere and the amazing people but I still far prefer the startup I'm in currently. I just don't think Google registers as a startup anymore.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.freelancer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelancer.com/</a>",1296000531

We had inhouse people, people at home and people working in Manila (on data, like fast facts--not full- on writing) of <i>articles</i> and that worked well. In fact, you can almost make the at home and in the office model work if you keep the costs down to $10 an hour/$10 a page. To have folks in the office you would have to do it as $400-500 a week and no benefits and no chef (which kind of sucks), so work from home wins this model (as it did on Demand Media, Weblogs Inc, etc).<p>2. Mahalo is 40 months old now, which means we have better SEO, better ability to move folks around the site and a better ability to know which pages make money and don't. So, we can make 3x as much now per page as we did back then (or more). So, we've learned a lot.<p>3. Video is VERY different than writing articles. I won't get into the metrics, but you can't compare it to articles. also, the traffic to each is very different.<p>So, Mahalo will continue to grow and folks will continue to misunderstand how it works... and that's just fine. We're not here to explain how to run a business to folks who don't know how to. We're here to build an amazing place where people can ""learn anything"" and to get a return for our investors.<p>We are the 160th largest site in the USA now.... and if you counted our video traffic to our domain traffic we would be in the top 100 (maybe #75). Quantcast doesn't do this (grrrrr).<p>Next year we will be in the top 100, then top 50 and then in the top 25.<p>at that point you'll write a long post and explain to me how i don't know what I'm doing, and i will write a long post back to you explaining how business works..... again! :-)",1296000401
