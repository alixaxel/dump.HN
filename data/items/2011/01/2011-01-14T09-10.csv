The nag message for Apple users does not contradict the license under which Remind is published (GPL). The message, reflective of the author's ""petulance"" as you put it, is, legally speaking a feature of the software and it is subject to the same licensing terms.<p>I think you are mixing up the license with a vague notion of the ""spirit"" of the license. These are two different things. You may still argue that the nag message goes against the ""spirit"" of a free license (while not against the terms), but the counter-argument made by the author is that this measure is justified in the face of Apple's restrictive behavior.",1294999175

I don't think you're the common case.<p>Compared to the effort it takes to produce the content, encoding is negligible. We have a complete studio and a dedicated team producing a couple hours of original material every week. Originals are kept as uncompressed as possible storage-wise and are captured at the highest quality the equipment allows. Encoding happens in a server that's nowhere near capacity.<p>I proposed a presentation on it at the last FISL but it didn't make the cut (for which I am glad - two others did and it was quite enough work preparing them).",1294998736
2103059,comment,2102905,2102905,0,0,wlievens,,,"I think a great way to learn programming is to start with the simplest languages.<p>Start with Scheme. It doesn't even have proper objects and classes, so you'll be forced (guided, actually, if you go the SICP route) to implement them yourselves. This teaches you in an elegant way about essential concepts in programming, but manages to keep your head clear and unbiased about the many different ways to do things, whereas a language with a strong fundamental paradigm (i.e. Java) may bias you forever.<p>Then learn C. It couldn't be more different from Scheme, but that's a good thing. It forces you to think about things you thought you didn't reaaly have to think about - such as memory allocation.<p>With a solid basis in these two languages, you've covered just about every paradigm or building block of programming languages you can imagine. Learning another language then becomes trivial, and for bonus points, you'll be a lot better programmer at those languages too.",1294998636

Even C++ would give you a shorter version.<p>Far more important though is how much stuff is in that one line of code that needs to be understood in order for what you are typing to be more than just arcane magic words. Pedagogically speaking that is an awful way to get started, so I think the claim that that is not a great way to teach kids is pretty valid.<p>To be fair I fully agree that 'Hello world' is not a good way to assess the worth of a language in general, but the ease of getting started is a valid concern when using a language to introduce programming",1294998450

Checkout CLOS and the MOP or Smalltalk sometime for a good object system.<p>- No. Java has a complex syntax. Take a look at the grammar sometime.

Explain to me how: Map<String, Pair<Integer, Set<String>>> data = new HashMap<String, Pair<Integer, Set<String>>>(); is useful. Explain how 20 lines for a strategy pattern or a visitor pattern is better than just having built in first order functions and multiple dispatch.<p>- The type system is abysmal (and not sound).

But only because I need Lucene and Hadoop ;-)<p>The main bad habit is a gross overuse of patterns to compensate for language stupidity (see: <a href=""http://norvig.com/design-patterns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/design-patterns/</a>).<p>A few particular examples include:<p>- Too much global state. You call it a Singleton. I call it a global variable with a fancy name and a lot more code.<p>- You lose the ability to think functionally and dynamically. You can see the core of the architecture much more clearly if your default thought is 'I want to pass a function' or 'I want to call a fn based on rutime types.' And then you should convert that to what's implementable in language X (strategy pattern and visitor pattern, respectively for Java). Thay way you don't lose sight of the forest for the trees (and can implement what you're trying to do without cruft in a good language).<p>- Verbosity. It's bad enough that passing a small fn (1 line of code in a decent language), requires a separate class and 20 lines of code in Java. On top of that the type system is too weak to actually stop most interesting errors but just strong enough to be annoying. And for some idiotic reason, they won't even implement compile time type inference which would save lots of verbosity and maintain code/bytecode compatibility.",1294997862
