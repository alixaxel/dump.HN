You can get much of the experience with essentially zero risk (except to your ego) by starting a social club, student organization, hobby website, or open-source project.  Just as long as you make an honest goal of adoption and don't just put it out there with a ""whatever happens, happens"" attitude.<p>My first major programming project was a complete rewrite in college of a Harry Potter fansite that grew from 2000 to 100,000 registered users during my time on staff.

2160562,comment,2157703,2158619,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>How can I stop being a ""faker"", as you call it? I, and probably some other HNers, are often pretty critical or take things people say more literally than they meant often, rather than giving them the benefit of the doubt with a more liberal interpretation.</i><p>I think it helps to realize it is endemic to the culture and to understand why.<p>My original introduction to online communities was with parenting/homeschooling forums for folks with ""gifted"" kids.  The members were generally bright and many of them well educated.  The initial environment was pretty ugly, in spite of the intent that these were supposed to be ""support"" groups.<p>I eventually concluded that most of the members were used to being the smartest person in the room and had the routine experience that if someone didn't agree with them, it was because they didn't understand it.  I felt it was the first time most of these people were exposed to a culture of intellectual equals where other people who disagreed with them had valid reasons for seeing it differently.  I felt that we had no choice but to break new ground in order to get past the tendency for people to be obnoxious and arrogant.<p>Hacker News appears to have a similar situation.  It is somewhat compounded by the fact that it is the most international forum I have participated in.  This means people from very different cultures and very different life experience are interacting.  This inevitably leads to inaccurate interpretations.  I come from a multi-cultural background, so I tend to overlook foreign accents and grammatical errors to a greater degree than most bright, well-educated individuals.  I operate on the rule of thumb that ""They are speaking English way better than I would be able to speak their native language"". I know a smattering of German and French, a smidgen of Spanish, and a few words of Russian.  I'm not fluent in any of them.  So I start with giving foreigners a pass on grammatical errors or oddities of wording.  I don't see it as any indication of lack of intelligence.  Grammar and spelling are often nit-picked here and I occasionally do it myself.  I try hard to not come across as obnoxious. I sometimes genuinely was not sure what they were saying because of a misspelled word (that seems to trip me up more than grammar, which is mentally easier for me to account for, presumably because I grew up in a bilingual home).  In some ways, I like the fact that people here will nit-pick grammar and spelling and such but I really hate it when it is done in a very obnoxious manner.  I have seen instances where someone was railing about something of that sort and it just made me feel like ""Oh, grammar and spelling are things you think are critically important to public appearances but manners are not??""<p>This dynamic -- of everyone in the room being confident they are Right, by god! -- was a problem within my own family (with my marriage and my kids). After about 16 1/2 years of marriage, my then husband bought me a t-shirt that said ""I'm always RIGHT (except when I'm wrong)"".  It was something I said a lot at home and I think it was something of an admission on his part that perhaps he shouldn't argue with me so much, perhaps he should try harder to <i>talk</i> to me instead.  (The constant arguing was one of the things that contributed to the demise of the marriage.)  I try really hard to <i>talk</i> with people online rather than argue, even if I don't agree with them.",1296456433

Do you really believe that's a common scenario?<p>Even if they weren't working on it at the same time, as long as somebody's looking when you gain moderate success, you've got a competitor who can use your current work as R&D to catch up — and then they can outpace you if you're giving 30% fueled by pocket change and they're giving 100% with the resources of a millionaire.

2160549,comment,2159867,2160372,0,0,btilly,,,"If you do random assignment, and save the random assignments somewhere, then you can also get reproducibility.  If you do random assignment, and don't save the random assignments anywhere, then you have no idea how many people were in your test versions.  Which is not a good idea.  (You can estimate this data.  I've done it.  But doing it properly is surprisingly tricky.  It is very, very easy to do it wrong.)<p>There are several benefits to this approach.<p>The first benefit is that if you're testing a particular page, you can easily make your test only include people who have hit that page.  This will cause results to converge more quickly than if you don't know which people on your site actually hit that page.<p>The second, and sometimes critical, benefit is that you know exactly <i>when</i> someone entered the test.  Multiple times when testing things with a longer sales cycle I've encountered the situation where a particular test version causes the sales cycle to become compressed, but may or may not provide a long-term improvement in conversion.  Access to data about when people entered your test allows you to examine A/B test results only for people who have been in the test long enough to be likely to have completed either version.<p>A third benefit is that if you're testing multiple versions, then you can just continue the test and drop poorly performing versions as you prove that they are suboptimal.<p>The downside, as you say, is that the map of who is in what version can get very large.  In my experience, though, the access patterns are not that bad.  Particularly not if you are already using sessions, and can cache that information in the current session, so that most page hits don't have to fetch the A/B test version.  Furthermore this is not data that you need to join to anything else on your live website.  Therefore it is a perfect candidate to move somewhere like Redis.",1296455927
