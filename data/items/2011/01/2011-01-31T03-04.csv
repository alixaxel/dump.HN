That's: 3 x $70k = $210k.<p>So all you money is now gone.<p>With no money left how are you going to pay the rent, pay for equiment, pay for any other day to day business expenses (i.e. phone, electricity, insurance, taxes etc).<p>I'd say $200k is even too low for 2 employees (in any western country).",1296446276

Sure, it's most probably not going to be as intense as for a start-up, but that's less because of start-up vs big company, but much more about how committed you are to your work in general.

2160203,comment,2159592,2160175,0,0,wallflower,,,"> In fact, for most of the good stuff, you have to do this.<p>IB's biggest benefit is we can have our artists skin apps and check in the XIB - no programmer needed. This is very important once you start creating platform type apps. Skinning can be a very time consuming process; IB makes it more manageable.<p>To clarify what milkshakes is saying, IB stops being useful when you are doing custom animations (e.g. moving subviews around - something that is very common if you have a custom animation). Usually, IB will beat a developer coding CGRect type code from scratch (unless they are using Opacity - a great tool that generates code and is very programmer friendly). A custom UIView will probably win the performance race but lose in the productivity/maintenance marathon.<p>Once you start getting into custom rounded table cells, custom table headers that act as row 0 of the table cell, empty placeholder cells, CoreData, and table/cell animations - you are entering the dark side...<p>Using IB for UITableViewCells doesn't have a significant performance penalty now because if you are doing custom cells - the client is probably willing to sacrifice 60fps scrolling - to get their custom table gradients/cell backgrounds (otherwise the cells would be opaque).",1296446047

That makes a lot of sense when you consider the study shown in the article about how people valued two books in isolation and then relative to each other.<p>One thing to possibly take away is that if you have a more ""featureful"" product (like the 20,000 entries v 10,000 entries) that's not as nice, people will be willing to pay more for it, if it is next to a nicer ""less featureful"" product.  Obviously, this might only work in limited domains, like the dictionary example, but food for thought if you're selling your own product or one on eBay.

I would have more respect for you if you said for instance yes we have these well documented problems but not everyone in Israel is like that.<p>Legal discrimination is systematized discrimination, it does not imply that every law in the country is racist, but since you're accusing the country of legal discrimination I just referred to what you said it as ""systematized racism"" instead of ""legal [race based] discrimination."" I may have misquoted the degree of your criticism but you are still arguing that relatively small issues are in fact serious racial discrimination issues (small in the sense that they don't contribute to racial discrimination, not that the issues themselves aren't serious.) I don't even deny that there is racial discrimination from a small portion of individuals but to say that there is strong legal action taken to discriminate in the country is just flatly wrong.<p>>> Regardless of your efforts at justifying it with excuses, it stands up to the definition of discrimination, whatever the excuse or the path to that may be. No racist person or entity in history has ever suffered from lack of excuses.<p>No, the country isn't perfect or entirely fair but each of these criticisms has plausible <i>non racist</i> explanations. For example the building permits there are issued just like in the US: you have to pass many different rigorous legal and technical tests before you can build, and it is not entirely impossible that the legwork isn't being done by these Arab communities in the first place. The building-permit process in Israel is widely criticized as unusually slow for any country even in Jewish communities and I believe the OECD just released an evaluation that it takes 3 times as long in Israel as other OECD countries to issue building permits.<p>And another example: the criticism of education funding is no different than what happens in the US, where some people argue that a community's funding for education should be directly from what that community can extract from taxes.
