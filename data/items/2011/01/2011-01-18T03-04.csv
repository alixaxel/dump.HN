Pondering this, but it's a toughie.

Considering that we discover all kinds of animals are smarter than we thought with each passing experiment, the burden of proof should lie with you. The limitations appear to be our experiments.<p>We do not start with this assumption when dealing with human beings. The safe assumption is that animals have their own desires, goals, ambitions, and purposes for existence. Since we have significant trouble understanding them or communicating with them (even though we know that within their own species they communicate perfectly well with each other), we might start from a less biased viewpoint.<p>As for jellyfish, I don't know. But I do know that we've approached it from the wrong angle. Asking how many words a jellyfish can respond to and then determining whether or not it is intelligent is a surefire way to create a lousy experiment.<p>BTW, Europeans used to do the same sorts of experiments with people from other countries and civilizations. They knew that white Anglo Saxons were the best and brightest so they looked for evidence to prove it. Africans clearly hadn't invented guns or the printing press so they determined that they had a lower level of intelligence.

It's true, we don't spend a lot of time looking at roofs, and where people congregate in large numbers, roofs tend to be flatter and more out of view.<p>Pavement, on the other hand, is visible everywhere people are and you do look at it all the time when you're outside in a city. Regardless of the heat, a dark road/footpath is easier on the eyes than a light one. Concrete roads on hot, sunny days require either squinting or sunglasses as all that lovely light gets reflected into your eyes.<p>Not to mention that concrete roads and footpaths are less pleasant to use in general.",1295320512

As they're a bank holding company, they can tap funds from the Feds at a very low rate. Because of this, they can make deals with an enormous amount of risk, and not care. If it fails, and cash is needed, just tap the funds.<p>2. The contract between GS and investors, explicitly says that GS can sell their stake on Facebook without informing investor. A clear sign of the risk associated with the deal. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/goldman-sachs-discloses-it-can-sell-hedge-facebook-stake-without-warning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/goldman-sachs-discl...</a><p>3. The SEC can't do nothing about this. There's no law that prohibits GS to do this.
