That's why I don't use Facebook lately, although I wasn't able to verbalize the reason so well.  I feel like I'm reading PRs from my friends, and I feel like I'm compelled to write my own PR, what is time-consuming.<p>People used to buy expensive clothes or cars to show off.  Now they show off in Facebook, posting the pictures of their amazing vacations.<p>I used to love Facebook when I had less than 50 friends in it.

No-one else is going to pick it up and use it for a few hours. But the iPad just intuitively seems like a device that's destined to live on the coffee table and be a family's shared machine. The software may ""want"" to be personal, but the hardware definitely doesn't.<p>There's really nothing stopping this happening from a technical standpoint. Have multiple ""swipe to unlock"" arrows on the lock screen, one for each user, labelled of course. Passwords on accounts if users so choose. Everyone gets their own apps, browser history/cookies/cache, music, movies, etc.<p>Where this gets tricky is when users of the same device want to share things. You shouldn't need to have two copies of the same movie on a device. I also have no idea how iTunes syncing would work.",1296183423

That's why you have to stretch your pecs and consciously work to pull your shoulders back when you're standing. The standing desk is probably a really good idea for preventing ""turtle neck,"" because as far as I know there's no weight exercise where you push your head back and stretch the neck out (again, this is something that I do consciously now when walking).<p>Lower-body imbalances from squats will depend on how wide your stance is, where you point your knees, and how you use your muscles. Generally narrow and pointing forward you'll use quads, wider and out and it's glutes or hamstrings. I was definitely a hamstrings-dominant squatter and as a result I have tight hip flexors and hamstrings (this is apparently pretty common).",1296183219

Both languages started with a simple core that allowed developers to take some basic ideas and see just how far they could go with them. It just didn't occur to me to describe that as ""opposite"".<p>Interestingly, both languages wound up with a schism of framework enthusiasts (CLOS & ""big Forths"") vs. minimalists (Scheme & Moore loyalists (for want of a better term)).<p>As an aside, your bunch of data example would run afoul of Forth catechism. The normal response would be to use a dictionary address or even address and offset to access a data structure. Antagonism to deep use of the data stack is so prevalent that Moore eventually reached the point with his chip designs of implementing the top of stack as a couple of on-chip registers -- if what you want isn't within the top couple of stack entries, so the logic goes, then you've failed to factor your design properly.

In addition traders would predict US GDP, world trade, US military casualties, and western terrorist casualties, and a few miscellaneous items, to be determined by traders and the EIU. This would require (8 × 8 × 5 =) a hundred or so base markets.
