2147995,comment,2147615,2147615,0,0,aothman,,,"My research involves making electronic agents to mediate interactions in markets, with one application being to prediction markets. One of the things I've discovered is that prediction markets where prices influence events are significantly more complicated from a theoretical perspective than a standard market. In such markets it can be difficult to predict how rational agents will act, even if they care only about their risk-neutral monetary payout and not about the events in question.<p>For instance, one of the new trends in prediction markets has been corporate elicitation (e.g., Inkling Markets YC W06). For instance, a market might ask a pool of employees ""When will product X ship?"". Now consider the employee's problem. He knows the product will be delayed until November at the current pace, but that if managers see high November probabilities they'll cut back on the project and re-focus development efforts (or, perhaps instead, shift some staffers over to get the project done faster). How should the employee trade in this market?<p>If your answer is ""it's unclear"" then you're exactly right. The self-referentiality of prices (they cause actions which then define prices) makes the problem much harder. It's actually possible to design markets which are so self-referential that <i>any</i> trade will be the right one (the market prices are self-predicting prophecies) or that <i>any</i> trade will be the wrong one (e.g., if there's a high price on terrorist attack Z then the government will always spend enough money to prevent Z from happening).<p>In fact, the only way around the paradox is to have the prices in a prediction market not matter at all - for the managers to take the same course of action regardless of the prices they see in the market. But then why run a market in the first place?<p>The whole thing is an interesting and seemingly fundamental perversion of the way we normally think about prices. And again, this is without any malicious intent on the part of participants, which will certainly only further confuse things.",1296140188

From the staff I've known commuting between towns over the years, I find it hard to believe that a company offering good work and reasonable pay in a large town couldn't draw the staff and within a reasonable commuting radius of Northampton as the town in question you've easily got a 1m population, maybe more, let alone the 200k or so as the immediate local work force, keen to cut down the commute.<p>EDIT: I should add part of the company location suggestion is ease of reach for clients / partners, rather than staff lifestyle. Give yourself a hypothetical 10AM meeting and look at the percentage of UK business you can reach without an obnoxiously early start. London and West Midlands obviously, Thames Valley, pretty much the whole home counties, much of East Anglia, Oxfordshire, Leicester / Derby / Nottingham area, even up as far as Sheffield or Stoke....

2147959,story,,,20,8,throwmeaway,"Ask HN: How do you handle an impersonator?",,"Hi,
I work at a non-tech startup (financial services industry, not evil), and we're having trouble with someone trying to use our firm's name for their own ends.<p>We first found out about this through one of our founder's friends who was based in the UK branch of a major bank. He told us that instructions had been given out to ignore emails and calls claiming to be from my company. Till date we have never spoken with them, but they are a long term target we hope to convert.<p>We've seen internal emails discussing the issue, and it seems this individual had called multiple times to obtain phone numbers and names of people in the department. Bizarrely, he tried to impersonate the Financial Times and our firm in the span of ten minutes. Fortunately his voice was identified and the bank sent out an email letting people know he was a phony.<p>We suspect that he was part of some sort of unscrupulous recruitment agency, since he was primarily focused on getting names of people to talk to. We figured it was best to let the issue slide. A key fact though, was that the faker knew that we were active in country A, and at one point said that he was based out of Country A.<p>Now a few weeks later, we found an account on LinkedIn trying to masquerade as a Director of our firm. The account is based out of Country A, and I suspect that it is the same idiot trying to run another scam. I've spoken to LinkedIn and I am getting his account flagged, hopefully I can prevent some of the damage he may end up doing.<p>It is particularly painful for my company - our reputation and brand is one of the most important assets we are building up, as the industry really values trust and security when dealing with its vendors. 
We are worried that a reputation we have spent 4 years building up is being damaged by some dead beat, who we cannot figure out how to get a hold of.<p>Has anyone faced something similar? If so, how did you handle it? Any advice or suggestions are welcome.<p>PS: Please excuse my word and sentence usage, I will try and clarify as much as I can.

Due to financial differences the shuttle was seized and put into storage in the harbor of Bahrain. In the summer of 2003 the BURAN was acquired by the museum but transport to Germany was delayed because of legal struggles for five years.

Out of my class, only one other person went on to study something computer related (and not a computer science degree). The school made little effort in trying to promote such things and instead focused on the usual (mechanical) engineering and business type things that are (or were when I was in school, anyway) so popular. Yet those are industries (as far as I see, anyway) badly affected by the recession. Schools, in my experience - I'm sure some are better than others in this respect, put much too little emphasis on computer education, even though it has become such an integral part of most peoples lives and certainly of business. I think some solid computing and programming education for primary level children would be a great advancement for our country, but honestly, second level education is so lacking in that area that I think <i>any</i> additional computing-related education would be beneficial.<p>In fact, it should be a mandatory part of education for everyone. Even if most people are disinterested and do something else, the problem solving and analysis skills would serve them well whatever they do.

(Hand development,  of course,  is important for computer keyboardists.)<p>Although it's not a complete weightlifting manual,  I like the attitude of Bruce Lee's 'Art of Expressing the Human Body',  which turned me on to circuit training.

  For instance,  my knees are wonky so I watch my workload and avoid traditional 2-leg extension exercises such as the leg press and the 2-leg squat.  Instead I do single-leg exercises and intense hamstring work that has stabilized my knees.

   At some point you're going to transcend other people's cookie-cutter programs.  For instance,  reading Lee and Brookfield has gotten me to focus on forearm and grip strength,  because everybody I see who lifts has big upper arms and scrawny forearms.

London. And so on. There may be local centers of excellence elsewhere - and devolution has been an improvement - but if your startup relies on, for example, shmoozing clients or investors in the media or finance sectors, then London is where you want to be.<p>Personally, I think that's one thing (well that and our antiquated infrastructure and class system) that's holding the UK back, and it didn't used to be the case. But that's the situation we have.<p>However, there is no reason why people who don't need to shmooze with clients need to live in London or the Home Counties. If your job is coding, then remote working is a viable - and cheap - option, with the occasional company meeting every other month. A lot of companies have a lot of success with this model and, well-managed, it works well.<p>I think a lot of startups are still attached to some ""Social Network"" romantic ideal of a hackers' playground where we sit in Aeron chairs and eat pizza doing all-night coding sprints in between Nerf gun fights.

The EPR paper (1935) concludes with a statement that the authors believe a local and complete theory of QM is possible.

Peter Leeson, from the Dept of Economics at West Virginia University did some research and published a paper. Here's a link: <a href=""http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_off_Stateless.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_off_Stateless.pdf</a><p>This paper compares several indicators between the current situation and the time when they had a government.<p>Live expectancy is up. Physicians per 100,000 is up. Infant mortality is down dramatically, and the percentage with low birth weight is down dramatically.  Sanitation, access to health facilities are both improved.  Extreme poverty has declined. Radio ownership is up dramatically, as is Telephones and Television.<p>Adult Literacy and School enrollment are both down, but given the rise in private schools I suspect this might be due to the way the data is collected.  The same thing can be said about all the other statistics, as they always should bear some analysis.<p>But I don't think it is the slam dunk that it is popularly assumed.<p>From the paper:
""The data depict a country with severe problems, but one which is clearly doing better under statelessness than it was under government. Of the 18 development indicators, 14 show unambiguous improvement under anarchy. Life expectancy is higher today than was in the last years of government’s existence; infant mortality has improved 24 percent; maternal mortality has fallen over 30 percent; infants with low birth weight has fallen more than 15 percentage points; access to health facilities has increased more than 25 percentage points; access to sanitation has risen eight percentage points; extreme poverty has plummeted nearly 20 percentage points; one year olds fully immunized for TB has grown nearly 20 percentage points, and for measles has increased ten; fatalities due to measles have dropped 30 percent; and the prevalence of TVs, radios, and telephones has jumped between 3 and 25 times.""<p>and:
""Importantly, the indicators in Table 1 also do not measure the substantial increase in personal freedoms and civil liberties enjoyed by Somalis since the emergence of anarchy. The Somali government ruthlessly suppressed free speech, censoring newspapers, radio and television. Most forms of free expression were punishable by death and foreign travel was severely restricted. Today, in contrast, Somalis are free to travel as they please (restricted only by governments of other nations) and enjoy greater freedom of expression, both privately and publicly. 20 private newspapers, 12 radio and television stations, and several Internet sites now provide information to the Somali public (Freedom House 2005). Satellite-based televisions enable the transmission of international news services, including CNN (Little 2003: 170-171). Authorities in Somaliland and Puntland have attempted to interfere with media providers in their territories, but freedom of expression remains improved compared to its status under government. This constitutes an additional important, though unmeasured, increase in Somali welfare under anarchy.""<p>On the education issue:
""Only two of the 18 development indicators in Table 1 show a clear welfare decline under stateless: adult literacy and combined gross school enrollment. Given that foreign aid was completely financing education in Somalia pre-1991, it is not surprising that there has been some fall in school enrollment and literacy. This is less a statement about the Somali government’s ability to generate welfare enhancing outcomes for its citizens than it is a reflection of foreign aid poured into Somali education by the international development community before government collapsed.9""",1296137194

I have multiple terminal windows open in the background connected to various services and my current focus is on my fullscreen IDE of choice. Now my IDE has various pieces of information on it and, given that my short term memory isn't what it once was, I would like to always be able refer to it. So I switch to Terminal and ALL the Terminal windows are pulled above the IDE window, often obscuring the piece of information I wanted to reference.<p>It's not that the 98-esque model is necessarily superior, it's rather that it's surprising when windows you haven't requested to see are pulled into the foreground. Now this may be due to me having used `window-centric` switching for many years but after 3 years of owning a mac I still find this behaviour frustrating.",1296136895

I used to fiddle with Linux and know about the latest CPUs, but then I found that I was spending a lot of time on something of little benefit to me.<p>My MacBook does everything I need, and it has the Unix underpinnings I prefer. My iPhone is very useful, although it is getting a little slow as apps get bigger. I will probably upgrade to the iPhone 5 when it comes out, if it turns out to be good enough.<p>I'm the same way with cars. I bought a Honda Civic recently without a lot of comparison shopping because I have had good luck with them before, and I know it's a quality car. A friend of mine bought another kind of car that had some cool features that mine doesn't have, and I was a little envious for a moment, but it soon passed. I'm very happy with my solid little car.",1296136811

If you can't take other people's lives seriously, how can you be expected to take other people's money seriously? If the DUI were a little further in the past then it would be a different story, and I'm sure there are VCs out there wouldn't care about a recent one, but if I were a VC I'd move on pretty quickly.",1296136810
