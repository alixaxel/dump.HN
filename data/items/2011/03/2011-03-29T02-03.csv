2381164,comment,2381118,2381118,3,0,byoung2,,,"It depends a lot on what they are doing.  Are they all watching video or playing an interactive game?  Are they commenting on an active blog or forum?  Are they browsing product listings on an ecommerce site.  Or just reading articles on a news site?<p>If the traffic is write-heavy, like a forum or blog with active commenting, you'll need a beefy database to handle all of the concurrent writes.  Same for the interactive game.<p>For read-heavy sites like the video site, you would have to use a CDN to keep that sustained video transfer rate and to reduce latency for users.  For the product listings or the news site, you could get away with a lighter server setup and use static caching and CDN content mirroring to ease the load on your servers<p>It would also depend on whether this traffic is regular throughout the year, or does it spike at predictable times (think about an Apple product blog after WWDC or a coupon blog on Black Friday).  If you have regular, predictable traffic, you can buy or lease dedicated servers...for traffic to spikes, look into cloud based servers like Amazon EC2 where you can scale up and down at will.<p>At my current job (a media company that operates 850 radio stations in the US), we just have a few loadbalanced frontend servers with squid and memcache and a few database servers behind Akamai Edgecast CDN mirroring.  All of the traffic is read-only (articles, transcripts, news), so no actual users ever hit our servers, except to sign up for newsletters.  Show audio and video are streamed by Akamai or another provider.",1301367384

The example he gives is of a Swedish bus driver being paid 50x as much as an Indian one, where as they do the same job, just in different places.<p>Now since anyone in the world can create and submit work for 99designs (as well as for any other internet / information based agencies) it really levels out the playing field and removes the barrier of immigration when it comes to wages. Meaning that information workers (designers in this case) from developed countries need to add more value to what they are doing than what is available through sites like 99designs, if they want to continue practicing their craft.",1301367248

Talk about banging a square rhinoceros into a round hole.<p>Java's point of greatest similarity to C++ is undoubtedly Generics, which has all the syntactic disadvantages of C++ templates, but none of the meta-programming advantages.<p>But one of the ways of seeing that C++ and Java are quite dissimilar is to first grok Java Interfaces, and then read through the smalltalk/C++ version of the GoF book Design Patterns, with a view to how many of the Patterns don't even make sense in Java or are obsolete in Java because of Interfaces.",1301367233

2381138,comment,2379758,2380757,5,0,Xurinos,,,"I wish I had a good handle on that.  There is much to functional programming I need to digest yet.  But the hints are there (I noticed this in the timeline of when these various concepts were played with and integrated into standard specs), and in my own programming, I have learned to use the hybrid effectively.  What follows is purely my current opinion, and it should include some healthy ignorance.  I am but an egg.<p>If I were to put a finger on it, I would say that the reason OOP arose was that there was general recognition of the need for a rich type system.  I got a hint of this in the first couple parts of SICP.  Haskell incorporates a kind of type system that is, itself, pretty interesting.  CLOS/Moose makes C++ and Java feel antiquated.<p>In my experience, a lot of us who learned OOP via C++, Pascal, Java, Ada, and the like generally missed the point: type systems.  We tend to treat classes like collections of the language primitives as opposed to combinations of data structures.  Specifically, we make do with primitive data types and <i>neglect to constrain them as a type</i>.  And ""everything must be an object"" is an extremist mantra with little value; given that your process image must have an entry point, purely a code-flow issue, was there really a point to the illusion of wrapping the entrypoint main() function in a class (I am looking at you, Java)?<p>Here is an OOP type example I see in the wild: an ID that is a string of four characters, a dash, and three digits tends to be stored as a string.  This is incorrect; that string is not like other strings, and this is a blind faith that somebody is not going to incorrectly use that string.  Wrap that in a type that specifically checks that the ID fits that pattern.  It is easy to fall into this kind of mistake in the database management world, too, where an ORM pulls in a VARCHAR2 and does not translate values of this type into an appropriate type in the system, perhaps a type with a restricted domain.<p>Another example: I have learned to always question if my method really needs to accept an ""int"".  This is a smell.  Could my value be negative?  What is the real min/max range of the value?  Could the value have a magic value, such as ""Number Not Given"" (or NULL)?<p>Functional programming helps us with code flow.  OOP helps us carefully classify the data.",1301366918

All computers are basically the same in that sense.

-- How to Design Programs (get version 2. Racket, the IDE for this book, is practically plug-and-play, so you won't waste time prepping your development environment)<p>-- Think Python by Allen Downey (i haven't read this one, but it comes very highly recommended. the excerpts I've read show that Allen communicates the concepts very clearly)<p>-- Eloquent Javascript (very good introduction, all examples can be done directly in the browser with the specially-made console. This eliminates the time and confusion you will experience trying to set up a development environment with other languages.)<p>On top of those I'd also add:
-- The C Programming Language by K&R (if you are interested in C)<p>-- Dive into HTML5 (if you are interested in web development. HTML is a markup language, but you are going to need it to be able to build web stuff. This book complements Eloquent Javascript nicely)<p>-- Land of Lisp<p>-- DOM Scripting (Pair this book with Eloquent Javascript. It's the best introduction to the DOM that I've seen and will bridge the gap between HTML and Javascript)<p>The best books on coding are those that place equal emphasis on good prose and good programming practice and that de-emphasize syntax.<p>Also, look for books where the examples are real-world examples. i.e. things that people have actually had to implement at one time or another. Avoid books with completely imaginary examples that use made up names like foo, bar, widget, etc.",1301364958

Thanks so much for the resources; I'd love to stay in touch and will check out your profile. Do you know how long this stream will be saved?
