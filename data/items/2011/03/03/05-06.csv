2282994,comment,2281724,2282709,0,0,X-Istence,,,"Developers don't want to spent time setting up an entire LAMP environment. There is a reason why Django and Rails are doing so well and that is it is extremely easy to start development and start testing. With SQLite as the database you don't have a need for a full DB to start developing.<p>Being able to launch a quick server to do testing is absolutely fantastic. I use poole.py for my site (to create a static portfolio website) and I use its built in web server to view my changes before committing them and pushing them live.<p>If PHP development became as simple as launching a quick web server just like in Python or Ruby I might once again take an interest in it, at the moment I am just not too interested in working on it, as either I have to set up and run Apache with mod_php on my local machine or I need to set it up on a remote machine, and then files are no longer local, and testing becomes a deploy/test cycle instead, or I am editing files remotely over a possibly slow SSH session, or having to FTP them on save.<p>No, a built in web server in PHP that does the handling of requests would be absolutely fantastic. Having a simple web server doesn't have to add much bloat at all, it isn't bloated in Python or Ruby either. Look at publicfile [1] for an extremely small web server, look at the examples in libevent [2]. A web server built into PHP only has to do the bare minimum, serve requests. It doesn't need all of the functionality that Apache has. It isn't meant to be used in production.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/</a> see [3]<p>[3]: <a href=""http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/doxygen-2.0.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/doxygen-2.0.1/</a>   (Event Driven HTTP servers)",1299131472

2282983,comment,2280671,2282170,0,0,kaptain,,,"You might think so. It would be hard to test this empirically since I would need an alternate universe where people inside apple did not test unreleased software on themselves before releasing. But seeing the process that goes into deciding what fixes go in and what fixes don't has educated me to NOT update unless I have a real need to. I saw lots of examples where a fix for something broke something else that was seemingly unrelated. Or that a feature that I liked depended on a bug that was going to be fixed. That's why I wait on Software Updates. And if I don't need the Update, I don't install it.<p>The problem with 'eating your own dog food' is that it is dog food, so it's really hard to eat. To comply with this edict, I would set up a separate machine and install the latest build and play around with it for about 15 minutes and spend a half hour (or more) filing bugs. Thus, I wasn't really eating my own dog food...<p>Installing new builds turned out to be a big time-sink. It took time for the build to install and then you had to go through the paces of setting the machine up. You also had to do a clean install because of incompatibilities with previous releases.<p>After all of this, you started testing. Then you started finding bugs, and since I was in engineering, I tried to make sure the bug was reproducible and even tried to track down which component was responsible (which is a mess if you're dealing with overlapping stacks of software). THEN, you had to crawl through the maze of reported bugs to see if there was something already reported that was close... Hopefully they've made the bug reporting system better since I was there (but I doubt it… the system I used had been in place for a long time).<p>On top of that, I needed to get actual work done. There was no way that I was truly going to use a ever changing system of dubious quality to do work. I tried, and it was too difficult (although I knew of some folks that were faithful and did so).<p>'Eating your own dog-food' is an ok idea. It's not clear to me that it was the best idea for this particular situation. As a general practice, it seems that if your particular product scope is small enough, this would be a good idea. If it's larger, hiring a set of dedicated test engineers would be awesome. (The ironic thing is that Apple had those too!)",1299131200

2282977,comment,2282574,2282574,0,0,CyberFonic,,,"Great to read from someone who has startup ideas and is prepared to learn to program.  My two bits worth:  It's like a bar stool, best to have three legs.<p>1.  Choose the startup idea that you feel most passionate about.  There will be others as you progress, but stick to the first one (unless your customers vote with their money to go for a different one).<p>2.  Pick a widely used, well documented language.  My suggestion would be Python as it supports most paradigms and comes with a comprehensive collection of standard and additional libraries.  Buy at least strongly recommended book.  I recommend the ones from the O'Reilly series.<p>3.  Be prepared to go off and explore particular issues with the programming language as well as your idea.  You will probably end up with a lot of small point solutions.  I frequently end up with two or more solutions to specific problems before selecting the one to integrate into my key project.<p>Other considerations:<p>*  It's a good idea to establish test driven approach and incorporate your tests from point 3 in your code libraries.<p>*  Use version control, I prefer git, but others are good as well.  It's not so much which one you choose, but to use it consistently.<p>*  If your idea is very web centric, then you might have to seriously look at JavaScript and Node.JS.

The great thing about StartAtlanta or similar events is that you get to feel everyone out and decide if you want to pursue the idea, and conversely, keep team members moving forward. \nIt helped greatly that the TripLingo founder and ""business dude"", Jesse Maddox, was well prepared. He had mockups of the app, spreadsheets with sample data, and a business plan. He had put in 6 months of effort researching, was tech savvy (though not a programmer), and was organized.
