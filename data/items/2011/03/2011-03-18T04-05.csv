The title ""out of respect for people actually launching startups"" is incredibly narcissistic.  I don't give people respect because what they do fits some meme, it's about specifics.<p>But all that aside, I actually do agree that calling projects startups is a bad idea because it's not a subtle semantic difference—they are completely different things!  A project in this case really means an application, and a startup is a company.  Calling an application a startup is like calling the internet a series of tubes, it just betrays a fundamental imprecision that is anathema to the engineering instinct.<p>Note that this distinction has nothing to do with raising capital or how self-important you are.  You can run a business part-time, and if it's early-stage then call it a startup.  However if you're just putting some app out there without any kind of business plan, then it really does sound silly to call it a startup.",1300423694

I know very intelligent people who simply cannot reason about it, it frightens them at an emotional level and they can't get past it.<p>If your approach is rational, you look at this reactor, and you look at how the accident got started, and you think man that really sucks, a 9.0 earthquake <i>and</i> a 30' tsunami? Just like when two 747 jumbo jets collide as one is trying to land on the same runway that another is taking off. You look at what lead up to and ultimately caused the accident, you assure yourself that its not a systemic problem (jumbo jets don't have massive attraction to other jumbo jets for example) you grieve the tragedy, you adjust your planning and your procedure, and you move on.<p>No matter what happens at Fukushima Daiichi, even if all four of the reactors and their spent fuel rods turn into slag candles fused into the foundation of the plant, a rational person would say ""Gee it really is great that we don't have magnitude 9.0 earthquakes with accompanying tsunamis every year, if we did, and they can do this to a nuclear plant, <i>it would be foolish</i> to take those risks.""<p>But an emotional person isn't reasoning, <i>they are afraid.</i> And scared people see black and white, they look at a scary situation like this and say ""If we have no nuclear plants I can't be scared like this again!""<p>No amount of reasoning about the risks makes them less fearful, dealing with fear is a personal issue that goes on inside a person's head. You can try to guide their internal debate but at the end the day, they have to agree not to let their fear override their ability reason, they need to work through it.<p>We can talk about physics, we can talk about statistics, doesn't help the fearful. We need to embrace them, and say ""Yes, I can see that you are very afraid of nuclear power stations. It is completely reasonable to be afraid of nuclear power stations failing and causing grave harm to those around it. But rather than let that fear run us around, let us try to understand when we should be afraid and when we should not be afraid.""<p>People living near that reactor have every reason to be afraid right now. What is going on is not ""in control"" and what will happen tonight and tomorrow could be worse than what happened yesterday and the day before. People who live near nuclear power reactors might be afraid, but if they choose to they could learn what to fear and what not to fear. They could learn that if a major disaster stuck their town (like say an asteroid strike, or a magnitude 9.0 earthquake) they might want to move 50 or so miles away from the nuclear power plant just in case. They might create plans for just such an option, perhaps renting a storage unit in a nearby town and stocking it with some supplies, etc so that they could relocate there and stay for several days or weeks without having to do anything else. Since even this nuclear disaster (and Chernobyl before it) take time to develop fully, you know there will be time for you to respond (we assume you're not touring the grounds). When you make a plan and take action like that, then you've taken steps to conquer your fear, you are no longer the victim you are now prepared. This is just one of a number of ways we can help people deal with their fear of these things.<p>To summarize, the ongoing disaster at the plant is a major disaster, certainly for everyone who works at the plant and for people that live near it. Their lives are going to be disrupted <i>forever</i>. For the rest of us, it will become one of those ""where were you when ..."" kinds of stories like when the Challenger blew up. Our lives will be the same but we will have a painful memory of a tragic event we ""witnessed"".",1300422031

2339270,comment,2339183,2339183,0,0,cgranade,,,"I find it interesting that the study found Android to be so markedly better only for sites that weren't optimized for mobiles. On mobile-friendly sites, the median was quite close and even in iOS's favor: ""The two operating systems were much more closely matched for mobile specific websites with Android only faster three per cent of the time, with a median load time of 2.085 seconds versus the Iphone's 2.024 seconds.""<p>I don't think for a moment that the difference in load times for mobile-friendly sites (about 3%) is significant, given the errors inherent in such a test, and the results for non-optimized sites clearly show that there is a lot of merit to Android's browser stack. Rather, I bring this up because I think it reflects on Apple's design philosophy as compared with Google's. Whereas Apple designs for their ideal of what the Web should be, Google designs for the Web that actually exists. One could argue that Apple's approach is better in the long-term, but I don't think that I agree. They've taken a lot of liberties with the idea of a web standard, after all, and seem to be banking on their market power to ensure that their technical strategy works. On the other hand, Google's approach is more developer friendly, I think, in that it treats standards as tools which may or may not be employed by individual web development teams.<p>Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but all the same, I do think there's some room for very interesting analysis--- The Inquirer missed an opportunity here to delve deeper.

The only technology they provide her is a desktop with Windows 98.<p>So she uses her own mac to admin a tumblog filled with photos of assignments and answers to problems she uploads from her iphone. She uploads PDF's to google docs and 'shares with everyone'. She links to Khan academy videos since the school bans youtube and none of the district computers support flash.<p>Then her students use their home computers (if they have them) to consume this content. They're excited about it (most never heard of Khan before this) and it seems to be effective.<p>Back in the late 90's IBM installed a token-ring network at my high school. It was obsolete before they finished the project and the computers we had could barely get IE3 to load a web page.<p>So I hope this incubator does a lot not just to foster edu focused startups but to also get the right people in education to push for decent technology at schools.",1300420899
