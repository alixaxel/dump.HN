By making different design choices, it would have been perfectly feasible to not allow null objects in the language at all, but rather make some sort of nullable/maybe/optional type there is in many other languages. After all, a program that crashes with a null pointer exception is not much better than one that crashes with a segfault.",1300967900

The more you know, the more deeply you know them, the better.<p>Here's a random example: Marsden and Weinstein define derivatives in their out-of-print textbook Calculus Unlimited without limits. The tangent to a graph at the point x is the boundary between two line pencils, one of lines entering the epigraph at x, the other of lines leaving. There's no limit-taking of chords. It's a simple and neat definition that connects with classical notions of tangency.<p>In his essay On Proof and Progress in Mathematics, Thurston lists a dozen other definitions or conceptions of derivatives in his personal arsenal, some very sophisticated. But even those among his definitions that are elementary and have roughly the same scope there is a difference in their psychological affordances, and that can make all the difference.",1300966978

2363575,comment,2362207,2362418,0,0,tytso,,,"It really depends on what project you're working on at Google.  Some are so secret you can't even reveal their name, or even what general area that they are in.   Others are done completely in the open.   For example, if you work on Chrome or Chrome OS, most of what people work on is available in public repositories.<p>I work on the production kernel for our data centers, and most of what I do is completely public.   In fact at the moment I am working on a way to decrease seek overhead when writing large files to ext4, and I have been releasing the in-progress patchsets for review and comment both in and outside Google.   Why?  Because I've gotten some really valuable comments both at the design level, and ""spot the stupid bug"" level, both inside and outside of Google.<p>That being said, there are some really cool things that are only available inside the Google kernel.  For example, we can track every read, write, and seek operation at the hardware level, and tell you whether it is metadata or data, what application was responsible for issuing the request, and then correlate this information across multiple machines and in fact across the entire data center, and give you a single high-level view of your map reduce, or your application homed on hundreds of machines, so you can see how it is actually using all of the disk spindles associated with that job.  And its overhead is small enough that we can leave it running by default, as opposed to only turning it on during debugging/benchmarking runs (ala blktrace).<p>Why haven't we shared this with the external world?  Well, part of it is because it depends on infrastructure which is Google-specific, but the main reason is because we can't find the right people to help us clean up the code so it would be mainline acceptable, disentangle the Google-specific enhancements, negotiate with the upstream Linux kernel maintainers whose subsystems are touched by this code, and get it into mainline kernel.   And for most of these kernel enhancements (of which this is only one), we _want_ to get them upstream, because every single one of these enhancements (while they are really cool and there is no way we would give them up), makes it harder for us to rebase the kernel so we can get the latest enhancements from upstream.   More people using it means we hopefully will get a community of people collaborating to make the technology better --- which means free engineering help for us!  :-)<p>The problem is headcount; we need to staff up this and other projects before we can do things like push more of these Google-specific enhancements upstream to the Linux kernel.  (Some of it is happening now, slowly, but we have lots of other production and release priorities which take precedence.)  Unfortunately, it's really hard to find Systems People who are interested and willing to do low-level Linux kernel programming, and can also see the ""big picture"" systems issues.<p>So if you think you're a hotshot Systems designer who is not afraid to get their fingers dirty coding low-level Linux kernel code, we're hiring (and not just in storage, although that's my area; contact me).  And if you come to work at Google, you may be surprised at how much you can talk to your friends about, and even publish as a paper at a conference.  Yes, there is plenty of stuff about features under development in Google Docs, Search, Android, that you'll be able to play with as an early dogfooder, and that stuff you won't be able to share with your friends.  And some stuff we can't share because it would harm our relationship with our hardware partners --- but even there, Google has published a paper at FAST describing the failure rate and patterns of hard drives (although we anonymized the specific names of the disk drive manufacturers involved, for obvious reasons).<p>I'm surprised people think this is such a big deal, actually, because invariably there is some stuff that you have to keep secret at all companies.  I found that there was more stuff related to my day-to-day work which I had to keep quiet at my former employer, IBM, than I am here at Google.

Wrote it all up on the blog, but here is what I think they have wrong and our Pixamid has right:<p>Privacy: I think most people want to more privacy on their photos, not less. If the camera can sense who you are with (like Pixamid and Color try), by default, share ONLY with those people. By default, Pixamid shares with only your friends at he same place as you - you can choose to share with everyone there too.<p>Network Effects:  Color™ might be cool in a world where everyone uses Color™. But we don’t see such a world anytime soon. People will use lots of different apps: Instagram, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, Picasa -hell, even Ofoto (thanks Mom). We want to pull in your friends’ photos from any of these services, automatically as much as possible. See our post below about the Instagram magic we do; we’re dong a lot more of this cool stuff now.<p>Addressing a real problem: We are all taking more photos with our great phone cameras. But we hate to organize our photos. And if we add in Friend photos, it is even worse. Users of Pixamid get automagical photo organization as a byproduct of using the app. Each set of photos, with place, event, and who you were with. The things we will do with this in the future - can’t wait to show everyone! But we believe that our solution will revolutionize how people share photos online.<p><a href=""http://blog.pixamid.com/post/4060807527/the-color-tm-challenge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pixamid.com/post/4060807527/the-color-tm-challen...</a>",1300965255

To have reliable estimation, you need larger order n in n-gram, but it also increases the size of the model which requires larger amount of data and storage. Thanks to the Web as a corpus and cloud computing, we now have upto 5-gram models computable on Terabytes of data provided you are resourceful. One problem with this approach is the selection of the web data to be used for training. The better adaption to the target scenario, the better accuracy.<p><pre><code>  i see no services that make use of this.\n</code></pre>\nMost services have proprietary implementations of spell correction that is an amalgamation of several techniques including n-grams, and they might not like to make it public.",1300965233

In fact part of the appeal of the system is that it gets round many of these problems.<p>- Am currently in discussion with some much larger established companies re licencing and distribution (one in London, one in Boston). They both love the product but are moving very slowly. I want to have a separate distribution channel as it's not clear at present which is going to succeed. However, having a distributor would certainly be easier than flying Australia-US each time a sales prospect needs me there!<p>- I really like the idea of low retainer/high commission. The business model is to charge a recurring subscription, so paying a high commission based on the first year's revenue won't impact so much on future cash flow.<p>- No equity on the table until they have proved themselves! At present I own 100% of the company (bootstrapped), but would consider giving someone with complementary skills in sales a portion of this if they had proved they could boost the company's value.",1300964746
