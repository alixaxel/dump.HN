By about 8:00 pm I get pretty fatigued and I may nap for 10 minutes at this time, to recharge for the evening.<p>The work I am doing is challenging but for the moment doesn't require a lot of creativity, so the tradeoff between the sheer amount of work I can get done versus the decrease in errors is worth it to me at the moment.<p>I do exercise pretty consistently however (approx. 4 times/week for 30 to 45 minutes) and I find this invaluable in terms of keeping me less stressed and more productive.",1299714892
