The question I was curios to know is: what are you doing about protecting intellectual property for your customers in the cloud? 
Also it seems that the cloud has not yet evolved to the point to not be a single point of failure. What are the cloud computing providers doing to protect patient information such that it can't be hacked or shut down from a major terrorist attack?
There were a couple of speakers post Oracle and IBM'ers that claimed they have been doing Cloud computing for over 10-15 years. Hmm it is relatively a new advent I felt. May be they really meant we've been doing hosting and application service providing through our server technologies and software services for over 10 years and have been trying to build up a cloud computing model???

It's not the platform but the software running on it that counts. The first thing Apple did when they bought Emagic and, as a result, Logic Pro was to kill the product on Windows knowing well users would switch to OS X just to use their favourite tool (why wouldn't they given the $1200->$499 price drop and a major feature boost in Logic Studio).<p>Most musicians nowadays want more than the ability to record and play back audio tracks. What about the digital audio workstation (DAW) choice on Linux; the virtual instruments and FX plugins; MIDI editing and automation; a UI intuitive and simple enough to use at a live show etc. Good software in the creative market seems to take years to build but the user base is so loyal it takes massive effort to get users to switch. There is a reason most software used in the studio is decades old (see Cubase or Logic, for instance: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro#History</a>). There is also a reason why GarageBand had significant time dedicated to it at the iPad keynote. Musicians with computers tend to be geeks to a degree, but at the end of the day they have music to compose and perform, and the less time they have to spend on software and setting it up the better.<p>Basically, Linux not being embraced among the musicians is the same story of why you don't see very many people jump ship from Adobe Photoshop in favour of GIMP.",1300088127

So the emails you see at the bottom of the page are BofA execs asking for the removal of certain DTN records from their Databases (from what i understand DTN's are like information records). The reason they are doing that is because they are being audited, and when the auditors look up the loans that should be tied to those DTN's and find that there is no existing DTN record, they will discount it as a system error and move on.
The result of this ""deleting of DTN's"" was some $60B worth of fraud on the part of Bank Of America in order to cover up the mistakes they made during the housing crisis.<p>These emails are just the first ones released, but they are clearly TO and FROM BofA execs, asking for the deletion of DTN's from the system and even a response from one exec saying, ""Are you sure we can do this""??</i>",1300087084

A bit leisurely for the first hour, probably could've cover that in half the time, but then progressively realizes he's short on time and accelerates through the probabilistic analysis of the runtime. Still pretty easy to follow at warp speed near the end, because he is extremely clear. For instance, you can tell when he makes a simple 1/x mistake in a couple places (he catches himself), since his explanation which goes along with the calculation is crystal clear.

2321595,comment,2320391,2320620,0,0,trumbo,,,"This could be due to the strong emphasis Western culture places on ""integrity."" This term originally comes from the same Latin root as ""integer,"" which itself means ""whole, entire."" Having integrity implies that your private self and public self are one and the same.<p>Multicultural roots of Western culture may have made integrity an important signifier of  trustworthiness. Even going back to Shakespeare, you saw the theme of split identities everywhere in Western literature, and most of Shakespeare's villains are noted for their two-facedness.<p>The modern day implication of that cultural legacy is  our cult of authenticity. For a rap singer to be taken seriously by his peers, he has to be ""real."" The realness is a hard earned credibility by showing a singular identity, and not being perceived as the real thing for someone immersed in that culture would be the equivalent of ""losing face"" in Eastern cultures. Something akin to social isolation and even death.<p>Another, perhaps more relatable example, is something I often hear Americans say. It's said that in America you can be who you say you are. That is at the heart of the open society for which Americans are praised, and Americans take your word at face value, until you say or do something contrary to their expectations of your self-proclaimed ""role.""<p>So thinking over what I wrote, I think the reason why role-playing works in Japan and doesn't in America is because Americans have a culture of self-invention, a culture built on appearances, they also have a wariness about being taken in by people who change their appearances often.",1300086163
