If development patterns there were left to market forces, the coasts of Florida would not be as significantly developed.  Insurance costs would prohibit it.  But the state's insurance regulations control prices and force inland homeowners to subsidize the insurance rates of coastal homeowners.  Even worse, as insurance companies flee this distorted market, the state stepped in and now runs its own insurance company, which is building a massively underfunded risk portfolio.  Literally the state of Florida is at risk of bankruptcy if another hurricane Andrew hits.<p>Another factor is, if the storm is big enough, the feds step in with FEMA and bailout people who are underinsured.<p>People living in Florida's hurricane alley pay nowhere near the cost of the risk of living there, and the result is overbuilding, and catastrophic property losses when the big one eventually does hit.",1299880764

From what I have seen of SO, such sites have a lot of potential and perform a valuable service.

2315071,comment,2313706,2314043,0,0,nooneelse,,,"Not my field, but I'll play with some numbers on a Friday afternoon. From some googling, I'm getting an estimate of about -1dB attenuation for the fiber optic and end connectors for a meter long fiber in the near IR.  Which would give about 20% losses.<p>The linked-to gun said it did a 1MW pulse, so to match that with 20% losses you need to start with 1.25MW, giving you 0.25MW loss.  But the video doesn't state a pulse time.  You can use (<a href=""http://www.mhi-inc.com/Converter/watt_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mhi-inc.com/Converter/watt_calculator.htm</a>) to play around with times... assuming it fires for 0.001s (I would guess it is shorter than that) and all that loss shows up as heat, it would be less than a BTU, so easily cool-able.<p>Assuming your backpack could carry enough energy to have it fire at that power level for a full second, that conversion page says the waste heat from the fiber would melt a 1.6 pound block of ice.  Such a backpack would do well to have a top-loading ice reservoir.<p>However that loss percentage is probably for reasonably unbent fibers, and the whole point of the backpack-to-gun fiber is to allow bending quite a bit.  For a higher power system, I'd think it better to skip the fiber optics and instead have something like the laser turrets they put on the front of planes (<a href=""http://www.mda.mil/system/altb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mda.mil/system/altb.html</a>).  Have a small version of that come up over the wearer's shoulder, with the turret sitting in front of the user so they can aim anywhere in front of them.  Even with 8 mirrors in the path to get the business end somewhere comfortable, 98% efficient mirrors would have 15% losses.<p>I also happened upon this much lower powered backpack laser <a href=""http://www.cleanlaser.de/wEnglish/produkte/backpack.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleanlaser.de/wEnglish/produkte/backpack.php</a>, and its bigger cousin, <a href=""http://www.cleanlaser.de/wEnglish/produkte/high-power-cl-1000.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleanlaser.de/wEnglish/produkte/high-power-cl-100...</a>.",1299880413

2315056,comment,2295528,2311062,0,0,wittjeff,,,"In the early '90s when I was a usability specialist at Microsoft I did a laborious usability study (hired several temps to enter text using various methods for hours per day, over multiple days) comparing pen input vs. OSKs and got some counter-intuitive results.  Essentially OSKs are much faster than handwriting even under optimal conditions.  If it takes 10 seconds to enter a string with an OSK, it'll take ~15 seconds to write it using block letters.  That's not counting any time needed to correct errors, which will tend to make the writing input even worse.  When I asked participants after the study which method they thought was quicker, most assumed the pen-based writing was. Keep in mind that they spent 1/3 or more of their time correcting errors, so the writing may have taken twice as long as the OSK, yet they didn't perceive as such. Of course their statements could have been a demand effect, but it generally corroborates my main point.<p>I've read a pile of published usability reports on other text entry methods, such as chording keyboards, and they all show essentially the same thing. Letting fingers extend to hit a fixed close target is hard to beat, and the optimal amount of pressure needed is very small (though perhaps not zero).<p>My theory is that it takes less mental effort to write than to use an OSK, so the OSK is perceived as being slower.  With the OSK the level of mental effort is mostly high (mostly visual search), with periodic dips (hit the key).  With pen-based writing it's the opposite -- mostly automated / low-cognitive-effort behavior with periodic thinking about what to do next.<p>I read a quote from Jobs somewhere recently where he said something like, ""the problem with handwriting is that it's just so darned slow"" so that makes me think that Apple may have done a similar usability study.<p>I don't think OSKs are ideal. I'm continually impressed by the steady flow of innovations in text-input methods. But pens have their own usability baggage even outside the limitations of handwriting.",1299880156

2314941,comment,2314672,2314672,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've been a member of Quora for a while, but I never got around to participating. There was always something about it that struck me as strange.<p>I think the problem is that there is an assumption that asking a question and receiving an answer is somehow a valuable experience in itself, and for basic bits of factual information it is. But much of what constitutes ""interesting"" questions, like the one in this article, do not fit that pattern.<p>I teach teams how to be agile. For many, an honest question they have is: why do we need you? Can't we just read the book and know all we need to know?<p>It turns out the answer to that question is very interesting, because mostly no, you probably can't. At least not in the way you think. There is factual information and then there is mastery of a complex skill. I look at it this way: I can show you a movie of a great piano player, you can meet him and get his autograph, we can even read books on how to play the piano.<p>Will any of that make you a piano player? No, it will not. So when you ask a seemingly straightforward and honest question like ""How come I can't play this Bach piece?"" I'm unable to give you a straightforward answer that you are going to find helpful. It's going to sound something like ""Because you don't know what you are doing. First you must do all this other stuff"". Of course, you don't want to do all that other stuff, you want to play the Bach piece. And so there we are.<p>This touches on another problem -- not knowing what you don't know. When I learned to fly, I found a good instructor and told him about the things I would like to do.<p>""We're not doing any of that,"" he said, and then explained what we would be doing. You see, I didn't know what questions to ask first. I simply had some goal.<p>The worst problem I can see is folks getting answers they are not ready to process. For example, sticking with my agile coach example, somebody might ask me why a team takes so long trying to figure out what it's doing. The ""answer"" might be something like ""Because you've restricted their machines and tools in such a way it's taking ten times longer than it should."" but good luck in giving it to somebody in that direct a fashion. They'll throw you out of their office -- especially if they were the ones all along pushing for more controls and complexity. This is a case of wanting a solution to one thing, but having a second thing that cannot be touched. And of course, the second thing is directly involved in the first thing. In situations like this you have to help people figure out for themselves where their own internal model is flaky. Sometimes that takes a while. (Interesting side note: many technologists ardently refuse to believe they could be this way, saying things like ""just tell me bluntly"". I have found that these folks are the worst to deal with, because instead of seeing life as a journey, they are caught up in black-and-white reasoning. So they are the last people you want to treat that way, because to do so you're basically telling them their thinking is broken -- a concept many cannot process)",1299877999

""Fuck the loyalists, we're here to make some money. Getting sick of these third party tools charging coin for our damn API while we get nothing.""<p>If so, the question becomes: who creates more value on Twitter? Is it the old guard, who use it as a communications and community medium? Or is it the mainstream, following celebrities and talking about sandwiches they're eating, eyeballs to be sold to the highest bidder?<p>(edit: My hunch is that, too late, the Pareto principle will be discovered hard at work: 20% or less of Twitter users actually generate 80% of the value. I just can't see it as a bland, empty consumption tool. There's surely peril in optimizing toward that.)<p>It sounds to me like Twitter wants to round up its user-cattle and drive them on down to monetization gulch. Anyone who gets in the way of this is going to be flattened.",1299877482

2314893,comment,2314453,2314453,0,0,tytso,,,"The key problem is that the desktop community desperately needs one or more architects who can act as a sheepdog and keep the sheep marching in roughly the same direction.<p>It's far more critical in the Desktop world than in the Linux kernel because in the kernel, there is enough development in the kernel that there is strong incentive to develop in the upstream sources, and not behind distribution-specific source trees.  In addition, the Linux kernel releases on a regular 3 month cycle.  So even if we don't have formal design documents, it's a lot easier for collaboration between key kernel subsystem developers, because our patches have to come together and _work_ every three months when we push out a release.  (In practice, they had better mostly work by the end of the two week merge window, or there will be hell to pay, and Linus, as the great benevolent dictator, will yell at people, and Make a Decision --- which will usually involve reverting the change which broke things functionally.)<p>In contrast, the Desktop world has a much harder problem, because (a) not everything lives in one source tree, (b) the kernel largely doesn't have a UI, and there are objective measures of ""does it work"", and ""did the benchmark results go up or down"", that either don't exist or aren't as important in the UI world.   Questions of whether a UI is ""good"" or ""better"" than some other UI choice is a question which can't be easily answered objectively.  And that, more than any thing else, is probably why we have three major design centers for desktop development: GNOME, KDE, and Canonical.<p>One of the things that worries me is that all too often, people look at the way things are done in the Linux kernel, and assume that it will port over to their project.  In most cases, the Linux kernel is a much larger and more complex project, and things which we do in the Linux kernel world probably aren't needed in other projects.  But in the Desktop world, I think the reverse problem is true.  It's a much larger and more complicated ecosystem than what we have in the Linux kernel, and so decisions such as allowing the major subsystem developers to negotiate major technical changes organically and informally might work for Linux, but not in the desktop world.  (For example, in the storage stack, there are less than a half-dozen people I would need to consult with in order to come consensus about some change to accomodate PCI-attached flash, and we have multiple opportunities a year to get together and work things out).  Hence in the desktop world, hiring a full-time architect who did nothing else but talk to the different stakeholders and try to come to consensus on a common vision is probably something which is necessary, even though we haven't found the need to have someone in that role in the Linux development community.",1299877409

The user experience is not all in their hands, and isn't it ironic that this comes a week after the ""dickbar"" incident? Twitter hasn't really proven they can keep the user experience the way it should be. There was a post last week here on HN about how Tweetie used to never crash and the lastest release was awful...

Some of these may have sold fairly well, but the titles are ignored today so they couldn't have been all that good.<p>Pokemon developer Game Freak seems to have had it pretty rough prior to hitting the big time with Pokemon. The company has existed since 1989 and they put out a number of relatively unknown games before Pokemon in '96. Pokemon wasn't a strong seller at the beginning either.<p>According to wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Tajiri"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Tajiri</a>):
""Pokémon Red and Green took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely enough money to pay the employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.""",1299877351
