I know you don't want to limit the use of your site, but it would be helpful if the writing was more specific and exciting and the video was focused less on explanation and more on fun useful actions users are actually going to take on your site.<p>You start off talking about content creators (like it's a tool for blog authors) and then you describe it's use for blog/content readers. That's confusing.<p>1. In your example of how to use it, you start off talking about a ""conversation"" (a little vague - I wouldn't know where to find a conversation on the web) and you start to list other uses for it before I understand the initial use for it.<p>2. You suggested people ""filter content by calculating influence"". That's too abstract. I think you meant ""follow popular and interesting users and vote for the best comments.""<p>I think more exciting language that describes tangible actions users will take and pictures that are not flat screenshots of text will improve your conversion rate.",1299801591

Is it looking for bigrams and trigrams to determine tags? If so 140 characters might not yield you much useful data. If not, could you explain it a little more?""<p>Great question! Twitter's hashtags, as far as I can, see are a great idea but in most part under or misused.<p>For example, in the stream that I receive, just looking at the first 25 tweets there were a total of 2 hashtags, #email (which is useless) and #SXSW. I would have more luck searching for ""#imjustsaying"" than if I searched for something like ""#programming #rrails"". Plus the limit that 140 characters means in many cases there just isn't room for a descriptive set of hashtags, and do I really want to only be able to classify information based solely on the author's suggestion.<p>I totally agree that looking for bigrams and trigrams in such a limited set of data would not be very helpful.<p>So what I thought, and what is the idea behind tags4.me, is that having read the data and followed any linked information I am the best person to classify the information in a way that is meaningful to me.<p>For example the actual reason I created this is that a little while ago I remembered that I had seen a really good startup a month or so prior float past in my stream. I checked it out at the time and thought, ""gee I must remember that and tell ___"". Well of course a month pasted, I saw the person and couldn't for the life of me remember it, what the site did, and I couldn't find it after searching twitter. Hell I didn't even know what to search for.<p>Now if I had been able to classify that in a way that meant something to me, for example with the tags ""Startup, Programming, Development, Analytics, Awesome"". With my site it takes like 2 seconds and at anytime in the future I could enter any combination of those tags and see that tweet again.<p>I just thought that it might be a useful tool, and having followed HN and YC for a little while, thought I would love to get some feedback from the community.",1299800885

We are less fascinated with other people and more willing to be alone, or perhaps with a completely logical slave machine for company.<p>The desire to fit in and conform does not develop in the normal way, because we're not aware until later than neurotypical people of what other people are thinking and we never care about it quite so much. Normal children are obsessed with finding peer approval and young hackers stare in amazement.<p>I failed to grasp the basic mechanics of marketing until a kind MBA recommended ""Crossing the Chasm"" by Geoff Moore, after I had told him I didn't really see the use of sales and marketing. One of the ideas in the book is the need for marketers to convince different market segments that this product is suitable for them. A huge part of that is convincing them that they are not alone, that the product has already sold to a lot of other people and that they are not going to be doing something risky and independent by buying it.<p>This herd mentality, which dominates mass market sales, had not really figured in my earlier understanding because I am not in that same category. I'm in Moore's ""innovators"" category. It doesn't matter a bit to me whether anyone I know of has chosen some product or idea.<p>So I think many hackers have a poor grasp of marketing because it doesn't really work on them and they don't know how unusual that is.",1299800321
