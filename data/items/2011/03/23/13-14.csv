They're often an early-adopter circle-jerk and unless your customers are early adopters, you get diminishing returns on such things.<p>You need to build up a network, and so getting out and pitching to folks is a necessity early on, but remember that networking events are mostly just practice for pitching to the people who actually matter.<p>I'd suggest also that a lot of people are convinced that their target customers are early adopters because it's easier to imagine that their customers are like themselves.  This is often wrong, sometimes dangerously so.  Do some soul-searching (Are these <i>really</i> the people that are most likely to give us money?  Do they even <i>have</i> any money?

For example, Fowler says that using mocks ties the test to the implementation. I don't see how stubs are much different - you test the state of the stub, and this requires knowledge of how the implementation will use the stub. Any internal interaction testing will be tied to the implementation by its very nature.<p>I suppose the argument is that mocks can be even more coupled to the implementation by using expectation matchers. I find this is a bit disingenuous though - any decent mocking framework will make these matchers optional. But when you really need to test that specific interaction, it can be very handy.<p>So perhaps ""mocks aren't stubs"", but I would say a stub is a mock - just a dumber one.",1300888713

2359336,comment,2358467,2358467,0,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1.As a general rule, founders like notes and investors do not. The reason notes are more often used today than before is one of power and control. Founders today have more bargaining power and can insist on going with notes. Investors may not like this but, if they like a company and want to invest, that is their option. This reflects a longer-term trend by which quality startups have become easier to launch with comparatively smaller capital needs, and this has enabled founders to keep more control through the early stages of a company's growth. I believe this trend is becoming permanent, which is one of the reasons for pg's observations about the predominance of notes in today's climate.<p>2. Building a startup is a teaming effort and the ideal cases consist of founders and investors who work together to build a great company while keeping their interests aligned. But this point only goes so far. Just ask any desperate founder who is under a cash crunch how much investors are prepared to give their cash on founder-friendly terms in the name of ""alignment of interests."" At a basic level, the issue with funding centers about power and control. Founders use notes because they can, and investors allow it because they have no choice if they want to invest.<p>3. The main advantage with notes is that they come with few strings. Once you set up preferred stock, investors become a dominant (even if not controlling) force within the company. Many things that you once had freedom to do you are no longer free to do without investor consent, and that includes choices about future funding. In addition, with notes, you don't have to reprice your stock price or fool with such things as 409A valuations too early in the company's history. With equity, you inject added costs and complications, and many founders want to avoid that in the very early stages. Such things tend to be distracting and tend to put more emphasis on fund raising as a process than would otherwise be the case. Again, just ask the YC companies who are getting the $150K notes with almost no strings attached. The main benefit: it lets them concentrate up front more on building their products than if they had to hustle up survival money right up front.<p>Bottom line: most founders will go with notes when they can because of power and control and intangible factors such as alignment of interests with investors, the educational value of learning to manage a board, etc. will not normally sway them in the other direction.<p>All that said, this is a a splendid dissection of some of the key factors affecting the use of convertible notes in early-stage funding. A very nice piece.",1300888188
2359335,comment,2359112,2359112,0,0,jballanc,,,"Well...I can't say I didn't see it coming (recent ex-Apple engineer here), and I'm happy for Bertrand, but Apple is loosing an extremely valuable asset.<p>Bertrand is a truly amazing and, I feel, wholly under-appreciated engineer and manager. He knew the technology better than pretty much anyone at Apple, and he stayed involved in all of the nitty-gritty details including participating in some of the internal engineer mailing list discussions.<p>One story I can relate that I think illustrates the point: Inside Apple there is a system to search the source code for every product they ship. The idea is that when you need to track down the definition of that primitive method that keeps crashing on you, you just go to this site, type in the function name, and get the source laid out in front of you (nicely syntax highlighted, of course). Well, one day I got the idea to use this tool to search for people, instead of functions. For a while now the policy at Apple has been that engineer's names don't go in the public headers that ship...but there's no rule about internal code that the outside world will never see. So I typed in ""Bertrand Serlet"" into the search, and the first thing that popped up?<p>malloc.c<p>Seriously! The rest of the list was equally impressive including the original implementation of NSObject, a bunch of CoreFoundation, and on, and on.

2359304,comment,2358834,2358834,0,0,corin_,,,"The company I work for has a business model based solely around advertising. It's not 100% banner advertising, we run some bespoke campaigns (e.g. microsites) and do some events, but basically everything that isn't banner advertising is available to us because of the audience we have, and because we can promote it through banner adverts.<p>A few thoughts from our experience to some of the common concerns about advertising as a revenue stream. These are all based on our specific situation, so may not be applicable to everyone.<p><pre><code>  It's too hard to make money, you need way too many users\n</code></pre>\nAll our brands are content sites, we have around 1.5m monthly uniques and 20m monthly pageviews - with around 700k registered accounts across the different sites. From this we don't have a problem making a profit.<p>We sell at decent CPM rates (as in, not crazy cheap - once we tried filling spare inventory with Google adverts, we got $70 for the impressions we could normally sell for 100x that), and we handle all sales internally, no agencies involved. For that we have one main guy, our Director of Sales, who's amazing, and then for bigger campaigns I and one other person will often get involved to help out.<p><pre><code>  Because it is so hard to sell advertising yourself, that becomes the company focus\n</code></pre>\nWe have (I <i>think</i>) ten full time employees, and a few part timers as well. Between a few people, I'd say the total amount of time spent directly on the revenue side of the business (i.e. dealing with clients, making sales, and, for the bigger campaigns, then managing those) is the equivilent to two, maybe three, people working on it full time. That leaves us with plenty of work hours between the other people to deal with the business as a whole, technical issues and, most of all, content.<p>(Side note: we're not a content farm of any sort. Our sites are all based around video games or hardware, and they all started off as small community sites that were built up to have a good following.)<p>What helps with selling our own advertisements is connections. Because of our very specific audience, we have a good selection of regular clients ranging from smaller companies like Razer and Steelseries up to Activision Blizzard, MediaCom and Dell.<p><pre><code>  Your users lose out because your focus is not on them, but on advertisers.\n  (see thenomad's comment on this thread: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2359089)\n</code></pre>\nEditorial independance is very important to us, and we do our best not to blur the line between journalism and sales. We've never, for example, asked anyone to change what they write to suit us or a client, and never even felt the need to.<p>When it comes to the idea of chosing ""how do we get more pageviews"" over ""how do we make this better"", in our experience there's little or no difference. Obviously there are ways to add more page views simply by changing the structure of the site, for example multipage articles, but we feel that, if a change like that has a negative impact on users, then they'll be put off the site, and so it won't end up actually helping our pageview figures.<p>Actually, on one site we did implement multi-page articles, but only after a couple of years of not wanting to do it - and the reason we ultimately made the change? It kept being requested by users who didn't like seeing one huge wall of text.<p>Certainly in the case of content websites, if perhaps not others, pageviews is actually a very good indication of how the user experience is. If the quality and quantity of content is rising, so will the stats we care about, so it's win/win for both us and our users.<p><i>Edit: one more.</i><p><pre><code>  Advertising is a dead model, it doesn't help anyone\n</code></pre>\nOur model isn't to keep finding new people to waste money, most of our clients have been with us for some time, and stay with us because they keep seeing a good ROI with us.<p>And at the other end, the advertisments are often useful for users to. Because of their targetted nature, a lot of adverts are for products/services that a lot of our readers are interested in. And for the times and people for whom that isn't the case, our adverts are all standard sizes, fit nicely into the pages and are perfectly easy to ignore. We don't do roadblock adverts (""sorry, you have to look at this advert and wait ten seconds before you can see our content"") or anything like that. Well, we do have some preroll adverts on videos that we serve (again, we sell them all ourselves, and use our custom video player to display them), but we keep them short and offer users the opportunity to skip right through them if they wish.",1300887737

Transposition could be done for example by writing the order of letters in a word backwards, so that word becomes drow. It is more effective to rearrange the letters in whole sentences or the whole message rather than single words.<p>If transposition was not limited to words or a certain order the number of different possibilities for rearranging a thirty five letter message rises to 50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 different distinct rearrangements making the task of working out the correct rearrangement impossible even if all the people on earth were to check a single rearrangement every minute.""<p>...notice the careful attention paid to frequency distribution analysis, which the author later claims is another output of Islamic civilisation.  Additionally, if you preserve word boundaries cryptanalysis can include word length, which makes breaking the cipher all the more easier.<p>""Substitution is the other method by the meaning of a message may be concealed...Working with the plain English alphabet, allowing the algorithm to be any arrangement of the different letter, it is possible to generate more 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 different distinct rearrangements of letters and so the same number of different ciphers, thus producing a high level of security, baring in mind that the recipient need only to keep the key safe.""<p>Besides mis-spelling bearing, how, exactly, were you planning on distributing the key again?  Is the distribution channel more secure than your allegedly secure cipher?  What happens when you re-use the key?  For the love of God...you'd have thought they didn't bother reading ""Cryptanalysis"" by Helen Gaines, if they even wanted to pretend to make an effective cipher.<p>No evidence for this, but I bet you the BA plotter was drinking the koolaid a bit too much and thought too highly of the 1400s.",1300887644

2359239,comment,2358118,2359116,0,0,jerf,,,"Real-world currencies have backing. The ability of dollars to hyperinflate or hyperdeflate is bounded by the fact they can be used to pay debts to the United States Government that are denominated in dollars. Their value recursively emanates out from there, but that's the base case. That's also why the fall of the US government would be pretty much immediately followed by the fall of dollars, as has happened to other government-backed currencies. Stripped of its backing, currencies completely collapse in practice. The recursive base case is gone and if the currency briefly holds on it's a Wile E Coyote off the cliff moment, and in the modern connected world I can't imagine it would be more than a few <i>minutes</i>.<p>At some point, BitCoin faces some dip in currency confidence. Not because it's ""BitCoin"", but because all currency face periodic confidence crises. All the major world currencies have faced them in the past three years. But they didn't simply collapse because they have backing. I don't know what stops the first BitCoin currency crisis from completely collapsing the currency, because when BitCoin holders ask themselves, ""Hey, what is this <i>really</i> good for?"", <i>I don't have an answer</i>. I know what a dollar is good for: Not being put in jail by the United States Government due to unpaid debt. Ultimately, without trying to be too philosophical, dollars are backed with men with guns (and the privilege of them not being pointed at you).<p>Contrary to apparently popular belief, currencies aren't merely arbitrarily-agreed-upon numbers that we all trade with. Every currency I know has some actual backing. Even the fancy electronic ones we've seen spontaneously develop online, they all have some form of local economy-appropriate backing. It isn't always ""gold"" (literal or electronic), but so far the ""men with guns"" approach has proved successful in the real world. BitCoin is an apparently-good design for the arbitrary number approach, but until it solves the backing problem I won't be putting one dime into it. As much as I don't particularly enjoy having the US government as my currency backing I do not see how going to a backing-free currency is the solution.<p>The currency can still hyperinflate even if it is physically impossible to produce more by virtue of people raising all BitCoin prices as their confidence in the currency collapses. But instead of hyperinflation producing lots more BitCoins, then collapsing the economy, hyperinflation will simply directly collapse the economy as it takes ever increasing amounts of the BitCoins in the world to buy a service, until eventually even every BitCoin in the world isn't adequate. Hyperinflation is a <i>symptom</i> of lack of confidence in a currency, not a <i>cause</i>. (Of course observing hyperinflation can further decrease confidence, but the hyperinflation started in the first place because of lack of confidence.)<p>BitCoin advocates tend to get very angry when I point this out. I think it's because they have no answer to this. The site <i>used</i> to have a FAQ that addressed this, but it just sort of mumbled words and now it's gone because it was actually better just to ignore the problem. My challenge would be to anyone who claims that currencies are somehow backing-free is show me the successful currency of any kind that really is just an arbitrary number with no backing that has reached any sort of significant size, shall we say, a million dollars or so worth of an economy? (All the electronic currencies like Microsoft Points are well above that size, for instance.) And I'll show the backing. It isn't always a physical item, especially in the electronic world, but it's always something that serves as a locally-appropriate backing.<p>(""So why's it worth so much now?"" It's in a bubble generated by all this publicity. What happens the first time this bubble even threatens to pop? That's when you'll really find out who is right, me or them. Oh, and I'd predict an even larger burst of publicity and public braggadocio if it looks like that's going to happen; that will be the only way to forestall the inevitable another few days.)",1300886584

Even if there's no official channel for it, that's what people <i>really</i> care about and they'll immediately recognize it as such.<p>The reason that this sort of thing is so rare, I think, is that we don't know what metrics matter until we're well past the point of applying to something.

That recess was white, but the package engineers didn't like the lack of contrast where the recess walls met the recess base, so they tooled out a small sub-millimeter section of material so it would cast a subtle drop shadow on the base.<p>That kind of attention to detail, on packaging no less, is one of the big reasons I'm a big Apple fan.",1300885690
