2358858,comment,2358834,2358834,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Good one, Jacques (assuming you're reading this)<p>People get caught up in all this ranting about MFA sites and they forget one important point: an ad is just another link as a resource that you can choose or not to put inside your content.<p>If I'm reading an article on how to carve pumpkins for Halloween, why wouldn't I want a chance to click over and see how much carving kits are at PumpkinCo? In fact, the author of the piece can make a guess as to what I might like, put some links in, then check to see if anybody is clicking them. In this way the ad is much more than a revenue generator: it's helping the content author determine what the intent of his readers are when viewing his site.<p>If I find that nobody clicks on PumpkinCo but lots of folks click on a knife shop, then I can eliminate the PumpkinCo ads, put in knife ads, and, more importantly, think about writing some more content around how to best choose a knife. After all, that's what people visiting the page are interested in. Each little change I make isn't so much focused on income as it is making the perfect experience for the person visiting my page.<p>Too often we think of web pages as something ""we do"" to the reader, as if it's some huge program that we create and the users are just little bits running around in it. (I know Jacques doesn't think this way, but some folks do). It's better to think of any sort of web content as a conversation: you do something, people come by, you measure and observe, then you respond to what they want. This is the very essence of A/B testing (which talks about this is purely analytical terms)<p>It's a damn-frustrating conversation, but in a way it's a hell of a lot cooler than email or IM. I can take a page over time and hone my message, adjust the graphics, add in ads, mix-in video, maybe add some interactivity -- all in an effort to create an extended multimedia conversation with some guy I will never meet and who may visit my site long after my death. \nTo me that's pretty cool stuff.",1300877765

2358856,comment,2357213,2358037,0,0,deadcyclo,,,"No problem with many authors, simply expire when the last author dies.<p>Corporations I sort of already said something about. However I must admit I like how things work in the Norwegian equivalent of copyright: You can transfer ""copyright"" to corporations, but if, and only if there is an employee relationship (either you are employed or working as an independent contractor). This for example means that as a student you retain full ""copyright"" to all of your work (master thesis etc.), but as a professor it can be transfered to the university.<p>In addition you always retain your ""ideal rights"" no matter what, even if the rest of the ""copyright"" is transfered to your employee. I don't think american copyright has an equivalent to this. Basically it means that no matter what you have 1) the right to be identified as the creator and 2) the right to deny derivative works to be associated to you.<p>This means that if somebody makes a movie based on your book you can say ""Hey, this movie completely misses the point, I don't want to be associated to it in any shape or form"" and the creator of the movie cannot use your name at all.<p>This does however mean that there is no such thing as public domain in Norway, since there is no way of giving up your ""ideal rights"". Even if you put something out there under terms that in the US would be public domain, you cannot give up your right to be identified as the creator or your right to not be associated with derivative works.",1300877731

2358851,comment,2358300,2358777,0,0,cop359,,,"Interesting point. However it seems like the only way to make big money on the internet is through advertisement and Google has that market locked up. Chrome is just another tool for their social data-mining. I'm sure they keep logs of what searches your IP has made (if you use Google Search), what emails you have read (if you use Gmail) and what websites you visit (through Chrome). If you sign up for any of their services then they can tie a name to an IP and then track what other computers you use (so they will know for instance that a work and home computers belong to the same person). This way they can profile people and then carefully target advertisement towards them.<p>So then they funny result is that the more people use them the better they get; and the better they get, the more people use them. It's a perpetual motion machine, they feed on their own sucess so it almost  seems impossible to catch up with them.<p>So are you saying that microsoft is trying to replicate this with the Bing, IE, Live/Hotmail ?

For years now I've been working on using the mouse less and less and the keyboard more and more up to the point now that I hardly ever use the mouse (a couple of months ago I sat down and used a public terminal for 25 minutes before I discovered that somebody had stolen the mouse).<p>Up to now I've been using conkeror for my browsing need (and w3 in the terminal when following links in email from wanderlust in emacs) since emacs is my OS of choice. However I'm now in the process of converting to chrome. I found out that with the help of some extensions and a little bit of scripting I will be able to have a chrome almost as keyboard driven as conkeror and finally be able to use some extensions I have sorely missed in conkeror (biowalled2browser, readability, etc) and that most google products work fine without having to write modes for them (nice since many of googles products are rather keyboard driven by nature)<p>Why do I do this? For one I hate wasting time, and I hate wasting screen real estate. My computer should be a tool that helps me get tings done as fast as possible, not something beautiful to look at. The more use of GUI and/or mouse the slower one works. If you can to everything from the keyboard, and _know how_ to do it from the keyboard, you can work much faster than when jumping back and forth between the keyboard and mouse or other pointing device.<p>But I take it one step further. Being all about efficiency I don't want to have to move my hands much either. I therefor strive for using and/or creating setups where ones hands never have to leave the asdf-jkl; position of the keyboard. Thus I don't use enter (C-m or C-j), I don't use arrow keys, and avoid at all cost using any keys that are not reachable without moving my hands from the home location on the keyboard.<p>To sum up: Basically I'm a keyboard and efficiency geek ;)",1300876380
