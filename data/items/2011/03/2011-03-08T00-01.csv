From what I've seen, it seems like broad career choice is also incredibly significant; and that's something rich kids often get wrong (from the perspective of an entrepreneur).  They want to have happy lives in prestigious jobs, and there lies the problem.  They want stability instead of the ability to change something.<p>Now I'm studying abroad, and have met up with a bunch of rich kids.  They all want to party.  Sure, if I get a job with them it's possible they'll do better than me.  So I won't get a job with them.<p>Let's look at the top entrepreneurs right now.  Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.

There's going to periods were you just can't be bothered or were it tires you out and the next task/step is soo complex you procrastinate for weeks, you have to identify this and the fact that it happens and push forward.<p>On thing i do, it's pretty weird, start with really small tasks and build up til' you're in a productive state. (do the dishes, reply to emails, make breakfast lol) When it comes to the hard part (opening up the code editor and getting started) what i do is kinda' go consciously unconscious, you phase out everything, the task, every thought in your head (you might even go light headed), complete yet forced zen and just start coding, when you ""regain consciousness"" you'll have already started the task and it will be less of a mountain.<p>And prioritise.<p>I'm currently at university, in my first year, working on my new start up.

If you're going to be 100% exclusively focused on women's fashion, I think you could play off the hourglass with a red dress with a hourglass figure..<p>3) I would move the price and buy now buttons up the page significantly.  I have a large monitor but on a smaller monitor, I'm pretty sure that's below the fold and people are missing the most important element.  Also, include the % discount like (75% Off!)<p>4) Way too aggressive on the registration layover.  I got it about 2-3 times while moving around.  Also, you should clean it up a lot, the graphics and text look a bit spammy.

I don't know what the target audience is but if it's upscale, I would stay away from the script font you're using on the right side banner and use the elegant font from your logo.<p>6) The box edges on both sides of the page are not aligned and the same width so it looks a bit messy.
