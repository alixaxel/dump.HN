2296217,comment,2295834,2295834,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>But the other interesting thing we’re seeing is that whereas trollish garbage used to infest the comment section, now we’re seeing almost the opposite. Many people are now leaving comments that gush about the subject of the article in an overly sycophantic way.</i><p>I've never been a TechCrunch poster, so take my comments with a grain of salt, but:  duh!  All they've done is amplify the negative consequences of unpopular posts a thousandfold, because the stigma will attach to your real-life identity instead of an easily abandoned online identity.  The mechanism they chose deters people from posting comments that might engender personal hostility.  That isn't selective at all!  Everyone feels shame when they say something wrong online and a little twinge of pain when someone attacks them; that's only human.  Trolls just feel less than others.  Crank up the pain to get rid of the trolls, and you'll get rid of a lot of other people, too.<p>Compulsively positive people, of course, are safe anywhere because they don't trigger anyone to viciously lash out in defense of their favorite technology or company, and they feel even more welcome than they are because they're blind to any subtle negativity that is directed their way.<p>There's another breed of posters who will stay, too -- professionals in whatever is being discussed.  They're used to standing behind their opinions, but more importantly, they actually benefit from the positive impression they make, because it bolsters their professional reputation.  Sure, you won't lose those guys, but why would you be surprised at losing other positive contributors?  I'm only a professional at programming, so the consequence of connecting my personal identity with my words about <i>anything else at all</i> is pure downside.<p>Let's not turn every corner of the internet back into real life.  Every time you open your mouth with a critical opinion, you run the risk of personal negative blowback.  In real life, people spend their ""negativity"" budget carefully.  I use mine up in person on personal issues and work issues.  I have no desire to blow any of it online.  The nice thing about the internet is you can shut down your defenses and relax.  We're playing with Monopoly money here, and even so it still hurts a little!  I've built up decent karma here and at other semi-anonymous sites with my only incentives being my self-respect and the meaningless little number next to my id.  The anonymity that is allowed here doesn't liberate me from my morals and my pride; it just liberates me from the constant oppressive calculation of honesty versus risk.<p>When I comment anonymously, I get a chance to clarify my ideas, express myself, and receive feedback.  (Sometimes I do this by expressing opinions I'm not sure I personally hold, and which I am not ready to personally endorse -- does that make me a troll?)  Connecting my personal identity just adds personal risk and forces me to turn on all of my social defenses.  Ugh, that's tiring and paralyzing, and it isn't conducive to clear thinking.  It makes me feel tired just thinking about it.  No thanks!",1299477395
2296216,comment,2295778,2295778,0,0,forkandwait,,,"This shouldn't surprise anybody who has lived in a small town -- when you are in a fish bowl, you manage how you present yourself differently than when you are in a big urban anonymous situation.  I choose not to live in small towns, and I choose not have a facebook persona, precisely because I don't want to have to worry this crap. (I think Facebook has already lost its mojo because of these issues, but that is another story.)<p>Regarding ""authenticity"":  please, give me a break about the ""real you"".  The part inside you that wants to rip off your clothes and tell dirty jokes is no more ""real"" than the part, also inside you, that maintains your social persona.  Without sociality -- and the maintenance of personas and ethics -- you don't exist, period.  Even the idea of ""authenticity"" is given to us, a (rather lame) invention of the 19th Century Romantics, Freud, and the 1960s.<p>(Edit: Some of the existenstialists would even go so far as to say there is no ""real you"", and that the anxiety created by this lack of anchoring is one of the most important aspects of the human condition.)",1299477386
2296215,comment,2296165,2296165,0,0,naithemilkman,,,"How about pooling together cash and hiring a freelancer to do #2 as another option.<p>Just out of curiousity, how big is your 'group' and what's the role assignment like? Who's going to be doing what? The reason I ask this is because it sounds like there might be too many 'non techies' involved in the project.  Is everyone going to learn to code?<p>From my short experience in teaching myself to code in python, there is an entire sys admin side to the equation that is often left out of conversations but is really important as well. So I think that's something you need to factor into your to-do list as well. If you're going to be learning Django, you kinda need to know Python. Otherwise the terms will just fly over your head pretty quickly and you'll be making really obvious mistakes (like not putting a comma at the end of a tuple). So having kind of walked this path already, I recommend doing a 101 on Python to begin with (its not that hard to get the basics down). You might find my blogpost on this useful: <a href=""http://pragmaticstartup.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/how-i-am-learning-python-from-scratch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragmaticstartup.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/how-i-am-le...</a><p>If you do not want to bother yourself too much with sys admin, you probably want to consider hosting your mvp on Google App Engine (GAE) to begin with. But having said that, I don't think there have been many startups who have gone down this route in the mid-long term. The general consensus from what I have read seems to be to use GAE to host weekend projects and then migrate away once you decide to take your project more seriously.",1299477370

That aside, i dislike the notion that the internet is somehow a separate kind of space from the other sorts of social interaction we engage in.  There are people who masquerade and are different people IRL just as well as there are online.  There are some differences, the sort of transformation and context switch necessary to go between identities/facets is different certainly.  But that doesn't change the cognitive/emotional reality.<p>Besides, who's to say that internet trolls aren't a real part of a lot of people's identities? (I think this is where we agree) Facebook commenting may add a component of IRL social decorum, but imo that has less to do with notions of the self, as just trying not to piss off people who have social currency in your life.",1299475868

Quirky, unique games and games that are very difficult just don't sell as well.  I think it was in GameFan (RIP) that I read the quote that summed it up:  ""The hard-core are never catered to.""<p>Game companies started to broaden their reach, to expand their demographic.  The same is happening with Facebook.  I watched my mother play game after game of Bejeweled.  Facebook's reach is huge, well beyond the demographic usually thought of as gamers, that 18-35 male collective cash cow.  I'm not on Facebook, but my mother is, my aunt is, the sort of person that kinda likes clicking cows.  Zynga's games are close to their tolerance:  easy, always there, not too deep.  The gaming equivalent of a Will Smith summer blockbuster, the type that upsets the people that really love movies.  A McDonald's burger, a Mariah Carey song, Marlboro Lights, Windows XP, Zynga: the suburbs of their industry. It may not be loved by critics, but damned if you can't make more money selling to a broader demographic than to a smaller group of devoted genre fans.<p>So, on a much larger scale, we're seeing the games market broaden and develop, the same way that we saw it happen 10 or 15 years ago.  There's hope for the future:  you can still get rich making an iPhone/Android $2 game or a Minecraft, so we still have some sort of vibrance, sparks flying from the souls of the passionate and creative.  But the way things are, there's more money in Farmville.  I've stopped being angsty and dropped my elitism:  you can't fight basic laws of commerce or Sturgeon's Law (""90% of everything is crap"").<p>I value my time, so I don't play social games (unless you count GitHub), but the customers have indeed decided what they want, or at least what they'll pay for.<p>...Where's my copy of Ninja Gaiden?
