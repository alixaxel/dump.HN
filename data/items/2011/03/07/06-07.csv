2296315,comment,2295813,2296129,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't really understand your comment.<p>No one's saying that IPC is unique to Node. The OP's criticism was: async i/o is fine, but what if you have some CPU-intensive work to do? Isn't it bad to let that block the whole server? Of course it is. OP's answer is a different server architecture; Nodians' answer is just forward that work to a different process and let Node keep doing the one thing it does well.<p>Why use Node? Isn't the reason that it lets you write server apps that don't block on i/o, in a high-level language?<p>From various comments over the last year or so, I gather that you're saying Erlang beats Node hands down at this. That may be true. Still, not everyone's going to use Erlang. What other alternatives are there? (Twisted, EventMachine, ...?)<p>I can see the attraction of Node's approach. First, it's conceptually simple. Second, yes, it shoves a bunch of things in your face and makes you deal with them - but they are precisely the things that make your program slow. Perhaps you <i>want</i> to deal with them. I can understand why someone would say: I want to manage my program's control flow explicitly so I know it won't block when it shouldn't; it makes some things annoying, but other things easier (at least I don't have to worry about other code interrupting mine); just don't make me write everything in C.<p>(At risk of being tedious, I'll add that I'm not being polemical. You, silentb and others know a lot more about it than I do. I'd like to get clearer about what the issues are. Also... I'm tempted to reply to the second part -- about writing programs that know how to divide up their computations, and whether this is greenspunning the OS -- but this is long.

I don't dispute that a very nice app could be created, but I question whether the iPad itself enables any of those things.<p>Further, a finger is a very imprecise input device.  For music, precision is very important.  Even a mouse is not precise enough for lots of things I do when I use DAW software.<p>Music notation is one place where I think pen-based input would be useful.  It's precise and the input language is tightly scoped enough that the recognition problem is solvable.  There's also no existing system that lets you input musical notes in any faster way.  Recording-based apps (midi or otherwise) are always at the mercy of the performer.  And unless you're superhuman (I'm not), you have to spend a long time quantizing and correcting the transcribed rhythm.  It's real bummer.

You don't have to like that bar and most people certainly don't but does it affect your twitter experience in such a bad way that those one star ratings are justified.
