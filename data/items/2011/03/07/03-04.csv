I was recently offered a Tech Intern from Goldman. As it was the only good option I had at that time, I decided to go for it. Working there was a great experience and definitely learned a lot about financial markets. My main goal going there was to understand the inner workings of such a big Investment Bank. I grabbed a lot about that.<p>Working there was good, but throughout my work I had confusion regarding these:\n1. People were way too professional.\n2. I was tightly following what Goldman had done during recession. I felt it was ethically wrong (watch ""Inside Job""). Result, I was not able to feel myself as a part of Company.\n3. There were too much restrictions on employees. Surveillances were running on our accounts. Everything was tracked etc. etc.<p>On other side I must say that their technology was great. The size of data they process everyday is marvelous. But finally, after a lot of thought I rejected the final offer from their side. Right now I am working in a big company, with relatively less compensation. I am happy with my current job.<p>I still stand on my decision. Just want to know your opinion about the same. Was I too childish raising above questions in my mind?",1299470172

They would be completely unable to offer subscriptions, they would have access to the functionality only. Any monetary exchange would be independent of them.<p>Then the app they create would have access to the paid sections of the API only for users that upgrade on the website. They cannot charge, so they cannot be obliged to make in-app payments available. They might even be able to redirect users to your website to pay without violating terms.<p>And it seems like Apple couldn't work around this without restricting a number of third-party apps.<p>The downside, of course, would be that you cannot put your own app in the app store.<p>While Apple is surely within its rights to take commissions from in-app sales, I suppose developers are also within their rights to find solutions like this (if it is viable).",1299469866

Figure out how to run it manually first.<p>Staging isn't so important at this point.  Staging is generally most useful when you are showing a working version of what you are building to a client (or anyone who might need to see it) while you are still in development.  In this case, your code is always changing and you are regularly breaking things.  If someone needs to look at what you are doing then you need a stable snapshot setup for them.  This is especially important when you have multiple developers because you don't know what the other guy is doing.  The end game is that your code has gone live and the ""client"" is your actual customers.  This is where being able to push your code to a staging server is critical.  You need to be able to ""user test"" it before going live.",1299467651
