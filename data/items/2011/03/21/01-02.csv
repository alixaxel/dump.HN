The technologies existed as separate entities - you post your thoughts on your own page - you use a separate tool to read an aggregated list of other's thoughts. Twitter combined the two into a dead simple interface.<p>The 140 character limit - initially an artifact left over from the days when sms was the primary means of using it - is now more of a practicality issue.<p>You can't show a steady stream of other's thoughts if they all extend to multiple pages.",1300672639

Lisp is not used for this purpose by widely used production systems. (3) Game playing, e.g. chess programs. Lisp is not used for this purpose by widely-used, superior chess programs such as Fritz.<p>Lisp was invented and developed by US AI labs in the 1960's in order to rapidly prototype symbolic logic programs in which the native Lisp data structures fit the level of symbolic abstraction required - e.g. English words could be symbols in a list, logic formulas could be easily represented as lists of operators and operands.<p>But for production programs, the software engineering advantages of static typed languages and a wide variety of third-party libraries, means that Lisp is not even considered for large modern systems that perform AI tasks.",1300672220

It is a reasonable assumption to come to, but I have to admit: I suspect its wrong. I don't think the primary reason why most ""normal"" people use Twitter is to share news links. I think Dave Winer uses it that way, but I feel like he has a tendency to assume that <i>his</i> way is the <i>only</i> way. It isn't.<p>I also understand Winer's objection to the 140-character limit. I really do. I personally think that it breaks Twitter for me and others who primarily access it via the web or the data connection on our smartphones.<p>However, I don't think Winer understands that for people who <i>don't</i> access Twitter in this way, anything more that 140 characters <i>completely breaks</i> the service. My wife used to have a ""dumb"" phone and thus access Twitter entirely through SMS. Had the service broken the 140-character limit, she would not have been able to use it.<p>I don't know how many people use Twitter in this manner. I don't know if anyone but Twitter does. I suspect, though, that Twitter doesn't change this because they <i>know</i> it will negatively impact enough of their userbase that it isn't worth dealing with.",1300672019

It's just a matter of different focus or emphasis.<p>So, you could very well be an extrovert and be a loner.
