Therefore somehow science is a kind of foundation.<p>In reality the relation is quiet symbiotic... Both fields depend on each other and stretch human ingenuity to the limits.<p>Engineers and inventors start applying knowledge way before scientists understand how things work.\n1) Edison did not keep reading journals about photons, electrons, chemistry of filaments and so on... he starts off with what he knows and uses clever strategies(sometimes even brute force or groping in the dark) to minimize the effect of the unknowns.\n2) The wright brothers did not wait for the emergence of the theory of fluid dynamics to make plane fly... they observed birds and kites and what not. Created a wind tunnel using tools they could easily afford, and basically figured out how to iterate like crazy... something like what a modern startup would.",1299383915

I finally came up with a feature enhancement I'd like it to have today, after using it for five years with no complaints or wants -- and that enhancement is really just an improvement of an existing feature.<p>More to the point, it's an enhancement that <i>no</i> window manager has, so I'm likely to need to write the code for this feature enhancement myself if I want it badly enough.  I may pick up maintainership for the project to do just that.<p>Think about that a moment: one feature enhancement requested in have a decade, merely an extension of an already existing feature, and it's something entirely new to window managers as far as I'm aware.

Of course, there was a statistics lesson at the end to be learned from it.<p>Even though it appears to be that you both have an equal chance to win (both of you have 33%), why would someone offer you an equal game unless he had some sort of advantage that you aren't aware of?<p>The trick was to look at the opponents hand while it was still going down. If you're throwing rock or scissors, your hand will be clenched the whole way down. If you were throwing paper, you will probably open your hand halfway down your throw.<p>So when he sees you opening your hand, midway he will change his to scissors. And if it doesn't stay open, then he will use rock, since between rock and scissors, rock will either win or tie. It required a bit of hand dexterity, but he practiced wing-chun, so it wouldn't have been a problem for him.

""Classical liberalism"" [1] basically won, but it won a long time ago. If you stick to ""classical liberalism"" you're basically being a conservative in the stick-to-the-old-stuff-that-works sense. (Because you should never use the words ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" without being clear about exactly which meaning you are using. Leave them adrift and they are worthless.) What we call liberals today is not where the term started; call it ""progressivism"" if you like. But absolutely there is a way in which an older meaning of ""liberal"" matches up with the modern meaning of ""conservative"", without contradiction.<p>I wouldn't say it is correct to say conservatives have ""claimed"" liberal ideas; conservatives are (broadly) the ones who, for better or worse, never let go of them in their classical liberal form, while the term ""liberal"" moved on over the years and turned into something totally unrecognizable by the original meaning of the term. (I do not mean that as any sort of moral judgment. It is simply an observation that language shifts over time.)<p>[1]: In this sense: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberal</a>",1299383036

There has been a growth in knowledge based jobs precisely because of growth in population plus growth in productivity in the output of manual labor jobs. In a world where production costs are near zero because its fully automated, there is still the built-in costs of the materials themselves. This puts a cap at how cheap a product can become.

Perhaps we could call it an increased democratization of open source.<p>Sourceforge is centered around projects. You have to register and get approval for each project separately (at least you did a few years ago, it has been a long time since I last went through the exercise). This left a significant percentage of projects with descriptions of the author's intent, but no actual code. It also meant that any third party contributions had to go back through the author (who might have lost interest).<p>I have never seen a project on github with no code. There is no approval process. You simply push and you are up and running. Forking allows others to start contributing right away without any action from the original author (and github really encourages you to fork projects).

2293341,comment,2293202,2293299,0,0,arkitaip,,,"GitHub has managed to take advantage of the Git hype and make code social in a way that SF or Google Code never could. Today's SF, although powering lots of high profile floss projects, feels increasingly dated with its traditional developer-user model. Google Code is arguably even less social and definitely lacking in features. GitHub, finally, looks great, is easy to use and has a lot of small yet very neat features that making coding easier.",1299380870

It will be some other product feature, like weight, or battery life, or cost, that will be the axis that you see competition focused on.<p>Marketing folks would love to have consumer focus on a metrics like performance that constantly keeps growing and outdating old products. Other metrics, like price and customer experience, are often just as important to buyers.<p>To give a parallel example, I don't think most HDTV owners are going to replace their set at this point for higher resolution. If you have 720 you probably don't care all that much about 1080 unless you're an AV geek. So that market is now competing on two other axes: cost (how cheap can you get it for a given size) and they're also pushing 3D.",1299380721

You need to signal to employers that you're worth hiring; ""Hire me, I'm desperate and barely competent"" doesn't really push that message.<p>- What's ""real"" job experience? Did you write code for 6 years, or not?<p>- I'm out of touch with what junior engineers get paid (hopefully it's less than $100k), but I'm guessing your friends have accumulated track records over the past few years and are in mid- to senior-level positions. I don't think you're likely to get one of those given your history (to say nothing of your self-presentation). If that's been your target, maybe aim a little lower, at junior-level jobs? Still difficult since there are so many junior engineers.<p>- What everyone else said.<p>When presenting yourself as someone of value, remember that it doesn't matter if <i>you</i> believe it.
