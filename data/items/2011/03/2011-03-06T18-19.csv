Because the demand is much higher! So, despite the INS's dickitude and the so-called ""broken"" immigration policies, MORE people are wanting to come here.<p>>You need to comprehend before responding. The immigration system was as broken 20 years ago as it is today. During boom times it's broken; during bust times it is broken. During the dot-com boom, it was broken, and yet the dot-com boom still happened. It is a constant; you just route around it.<p>Were startups so easy to found 20 years ago? Were there mobile apps that one can develop in part time?<p>Vivek is trying to lobby for a better future. Just because people used to walk uphill both ways in snow to school in the past then doesn't mean you shouldn't try to fix it atleast now.",1299437927

I am a registered republican, highly educated, and have founded 2 successful companies in Silicon Valley, and now a third in Vienna, Austria. Our family left the United States 9 years ago. We will not return until the US is once again a land of opportunity.<p>I am a proud American. I am proud of my country,and it's citizens. I am not proud of the kleptocracy that the State and Federal governments have become. I saw the financial industry collapse and ""great recession"" as inevitable back in 2002 when we left.<p>Yes the immigration system in Austria is highly dysfunctional and just as self defeating to entrepreneurs as in America.<p>Attractions:<p>Austria has a highly effective social welfare system, social health insurance system, career training, apprenticeships, and no cost higher educational system. As a direct result, Viennese society is one of the safest on the face of the earth. Kindergarten children take the subway and streetcars to school by themselves.<p>The European Union actively funds ""open source development"", and requires much of its research to be made open source.
Software patents in Europe, which exist, are unenforceable.
The US government sells its research to the highest bidder, depriving its citizens of its use. Europe believes in returning its research to its citizens use.<p>Austria, Germany Switzerland, and France are growing rapidly, and have record low unemployment rates. Austria is currently at 4.6 percent.<p>Vienna has been the top Mercer world city for 2 years in a row. A very trusting society, papers are placed in plastic satchels, with a coin box attached. The subway and train systems have no entry / exit barriers or gates. A simple ticket stamping machine sits on a post. In a highly trusting society, there is no need for steel newspaper boxes or oppressive barriers.<p>Austrian's are protected by law from overwork, and as a result, are very healthy, utilizing far less heathcare services than the typical American.<p>Austria, Germany, and France are the best countries for an American to emigrate to.<p>Vivek Wadhwa fails to realize that immigrant founders actually deprive Americans of key jobs. Founders jobs. Immigrants are the only people desperate enough to accept the immoral yet legal terms offered by many Vulture Capitalists. A legal form of slavery. Nothing else explains the high percentage of immigrant founders adequately. I was witness to several immigrants having lost control of their own companies just as they became profitable.<p>The US must actively recruit each and every foreign born entrepreneur, engineer and scientist they can find, in order to grow the economy to at least 7 percent a year, or it will be bankrupt before 2025.<p>By throwing wide the doors to foreign immigration, the Vulture Capitalists would be unable to exploit foreign immigrants. The playing field for both immigrant and US citizen would be equal. The US would, within a few years, drastically reverse its trade deficit to a significant surplus. Just as Austria, Germany, and France currently enjoy.<p>I don't see that happening, and so the US government will be deprived of vital tax revenue from the next great technological advance. US corporations have parked 2 trillion dollars of profits overseas, to avoid paying US taxes.<p>I highly recommend US citizens act with haste to emigrate to a new home in either Europe or Asia before the Hobsian society arrives in force, resulting in an exodus tidal wave of Americans.",1299437427

Currently most of them are regulated by the FCC, but when payments start showing up on phone bills the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department start getting curious. This leads to two dynamics that are bad for everyone: delay between each carrier and the government, and delay between each agency within the government as they fight out who gets to be in charge.",1299437365

2294704,comment,2294441,2294553,0,0,cletus,,,"It seems that no one is interested in the model where subscribers pay for no ads. Look at Hulu. You can buy Hulu Plus and... still get ads. If Hulu Plus was ad free I would sign up immediately.<p>So why is that? There are several potential reasons:<p>1. Those providing such services like advertising or, rather, they like the relationships they have with advertisers. Consider [1] (second time quoted this today!):<p>> Since the carriers had all the power, getting any distribution (which usually meant getting on the handset “deck”) meant doing a business development deal with the carriers. Business development in this case meant finding the right people at those companies, sending them iPods, taking them to baseball games, and basically figuring out ways to convince them to work with you instead of the 5,000 other people sending them iPods and baseball tickets.  The basis of competition was salesmanship and capital, not innovation or quality.<p>Companies, and particularly sales guys, like having something to sell (being ad inventory). They like the perks this gets them (and the commissions of course).<p>2. Subscribers aren't willing to pay what the advertising brings in. I'm curious about this but haven't seen any numbers. Take an episode of The Big Bang Theory. How much does each episode cost to produce? How much does each ad bring in? How much does the national network earn in affiliate fees? How much of the advertising revenue is product placement? If you had these numbers, you could calculate what each viewer is worth. I suspect it's a lot less than what such companies charge on iTunes and elsewhere;<p>3. A correlation between the people willing to pay for no ads and being the target of those ads, which means if you're willing to pay for no ads, you need to pay higher than what ad revenue / viewers might otherwise suggest; and<p>4. Lack of metrics in broadcast and print media. Sales guys are known to exaggerate (and basically just make up) conversion numbers on ad campaigns. The reality I'm sure is a lot less but there's no real way to tell. With online advertising, you can tell, which possibly explains it's lower cost/value compared to traditional advertising;<p>5. Related to (4), people pay for broadcast and print advertising what they do, largely because that's what it's always cost; and<p>6. Limited inventory drives up the cost. Inventory is not a problem online.<p>As for Twitter, I suspect they haven't done anything interesting with advertising (and monetization) because that's a hard problem to solve. I mean, people need to see ads for them to be ads right? At that point, how exactly are you going to advertise to people who mostly use an API, other than through their Twitter stream?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://cdixon.org/2010/06/06/steve-jobs-single-handedly-restructured-the-mobile-industry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2010/06/06/steve-jobs-single-handedly-rest...</a>",1299437325

Particularly when you only spend, say, $1-3 at a time, the fees take up most of that.<p>The only way you could have a more efficient system without cutting the credit card companies entirely (which is a huge proposition with enormous barrier to entry) is to buy prepaid credit in larger blocks (say $20 minimum) rather than charging each transaction (or day's transactions) in one small lump.<p>Apple partially has this with it's retail cards but they probably lose 20% of that to the retailer.<p>Payments seems to me to be one of those areas like music (and really all digital content) where there are players that have cooperate who basically have no interest in cooperating. In music and digital content it's the labels, publishers and studios, all of whom are investing heavily into turning the clock back to 1997 (thank you, 30 Rock).

There are tons of research papers and projects, which just cannot be implemented on GNU/Linux in non-kludgy way.<p>For example, there would be no need in archivers (like tar), when you could do `cp ./directory archive.tar` (OS X has something similar this with dmg HFS images). Or you could have `/etc/foo.config` as a text file, but also access separate options as `/etc/foo.config/section/option`. Or you could have versioning built-in into a filesystem. `./foo.txt` is a current version, `./foo.txt/history/` is a directory with a list of revisions, and `./foo.txt/history/2010-01-23T16:24:00Z.001` is an old version snapshot.",1299436456

2) If you get fired on a Friday, you're technically out of status from a legal point from Saturday 
and must leave immediately regardless of spouse,rent leases, homes, cars, pets, kids, kids' schools, personal property etc.
3) You and your spouse and kids cannot have any supplemental active income. This rules out selling photographs on stock photo sites,
phone apps, etc. You can basically do nothing productive that earns money outside your job. 
4) If you move to a different job or even change roles, you have to reapply for the Green Card process from the scratch. Expect multiyear delays just to get back to where you were.
5) If you or your spouse wants to visit your home country or travel outside the country, expect to get stuck there for months for no good reasons. It has become so bad that immigration lawyers are advising not to travel internationally except for emergencies.
