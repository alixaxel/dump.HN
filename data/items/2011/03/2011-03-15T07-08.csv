It's not that I have anything against VLC, but they recently did an AMA on Reddit and it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. The primary thing the VLC team gets credit for is being able to play pretty much anything you throw at it, but that's the product of a lot of DSP work that me and mostly a ton of other people a lot more talented than me did. If VLC came out and said ""we make graphics frontends and command line options"" that would be one thing, but there was a trend to accept the praise without coming out and saying that they weren't responsible for most of the work. It was especially frustrating for me because I actually dislike a lot of the UI/UX decisions that VLC made, which was their primary contribution to the media player.<p>I understand it when unscrupulous people rip off FFmpeg, but I had hoped there would be more honor among fellow OSS developers.",1300175726

This 'backup plan' will also make it easier to take risks without having to worry as much about the potential for failure. In other words, savings provides you with options.<p>But that's in terms of general savings. For retirement more specifically, you should definitely start now if you can afford it, due to the effects of compound interest. Try playing around with an interest calculator[1] to see why. But perhaps the best reason is that once you're 40 and have had a few curve balls thrown at you, you'll appreciate that regardless of how things turned out, you'll have put yourself in a good place financially for the long-term.<p>For the record, I'm in my mid-20s myself, and across my Roth and my employer's SEP-IRA, around 20% of my income is going towards retirement (with other non-retirement savings on top of that). I've set up my direct deposit such that the Roth contributions are totally automatic. It just gets dumped into three index funds: US Stock, Intl Stock, and Bonds.

2326448,story,,,20,15,throwaway_,"Ask HN: I don't think I am a good programmer but I keep trying",,"I am probably one of those rare programmer/techie guys that really can't code. I have been in the industry for the past 12 years and I have been consistently making six figure salaries and getting excellent reviews at every place I have worked. I have been mostly working on the enterprise software, managing ERP packages (ala SAP) and enterprise databases (Oracle). All the while, I could not really code a program from scratch, although I could whip some shell scripts by copy pasting stuff and I was exceptionally good at troubleshooting issues and figuring out things. I also work well within teams and have also played managerial roles really well.I was always counted amongst the top 2 or 3 people in the IT organizations that I worked in. However, none of these places were cutting edge tech companies, but nevertheless all of these places have high name recognition.<p>I recently quit my job and started working on something that really requires hard core programming skills. I figured, I could manage it, if I sit at it for a month or so. However, I have been very ineffective in managing my time and honing my programming skills to be effective. Even when I was doing 9-to-5 jobs, even though I was exceeding the expectations of my peers and managers, I always knew that my productivity in terms of the amount of time I effectively worked, was always in the 25 to 40% range.<p>I want to be a good programmer, but I am starting to thin that it does not come naturally to me. I read on HN about how people started programming since they were 10 to 13 year olds and how it caught their imagination. Nothing like that happened to me when I was first introduced to computers. In fact, even though I really wanted to learn Ruby since 2004(bought my pickaxe book then), but never ended up learning. I didn't need it for my job then, but out of my own interest and wanting to learn programming, I picked it. However there was no proper follow up. That is just one example, there are many things I wanted to learn along the way and I never got good at anything.<p>May be I should just give up and go the management route, since all I manage to do with technology is to keep up with what is cool and current, but never able to get into any depth.<p>What I really want is mastery in programming, but I am somehow unable to put consistent effort to get there. Maybe I don't have the aptitude or the analytical skills required for being a good programmer. There are tons of programming videos online, but I feel drowsy and my attention shifts elsewhere within 20 to 30 mins. I however did manage to put one app in apple app store, but I took a ton of help from others to get it to the store. I know I am capable, but somehow am unable to put the consistent effort needed to get good at it. Not sure what kind of responses I am expecting, but just putting it out there is cathartic.",1300174155
