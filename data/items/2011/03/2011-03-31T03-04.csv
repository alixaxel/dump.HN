2390366,comment,2389994,2389994,1,0,jsz0,,,"I'm not sure we're at that point yet but it will happen eventually. Once the iPhone gets a multi-core processor, much faster GPU, and 4G what else is really left for a yearly update? I doubt we'll see an octo-core iPhone 6 with 4 cameras, 2K display and 5G radios in 2013. The possible delay for the iPhone 5 seems more about re-aligning the product release schedule. It doesn't really matter when the iPhone is released. Most people only buy a new phone with they are eligible for a subsidized upgrade. The iPad, and iPod Touch, are the items that need a big back-to-school/x-mas production push. It must be difficult (or at least expensive) for Apple to release the iPhone mid-year and 2 months later gear up for the iPad/iPod rush. I think we'll probably see the iPad 2 get an extended shelf life too. The rumors of an iPad release in September were probably correct they just got the year wrong -- it'll be 2012. The last piece of this is they may move to more frequent, but minor, OS updates. This has already started to happen with 4.x where each release brought some significant features. Perhaps all the bundled apps will be updated through the App Store instead of OS updates as part of this.",1301543580

Every effect has a cause."") where no analysis of the subject will produce the predicate,"" then went on reason that statements such as those found in Geometry and Newtonian physics are synthetic judgments. Using the classical example of 7 + 5 = 12. No amount of analysis will find 12 in either 7 or 5...  So you present the aforementioned idea and the reasoning behind it (both of which are atributed to kant btw): do you think that if I came along and reworded my reasoning behind the idea but drew the exact same conclusions, that I am absolved from giving credit to the original source?  Or perhaps you are claiming that because I reworded your idea it became my idea?  Something as unique of an idea as Synthetic Judgment, which in it of itself is the creation of the author, what then?<p>Anyone who has ever written a philosophy paper (myself included) has invariably had to cite (give credit) to some long dead source.

I was in school for two years and experienced a lot of the same stuff you did (I'm 21 now, I dropped out):<p>1) Was smart enough to glide through classes for my whole life, college not an exception<p>2) Started off having a lot of fun but got over the drinking and partying phase faster than my classmates, definitely felt lack of connection with my classmates<p>3) Thought a lot about whether or not I was actually depressed, especially because of the lack of connection w/ classmates.  Tried a lot of stuff (diet, exercise, shrink etc.)  Nothing quite seemed to do the trick (though the exercise helps a ton with daily stress but will not fix depression).<p>Although I obviously can't recommend it to everyone, I dropped out and started working.  Now I had been freelancing and doing internships since I was about 15 so I had a solid shot at an entry level position at a startup.  I can't tell you how much happier it made me.<p>You may not be able to just drop out, but I bet if you find an internship or something that involves you in the ""real world"" in a way that's somewhat meaningful to you (ie: not getting coffee) you'll get a lot more satisfaction out of life.<p>Remember you're young, you're not exactly supposed to have it all figured out yet.  Even old people don't have life figured out yet, no one ever does.  You also sound pretty introverted, and self reflective.  This is a really great trait, but it can be crippling if you don't know how to manage it.  You'll learn to know yourself and catch yourself repeating patterns.<p>It doesn't sound like there's anything wrong with you to me, but again I'm just a dog on the internet.
