The previous two globally-advertised large-scale disasters happened in western anglo countries and had minimal, if any, looting.

Both of these events saw <i>strong</i> outpourings of community spirit and solidarity, with lots of volunteering and food drops. It's not something that's mysteriously Japanese.<p>This is important because the article paints this as a Japan vs the World thing by roping in the UK, Chile and Haiti.<p>The article lists the following as reasons why there is little looting in Japan: 
- buddhism and shinto
- honour and dignity
- conformity and consensus
- national pride
- high discipline
- they return your lost wallet
- more highly evolved race (!)
Few of these are attributes that random interviewees would say are characteristics of Australians or New Zealanders<p>The Japanese are a unique culture and credit needs be given where due, but we need to stop talking about them as if they're magical and mysterious, beyond mortal ken just like Tolkein's elves.",1300265567

Utopic shows the hottest daily topics and content among your friends and people you follow on Twitter and Facebook (more sites to be added soon). Utopic is the fastest way to see what’s popular right now, breaking it up by categories like videos, music, links, events, photos etc. Utopic gives a personalized real-time view of what’s trending today among people who matter to you the most. Instead of going through long linear feeds and tens of external websites, see hot content from friends all immediately in one place, in a prioritized order. Other data sources like Google Reader, music services and others will be added shortly.<p>Utopic solves the problems of:
- Curiosity: everyone wants to know what's trending or hot among their friends.
- Information overload: there’s too much content on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube etc, even among people you’re following. Utopic brings out just the important stuff.
- Too many sites to go through: Utopic aggregates everything popular into one site.<p>Technically what we do is a pretty complex issue. Even for a few hundred users, we have indexed a few million links and hundreds of thousands of people sharing/liking/retweeting stuff in our databases. Adds up to gigabytes of data already early on. Big data & processing it rocks - something our team loves :) A bad side to it is that importing Facebook & Twitter data for a new user can take hours (yeah, their API's are slow, especially FB) so you see full advantage of the service may be only on your second login.<p>Any suggestions on how to improve the service? Anything you like or dont like? How to make it more social & viral, for it not to be a single-user tool?<p>You can also e-mail me at jk@utopic.me. Thanks in advance!",1300265231

  your readers and one is to the company that signs your

  have a responsibility to “stay on good terms” with movie 
  studios.
</code></pre>
Just like Moviefone has to maintain good relationships with studios, Techcrunch has to maintain good relationships with tech companies, or else its access will be cut off and things will be made difficult for it in many ways. It can burn a source from time to time just for fun, but if that becomes a habit, then it just stops getting scoops and bad things start happening. For example, some hypotheticals:<p>- pg stops sending them new YC startup launches<p>- startups start actively avoiding Arrington and his
    reporters and seeking out more friendly outlets, e.g.
    Startup Foundry<p>- some smart startup guy with time on his hands does an 
  investigative report on TechCrunch itself, showing how 
  the post-AOL TechCrunch has SEO'd its headlines to the 
  gills with Bieber and Gaga crap<p>And in addition to these sorts of perceptible consequences for burning sources (i.e. scoop decline = traffic decline = revenue decline), there is another dimension to this.<p>Put yourself in the position of the unfortunate PR person for Source Code. Their entire investment of time and effort -- getting the Techcrunch contact, arranging a screening, getting Alexia face time with a mercurial movie start like Gyllenhaal -- went up in smoke when Alexia trashed the Source Code game stuff. [Though you could argue that the movie sort of has higher awareness now as a center of ""controversy"", this was not the intended outcome.]<p>The thing is, PR guys are scared of talking to reporters because there are often very large sums at stake that can turn on the whim of the reporter. Anyone who has raised money in the Valley knows that deals can close -- or fall through -- on the basis of a single well timed adverb in a headline.<p>Reporters are only dimly aware of the economic consequences of their reporting, and their ability to create -- or utterly destroy -- wealth. It's like there is a river of money flowing by them, and they can either reroute it off a cliff or towards an even larger tributary, but cannot actually take a drink from the water.<p>I'm of course not saying that reporters shouldn't publish negative stories or takedowns, but rather that often they aren't aware of just how bad a negative story can be if it's the top hit on Google. For those who have built something, your heart is in your throat when talking to the first few people who are going to publicly evaluate it -- are they going to trash it to such an extent that you won't even get the resources to improve it? It's at least arguable that an alternative to the tabloidy approach of Techcrunch is the more builder-friendly approach of David Pogue and Walt Mossberg, who generally don't write about things if they're going to trash them (i.e. the sign that they don't consider something that good is a lack of coverage rather than an outright flame).<p>Finally, sometimes reporters <i>are</i> aware of the economics surrounding press coverage, but in the worst way.

Make no mistake, access and credibility both have business value to any media company and need to be balanced. Access means good treatment of sources. Credibility means good treatment of readers. If you are only ""credible"", you are reporting yesterday's news. And if you only have access, you are only reporting airbrushed news. There is a balance, and Carr has to acknowledge that.",1300263724

2331273,comment,2327313,2328627,0,0,beza1e1,,,"> The biggest thing that could be improved about parsing IMO is for grammars to be reusable.<p>This is not solely about parsing. There is the semantic analysis phase afterwards, which is just as hard. In your example ""sizeof(struct MyStruct) = 96"" must be related to the type definition of MyStruct. Then the compilation target must be asked for the sizes of the primitive types inside the struct. Effectively, the IDE could as well execute the compiler (with a parameter not to generate code) and parse the output.<p>Maybe an IDE wants a complete frontend as a library. Feed in the file, retrieve the AST. Insert callbacks for warnings and errors instead of printing to stderr.<p>An interesting problem would be to reparse parts of a file. The parser would have to get an AST node and a file position, to ""resume"" parsing from there. This only works, if there is no context apart from the AST, though.",1300263509

With a tool like ANTLR you have to do wierd stuff to parse Python.<p>Programming languages older than 10 years or so are usually not context-free. For example C needs context to parse ""A*B"", because the meaning depends on whether ""A"" is a type or a variable. Recent programming languages usually try to be LL(1), which is why the keywords ""var"", ""val"", and ""def"" become so popular.",1300262670
