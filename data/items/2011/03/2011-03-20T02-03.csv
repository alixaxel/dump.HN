I don't believe we truly _fundamentally_ understand the universe, maybe it's not even possible to actually understand it fully, but the scientific method gives an incredibly useful framework for us to model and reason about the universe and to actually get useful results with that framework - and it works along a whole spectrum of abstraction and different disciplines.",1300589880

Something like 1/3 of all reddit submissions are self-posts anyway (they don't link anywhere but to a reddit comments page) so the 'social bookmarking' classification is all the more absurd...",1300587283
