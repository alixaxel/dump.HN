2347214,comment,2346338,2346783,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I was only half-serious, but I'll elaborate it into a serious argument anyway.<p>Allowing insider trading will create asymmetric information in the stock market, and that risks creating a ""market for lemons"" type situation and <i>reducing</i> liquidity.  Say that insiders are allowed to trade whenever they want, on whatever information they have.  As an outside investor without that information, I should then <i>assume</i> that I will get a raw deal on any trade that I make.  The rational action, then, is to avoid trading that stock at all.  Even if there're initially lots of non-insiders to trade with, <i>they</i> are all making the same economic calculation, and will come to the same conclusion.  Hence, anyone rational will leave the market, and the only people left will be those with inside information, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  That defeats the whole point of a public stock market.<p>When you think about economics, you can't stop at first-order effects.  The immediate effect of insider trading may be to increase the speed with which information gets to the market, but the long-term effect is to destroy the market itself, as every participant then has an incentive not to trade.<p>Anyway, the ironic part of my original comment is that I'm actually not an outsider by most people's POV.  I can think of a number of people that would pay good money for upcoming Google product releases, were it not illegal (and grounds for firing).  So in strictly personal terms, I'd stand to benefit quite a bit from legalized insider trading, but in academic terms, it'd destroy the system that generally works pretty well.",1300651160

It's a perfect example of someone arguing to make a point without even trying to understand the opposite position.<p>No one has ever argued that dynamic languages are more expressive than static languages. This is impossible, as long as we're considering Turing-complete languages. The fact that Harmony/EcmaScript 5 reference compiler was implemented on OCaml. However, it is equally futile to argue that they are <i>less</i> expressive[1].<p>""you are imposing a serious bit of runtime overhead to represent the class itself [...] and to check [...] the class [...] on the value each time it is used.""<p>Users of dynamic languages simple trade runtime efficiency for compile-time efficiency. What's wrong with that?<p>The point of having multiple languages is that different languages make different things simple and easily expressible. Sure, you can do dynamic programming in Haskell or OCaml, but the language is going to work against you in some way, requiring you to specify your intension in a particularly lengthy and awkward way (think Java, except Java makes you do that for any kind of programming).<p>[1] Ironically, the author fails to point out the one way in which static languages are more ""expressive"" than dynamic languages: overloading on function's return type.

You make friends like rarely one can make (that network becomes a fantastic ressource when you need help now!/yesterday).

2347081,comment,2346338,2346853,0,0,nickpinkston,,,"seems like you're conflating insider trading with all forms of manipulation & ""real"" cheating. Enron wasn't mainly insider trading - it was fraud by fudging their numbers. My argument is to use greed to incentivize more market information that wouldn't have been public - so Enron's are found sooner. This will lead to a smoother market because of:<p>- more accurate and timely information (stock pricing)
- firms increasing transparency (info) to remove financing volatility
- Current SEC 10k's, etc. are of little value as we've seen. It must be forced to prevent loopholes - insider trading does this from the inside.<p>What I'm not saying: That market manipulation (ex. Pump and Dump) should be legal - thats another issue, and provides no value (information or otherwise). That's anti-competitive behavior with no societal benefit I can see - and hence should be regulated and leaked using insider trading ;-)<p>Other concerns: 
- Fraud in insider trading: Perhaps it should still be illegal to lie about your inside knowledge, and further firms that trade would have every incentive to confirm the data with other sources.
- Risk pricing would be far better than luck if there were a lot of data points for each company due to multiple leaks over time and other business intel. The Street already know these CEOs, etc. - they don't exist in vacuums.
- Your startup risk pricing ideas don't address the differences I cited - who is insider trading startups? That'd mean investing based on the inside numbers the company has - which is already normal for investors to have access to, and if a founder fudges those - it's fraud.<p>Your concerns about risk pricing are due to this ""real"" cheating, which insider trading helps discover, and hence eliminates risk.<p>Am I off base here?",1300648909

I'm assuming the answer is yes unless I make any changes, at which point they'll try to force me into a new AT&T, which will suck.<p>2. When can I buy an iPhone for use on my T-Mobile plan? This will still probably a good year away, though I hope it'll be faster.",1300647771

I tether with it all the time, but T-Mobile uses a different frequency for their 3G so your AT&T phone can hop onto T-Mobile Edge network but not 3G, unfortunately. Same thing in the other direction. I don't think any manufacturers make phones that can do both frequencies for 3G.",1300647679

Given how long ago this was, I didn't have data, so I can't speak to what would have happened with a voice/data plan.<p>However, I can see the same thing not happening with this deal.  AT&T really is the antithesis of T-Mo in terms of pricing, flexibility, and customer service.<p>I've got both (an iPhone and a Nexus One).  While 3G coverage is not as readily available on T-Mo as it is on AT&T, there have certainly been many times when it has been more reliable in call quality and drops.<p>The only upside to this?

The situation would not be any different today. AT&T only won that war because of their dominant position, which allowed them to throw billions at promotions and guarantees -- which, of course, only further worsened T-Mobile's ability to compete (imagine if they had gotten the iPhone instead).<p>In today's world, if you were Apple, AT&T would once again be able to sit back and dictate terms, as they will be the only real nationwide GSM network in town. It's 1998 all over again, and I don't like it one bit. The other players -- MetroPCS, etc -- are clearly regional / metropolitan plays and do not offer the footprint necessary for an iPhone type device.<p>As an aside, I would appreciate if your responses were more than one liners.",1300647612
