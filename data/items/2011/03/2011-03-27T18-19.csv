They share the same model of parallelism model, but Nvidia keeps baking more support for unrestrained C++ into both the hardware and compiler (see recent addition of function tables, unified address space, general purpose cache). I think if AMD continues to focus primarily on gaming then it's just a matter of time before their cards/drivers have some slight edge in the gaming domain.",1301252387

2375614,comment,2375430,2375443,23,0,nhaehnle,,,"BitCoin is certainly a real currency in the sense that it is traded by people, even in exchange for real goods and services. As for whether it is something to watch depends on where you're coming from.<p>The problem of BitCoin is that of adoption. The US$ is a viable currency because the US government is able to force a US$-denominated debt onto people via taxation. This creates demand for US$, which causes people to offer goods and services in exchange for US$. Of course, once a currency is established, the circular/recursive reasoning of ""you work for US$ because you can use them to buy groceries at your favourite supermarket, because the supermarket must pay its suppliers in US$, because the suppliers pay their employees, i.e. you, in US$"" largely takes over. Take the base case of enforced debt away and the currency keeps working a while longer in Wile E. Coyote fashion, but at the first sign of serious doubt as to the currency's value it will inflate into worthless paper, even when the ""total amount"" of paper remains unchanged.<p>There is nobody who can force BitCoin-denominated debt onto anybody, and so it's unclear how BitCoin could ever take off. It certainly has appeal to a fringe group of libertarians, but I see no mechanism by which it could possibly spread beyond that.<p>It is true that BitCoin has some appealing feature through its distributed nature. Making small transactions between peers easier is definitely appealing - it's what makes services like M-PESA sell like sliced bread. However, BitCoin has the enormous disadvantage of not being convertible to US$ in the sense that when you want to use BitCoin, you are dealing with exchange rate risks. I would bet that this makes it too inconvenient for the majority of the population to ever take off.<p>We can spin this further and ask what would happen if, despite all difficulties, BitCoin would ever find widespread adoption. If all prices are denominated in BitCoin, then the exchange rate risk is no longer a problem for average people. But then the economy would face the same problems that plagued gold-based economies, in particular frequent recessions. The historical cycle of monetary development would be likely to repeat itself: People would start introducing paper moneys that leverage BitCoins, frequent bank run would happen until the establishment of a new, BitCoin-based central bank. Eventually, convertibility of the new de facto currencies to BitCoin would be dropped, reverting to pure fiat money.<p>From a public policy perspective, it is desirable to skip that cycle and just stick with fiat money. Most likely though, the question won't even come up, because BitCoin cannot really gain traction without government intervention in the first place.<p>From a hacker perspective, the more interesting question is: What problem do people actually face in their daily lives? I am sure there are payment-related problems that can be fixed, but my feeling is the solution is more along the lines of M-PESA, working within the currencies that people are already used to.<p>From a monetary economics perspective, it is an interesting experiment that may one day be used as empirical evidence for one or the other theory on money.",1301251599

(It's a common semi-noob illusion.)""<p>It's not a very good way to reference it, though, and in general comes off as snobbish. There's also a distinction between complaining that HN is going downhill (which the guideline discourages) and asking how to prevent it from going downhill (which I see as a good topic of discussion). Of course, asking what HN is doing to prevent it is one which might be more easily answered by watching the site for a while.<p>Based on an extremely unscientific sampling (going back a bit over a million items and then hopping around randomly between 300 and 386 days in the past), while there is a slight decrease in the level of conversation - and a fair amount of karma inflation - it's not too noticeable, and I expect that it would be somewhat difficult to distinguish between a discussion thread now and one from a year ago, if all temporal identification was stripped out.

Pretty much, these are languages I had to use, but not languages I had to get good at using. Among these would be PHP, VB, and maybe Java (though I actually liked it before I started using C#).<p>Then, there is JavaScript, which I cannot avoid using despite having concerns with it. I would not say I ""hate"" it though, it's more of a ""love and hate"" relationship that formed over time here. I guess I look at it as being in a large city: if you know where to go it can be a wonderful time, if you don't you'll be shot in the face.<p>Among the things that bother me the most are function only scope, specifically when it mixes with declaration hoisting and implied globals. You can really end up writing some deceitful, innocent looking code that just does not do anything you'd expect it to. It's somewhat simple to avoid any problems that might come up if you're aware of them, but it's made me extra touchy; I get uneasy feelings when I see a variable declaration that is anywhere except the top of the function it is declared in. At the same time, having a large distance between the declaration of the variable and its use has been somewhat problematic for me: if I change the name of the variable, I must also remember to scroll up to change where it was declared, otherwise I just added a new global property. This bites.<p>The other significant issue I have is inheritance. I wouldn't mind if it actually resembled normal prototype based inheritance, but it just doesn't. It's too mixed up with the classical approach, making the end result neither simple nor powerful. It's easy to see that this problem in the language since there are so many different patterns of creating and extending objects as a result. Almost every framework/lib uses a different approach and tries to abstract it so the end user doesn't have to be aware of it. Of course, that only gets you so far before you end up having to look at how the libs you're using implemented it, and that sort of defeats the reason for the abstraction in my opinion. Something as fundamental as this shouldn't be so problematic, but it is.<p>Strangely, when I'm looking at EcmaScript 5 and Harmony, and see the changes that might try and fix these things, I kind of feel sad because it just wont be the same JavaScript I got used to fighting with.",1301249243
