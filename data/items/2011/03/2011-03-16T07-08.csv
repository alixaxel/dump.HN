The gasoline for the greater San Francisco area is pumped from the Brisbane junction.<p>For anyone who wants to move a company there, they don't have much amenities.  They have a single chinese restaurant, una taqueuria, and have a stellar coffee shop, but its not open long enough for the hacker personality.<p>Brisbane is a small town that used to be lively during the days of Johnny Cash.  Its not a substitute for a city like San Francisco or even a south bay area like Mountain View.  Its that mountain town you see up in Tahoe, but 1 mile south of the city.  I actually suggest making a daytrip to hike the abandoned railroads through it.<p>If they were to move into the open buildings in the area, this could make lives of people who use public transit annoyed.  The Caltrain stations are 1 mile away on each side away from Brisbane, there is only a single SamTrans running along Bayshore and forget BART, its way too far.  Biking is your best bet via caltrain.<p>Since Brisbane is an economical situation where they are talking about shutting down the elementary and highschools, this could be a very good thing for the city.  As for Twitter and other companies alike, its a question about what type of culture they want to grow.  As a resident of the area, I prefer living in Brisbane, rather than working.",1300262214

We felt the most honorable people on earth.<p>We go return the blouse, the alarm starts while we enter then we have to fiddle explaining in half-Spanish what we meant to do.<p>We end up paying for the damn blouse, with the guard next to us but we don't get a receipt because that's company policy (I'd guess a form of punishment so you couldn't return the item).<p>In the end we both regretted returning it and kinda ruined the whole evening.<p>Not sure if this is a valid Spanish/European-Japanese comparison but it certainly is a corporate versus humane shop comparison.",1300262209

2331201,comment,2330467,2330621,0,0,andolanra,,,"Slightly off-topic; a tiny bit of Parsec advice—you don't actually need the undercore at all. queryExpression can be equivalently expressed as<p><pre><code>    queryExpression = do
        char '{'
        sqlValue <- sqlLanguageSelectStatement
        char '}'
        return $ QueryExpression sqlValue
</code></pre>
and it will be exactly the same parser.<p>Incidentally, my personal preference is not to use do-notation at all and instead to use applicative functors (as they do in Real World Haskell, c.f. <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html#id652399"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/using-parsec.html#id65...</a> ) I think it makes code more concise and readable. In that case, queryExpression would look like<p><pre><code>    queryExpression = QueryExpression <$> (char '{' *> sqlLanguageSelectStatement <* char '}')
</code></pre>
which again does exactly the same thing. (The * > operator chains things together but throws away its left-hand side, and <* does the same but throws away its right-hand side, so you're left with the result from parsing sqlLanguageSelectStatement, and <$>, which is a synonym for fmap, reaches in and wraps the result of the parser in a QueryExpression. The only downside is you have to write the Applicative instance yourself, but because GenParser is already a monad, all you need to do is define each method to be the equivalent monad method, which they show in the link above.)<p>As for your broad idea—the only issue is that sometimes parser combinators aren't as fast or finely tuned as a handwritten parser, and there's a chance that you'd have to do some kind of backtracking. But the short answer is yes, that is exactly what parser combinators are designed to do, and they do it pretty well and very easily.",1300261060

I think that's a horrible idea. The JVM is an awful platform for any kind of language research & development, unless the type-system of that language is basically the same as in Java. I'm actually pretty upset that they've taken continuations out from 1.9 - most likely JRuby bares some blame.<p>Not to mention I would prefer to keep Oracle(TM) tainted stuff out of my lawn, as at this point I consider Mono/.NET to be more safe than Java.",1300260227

Of course, not everyone will live IN SF, and perhaps the average will be lower -- but that's still an enormous amount of money moving out of the city (to pay for all those nice things you mention).<p>Furthermore, and I'm still figuring out the numbers on this one, I am curious to see what the sales tax losses (among others) will be when major companies like these move away from the city.<p>And really, it puts entrepreneurs in an awkward position of being forced to go to SF (because that's where all the talent want to be) and having to find a way to survive as well.
