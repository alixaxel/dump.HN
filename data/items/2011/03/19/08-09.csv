Presumably AT&T are aware that some people are prepared to pay more for tethering and therefore write the T&Cs such that can price-discriminate in order to get more money out of those people for potentially the same service. The sad thing is that people probably signed up in the expectation that the T&Cs would not be enforced and are getting a rude shock.<p>To slightly modify your airline analogy, this is like going on a business trip and flying economy. The airline scans your baggage, notices that you have packed your suit and other work-related items and demands that you pay the business class fare. ""Hold on a minute,"" you complain, ""I am entitled to 20kg of hold baggage and 7kg of hand baggage, so long as it fits with certain dimensions and isn't dangerous!"" The airline retort: ""Read the small print. Business travellers with certain items in their baggage will be charge the business class fare, which will be charged to your credit card. Now, enjoy the flight and don't forget to pay attention to the safety announcement.""",1300522593
2343202,comment,2340269,2340759,0,0,wladimir,,,"It's kind of the same here. We first have to write a design document, then get it reviewed by people all over the organisation. This reviewing <i>has</i> to be done in a meeting, which is impractical because it is almost impossible to find a time where everybody is available AND a room is available.<p>Writing a design document doesn't sound that bad, but the requirements are completely unclear when you start the project. Usually, the stakeholders don't even exactly know what they want, so it's very hard to get concrete requirements. And they change their mind all the time, so if you just scrapped something, many times you have to add it back later.<p>Only when it is deemed OK, it is officially allowed to start programming. If not, back to the drawing board. Worst part is that the opinions differ on how detailed this design document should be. Some people complain if it is not detailed enough, others complain if it is too detailed.<p>When you have the OK, the red tape only starts. You have to mail or run around asking people to grant change access to their part of the source code. In many cases, simply referring to the design document for explanation is not enough. Nope, as they generally had ""no time"" to go over the document, if you want to get work done, you should explain everything that you're going to change in their part.<p>Even the SCM system that we use is slow. Checkouts take ages, builds take ages. This way of development really doesn't work for me and many others. Luckily there is an (unofficial) way to ""fork"" the code, so that you can start working and experimenting while writing the design document. Without this, it'd be almost impossible to get the amount of detail required.<p>And when you're done coding, you need to write a document with testcases, which goes through the same review process. When you're done testing, another document with test results...<p>In this case, the process works because it is not very rigidly enforced. Unluckily, some people in management think that code quality will improve if and only if more checks are put in place. So every half year there are more checkboxes and process steps.",1300522508
