2279035,comment,2275844,2277329,0,0,danssig,,,">Why is it so easy to accept that pretty much everything in our bodies is genetic but not intelligence?<p>Because intelligence is much less understood than most of the rest of our bodies.  For example, there have been various discoveries that seem to indicate our language has an effect on what we can know and understand [1, 2, etc.].  Perhaps there are dramatic differences in what each of our brains are capable at the ""hardware"" level, but the ""software"" (language) dampens the effect.<p>[1] The Piraha can't learn numbers after a certain age because they have no words to describe them<p>[2] An article a few months back about deaf people growing up without any language ended up bringing out the fact that some asian languages have words to describe some aspect of color that westerners do not.  Babies are able to see the difference but gradually lose the ability as they grow up with no way of expressing it.",1299059933

The ongoing debate is about German consumers not consuming enough and saving too much. And because Germans are saving so much they tend to be very aggressive inflation hawks, which led to the ECB _raising_ interst rates in 2008.<p>Still, I think, it is deplorable how little respect the Germans get for simply making what others want. They're doing that very well and other European nations should ask themselves how they do it instead of complaining about a two speed economy. Get up to speed guys!",1299059786

2279015,comment,2277055,2278013,0,0,iuguy,,,"They do different things, so I'll give you an overview:<p>HBGary have a tool called FastDump Pro for imaging memory. What Responder does is it takes (or acquires) a memory image and reconstructs the processes and left over memory modules. It also reconstructs details of open files, sockets, registry entries etc. at the time of the snapshot.<p>Responder Pro has a thing called Digital DNA (which backs up nearly all of HBGary's enterprise products) - it's a mechanism that looks for potentially malicious code (I say potentially because it's easily triggered by things like McAfee because it has a load of strings in memory at any one point in time). Digital DNA uses known indicators to look for specific signs of things like keyloggers. It's not 100% but it usually reduces analysis time by a lot.<p>There's a fairly straight forward disassembler, you can look at strings tied to processes and memory modules, check for hooked SSDT, IDT entries etc. and there's a canvas type function for mapping out a processes' structure. There's a C# interpreter for scripting but it's not well documented so most of our guys don't use it much for other than basic scans for specific things.<p>Recon comes with responder pro and is used to test potentially malicious code pulled off disk in a VM. You define how long it's going to run for then it runs the code under the VM. You can then go back to responder and there's an actual slider that shows you all the changes from registry, files, even cpu registers over time so you can zoom in on your process and see the encryption algorithm in the malware decrypting and flip back and forth, which makes it really cool for basic malware cryptanalysis when you're me and not you :) - it's also handy for extracting 0day from exploit code because you get to see what's being exploited and how, so you can quickly write a cheeky canvas/metasploit module.<p>There's another tool called flypaper that stops the process in recon from exiting, which can be quite handy.<p>Although the company's in a bit of disarray at the moment the products are really great for malware analysis, and could be used for exploit dev (but I wouldn't).",1299059324

If you watch the video there is a better chance that you'll see how the person got to that point.<p>The thing that always annoyed me about Haskell tutorials, for example, was people would put in all this beautiful code but I couldn't ever make it run.

Suppose Person A will provide value Y per year, cost X per year, and turn over in one year costing Z. Person B produces value Y - K, costs X, but will stay for 3. If K < (Z - Z/3) all else equal you'd choose person B.

  * Authors are paid by the government on behalf of the public in proportion to the demand for their work (libraries buy more copies of popular books to meet demand from patrons).
  * The public pay the same amount no matter how much information they consume (via their taxes).<p>From a macroeconomic perspective, information has different properties to physical goods:
  * Information has high fixed costs, and low variable costs.
  * Variable costs of disseminating information can be spread to individuals other than the original creator.
  * Once the fixed cost of information that improves productivity is met, the most efficient outcome is to distribute the information as widely as possible.<p>Therefore, there should be a way to compensate information creators in proportion to value to society, without imposing a price disincentive to consume information.<p>One way to do this would be to have an alternative economic system for digital works where there is no limit on how much digital information an individual or company can consume after they have paid a fixed amount in the main system, with allocation of the individual's total in proportion to some metric - such systems are tricky to get right while not incentivising dividing up one invention / work into small pieces or creating complex entity structures to game the system.",1299057995

The country rebooted from scratch in '48 with the most unsocialistic / market-libertarian constitution / law landscape the country has ever had so far. Immediately there was the ""German economic miracle"" (not a miracle at all) but since then socialism has grown every year. Notably faster paced since 1990 but ""dialling down socialism a bit and the free market up a bit"" is optimistic and illusory. Once this beast feeds and grows, there is no real turning back, all you can possibly adjust is timing. They now have not just income taxes but taxes on everything that moves and every step of every transaction or value chain. Once these taxes exist, they are never removed and keep being raised. Continuous talk about new taxes. All political parties are various shades of socialism and this is apparent in legislation. They make it harder for productive people and firms every year and the real miracle is that there is still ""power in the power house"", and I'm convinced they're still riding on the momentum of the 50s-70s. All these various 100s of ""social state insurances"" schemes and constructions are about to collapse a few years down the road and every euro spent on them whether through taxation or debt will not prevent this and just be a waste and destruction of productive human energy.<p>I dropped out, I stay a perpetual traveller and out of Germany because my conscience forbids me to feed this corrupt destructive apparatus and the greater EU with the fruits of my labour. The only legal way for me to still be able do this and keep my citizenship is to stay outside the country for 180 days or more a year, and not stay inside more than 2 months in a row -- roughly.

As far as i know and in contrast to their competitors Lunge refuses to put their money into marketing and instead focuses its efforts solely on the development and manufacturing of their products. Of course they can't compete on the price level, but I hear lots of good feedback from customers that won't go back to asics, nike & co. and don't mind paying the bonus for substantial products.
