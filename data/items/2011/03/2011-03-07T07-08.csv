2296421,comment,2295968,2295968,0,0,oakenshield,,,"I don't quite understand what you're trying to get at. Are you saying that cloud providers should provide you some sort of insured access to data in case something catastrophic happens, or are you saying that you should be able to store encrypted data in the cloud so the cloud provider or another authority cannot read it?<p>As for the former problem, cloud storage providers such as Amazon S3 already provide more redundancy for your data than you could possibly design cost-effectively on your own (in fact, they even offer a _reduced_ redundancy service if you don't want to pay for the S3 redundancy).<p>The latter ""problem"" isn't really a problem --- it's entirely up to you to encrypt the data you want to store in the cloud and keep the key to yourself, and you can easily have an encrypted frontend to your S3 block storage or even your Dropbox folder. I don't see the relevance of something like SUNDR... IIRC, it is a way to merely store your data on an untrusted service. However, most business use the cloud for <i>computation</i> (which of course requires storage). So SUNDR won't apply when you have to trust both computation and storage to an untrusted entity?<p>You could of course run a distribution on your compute node VM that encrypts data going out of the VM to the cloud provider infrastructure, but the benefit is limited because your applications are finally running on the provider's hardware. I suppose we need to wait until that homomorphic encryption stuff becomes real :)",1299484598

But I was pleasantly surprised today to see it on the front page.  I have been thinking about breaking it up into smaller articles - but something in me has resisted.  The most important point requires the reader to stitch together a great number of different threads - and would be largely intelligible without the background.<p>I tried to explain the idea over at esr's blog - because I thought the crowd there might be interested and might get it.  Amusingly esr let loose at me (called me a sloppy thinker no less!) - and I realised it just couldn't be articulated in small bytes of info.<p>But yeah - intimacy comes at a great cost of time - the time spent really getting to know a person through great chats and extended exploration.  This article assumes intimacy with the world because of the time required to invest in it.

I doubt Jeff Bezos, Meg Ryan, Larry Page, or even Jacqueline Novogratz would be attending and interacting at a conference that wasn't at least some bit elitist. To know that the fellow attendees are ""peers"" who have some comparable ""level of achievement"" puts them in a different mindset than being surrounded by people who are extremely passionate about something but may not have as much of a track record. The former scenario is networking for them, the latter is putting in face time/public relations. I think that if you make the TED conference itself more open, then you'll lose some of the big name people. The big name people who do attend will be in that ""lecture to the audience"" mode and likely leave right after the speeches.<p>TEDx is the non-elitist version of the TED. I think these are just as inspiring and motivating, but without the distraction of the big names. The character of the event is different(less money, prestige, and social posturing in the room) but the spirit of sharing ideas and doing what we can is the same. I think there is a place for both TED and TEDx in the world. Whichever you most want to attend depends on your own personal goals and circumstances.",1299484585

As far as I know for my GalaxyS there is a partition on the internal storage for the ""Internal SD"" and the external SD is handled as a different card.

It took 3 months to get approval by the Handelsgericht (commercial court) to obtain approval of the incorporation papers. In Austria, you must have a minimum 35000 euros of ""startup capital"" invested ""on deposit"" to form a company. In the US, it can be done in an afternoon.<p>Regulations and oversight in Europe is far greater, and intrusive, than in the US, which can be frustrating to me as an American, however I understand the reasons, and clearly can see the benefits of this in the stability of the financial and business industries. With kurzarbeit, there was minor economic damage to either Germany or Austria.<p>The key economic drivers of European growth, Germany, France, Austria, Norway, Finland, Switzerland tend not to have boom / bust cycles like the US.<p>The Euro definitely has issues in the absence of an ""economic union"", however if any country goes into default, it does not bring the entire union down.<p>Europeans tend to focus on R&D of ""long term sustainable"" ""tangable technology"" rather than the modern silicon valley focus on ""short term fluff"" of facebook, zynga, iPhones, iPads etc.<p>Airbus kicks Boeing's ass in Aerospace (not to mention business efficiency (787 outsourcing debacle)
European research is superior in almost every category, and is at par with the best that the US has to offer. Europeans do not turn over their core R&D in order to do business in China, or India.<p>NASA manned spaceflight (the 11 billion dollar boondoggle of the canceled ARES / CONSTELLATION)(and the new heavy launcher designed by politicians) is a huge embarrassment for US expats like myself. For Europeans, this is clear undeniable evidence of the US having lost its technical superiority, and Europe's rise to supremacy.<p>Europeans tend not to do business arrangements with dictators as often as the US. And I think that it is immoral to exploit citizens in another country which tolerates slums (Brazil favelas), and does not work actively to lift its people out of poverty (China/India). Check out the favela tourism (predominantly patronized by US citizens) next time you're in Rio.<p>Yes, Europe in general is not as astute in funding of high tech startups, and culturally are more risk averse to funding the silicon valley fluff.<p>Greece Spain Ireland:
Unlike in America, if California or Illinois, or Ohio declares bankruptcy, its fatal to the entire country. In Europe, it would cut Greece loose from both the Political and Monetary unions in a snap.<p>Not so easy to kick states out of the United States union.<p>As far as EU expats, I've personally met many Germans and Austrians who have returned from the US, and vow never to live there again (violent crime / fascism / kleptocracy). Most would like to visit again, because of the friendly people and the beautiful landscapes. These folks in particular ""get why I am here"", and the advantages of Europe over the US. There is a weekly television show in Germany and Austria called ""Goodbye Deutschland"", which chronicles such expat adventures primarily to the US.

Yes there is corruption in Europe as well, however here, people go into the streets and demand justice, whenever the politicians fail to act in the best interests of its citizens!<p>Wisconsin is the ""first shot heard around the world"" for the next US revolution.

2296401,comment,2295927,2296312,0,0,dgurney,,,"You make a good point about replacing ""tap"" with ""click,"" but while the two seem similar conceptually (ie. either way you get ""input --> reaction""), I think the actual experience is completely different. With clicking, you make an input and see a reaction elsewhere (on the screen). But with tapping, the input and reaction occur in the same place. And I think that direct connection is key. Playing music is by nature a tactile experience, so composing in a tactile manner brings you that much closer to the end product. Granted, I'm a musician myself, so I could be biased. But I think pretty much anyone can enjoy the idea of adding notes to a staff and seeing music come out the other end. The more direct that process is, the better.<p>In terms of precision, I find the iPad to be plenty accurate, for these purposes anyway. The staff would have to be blown up a bit, but after that I don't see note accuracy being a problem. Plus, this would probably be a more limited program and wouldn't be as applicable to professionals who need that pixel-by-pixel level of accuracy (think finger painting vs. photoshop...).",1299483845

I am not an expert in any of those languages, the best I know is C++ and right now I am trying to develop a web application. I am fairly familiar with Java and PHP. 
The application is a kind of summarizer which will take user input as certain keywords they want to know the public opinion about it. Lets say i search for iPad2 and my web application gives users a % positivity/Negativity in public opinion, by analysing various blogs (which the links are fetched from search engines, and parsed) and finding what each one says.This is a brief description.
What my prob is that this particular application would be CPU intensive and I don't want my application to be slow. Another thing is that hosting the web application shouldn't be so costly as i am currently starting off my career(just a college pass-out n working as dev in a MNC).Also the language should not be so hard to learn as i don't have lengthy hours in my hands, which i can devote.

The landlords set the price, and the brokers try to rent them (first hand experience).  Unlike sales, typically, there is no exclusivity in rentals, it's first come first serve.  Whoever rents the apartments get the prize.  Which creates tremendous competition among brokers.<p>It is in the brokers' best interest that the landlords lower their price and pay a finder's fee.  This makes the apartment easy to rent.  The idea that somehow brokers bound together to control the price is simply untrue (this notion is somewhat true in sales).  Landlords control the price based on supply / demand.<p>Everyone tend to think that brokers themselves represent market inefficiency, which is also debatable.  Everyone knows Craigslist, and if they wanted to be on it, they can.  Now, why do landlords go through brokers at all, knowing there is Craigslist?<p>Last but not least.  The reason that renting is such a unpleasant experience lies in the nature of the business, and also what I call the Craigslist's dilema.
