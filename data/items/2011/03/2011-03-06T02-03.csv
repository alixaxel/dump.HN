If the desktop is nothing but wallpaper space, then minimizing windows make little sense - just get your windows on the front (which is hard to do without a dock)<p>At times (especially at work) I will have many different windows open at the same time. Exposé at that time will become very cluttered and it will be very hard to find the window I want, minimising removes that because now the windows I do want are bigger than the small minimised ones.<p>From looking at more screenshots from Gnome 3 it looks like their ""activities"" overview is a lot like Exposé.",1299380070

2293323,comment,2292751,2292751,0,0,toddynho,,,"(disclosure: I founded BuySellAds.com)<p>I think it's a great idea, actually. At BSA we've been talking about newsletter ads for a while, but haven't been able to commit to executing on it properly. We went as far as acquiring the NewsletterAds.com domain, but have since stopped there.  One of the biggest hurdles with selling ads in newsletters is getting enough valuable inventory. Even with our existing publishers (and with 150-200 new sites submitted every day) we would struggle to have enough <i>meaningful</i> inventory to put together to sell. That being said, I had <i>many</i> people tell me the same thing before I started BSA - that I would never be able to get enough inventory together to make it work.<p>The other piece of advice I can give you is that operating at 25% commissions (like BSA does) is definitely a bootstrapping path. If you can sell ads in newsletters that they aren't already selling, then it's something I would do at a 35-40% level. Maybe that sounds crazy, but if you're able to make sales that are normally not made you can charge whatever you want.<p>So, I'd say go for it, hustle, and make it happen if you are passionate about it.",1299379998

When I first started going I found that git was rather hard to for me to wrap my brain around, especially since it so radically changed the way certain commands worked. So I looked at Mercurial and felt much more at home as it felt like Subversion.<p>Since then I've wrapped my brain around Git and absolutely love it. I now have accounts on both Bitbucket and Github and both work equally well for what I want. The only feature that I feel is missing from Github is the ability to create unlimited private repositories for free, if not at least, on their lowest paid tier.<p>I tend to create random projects haphazardly, and while I like to have it versioned and ""backed up"" somewhere where I can invite friends to collaborate with me, I don't want some of these projects out in the open. Some of them are research projects for new products I am developing, others are projects I am working on with friends that could potentially be monetized.<p>Don't get me wrong, I understand where Github is coming from, and being familiar with both Git and Hg is not going to hurt, it is annoying on a context switching level to have to remember how to do something in hg and then in git when switching between projects.<p>At the point where I am in my career I don't yet make enough money (after paying student loans, car insurance, etc...) to spend money on monthly billing paid services.",1299379833

Now, usually such a product will have other benefits that the competitor's product lacks - at the very least, a cheaper price, but maybe also convenience, flexibility, customizability, simplicity etc. This benefit is usually a result of a tradeoff against the above dimension - a ""drawback"".<p>Over time, you naturally will improve your product, and (perhaps) it will approach being good enough to threaten that competitor. But even as they see you approach, they really can't fight you, because it would require they let down their customers. And, what's even worse, at this new way of doing things, <i>you</i> are now the incumbent, with all the experience with engineering, customer acquisition and business model etc, and they are the entrant.<p>But I think you add a new idea to disruption, that the ""drawback"" is <i>incompatible</i> with the value proposition, as opposed to being orthogonal. Different business models are often like that; also many engineering tradeoffs. It's exacerbated by when you improve at something, you often specialize in it; and specialization in one thing implies de-specialization in something else.<p>Note that such incompatibilities are not restricted to engineering issues: if Apple somehow became dependent on tethering, or on iPad users requiring an Apple desktop, as part of their <i>business model</i>, it would then become a ""drawback"", that you could attack on.",1299378594
