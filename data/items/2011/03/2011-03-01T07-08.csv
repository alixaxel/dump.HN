2274677,comment,2270613,2270869,0,0,dougabug,,,"My comment was not really so as glib as all that. We see hundreds of billions of dollars worth of speculative investments in ""technologies"", recalling the heady days of the dot-com era and the now iconic pets.com. Cures for common viral diseases, while surely not as monumental as daily groupons or facebook status changes, would be a boon for the billions of people who suffer from their effects.<p>Look, a hundred billion dollars is a lot of money. Enough to secure progress on major scientific fronts. Enough to launch half a dozen Human Genome Projects. If groupon is worth $15 billion, and facebook is worth $70 billion, it's not so absurd to wonder if the way we are valuing technological and intellectual resources has gone off the reservation. Memory of the dot com bust seems to have completely faded from the valley. The valuations we place on forms of innovation, intellectual achievement, affect where we are going.<p>Yes, I would rather pursue the cure for the common cold, flus, and other viral diseases, even with a low probability of success. The odds of creating the next Facebook are similarly astronomically low, and even if I succeeded, it would be less meaningful than even advancing the solution of the former. I would credit myself if I merely convinced a few smart people that this was a worthier goal towards which to apply their energies and abilities.<p>Imagine a world where (more than a few) hackers thought and communicated about the structure and meaning of dna. Wrote programs which probed protein structures and revealed their dynamics and interactions. That seems far fetched now, but decades ago, computers were extravagantly expensive devices maintained by a relatively small priesthood. The ecosystem of software which has evolved since the democratization of computing brought about by the personal computer and Internet revolution represents billions of man hours of work by smart, dedicated (and even not so dedicated) people. My point is that hackers can and do contribute a great deal to solving very difficult, truly important problems, and that we shouldn't be so obsessed with trying to create the next twitter or twaddle, because twaddling is so ab$urdly overvalued at the moment.",1298965268

The fact that others' after-tax income was transferred to me along the way in exchange for shares is irrelevant to the question why a positive or negative return on investment should involve the government for a second, third, fourth... time.

2274634,comment,2269669,2273309,0,0,chc,,,"When communicating, it is our responsibility to express our thoughts as clearly as possible. Dashing off vaguely worded comments and then insulting the reader when he seeks clarification is not a generally accepted practice in the field of writing.<p>To explain the confusion better: You say you ""referred directly to the button's content,"" but you didn't. You referred to it obliquely. The grammatical subject of your comment was ""this sentiment."" That is as specific as you got. The most obvious antecedent is ""the sentiment expressed in this article"" — which is what people assumed. In order to get your true meaning, the reader has to actually ignore the grammatical structure of your comment and read in a subject which you didn't explicitly mention anywhere <i>and</i> which is actually off-topic for the current discussion (people will generally use the overall topic as context when trying to determine the meaning of ambiguous phrases).<p>At any rate, insulting people who are confused by imprecise wording is kind of rude.<p>As for the button's actual content: I think you're taking the jokey posturing too seriously. As he explained in the OP, the reason he liked the phrase is because it reflects an actual divide between the two cultures — almost any fantasy fan will have read Tolkien, whereas many (probably most) sci-fi fans are focused on present series and haven't read, say, Heinlein. Depending on your school of thought, it could be making fun of fantasy fans for being stuck in the past or it could be making fun of sci-fi fans for being ignorant of their own.",1298964001
