2292018,comment,2291054,2291675,0,0,ejames,,,"Actually, this is something of a new problem in privacy considerations - broader than the strict ""is a GPS device on my car illegal"" question.<p>A great deal of what we call ""privacy"" - in the common English meaning of the word, rather than the legal definition - consists of other people lacking information about our movements and actions.  However, in that meaning, most of our privacy comes from the fact that 1) nobody is actively attempting to gather information and 2) it would be very difficult for them to do so if they tried.<p>With technology, it is both dramatically easier to collect information, and dramatically easier to convert that information into a usable form (whether for sale, or for leverage in a government action).<p>So although it's true that the technological method by which the FBI gathers information normally does not affect their legal right to do so, the standards under which the FBI operates were made when gathering information was difficult enough that stricter standards were not required.<p>That's why it's a big deal.  Normally they wouldn't bother to follow him.  Normally they wouldn't have the time or money.  As such, it was OK to give the FBI broad freedom to follow someone in an unmarked car, because the check on the FBI's ability to abuse that authority was its lack of money and manpower.  Now that technology has solved the FBI's lack of money and manpower, the legal question is much more relevant.",1299350898

I'm a huge Buffett fan, and I really dig the analogy of looking after your own health and lifestyle the same way you would with your finances.<p>Interest accruing on your bank account doesn't seem like much in the near-term, but compound it over several years and it yields a huge reward, hand-in-hand with having the common sense to steer clear from risky disasters. The same is true of developing good long-term habits like exercising, watching your nutrition, having a positive mentality, etc. Sure, it doesn't sound all cool and sexy, and it doesn't gratify you in the short-term, but they're time-tested principles and they put time (or the effect of compounded growth) on your side - just like Buffett's investing habits.",1299350876

That fits with our different experiences (laptop vs server).  Think about how you would feel if you rebooted your server, it went through a different power mode as part of shutdown, and when it came back all eight of your presumably nicely RAIDed drives were dead.  Of course a lightning strike could do the same thing, but you have a surge protector that guards against that.  How are you protecting against your SSD's firmware?
