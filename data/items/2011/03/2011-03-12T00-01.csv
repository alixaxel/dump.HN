If it's vertical, it can't be the same as a service with a wide appeal.<p>From what profile.io looks like to me now, it's just flavors.me with poorer design and less traction. You can try to beat flavors.me in design (good luck with that), or you can try defining your own project and set it apart from the competition.<p>Information on profile.io is very scant, so I know very little about the project.

The participants in the studies you're referring to who slept vastly more than others were those with sleeping disorders, some with extremely bad sleep apnea. They felt the need to sleep more because the quality of their sleep was so poor.

Building apps based on an ecosystem that you have no control over has always seemed like a substantial risk to me, and this assumption is starting to take shape.  Twitter's recent move is an example of what happens when a company is ready to monetize their content and wants to cut out the ""middle man"" so to speak.  It's pretty clear that they don't want third parties encroaching on their ad revenue, and while sad, it was inevitable.<p>I see this as a very disappointing move by Twitter for the fact that they are alienating the very developers that helped build their brand.  This is a glaring warning sign for all applications that are based on an external platform.

2315519,comment,2313661,2313989,0,0,malkia,,,"Even with OpenGL you don't get multi-platform for free. Neither with D3D (PC and XBOX)<p>There are more important things to consider:
  - Image compression supported (DXT vs. PVRTC vs. others)
  - Type of rendering buffers supported and precision (stencil, z-buffer, etc)
  - Features of the latter - can you do some prepass to skip  pixel shaders?
  - Normal map encoding and compression
  - Primitive buffering (batching) - static, dynamic, or low-level if the platform allows it
  - Minimizing state changes
  - Organizing mesh data for most optimum cache 
  - Hardware level queries - ""Did last primitive actually drawn something on the screen?""<p>So what the drawing api is of little importance for big AAA games. Data organization and features (what actually is supported on the HW, and which rendering paths are fast) is more important.<p>Now for CAD/3D Designer apps - you have more dynamic data - your meshes change too much, textures. You need very good looking wireframe antialiasing, etc.<p>For games - almost everything is precooked - starting from global illumination, meshes that have been cache optimized and had vertices welded where possible. Level maps optimized so that they draw faster, and batched so that with few draw calls you draw the whole level, etc.<p>My opinion is that OpenGL is really suitable for the latter, but it's also suitable for the former. Though D3D by not keeping much backward API compability can talk to the hardware in more straightforward talk, hence the API design:<p>OpenGL - functions with general types, not much if not at all structures. Easily to serialize (protocolize).
 Direct3D - functions with very specific goals, using structures more or less tied to the hardware, or the operating system, hence less portability.<p>For example I can't see D3D as an API taking off the way webGL is doing, simply because it's hard to map it's API to a scripting language, while OpenGL can.<p>Both are good :)",1299889487

2315500,comment,2315205,2315205,0,0,aperiodic,,,"There's really not much information in this article, and consequently it reads a tad sensationalist to me. Let me try to break this situation down as I understand it.<p>IAANRO (I Am A Nuclear Reactor Operator. I work part-time at my college's research reactor[1])<p>Nuclear power reactors are of two main varieties: Pressurized Water Reactors, and Boiling Water Reactors[2]. The plant in question is a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR). BWRs work by using the core's thermal energy to boil the cooling water into steam, and then channelling the steam in order to turn a steam turbine. After it exits the turbine, the steam is cooled in a condenser, where it turns back to water, and then is sent back into the core. The condenser requires cool water to be actively pumped through it, to keep the pipes upon which the steam condenses from becoming too hot. The water/steam that runs through the core and the turbine is referred to as the ""primary cooling system"", and the water running through the condenser is the ""secondary cooling system."" The primary is assumed to be contaminated (that is, it is measurably radioactive), whereas the secondary system is not, since it is isolated from the primary.<p>As far as I can tell, the chain of events for this particular plant went something like this:<p>Shortly after the quake, the reactor successfully shut down in anticipation of the tsunami. This means that no more fission is occurring in the core. Since a core meltdown is a result of uncontrolled fission, this means that the reactor is now incapable of melting down. This will not be another Chernobyl. However, just because U-235 is no longer fissioning, doesn't mean that the core isn't producing heat. The fission fragments (those isotopes produced as a result of the U-235 fissioning) will continue to decay through alpha, beta, or gamma emission, until stable elements at the bottom of the decay chain are reached. The decay of these fission fragments and their decay products will cause the core to continue to produce heat for some time after shutdown.<p>Presumably due to the fact that every reactor near the east coast of Japan was being shutdown, offsite power for the secondary cooling system was unavailable, so the power plant had to rely on onsite backup power, but the onsite power only lasted for 8 hours. After that, the secondary cooling system failed, which is what triggered the declaration of the Nuclear Emergency, and evacuation of those living within 3Km of the plant.<p>Since the core is continuing to produce heat, and consequently steam, the steam pressure inside the primary system is rising above normal levels. They are hesitant to bleed off steam into the containment dome, since the dome was probably damaged in the quake, but obviously bleeding off some steam is better than having the primary system rupture. Thankfully, most of the really nasty decay products have a relatively short half-life. In particular, Nitrogen-16, which gives off pretty high energy betas when it decays, has a half-life of 7.2 seconds.<p>Therefore, releasing the steam is undesirable, but not catastrophic, and probably not even particularly hazardous. The radioactive materials in the cloud will be longer-lived decay products of hydrogen and oxygen in, and as far as I'm aware none of those are particularly active. The cloud will be dilute itself after release, which will lower the intensity of the radiation field significantly. Therefore, the total radioactivity release will be many orders of magnitude lower than that of Chernobyl or Three Mile Island. The media is playing this up to be bigger than it is, because nuclear power still carries a stigma.<p>[1]: Reed Research Reactor: <a href=""http://reactor.reed.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reactor.reed.edu/</a><p>[2]: Wikipedia Article on Boiling Water Reactors: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor</a>",1299888964

Then everyone tries to figure out why and copy them.<p>They are solving wrong problem/chasing wrong tail.<p>Instead make as many games as you can, serial startup as many companies, ask out as many girls, etc.   The larger percentage of the set X are ""yours"" the larger chance you have of being right place / right time.<p>If you look (as here) you will find the vast majority of massive success is preceded by many ""failures"" and/or small success.",1299888119

Seriously.<p>> When it comes to a AAA game the big three sellers are Xbox, PS3, and PC, in roughly that order.<p>That is true. But, AAA games are not all of gaming. In fact, they are decreasing in importance - look at the rise of the Wii and Zynga as just two big examples.<p>Gaming is growing, and moving from hardcore gamers with AAA games to more casual gamers that use a greater variety of devices. Mobile phones and tablets in particular are becoming very important, as is the web.<p>DirectX is simply not relevant to any major phone or tablet platform, nor is it relevant to the web. iOS and Android use OpenGL, and the web uses WebGL (which is basically OpenGL ES in JavaScript).<p>OpenGL, by simply being everywhere that matters, will win the fight.<p>(Of course major game engines use abstraction layers anyhow - no one chooses just DirectX or just OpenGL.)",1299888009
