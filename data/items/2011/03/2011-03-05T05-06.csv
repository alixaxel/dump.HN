<i>Getting to focus on your algorithms and overall experience, and not dealing with ridiculous, time consuming, soul sapping optimizations which shouldn’t have to be discovered in the first place.</i><p>I work in a consulting shop that develops apps for all three platforms. I love my windows phone and I think the development tools and the framework are better than iPhone/Android. That said, there are some serious performance problems on wp7 and it takes a deep knowledge of the platform to avoid them. I've spent way too much time optimizing on wp7 just to get passable performance for a list of items with thumbnails. This is a such a basic scenario and it's extremely hard to get right. The navigation stack isn't good either. I like the back button as a user but dealing with scenarios where a user can jump to the first page of an app or when you need to navigate and avoid putting a page in the back stack and you run out of options.",1299304665
