You should always consider the expected outcomes when arguing for or against a technology.<p>Sure, in the worst case a nuclear reactor can kill thousands and make large areas no longer habitable, but this event has only a tiny probability. On the other hand conventional fossil fuel plants don't have such a dramatic worst case but they produce a constant stream of greenhouse gases and other toxic fumes. How many people died because of smog? How much land will become unusable due to global warming?<p>It's the expected harm we should be worried about, not the worst case scenarios.",1300017562

2318966,comment,2318849,2318849,0,0,6ren,,,"The neverending rebuttal of ""a great idea is enough"".<p>It seems to me that having a great idea would help... but I wonder if even that is necessary... I've been reading Christensen, on ""disruption"", and there's the concepts of:<p>- <i>targeting non-consumption</i> (or <i>non-consuming contexts</i> - e.g. users of phones, but not while mobile)<p>- <i>asymmetric motivation</i>, where low income or low margins or small markets etc. look great to (poor) you, but a rounding-error to (rich) incumbents. So they don't fight you.<p>- <i>independent value networks</i>, where you don't tap into any part of the way the incumbents do business. You don't use their suppliers; you don't use their sales channels, you don't target their customers. To use a value network, you have to fit in with it, you have to integrate with; you have to work with it - these means that you must constrain your business in some way. This has two effects: 1. if it's their network, your business will be more similar to theirs, and therefore easier for them to adapt to it, to attack you on your home ground, and co-opt the new market you created; 2. being constrained by some pre-existing way of doing business makes you less adaptable to whatever this new market needs, what the customers need, what the business idea needs. You are hampered from serving it.<p>- <i>asymmetric skills</i>, which is just the experience you get in making your particular business work. It's the accumulation of engineering problems you solve each day and gradually adapting your approach to suit them and having insights about how to reorganize to deal with them best; it's the accumulation of knowledge about your customers, what they want, how to reach them, what matters to them, what doesn't, along with repeatedly getting that to work. And so on - it's every part of making the business work. The more adapted you are to your customers and needs (and assuming this is different from what your competitors do - see the previous point), the greater a barrier to entry it is. That is, you become the incumbent in this new market, and you have the strengths that come along with that.<p>So, you might have an idea of a new market, that meets the above characteristics, and it seems that that idea would be valuable: a great idea.<p>However... I'm starting to think that instead of all that careful reasoning, perhaps you could just say ""here's <i>my</i> idea"" (meaning an original idea, not a copy), and start doing what a business needs to do: find customers, serve them, improve your product, etc.<p>Wouldn't all the above points follow automatically, provided you just ""did it your way""? And isn't that how so many of today's great companies started?<p>If this is true (is it? I don't know), then the idea doesn't matter at all, so long as it's <i>yours</i> (original and motivating). <i>Any thoughts on this, esp if you've read Christensen?</i>",1300015226

Musicians think about it with the starting number being one, , whereas in maths we think of the starting number as zero.<p>When you're talking about different arrangements of a triad (example, major chor C-E-G) you can have three positions - root position (C-E-G), first inversion (E-G-C) and second inversion (G-C-E).<p>Anyone with a math/cs background would wish to express these as 0-2-4, 0-2-5 and 0-3-5 respectively. It would be easier to think about music and maths concurrently theory were it so. But the guys who built the rules of music didn't think like that, so instead it's 1-3-5, 1-3-6, 1-4-6. As a result, it's harder to reuse knowledge.<p>Timings are the same. First beat in a bar is 1, but it would be better if it were zero. As a result you have to get practiced at doing maths thinking offset by one. It's like having a C for-loop constantly on your back.<p>Could be a fun geek book geeks - to answer the question, if we redesigned the rules of music based on what we know now, what would we do differently? Interval expression would be top of the list.<p>Worth considering, I'd be tempted to express the scale as an expression of twelve (including half-tones) rather than what they do at the moment, an expression of 8. Because it gives you better fractions, and avoids conditioning.<p>I think the western tradition did do an awesome job of the important stuff. For example - the number of notes in the scale. Why twelve notes instead of 15 or 32? The reason is because you get a nice toolbox of frequencies (more than were available in strict pentatonic system, or the cool pentatonic-with-bending), without it getting too complicated. The basics of harmony theory are based around fractions of a halves and (fractional) thirds, which are easy to play with mentally, but give lots of scope for messing around.<p>I'd be interested from hearing from any Indians or other traditions what they think about the respective compromises. I notice in India that mainstream music has embraced the western scale.<p>Something like Jazz would be harder in other traditions becaues the internal maths would be harder. But there's still room for hacks like blues.<p>On youtube there's a great series of music videos by Howard Goodall on music theory. Coventry Carol is one of many Christmas songs that give us a link to the past and times before modern harmony. Say goodby to your Sunday :)<p>Another thing I've been thinking - there's room for a lot of development in music now that we can have direct manipulation of the waveform. This is a new power - something that has literally only been available for a few decades. Imagine if computer programming had started with high-level languages, and we had only recently discovered assembly language.",1300014299

2318941,comment,2318492,2318492,0,0,fijter,,,"1) Job/Tech related: When starting a new project try to think of something new, something you wish to achieve. Like ""I'll switch to VIM for this project in stead of TextMate"" or ""I'll use CoffeeScript here in stead of Javascript"". This way you develop yourself further every project and it won't feel as much like you are doing the same thing all over again every time.<p>2) Start your own company / start as a freelancer. Come on, you can do it ;) It's not for everyone but ever since I've started doing this I haven't had any regret for doing it. You will have lots of extra time and freedom to try new stuff; And once you have the right clients you only need a couple of hours a week to get the same amount of money you now get working your ass off fulltime. Only do this if you know you are good at what you do. Make sure you've worked in the same field before so you know what to expect and be aware of.<p>3) Not going to work for yourself? Switch jobs once you get bored. I've seen people work at the same job for so long they go into auto pilot and they don't develop any further. In the last 5 years I've had 4 different full-time jobs, at every switch you will learn some new stuff, either tech or business related. No one ever questioned my loyalty and I've had I nice raise every time I started something new.<p>4) Some big buildings with lots of companies in it have a private parking lot with some guy in a booth checking out if you can park there (most of the time this is for suppliers or people with some kind of access card). Just approach the barrier, smile at the guy in the booth, and raise your hand. Most of the time they will just let you through. If they don't they will ask you why you are there. Just say you are delivering a package for Company X, they will let you through, no further questions asked.",1300014095
