As far as I'm aware, Intel's never been successful in those spaces and even took the strategic step of dumping its ARM (Xscale) operation.<p>My point being, if Intel's secure in established markets and uncompetitive in newer markets, that's not a technological disruption in the classic Christenson sense. It's merely the consequence of earlier strategic decisions to not go after newer low-power application markets.
