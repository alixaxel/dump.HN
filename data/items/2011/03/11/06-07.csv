2312453,comment,2309990,2312148,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The point is that you don't have to worry about the difference in Python, <i>because you don't use Python for the parts where performance matters</i>.  If you've got a million instances in your collection, you probably want to write your data structure and key traversal functions in C.  Python has a sequence protocol, so you can easily wrap it to operate on it just like a native list (which is really a vector), but the operations that need to be fast should be in heavily-optimized C.<p>In every system I've written, there's been a large chunk of code that runs on startup, or implements a feature that only 1% of users care about, or performs setup for one of these expensive operations but itself only touches a few data items.  This usually consumes about 90% of the code but only about 1% of the runtime.  Heck, probably 50% of my code never makes it to production at all, because it's exploratory or analysis code that's intended to define the problem, not implement the solution.  Why not write it in a language that makes you really productive, and spend the time saved to optimize the hell out of the remaining 10%?",1299826709

You give two reasons for not developing inside VMs:<p>* It forces you to deal with different configurations, which results in being able to move between systems more easily.\n* It's slow.<p>The problem with your argument about dependencies is it invites distraction. The cross-environment difficulties don't happen when you control; they happen on their own schedule. The proper way to make sure things are portable is to have a process for it.<p>As for the performance thing, that may or may not be an issue. It's not wise to just assume it's going to be an issue.

2312355,comment,2312064,2312234,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> Amazon is receiving an unfair competitive advantage by not paying taxes...<p>I don't understand this reasoning. They have to pay a shipping tax -- that is, regardless of the price of the item, the buyer is going to have to have it shipped to their home. If Amazon's offering free shipping, that just means they're choosing to absorb the cost, which eliminates a competitive advantage; if the buyer pays shipping, then that increases the total cost of the item, and again, that eliminates Amazon's competitive advantage.<p>I don't think this has anything to do with unfair competitive advantages, and everything to do with states simply looking for ways to grab more tax revenue ... so that they can turn around and offer it as cuts to other businesses, of course.",1299824228

2312344,comment,2310310,2311161,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps its an overstatement, but you have to recall that Google's ""I'm feeling Lucky"" button was designed to be the one page they had deduced you were looking for, their stretch goal, a results page with one link. The one they know you're looking for.<p>Now they have backed off on that, with reasoning that it is really not truly possible given that the search ""Sony XBR TV"" might be you are looking for the manual for the TV or to buy the TV or something which isn't known, but the goal is always to have the result you're looking for on the first page. That has been their target and promise for years.<p>So by creating a feature, and putting it into production, to ""block sites"" it suggests to me that they are saying ""Hey, we know our algorithm is failing and we have given up (perhaps temporarily) trying to fix it. We know it will put sites you don't want to see into the first page. Here is a manual tool to weed those out.""<p>It seems like something of a philosophy change at least. Perhaps Matt will chime in.",1299823851
