Everything a person needs are 4 walls, a roof, something to eat and someone to love.\nLets find a better sentence, something like: ""Make something which makes people smile"". While it is not catchy like the original sentence, it is a lot more accurate. A secretary will smile when presented with a better accounting software. A lumberjack will smile when given a better axe. A developer will smile when given an awesome new programming language.<p>Oh, and not to be mistaken, it is totally OK to have these people pay for things that make them smile, Disneyland also takes an entrance fee.",1300446522

I think ""Make something people need"" really means ""Make something some people are willing to pay for"". Which is nice, but more niche advice than ""Make something people want"".<p>No one wants to pay for Google search. But it's damn useful, and a great thing to have made (and led to business services that businesses need). Conversely, nobody needs any given movie or song or fiction book or game - they are largely commoditised and interchangeable before you've actually consumed them. But making movies and books and other forms of unnecessary art still makes hundreds of billions of dollars of revenues every year.<p>""Make something people want"" applies to more companies than ""Make something people need"", imho.",1300446076
