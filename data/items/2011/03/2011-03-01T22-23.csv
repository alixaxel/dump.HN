It has absolutely nothing to do with Apple's fairness in charging 30%, which is what we should all be talking about because it's a very important topic.<p>Very sorry to see this community of rationalists fall for a refutation of something that's irrelevant to the main discussion.",1299020354

Ignoring it is essentially non-web, so I suggest the label ""web-app"" is incorrect.<p>* The user-expectation of clicking the back button but expecting to remain on your one-page website sounds like a usability problem brought about by applying a non-web-like interface inside a web browser. Perhaps a better user-experience is not breaking the well-understood web-navigation model, and thus not be confusing to the user. Or perhaps these ""web-apps"" need to make it clear to the user that they deliberately don't follow the characteristics of a web resource?",1299020345

2277607,story,,,4,12,mckoss,"Ask HN: Why isn't a content addressable cache built into the Internet?",,"I have a simple internet protocol in mind. Does it already exist? If not, why not?<p>The idea is that there should be a content-addressable request protocol. By presenting a (20 byte) hash the server responds with a chunk of data (say, 2M in size) which is associate with that hash. If a publisher (NetFlix) were to offer their content using this protocol, they would transmit to each authorized viewer, a list of 500 hashes for a 1 GB movie (total size of hash list - 10K).  The client then requests each chunk by hash key in order to stream a movie.<p>Any ISP (Comcast, Level 3) seeing this protocol coming over their network, realizes that they can service a chunk request by returning the cached data, instead of forwarding it upstream to the source to fetch it over and over again. Routers could incorporate the protocol into their stack, so they can short-circuit high volume chunk requests out of a local cache (from several gigabytes to terrabytes). Once an ISP has the chunk data, they can serve it 1,000 times without requesting it from the origin server.  They can manage their cache purely based on demand for each chunk.<p>With this protocol widely in place, I think it would be possible for 100M households to simultaneously watch a movie when it becomes available for download.  I don't think that's possible using the current Internet protocols and CDN's.<p>Would this not be far superior for the network to transparently handle caching this way, rather than the messy system of CDN's we have today?<p>Does copyright law or the DMCA make it impossible to operate a system like this?",1299019974

It's naive to assume that long form marketing works like that and that those on the lower half are more receptive to the style.<p>I see two steps to understanding why long forms works and why people like us have an aversion to the method:<p>* Seeing the same things in different ways<p>* Assumptions about our place on the Internet<p><i>Seeing the same things in different ways</i><p>Take as an example the face mask adverts halfway down this A List Apart article on Whitespace in design: <a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whitespace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/whitespace</a><p>Looking at the direct mail version of the face mask advert we primarily see a bad design with no budget invested in it. We may assume that the face mask is likely to be of poor quality.<p>Others (e.g. those not versed in design theory/used to seeing nice designs… i.e. those who are not able to readily grasp why something just looks badly designed) may well see a small, honest, single-person company that didn't waste money on graphic design. He invested in the product, not the design.<p>The two designs are designed with intent; positioned differently for a different clientele. One no-less intelligent than the other, just less educated in marketing tactics and design.<p>We see the same thing in vastly different ways, drawing different conclusions about different aspects of the same offer.<p><i>Assumptions about our place on the Internet</i><p>It doesn't surprise me that long form works so well on the Internet.<p>Because we surround ourselves with people in our own social circle -- be it on Twitter, here on HN, etc. -- we forget that we are only a tiny subset of the Internet population: the subset of people who enjoy testing, reading about and discussing marketing, design, entrepreneurship, sales, psychology, etc.<p>Most purchasing and browsing on the Internet is done by those not as well-versed in these areas as us: we're out numbered by the people who know less about these topics by a huge factor.<p>They come across a long form marketing piece and good copy will snag them and bring them in, selling it to them slowly but surely.<p>When we see it: bad design!, scam!, psychological tricks!, close!  The copy doesn't get to us. It doesn't sell us. <i>It isn't positioned toward us</i>.<p>Combine this difference of opinion and our temporary delusion that everyone should be like us and you have your reason why we find it hard to comprehend why long form works so damn well.<p>- OK, my apologies for the length of this reply.

Never mind and SaaS providers not getting hosting out of that 30%.

The lack of real support for continuations (and/or coroutines) means  there is no escape from the callback hell and tracking down errors can be a real nightmare.  Ultimately for simple projects Node works fine but reach a point where your application becomes at all complex and things can get hairy real fast (of course this statement could be made about client side Javascript as well).<p>I say this not to discourage anyone from trying Node because for many projects Node may be just what you need but, there are some downsides one should probably keep in mind.",1299017735

a couple tips/ideas
- almost all brokers are not investors, they get a commission when they sell you investment products - keep that in mind.
- probably invest 80% in stuff that retains value/grows steadily and 20% in high risk/return stuff.
- real estate is probably a good investment now.  I would aim for places where a large amount of cash and ability to close quickly gives you a pricing advantage (ie vs a lot of small deals where other people bid up the price) 
- within real estate, restaurants are poor credit risks (being hit driven), commercial real estate is down right now, and residential is down except in select areas like SF.
- residential real estate is counter cyclical, ie in a boom, its bid up, in a bust, people turn to renting, so it is a solid investment (assuming the surround location is a stable economy)
- US stock market in aggregate is going to be flat, due to a structural issues.
- areas of growth include tech, so buy what you know or emerging markets, so buy a multinational with solid exposure there.
- other possibilities include ETFs (like mutual funds) are more liquid, but be careful not all ETFs follow the intended basket of investments that closely.<p>good luck,

I just wanted to tell someone, I suppose. I did not have a blog then... well I barely have one now. Also, The plan was not exactly something I could do on my own.<p>The idea was called Travel Packs. You're going to travel? Send your itinerary to Google and it will decide what you need/want to go into your luggage. Google will do all of this by using your itinerary, profile, body dimensions, weather, etc... The Travel Pack will then magically appear at your destination. When your done with your trip, just leave it behind.<p>Great things about this:<p>1) You no longer have to pack or bring luggage with you when traveling. 
2) Companies have a new way to target consumers. Imagine all of the companies who will compete to have their products placed in these packs.
3) Consumers get to try out new things without having to buy them. How about letting consumers purchase items from the Travel Pack at discounts.<p>To make this work, the clothes will have to fit. To do that we probably need 3D scans, although that may not be necessary for first iterations. Google has shown the initiative to map the world, why not drive around and start mapping the people. Just think of what you could do with these data! Of course many people would be uncomfortable with these scans and discussion probably needs to happen about who would own these data.<p>Anyway, I was once pretty stoked about this. Now I don't really care. But I think it's something that someone will do. Actually, I think there is already a company trying to make a go at pre-packaged luggage though I don't know how intelligent it is.",1299017562

Granted I haven't programmed anything harder than VB in my life, and that was 20 years ago, but I think I cam put something basic together provided there are widgets, etc.<p>So here's the question, what should I use, joomla, drupal or comentum?  Or do you have any better idea for me?<p>am i totally missing something that joomla doesnt seem that easy?<p>many thanks,
max",1299016908

2277391,comment,2274926,2274926,0,0,slavak,,,"This reminds me of a quote from Penny Arcade[1]:<p>'I mentioned to Gabe that the LendMe feature didn't extend to all books, and he was surprised to learn this, as ""lending"" a book digitally removes it from your device. It is, in many ways, like lending a person a real book. I suggested to him that this was precisely what they didn't like - you have to warp your mind to perceive it, to understand why a publisher of books would hate the book as a concept, but there you have it. They don't like that books are immutable, transferable objects whose payload never degrades. A digital ""book"" - caged on a device, licensed, not purchased - is the sort of thing that greases their mandibles with digestive enzymes.<p>Imagine what these people must think of libraries.'<p>The fact is that, scare-mongering aside, piracy doesn't seem to have nearly as big an impact on profits as the large content creators would have us believe. What worries me more is that they seem to be leveraging this fear campaign to chip away at the basic concept of ""ownership,"" pushing for a world where products are ""licensed"" rather than ""bought."" This scares me because, being rather old-fashioned, I enjoy the concept of buying a book, rather than licensing the words in that book for reading.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/12/16/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/12/16/</a>",1299016839
