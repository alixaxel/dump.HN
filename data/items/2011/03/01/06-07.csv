For example, equality of sets A and B is typically shown by saying that every element of A is in B, and every element in B is in A. <i>Why on earth do they do that? Why not just say they're the same??!</i><p>One advantage is it gives you the flexibility to demonstrate the first limb using one technique, and the second limb with a completely unrelated approach. I saw one example of showing equivalence of language defined by a class of grammars, and a language defined by constraints over sequences.
