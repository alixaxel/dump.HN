While oftentimes I think we do see engineers get marginalized in favor of ""business"" employees or designers to disastrous effect, it's important to recognize the importance of UI/UX, especially on consumer-facing products. While Apple and its extreme focus on UX is the most prominent example, many web startups have seen success due to a combination of good marketing and design (Tumblr, Facebook (vs. Myspace), Instagram, and Flipboard come immediately to mind).",1300506096

2342906,comment,2342824,2342848,0,0,jedsmith,,,"That's a bit unfair to jedberg, who actually runs the site with his operations team of two (one of them a new hire). This article and the comments are putting far too much weight on the developer, as if Reddit is a site that's constantly iterating new features. That's not to downplay his contribution, but:<p><pre><code>    * He was hired in November.

    * He works on code, and didn't get woken up during
      the last major downtime until the end (from their post
      mortem, presumably due to the DB eating itself). The
      word 'even' in ""we *even* woke up spladug"" is telling,
      that indicates to me that he doesn't wake up often.

    * Reddit is pretty much a done product, and the last
      features I can think of were meta (Gold comes to mind)
</code></pre>
He has a positive outlook[1], anyway, which the TechCrunch piece didn't seem to notice.<p>Doing operations for a site the size of Reddit with a staff of 2, on AWS, is far more impressive to me. Keeping an operation like Reddit afloat in front of that many uniques must be a pretty significant challenge. There's not a lot of depth for on-call, so I feel for their sleep.<p>On top of that, jedberg is the sole voice actively fighting for Reddit's reputation in public, since (let's be honest) the exodus looks a little suspect. Watching his comments[2] in the face of a perceivably sinking ship -- not to mention former employees who are saying quite a bit in front of an impressionable user base[3] -- is interesting, to say the least.<p>They're definitely undergoing a challenge, and I'm interested to see how they come out of it.

Not because of how much risk they're willing to accept, and not because they don't do the work to understand it. They always know what the probability of failure is. But, historically at least, they haven't been honest and forthright in taking to the public about it. In the early '80s, before the Challenger accident, they would say—and this is where I think they actually lied, I don't think that's too strong a word—they would say, ""Flying the shuttle is like flying a 727 to Disney World.""<p>That's absurd. Not only are you more likely to get killed in the shuttle than in an airplane; you're more likely to get killed going up once in the shuttle than if you had flown combat missions for two years in Vietnam. That's a statistical fact, but NASA doesn't make it clear. They might tell the House [of Representatives] that there's a 1.5 percent failure rate, but most Americans don't understand what that means. I mean, 1.5, what is that? Is that a lot? You have to relate it to something that means something to somebody. Otherwise, people have the perception that space flight is safe, and when there's an accident, they're shocked. It's like, ""We gotta stop flying."" If we want to add additional safeguards because now we're feeling emotional about it, okay, we can do that.

You can do both. For example, you can first aim to make a small exit, and/or a small recurring revenue from a lifestyle business, then, move on to try a larger exit, or add additional revenue streams. I do think the ""let's go for a huge exit, and change the world!"" on one's very first attempt, especialy if you come from humble financial background, or have significant financial dependents, is probably not wise, in the general case. You should crawl before you walk before you run. Plus if you are going to fail, don't let anybody kid you into thinking it's better to fail using millions of dollars of other people's money than to fail with just a few hundred of your own. It's nice to have the ability to quietly bury your mistakes. You still get the upside of learning from them, but with less of the downside.<p>Side note: Ack, just got bitten by the ""Unknown or expired link"" flaw with HN. Paul, man, what is with that? Bad user experience. Don't tase my flow, bro! :)",1300503974

RDS has really good replication which is really hard to configure and set up yourself. And having configured Hadoop I know it takes more than 5 minutes :) Perhaps Whirr makes that easier. Also, EMR's Hadoop is tuned to work really well with S3, which you don't get with stock Hadoop (or even with Cloudera's).",1300503607
