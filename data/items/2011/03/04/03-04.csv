Proprietary vs open source TCO studies always tend to disagree depending on who's funding the study, and that's ok. If you're  $_MEGA_CORP with an IT strategy that's working for you, there's no need to rock the boat. Where open source really shines is in enabling the smaller guys to be able to keep up with the bigger guys, and numbers-wise, there's a lot more of us smaller guys which means that there will be a healthy open source ecosystem for years to come.<p>I agree with the author that open standards are important, and if governments can achieve that with proprietary software then that may be ok, but unfortunately with the mess that was OOXML, I don't know if I can trust a proprietary company like Microsoft to choose open standards when these open standards make for less vendor lock-in as opposed to more.",1299211032

That decision was (presumably) based on maximizing application performance for users - but plenty of non-obj-C applications can perform quickly enough, so they went back and allowed them.  And more applications means more sales means more money for Apple.<p>It's equivalent to sharecroppers first preventing use of externally-developed tools, then discovering that they could make <i>more</i> money if they allowed them.  I don't see a comparable situation in Apple pulling 30% from subscriptions.<p>I do think that 30% is a bit high, as they're recurring sources of revenue and people tend to decide ""$1/month?  sure.  It's cheaper than that $10 app."" and then keep it for two years rather than switch to the $10 and waste a buck.  People are pretty predictable in this manner - just look at WoW.",1299210587

Neither are logical or sensible, but I believe one begets the other.<p>If you don't overly care about Apple and the only news you hear is either ""Apple did this"" and ""I WANT APPLES BABIES"", you will start to form an overly critical view, because the news seems to always tend towards hype.<p>And then some people (with the same fanboyish mindset as the fanboys) will start to take it too far, still as a backlash, but still just as ridiculous.  You only get raging haters by either spectacular failure of delivery OR by having raging fans.  People seek to balance by becoming unbalanced.  I am guilty of this.  I suspect a great many people are.<p>People don't like being told that someone else is better then they are, especially when it's something they hold dear.  Geeks, therefore, do not like being told that they are a poorer person for making different technology choices.  This is not news, see Vim VS Emacs.  As fanboyism can be quite judgmental, this gets on people's nerves, and they become defensive, lashing out at the ""Cause"" (being Apple).  The fanboys feel that their identity is being attacked, and they fight back with equal fervor.<p>None of this is rational or even useful, but it's just a product of social human nature.<p>(You're right, they big enough to fight their own battles, and they're big enough to toot their own horn, but people will do it for them, so people will do it against them.)",1299210297

They were increasingly unable to compete in the high-end UNIX server market against IBM. The Rock processor was constantly delayed. Their machines fell behind in performance, Solaris was harder to manage and less stable than AIX.<p>2) Inability to capitalize on their inventions. IBM used Java as a common language across all of their enterprise platforms, they sold Websphere as a common application platform. NetApp was able to build a large business off NFS.<p>3) Linux/Intel got a lot better on the low end, Sun could not give a good reason why their platform was worth the additional cost. Usually when you are disrupted on the low end, you move upmarket, but due to 1) they were unable to take this path.<p>4) Muddled strategy: they dabbled in a lot of things-storage, office suites, mysql, etc. It was hard to tell if they loved or hated open source at times. They spent years battling Microsoft in the press. They had 2-3 different virtualization technologies. Some of the best Fake Steve Jobs posts are when he ripped into Sun.<p>5) Even if they were able to execute, their niche was becoming less viable. A mid-tier hardware manufacturer using a proprietary operating system is not a good position to be in.

I was just stuck with a bad board.<p>Why?\nFirst it had a track record for organizational incompetence. I should have known better but few of my predecessors especially the more competent ones had had a good experience in that position. They had all warned me when I began but in my naivete and exuberance I still took the position and assumed I could change everything. Second, after I left, one by one the board turned over and it became very obvious that I had simply been shouldering too much personal responsibility with making sure our organization ran smoothly. I ended up still having to advice the organization from the outside after resigning.<p>Most importantly, till this day, I still have a good relationship with many of the more competent people in the organization (many of whom were recruited by me). The organization remains moribund however, bound together only by the strings of infrastructure (and personnel) I left behind.<p>Nonetheless, I think the more useful point I have to admit you make is that when you are joining an existing committee or group of people, there is a bit of compromise that goes on. To that, I say, make sure you check the background of the people you are working with before taking up any position. If they are people with a track record for incompetence or failure (in my case the fact that many of the people I was working with had been staff with this organization for several years should have been a warning signal),don't accept the position.

MS has a testing framework and a build tool that are basically a generic xunit and an ant clone. Now, there are a great many better xunit implementations on .net, and I think we can all agree at this point that xml isn't the greatest programming language for build scripts. I was pointing out various choices that beat out the MS ones in terms of community, maturity, and features. His argument was basically that if MS doesn't have the best product, eventually they will make it better and it will become the best.<p>Every community has strengths and weaknesses. IMO the big weakness of the .net community is also the worst thing about MS itself from a tech point of view - a real unwillingness to look at what everyone else in the world is doing. Because of that, you see this strange effect where enterprise trends seem to happen about 5 years later in .net then they do in other communities. For example, it is only extremely recently (like in the last two years) that it started to become normal for .net shops to use ORMs, and the hot debates over whether or not to unit test are just starting to die down. And it is really in the last year that the most bleeding edge shops have started to look at DCVS (the cutting edge ones are on svn, and the majority on a cvs type system).<p>And for the record, I don't think .net is a bad platform or anything like that. What I do think is that the single thing that could improve most .net shops is being more open to non ms technology.",1299207981
