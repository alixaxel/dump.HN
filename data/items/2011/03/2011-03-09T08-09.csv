At the height of the reign of Windows the landscape as far as the competition goes was extremely different. To point out one of the many contrasts - Apple did not have the kind of money it has today or the strong auxiliary channels: apps, music, ebooks etc to support its main product line.<p>I don't think anyone can say the world is going to be 90% Android or 90% iOS as far as handhelds are concerned.

Obviously Git's is ""legit"" because, as you say, that's how it was designed.  But I'm against such designs.<p>You can't use Git completely without a GUI [1] and not having everything in a GUI means I'm forever typing some command and then typing another command (or several) to make sure what I expect is actually what happened.  To ""visualize"", if you will.  In a GUI I could just see it and this would save a lot of time.<p>[1]  Diffs are visual (vi is a GUI).  I'm sure some clown will show how it's possible to use ed or something so you can really do everything without a GUI, but the effort that will take demonstrates my point nicely.",1299657685

StackOverflow is more sophisticated than the clone-it-in-a-weekend crowd gives it credit for, but even if it were Baby's First CRUD App, it would be Baby's First CRUD App Which Contributes Hundreds Of Millions In Productivity To Developers.  That community and their accumulated knowledge have value even if the technology is a hacked-together Wordpress plugin (and again, it isn't).<p>It is an open question whether they successfully move beyond developers.  If they do, gadzooks, good news for the world.  There are similar expert questions with canonical right answers which are a) difficult to find at present and b) extraordinarily consequential for people.<p>I had two canonical examples in recent weeks on tax and visa questions, for myself and other people.  Answering one took a week of research and directly lead to $5,000 in my pocket.  It is ungoogleable at present.  The one asked by a friend of mine is similarly ungoogleable, the right answer is easy but nonobvious and virtually undocumented, and many of the <i>numerous</i> wrong answers lead to <i>deportation</i>.",1299657646
