Technical?  No.  Emotional?  Yes.  Only a small fraction of the population is very technical, but a huge fraction is quite emotional.  So, the ""message"" was all emotionalism and not rationalism and certainly not rationalism about technology.<p>Generally, then for any person A who works in field X, actually to get paid in field X the person A has to know something about field X, know more than the LCD of some audience of millions independent of X. Then when person A reads some old media LCD content about X, they conclude that the writer didn't know anything about X and once again tosses aside old media.<p>Here on HN we see the pattern clearly:  It's super tough to find anyone writing for old media who can write as much as a single, significantly meaningful paragraph on computing without looking uninformed on computing.<p>So we are seeing ""the medium is the message"" again:  Now the ""medium"" is the Internet which permits focused content from experts in that content, and the role of 'generalist writers' using formula fiction to grab people emotionally with LCD content is fading away.<p>With irony, Dear Vanity Fair:  This time the sky actually is falling, on old media.<p>'Vanity Fair' RIP.",1299231758

I agree with the Gruber of 6 months ago who thought that phones and tablets would merge into the same product category, which he called ""tablets"" and I'll call ""webpads"" since I think that's the key distinction between them and the Microsoft tablets and smartphones that preceded them.<p>Apple thinks there will be 3.5 inch webpads, and 10 inch webpads and that they are two totally distinct markets, so it doesn't matter if you lose share in one of them. Everyone else thinks you can have 3.5, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 even 12 inch webpads and that they're made from 99% the same commodity hardware and software.<p>Android is in the process of returning Apple to single digit marketshare in the small webpad category, a story that tech churnalists have missed because they live in a rich, old, white, U.S.-centric, gadget-obsessed bubble.

Just carrying out normal actions in the Earth's gravitational field, putting your body through all the natural ranges of motion it's capable of doing, is actually pretty darn adequate, and can build muscle and improve figure and physical capabilities.
