They are expected to stick to the script, because they typically don't know enough to go off-script. It can make an individual call longer, but it makes most calls shorter by standardizing the procedures that fix most cases.<p>The scripts are designed for solving issues that novice users have. That said, you are putting the rep in a position of possibly getting disciplined if you try to force them off script. At least at some of the places I've worked in the past.

So many people think the internet operates independently of the principles of economics. Well, it doesn't.<p>And I also don't feel the analogy is apt. To use the well-worn metaphor of Twitter as cocktail party, it's like having a conversation with your friend about, say, Arduino's, and having the host, whom you don't know, walk by and say ""Oh yeah website X is having a great sale on those"", and then they're off again to serve Jell-O shots.

Many young people worked in cities and larger towns (and only their parents had homes in rural areas).<p>Zanu-PF is strong in rural areas. The reason for this are numerous - it is much easier to co-opt tribal leadership, easier to organize genocide (e.g. Gukurukundi) and more difficult for opposition groups to organize in rural areas. The opposition (Movement for Democratic Change) had its roots in the trade union movement - which was undoubtedly urban.<p>By destroying the formal economy and urban settlements (e.g. Murambatsvina) Mugabe forced urban people to do one of two things:\n1. Become illegal immigrants in South Africa.\n2. Become subsistence farmers in rural areas.<p>With this he accomplished his goals – illegal immigrants in other countries can’t vote and those in rural areas came under his power.<p>So this is what you are sitting with now: a large formerly urban population busying itself with subsistence farming to try and eek out a living (while living in squalor with a low life expectancy).<p>> the american smartass bribed corrupted local government to let him shoot the elephant.<p>There are actually two problems. Firstly, all Zimbabwean game farms are basically completely poached of animals. People need food and bushmeat is as good as any.<p>Secondly, expensive game (such as Rhino) was hunted illegally.<p>I doubt the second case is of concern – since elephants are not that expensive.",1301610125

Design isn't one of them, here is why:<p>The site and its team have shown a specific arrogance over voices of dissension about their design. Visually there are aspects of the design that make it difficult for people to use - the choice of colors for the text, the size of the fonts, and the contrast make it tough to quickly sort the information provided.<p>Their topic management system is difficult to use. The search box hijacks what you're typing and provides no easy way to get the cursor back.<p>The topics and threading of comments has issues as well. Topics lump a large number of content into a singular bucket, and though you can apply multiple topics to a question, you cannot filter responses in a given topic.<p>Commenting is limited to singular responses, non threaded conversations and are far too easily buried.<p>Architecturally the site suffers from sever performance problems when there are a large number of answers to a give question. See this post on companies hiring in the SF Bay, which on many machines will crash the browser.<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Which-startups-are-hiring-in-the-San-Francisco-Bay-Area"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Which-startups-are-hiring-in-the-San-Fr...</a>?<p>Typical browser behavior gets hijacked/broken as well - HOME and END keys no longer work, and at times, scrolling seems to break.<p>The Quora Search Bar, though, does provide good snappy returns of questions that have been asked from all topics that contain the words you enter. So I like that feature.<p>Overall though, I don't know what gasses fill the echo-chamber these folks design in, but I surely think they are high if thy think the site is stellar.<p>Further, why do the facebook alum feel like facebook blue is the best color to use? I hate it - and simply adopting design elements from your previous employer doesn't show me that you're a great designer.<p>Also, in this presentation she says ""Concentrate on what matters most: purpose and goals"" yet they seem to shoot down any criticism of their design decisions as quickly as possible, as opposed to hearing what others think. So, if the purpose and goal is to make a site that is instantly useful, responsive and navigable - isn't it a good idea to see what users are saying about it and take criticism?<p>I really like Quora, but it is in its infancy - I refuse to jump on the bandwagon that believes this thing came out of the gate mature and tested over the years.<p>You want to see a site that has an unbelievably good user experience? Spend some time on Reddit. Damn good design -- oh and guess what, they implement pretty much every great UI/UX idea that users submit -- for example, submitter highlighting in the comments thread is just one.",1301609798

The ITMS volume or seeing how piracy in US has been declining steadily are good indicators.<p>People go towards piracy when the system doesn't satisfy their requirements. Downloading a pirated movie is not as easy as it is to pay Netflix $10/month to have a vast catalog of instant streaming options. There is no comparative service that is free (legally or illegally). It's also argubly easier since you don't have to choose the format of the movie you are downloading or the encoder or several other options while being unsure wether it will play on your PS3 or XBox.<p>If you create an intuitive and reasonable system for consumers to operate it's very likely that they'll stop looking towards a sub-par alternative like pirating things.<p>A couple of examples:<p>Why should I care, as a consumer, that Hulu hasn't reached a deal to stream some TvShows to my PS3 but did reach it for the Web site? It doesn't make any sense to anybody but those who profit from this. How can this be helpful? People got Hulu Plus with the idea that everything would have been available on the PS3 and then some more, but this wasn't the case. This is a frustrated consumer whose demand couldn't be met not because of lack of technical capability or just impossibility. It's really just because of obscure business deals that have nothing reasonable attached to them from a consumer point of view.<p>The same could be said about music releases that are not international. What is the point of this? How is it that a UK consumer can listen to a given album while a US consumer can't (and vice-versa)? Provided both want to pay its full price.<p>People go towards piracy as a last resort, not as a first step, it's almost a precious feedback mechanism that tells the market what people really want.<p>You can of course dismiss all of this by simply saying that the consumer has no right to decide whether he agrees or not with the business decision.

Google had room on their clean results pages to place ads, and they also had users that were used to skimming and overlooking a lot of the text on the page anyway. Ads were not a huge problem for google. Twitter's app users don't have the space on their feeds for a few square centimeters of ad space, especially because we don't skim and skip over tweets (unless they look like the have lots of @s and #s). Tweets are like prepackaged feelings already. Someone who barely read tweets would have nothing left to intake. Twitter needs to find a way to place ads without taking up space or annoying reading time. That, or find a place on the page which doesn't LOOK like its taking up space. Meaning, if the bottom cm is always an ad, it isn't dropping down into my tweets. I just have a slightly smaller screen, which I will acclimate to quickly and won't annoy me regularly. Also, the ads can be more expensive that way.

Some 7 or 8 years ago we had an Microsoft Access based database that had morphed through several versions of Access. It was a complex database and had one major flaw, when the interface opened up it opened in an actual record - users tended to start data entry on top of an existing record plus other features that annoyed the heck out of the users. Our IT was centralised but we also did some local support (by me), untrained but with hands on experience. So one day - April 1 - I sent out an email advising of a new interface which could be used for most purposes which overcame these problems and asked people to register for training by lunch time. The new interface was called Lirpa1 - 1 April backwards, and another name - Devil - as our normal interface was called GODS. I mentioned this to one person, luckily, because they suggested I tell second boss up as a precaution.<p>Apart from catching those who could reasonably expect to be caught, three things happened. First, I came back from getting a coffee and first boss up, whom I would describe as a female agressive bikie moll type protecting her authority, was standing by my door with second boss who had been talking to her. Neither admitted it outright (second boss hinted several years later) but first boss up had turned up to yell at me for announcing a major change without her authority and to ask what the f. I was doing etc., etc. and second boss had stopped the outburst in time :) Second, one of our data analysts, who should have known better, at a meeting several days later praised this initiative. By that time everyone else knew about the joke but didn't know where to look during this praise. Third, and this took me several years to realise the probable cause, some four or five months later the data analysts were given access to the background tables which allowed them to run proper queries and reports without all the glitches.

One of the best interfaces I've used as it doesn't try to abstract the DNS records from you. That was one of my biggest issues with 1&1 and godaddy - their interface made it so that I never knew exactly what my DNS settings were, just what the spoon-fed messages that I was given told me. The only ""abstracted"" thing that they do is provide a one-click solution for setting the dns entries for google apps (which you can still manually edit, as they appear in your DNS records). Here's some screenshots of the backend:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/F5j5m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/F5j5m.jpg</a><p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/rx3uq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/rx3uq.jpg</a><p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/vGwwz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/vGwwz.jpg</a><p>Seriously, try it. I liked them so much that I paid to have my other domains transfered to them. That alone should show you how much I enjoy it over the others I've tried.",1301609091
