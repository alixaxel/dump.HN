A reasonably competent developer has several options to choose from - it's just not rational to spend 10+ hours on each job opening; you wouldn't be able to coordinate and assess 5 or so offers in a reasonable time (when looking for a new job, people will apply at various places, compare the offers and take the best one).<p>Most competent people would scoff at a suggestion like this, and I suspect that competent employers know it.",1301479192

As the userbase continues to grow though, there will come a time when running their own infrastructure will work out cheaper and more flexible and they might be able to profit from it the same way Amazon do (remember: Amazon's ""cloud"" services came about from wanting a way to make profitable (or at least cost neutral) use of all their spare capacity in the quieter ten months of the year), so they would be daft not to at least have some embryonic plans simmering away on their R&D people's back burners.",1301478883

Then I would recommend to do some contracting work. This has two nice effects: First, it gives you money to let you support your startup in the long run. Second: It makes you more productive, because the time you have available to work on a startup is reduced. This constraint makes you focus more on the stuff that really needs to be done. Oh and third: Every idea needs time to evolve. I mean, real time. Not time you invest, but time doing something different.

Paciolan is a separate system that was licensed by venues so they could run their own ticketing system. TM bought them out a few years ago.<p>The good news: most Paciolan systems are still out in the field, and the system itself is fairly well-documented, so if you contact the internal ticketing agent for a Paciolan venue, odds are good they can give you access to the API.<p>The bad news: Classic and Archtics are very, very closed. Classic is actually a green-screen application that's been adapted to the web and whatever else. For the most part, the backend still thinks it's talking to a tty. Archtics is somewhat less ancient - I guess it's only 15 years old now. But it, too, isn't really current by any stretch of the imagination.<p>At LN, we were TM's biggest customer by a mile, and even we couldn't get them to give us decent APIs. So I wouldn't hold your breath. Plus, about a third of all venues have their systems out in the field, so you have to connect to them directly. On top of that, the promoters (the primary customers of ticketing) aren't too keen on the data being out there.<p>If you're just looking for venue information, contact Pollstar. They sell a well-maintained list of venues and important venue info.<p>If you need more info, my email should be visible in my profile.",1301477925

Joe Schmo has seen too many zombie-virus movies and/or puts too much trust in things like Prince Commudgen's uninformed ramblings about grey goo, to trust anything they don't understand. Don't get me wrong: a fistful or few of such distrust is healthy for society, but from a commercial point of view it is just a potentially expensive problem to overcome.<p>They would also hit the nutty god botherer problem: this might only be a virus (and a modification of one, not the creation of one from scratch) but it could be seen as creating new life, something only the bi-polar sky fairy is permitted to dabble in.<p>And back to the impossibility of creating something that definitely won't have side effects for the patient and those around them: the companies need to be sure that the potential clean-up costs (i.e. litigation) or more than covered by the guaranteed profits - otherwise it is just safer to stick with the current treatment/business model, at least while it is turning a good profit.<p>(A quick note on my use of ""nutty god botherer"" and ""bi-polar sky fairy"" as they have caused heated discussion before: the many religious people I know, and I presume other otherwise sensible ones, take those as facetious jokey definitions (i.e. as they are intended) - the people who get offended by this sort of thing tend to be people I don't mind offending!)",1301476874

I'm not sure if it's because we are family, but we've always had a policy (not written down or set in stone) but that if one of us wants some time off then we do.<p>We pretty much do normal hours (10 - 6), we still work a few evenings, but we're now both full time so haven't got the added stress of a 'day job'.  It was always our dream to be able to work full time on our startup and now that's a reality there is honestly no other job i'd rather be doing.  We both get to see our kids everyday, i'm due to be taking my eldest (4) swimming at lunch.<p>Based on my experience (every startup is different), we do live and breath it, but at the same time we always make time for family, holidays and anything else we want to do (taking the kids for days out, nursery, the gym).  Our startup is actually doing better than ever and I personally feel that because we put in all the work in the first few years whilst holding down a full time job we are now in a position to be able to enjoy the fruits of our labour and have a great work/life balance.",1301476341

Is it really about creating an app? The app/startup will be forgotten at some point in time anyways. So why are you doing it, if it isn't for the personal freedom that comes along with a startup (eventually) and that enables you to spend more time with the people you care about?<p>I mean, it is just a startup. The people might care to some degree about your product, but they don't care about you at all and you shouldn't care too much either.<p>I know that the ""work hard"" mantra is ridiculously widespread in the startup culture and especially in the US and I also know the feeling that one's mind always comes up with new ideas, whether you want it or not.<p>However, I prefer to work on my startup 5 to 10 hours a week, just enough to get decent money from it, be ahead of competitors and make plans or delegate the work that needs to be done.<p>I think the real trick in startups is not to spend as much time as possible, but as few time as possible and still get good results.
