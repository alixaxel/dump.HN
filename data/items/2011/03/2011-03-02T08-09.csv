""Co-opted"" is a technical term in disruption, meaning that the incumbents absorb the new approach instead of being replaced (i.e. disrupted) by them. At one time, there was a lot of talk about ""disintermediation"", where publishers and other middlemen between producer and consumer would disappear. That hasn't happened. The closest is iTunes and amazon, which disrupted retailers.<p>Although there is a long-tail, where it presumably is happening, it seems that we still need filters. Even more so, people often want whatever everybody else wants, just because they want it. They want to fit in, conform, be part of something greater than themselves, rather than <i>be</i> themselves. This is possibly (I have no idea) most true of Mr. Biebers' primary demographic, tween girls. This popularity for its own sake is where centralized music publishers are strongest, and disintermediated serving of the long-tail is weakest.",1299056397

Very tough call, but no doubt the necessary call to make, if he wants to turn Mahalo into a going concern.<p>I suggest that he doesn't go around bragging about how he only wants 'winners' and he expects everybody to give 80 hour weeks and all that non-sense. Giving someone free food, and a 'free chef', doesn't make up for demanding 80-hour weeks no matter what they tell you.<p>I think he should just shut up, and set an example through deeds - because at the end of the day, 10% of the staff can (and should) get cut when revenue tanks. Acting like it won't happen and they will have a big payday if the company gets bought or goes public is disingenuous at best, and deceitful/fraudulent at worst.<p>That being said, I don't think he should discourage people from working that long - on the occasion when they have a deadline to hit or something.<p>But just be more responsible with the rhetoric, is all I am saying.

2278895,comment,2277831,2277831,0,0,bugsy,,,"You know, I bet the cocaine fiend guy wasn't even on cocaine. How would the company know this? If they had insurance coverage and he went into rehab it would be seriously violation of medical privacy for this to be revealed to the company. If he did go into rehab, the article author would have mentioned it given that he claims to know all about the guy's cocaine habit as well as his mental health history, which he is now disclosing in public. Boy I would hate to have a former employer get on the internet and post articles about how they think I have a cocaine addiction. I suspect it was all speculation, and probably wrong. Though when cornered, to save face, the author would likely deny all this and claim to have proof.<p>I took that one a bit personally myself as I could relate to it. Let me tell you how that went down with me. Went to work for a company, gave it my all. Did in 3 days what took other employees six months, and with fewer bugs and faster performance. The company rode me hard, demanded I worked more and more. Soon I was responsible for nearly all the critical projects. I was working 16 hours a day 7 days a week. My boss refused to let me even take Sundays off because of the crisis. Yet my salary was based on 40 hrs a week, no overtime, so when I figured my effective hourly rate if I was a hourly worker, it was less than I could make in fast food. Finally after a year of this I cracked and got very sick, suffering total exhaustion. I could not come in to work. The work then fired me. I later hear them tell people they suspected I had a drug problem.<p>So yeah, maybe I was even the guy he is talking about. Who knows. There were no drugs though.<p>That was the first couple jobs out of college. After that I wised up and started setting boundaries. But eventually I had to strike out on my own because too many companies will take advantage of diligent workers.<p>Looking back at it all I see it like a rich guy that buys an expensive race horse and then runs the horse in every race he can find without rests between until the race horse collapses, and then he sends the horse off to the glue factory with no loyalty to what the horse won him. Another example is the spoiled trust fund kid that buys a ferrari and drives it around and never changes the oil and after a year the engine freezes up, a total loss. This is just stupidity and failure to manage your investment properly. There are a lot of managers out there like this. Any company that routinely requires overtime is a company that has failed and is run by incompetent management. When the overtime is required of employees who don't even get paid overtime it makes the whole thing just that more abusive and exploitative. This all is especially absurd for those of us that produce at 10-30 times the rate and quality of the average developers. I always would find it infuriating to be told I must work 112 hours in a week during which I would write some 8,500 lines of complex code and there is another guy paid the same who writes 13 lines in the same week and goes home after 40 hours because his contributions aren't all that important anyway so no point in keeping him late.<p>Anyone in this situation do as I did. Leave and start your own company.",1299055963

Any further questions grew organically from answers to the questions in this video.<p>For us, they made a big point of knowing that our market really existed, even though no company was targeting it yet. In fact, our lack of solid evidence of the market is the main reason for our rejection (W11). However, maybe this was only such a large focus because it was our biggest weakness, and other interviews focus on other things.<p>Keep in mind that the interview is only 15 minutes, so there don't need to be many questions...",1299053468

I've been reading HN for a while and never really submitted anything or asked any questions but I seem to be in need of some advice.<p>I'm a volunteer webmaster for a small non-profit.  I've setup the website with Drupal on a small Linode instance.  We really have a very small amount of traffic ( 80 - 150 visits per day ) to the website.  Some people come through looking at who we are, our history, and specifically, people use it to register for events and classes.<p>We've been looking to boost attendance to our classes and have ended up somehow being featured on a popular local deals website ( groupon, living social, tippr, etc. )  I'd be less cryptic but since I wasn't involved in the deal making process I really have absolutely no idea how much I'm allowed to say about the upcoming deal.<p>I'm a professional rails developer and a Drupal novice.  I chose Drupal because other board members wanted to edit content and I didn't want to build out a CMS.  In hindsight, I really should have gone with Rails.  There's something to be said for just doing what you know rather than going with something that is ""better"" for the job - especially when you don't have a whole lot of time to devote to learning a new technology.<p>My questions are these:<p>1) I have no idea how much traffic people generally get from deals like these.  Can someone enlighten me?<p>2)  Do any of you php/drupal folks know what I can reliably run off of a small Linode with the increase in site traffic because of this featured deal.<p>3)  I'm considering replacing the entire website with rails site with essentially 3 pages: An about page, A class description / what to expect page, and a registration page.  This would be a super focused site and I'm wondering how much success people have had ( especially with respect to local/social deals ) with a 3 page setup like this.",1299053383
