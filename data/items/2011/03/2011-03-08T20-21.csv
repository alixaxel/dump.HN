Its interface is very web 1.0-ish, and in virtue of that, very fast and responsive.<p>It's definitely rather low-level in the sense that it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot with it.  It's like programming in C instead of C# or Java.  It requires understanding double-entry accounting and GAAP at a fairly erudite fundamental level, because unlike QuickBooks, there are no glossy splash screens or inline thought balloons to teach you Accounting 101.  It's also lacking in many high-level features such as a payroll module, and has fairly rudimentary stubs for many others.  It is, however, quite good at managing parts, assembles and inventory if tangible goods are your thing.  It's a little more problematic for a service company;  outside of AR and AP, I tend to think of it as little more than just a general ledger.  That may not be giving it enough credit, though;  it does have quite a lot of features.<p>Nevertheless, it is a great tool for a startup comfortable with using home-grown open-source solutions.",1299617925

Again, I never said that the solution was to force children to fend for themselves from 12 years old, or your latest number, 13.<p>What I said was: ""What's evolutionarily normal is to have children who are surrounded by, and interact mostly, with adults, in a group where many of the people are your family. The adults bring you up to their level.""<p>And ""How can you learn that stupidity leads to crisis if you're never allowed to make your own decisions?""<p>Children from impoverished backgrounds in the United States are raised, such as it is, with incredible differences compared to children of well-off parents. They have a ""30 million word gap"" in terms of words spoken to them. They are not asked questions that cause them to think. They do not receive adequate nutrition.<p>You can't compare a poor child whose parents ignored him with a middle class child whose parents let him make his own decisions, like whether or not to do his homework, go to bed at a reasonable hour, earn and spend his own money, pay for some of his own bills, prepare his own lunches & do his own laundry, make dinner for the rest of the family, clean his room or not, work at a meaningful apprenticeship, date who he wanted when he felt ready to date, get piercings or dye hair, wear what he wants, etc.<p>In short: you are a troll.

[Part 1 - Technology]",http://geekomaniac.com/,"Over the next few days, I hope to publish a 4-part series on answering the question: Why isn't Singapore as entrepreneurial as Israel?<p>It is a mystery, especially for a Singaporean like me. Both nations have limited natural resources, rely heavily on its manpower for its growth. Yet, why is it that the Singapore government is struggling to make its citizen create its own jobs?<p>Back in May 2010, I had the opportunity to embark on a 10-days trip to Israel, to investigate the reasons behind its entrepreneurial economy.<p>Introduction:<p>From my internship stint at the Singapore's Ministry of Trade, I learnt about successful Israel’s Yozma fund, and unsuccessful TIF Ventures in Singapore. Ever since then, I realized that the Singapore government has been mimicking what the Israeli government does. I signed up for Israel BSM to find out the real reasons behind Israel’s booming entrepreneurship ecosystem and why Singapore is not on par. On the 26th April, as I boarded the plane to Tel Aviv, all geared up to answer two main questions – (1) What were the historical differences that led to the today’s difference in entrepreneurship culture; (2) Is Singapore on the right track on becoming where Israel is today. As identified by Asaf Barnea, CEO of Kinrot Ventures, apart from funding, there are three main factors that make a start-up – technology, market needs and people. In reflection of the historical differences between Israel and Singapore, I will be structuring my thoughts around these four main factors.<p>Innovation & Education<p>As we visited the biblical and historical sites, I realized that the Israelis’ ability to innovate and cater to underserved markets was a result of necessity. Agriculture and water technologies were developed in response to daily survival consumption needs. For example, during the Canaanites inhabitation, an extensive water tunnel was built to access water from the faraway Gihon Spring. In addition, being the geographical land bridge between Africa, Europe and Asia, and the centre of religious conflicts, the nation was constantly attacked. These military threats and pivotal moments such as the French embargo on Israel caused the nation to kick-start its own defence technologies. Singapore on the other hand, had a less pressing need to innovate for self-sustenance. During the starting years, our homeland was fortunate to have a tropical climate for fruits and access to seawater for water and fish. Singapore has also been far less experienced in warfare. Even in times of war, it was the British government who provided majority of the weapons and manpower needed.<p>There are however, two traits that are similar for both Israel and Singapore. Firstly, both countries placed high importance of education. Due to the Jewish religious purposes, traditionally, boys were made to study religious text in a comprehensive manner from a very young age. This practice is still present in modern times. Even David, our tour guide, has ever brought his son up to the mountains to study the bible together. This attitude towards education has its immense impact on entrepreneurship in modern times. In Technion University, we were introduced to the president of the entrepreneurship club who at only 28 years old has over 10 years of experience in start-ups. His secret was that at 6 years old, he was already reading his father’s computer programming books. Singapore, being an Asia country, had also placed strong emphasis on education in their children. However, unlike the Israelis, during the 1940s to 1960s, prior to entering formal school, parents emphasized on their children hands-on skills to work or help at the family business.<p>Talent pool<p>Last but not least, both countries had an influx of foreigners. During the fifth Aliyah movement, many Diasporas returned from Germany and Austria as professionals in the field of medicine, science, finance and arts. This propelled the agriculture and high-tech industry in Israel. Singapore’s immigrants however, were mostly uneducated, with backgrounds in commerce, textiles and labour-intensive industries. There could have been insufficient individuals with technical know-how to spin off a high-tech industry even if they wanted to.<p>Next post: Comparison on ""People and Market needs""",1299616362

2302481,comment,2299409,2300236,0,0,Goladus,,,"The original example is actually kind of bad and doesn't demonstrate puppet's abstraction facilities.<p>You can define a custom resource, for example ""system_file"" that provides a default ""root:root, mask 444"" permissions such that you just have to define a source and destination for every file, overriding the default permissions when you want.<p>define system_file($mode = 444, $owner = root, $group = root, $content = '', $source = '', $ensure = 'present') {<p><pre><code>        file { $name:
                owner => $owner,
                group => $group,
                mode => $mode,
                ensure => $ensure
        }

        if $source != '' { File[$name] { source => $source } }
        if $content != '' { File[$name] { content => $content } }

 }
</code></pre>
So in the article's example, it would look like this:<p><pre><code>        system_file { ""/etc/ntp.conf"":
            source => ""puppet:///ntpd/ntp.conf"",
            require => Package[""ntp""]
        }
</code></pre>
Or even<p><pre><code>        system_file { ""/etc/ntp.conf"":
            source => ""$configfiles/ntpd/ntp.conf"",
            require => Package[""ntp""]
        }
</code></pre>
Where $configfiles might be the puppet server or some other location.  One of the things you get with puppet is access to any of the local host properties that can be discovered with facter, so you can dynamically configure something like a source file.",1299616292

I know that Google always seems like they're on our side over infrastructure things - but that might simply be because they aren't building that infrastructure.<p>It's possible that Google would bring excellence to consumer infrastructure as well.  However, they haven't run an ISP, cable company, wireless company, home broadband, or other regulated consumer infrastructure project.  That doesn't mean they wouldn't be up to the challenge, it's more a question of why you believe they'd do better?  They talk a nice game of unlimited, high-speed broadband, but that's easy when you're not the one paying to provide it.<p>Google also had the option to purchase the open-access 700MHz spectrum and once the reserve price was met, decided that they didn't want to be in the consumer-facing communications infrastructure game.  If they didn't want to become a wireless company a couple years ago, what would have changed to make them want to become one now?<p>Google has a strong staff and it would, at the very least, be interesting to see how they would fare as a company.  Would they decide to forgo the profits one receives for pushing things like Blockbuster Mobile onto their smartphones?  Would they push faster technology faster?  Would they decide that limits were wrong to put on users?  Would they decide to forgo subsidised phones and offer much lower priced plans?",1299616026
