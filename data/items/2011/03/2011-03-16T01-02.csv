2330353,comment,2329196,2330230,0,0,kunle,,,"The idea is to be robust around groups, and to be dead simple. So as a beta, I only use facebook because quite honestly that was the easiest way for me to get the product out fast, and get feedback.<p>The key differentiator between this and facebook (right now) is that the album is shared i.e. multiple people who were in the same place/event, and shared the same experience, also share the same album. Basically perfect anytime several people do something together and want to have access to everyone's photos, to share, to print, to store, whatever.<p>Our mobile app will extend this functionality live to events happening in real time and will be a way for hundreds of people, taking pictures at the same event, to have all their photos (instagram/picplz etc) in the same album - the end value in this is that it becomes an additional discovery mechanism for people with similar interests.<p>It's important that we break away from a facebook login for example, but this is really the crux of my question; my goal is to build something robust that a lot of people can use, and I'm torn between depth and breadth; depth being making it more useful to the people currently on it for now (and focusing on functionality/UI before acquiring users) or building out features more slowly, and focusing on acquiring more users.<p>If we focus on depth, we'll have a better product sooner, but less users for now, which means less feedback to react to, less traction etc. If we focus on breadth, it will mean more users more quickly, but it will take longer to realize the vision.",1300240762

For the first time in my life I have though it would be nice to not live alone so its not so isolating.<p>I love being able to focus at home in a way that I never could in previous work environments so I don't want to give it up.  My suggestion is to move into a larger place if you can afford it.  I'd go crazy being stuck in the same 1200ft all the time.  Right before I started telecommuting I moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to a 4 bedroom house (and then some.)  This gives me a dedicated work area that I can get away from in the off time.  The other thing I do is get out of the house for lunch almost every day, usually with friends.<p>I think its normal to feel this way, but you're obviously aware of it and you can find a way to cope.",1300240522

Rather than being limited to passing text streams around, Powershell commands pass full-featured objects back and forth (with callbacks and everything!).<p>This flexibility really seems to break down the transaction costs that the original article talks about, when compared to traditional Unix pipes.<p>I'm still trying to come up with a Linux-y way to do this. Microsoft can mandate that all Powershell commands run under the CLR (and therefore can talk to arbitrary implementations of some CLR class) but any FOSS equivalent is going to have to deal with people wanting to interface programs written for a dozen different runtimes (and probably even some C code running on the bare metal).",1300240371

2330333,comment,2328516,2329980,0,0,bradleyland,,,"> What about this new rule about subscriptions then?<p>I think it sucks. I think it reflects a narcissistic view of the company and their platform. I think it's bad for innovation on the iOS platform. I wrote about it on my blog too [1], but so what? Users don't care about that either, apparently.<p>Interesting that you'd say that about Gruber, because the majority of the time I've seen his posts show up here, he gets lynched.<p>Please don't confuse my remarks with saying that Apple is ""right"" in any greater sense than that they're making a lot of money. The problem is, users aren't asking questions about what's right, but that's nothing new. If we want an open platform to be widely accepted, it has to deliver what users want, not what we (geeks) want, and it won't sell based on any higher ""principles"".<p>> However, the bigger failing is the failure to recognize these even among technical people, most of whom seem to have something akin to devotion for Apple.<p>You'll make as much headway fighting against this (devotion to a product) as you will fighting religion. As one of the greatest marketers I ever met once told me, ""No one but schools and universities ever made any money trying to teach a customer anything."" His point is that buyers are just as self-centered as Apple. They're not interested in being taught why they want something; they want whatever scratches their itch. Some people are interested in what's ""right"", but for most people, it never crosses their mind.<p>I also reject the notion that this is any sort of ""failing"" on the part of someone who buys an Apple device. Business isn't always quid pro quo.  I still assert that Apple wears their intention on their sleeve. If you don't like what they're doing, you shouldn't buy their products.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.bradlanders.com/2011/02/21/its-not-greed-its-narcissism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bradlanders.com/2011/02/21/its-not-greed-its-narc...</a>",1300240302

I get that they don't need quite the same level of reliability as medical scanners, but the level of radiation safety should be similar, or perhaps actually higher, since many more people are routinely exposed to them. Could you get a device with the amount of ad-hoc testing that's been done here even into your local doctor's office? My guess is no.<p>I'm not particularly confident in what I've found of the failure analysis and testing, either. For example, the devices appear to work by scanning a beam rapidly across one's body. If the beam got stuck in one place, it would have to shut off extremely rapidly to avoid an unhealthy dose of radiation being concentrated in one place. Is it possible for the beam to get stuck? Are there fail-safes that would cut off the beam, and how fast do they operate, and how reliable are they?

An old woman and her husband walking by gave her <i>the glare</i> and you could see everyone nearby was shocked.
