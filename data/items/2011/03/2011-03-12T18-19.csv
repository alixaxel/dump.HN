2317205,comment,2317190,2317190,0,0,tptacek,,,"There's a kernel of a good idea in this article: before checking references, determine 2-3 questions about the candidate you need answered; then focus the reference check on those questions. This prevents you from posing generic questions that get canned, inconclusive answers.<p>That approach could glean valuable information even from direct references (the references you offer to a prospective employer are always primed and coached, right?). Even an extremely friendly reference is unlikely to lie overtly on the phone. So your mission as a reference checker is to pose straightforward questions that are hard to bullshit around.<p>People's concerns about HR ""no detailed references"" policies are also probably overblown. The references a candidate offers you are part of their credentials; they've presumably chosen the best ones they have. References that can't tell you anything because of ""policy"" are, in fact, negative references.",1299955907

""The skin is affected, but a lot of people get eczema because of a latex allergy or because they are eating a pineapple or strawberries.""

If they're wrong, they lose money.  If what they believe is true, they help us all and make a profit.  If what they believe is wrong, they hinder us all and make money.<p>Where is the private incentive that is actually at odds with the public one?",1299953190

So, trying to help someone with an XY problem can get you penalized.<p>One service that I really liked was Aardvark which for a long time did not have public Q&A pages.
