2306315,comment,2306006,2306006,0,0,jerf,,,"Comments:<p>I'm not sure of the virtue of rewriting the Erlang atom rules. apos-quote-atom name-quote seems particular odd, since Erlang already accepts apos-atom name-apos. Though if your grammar requires it, I'd understand. (Though it would still be acceptable to just make it apos-delimited at all times, I think.)<p>You may actually want to consider deliberately <i>not</i> including head and tail methods on list, as it's usually a sign you're doing something wrong where you should be pattern matching. I'm not saying this is a totally winning argument, but you may want to think about it. (It's better to encourage good code practices than make bad ones easy, and I think when designing languages or even just APIs that's the better perspective to come from, rather than ""number of features"".)<p>I'm not sure about the wisdom of making a super-special exception for empty lists to be false. I know the functional heritage behind that, but Erlang is not as list-centric as Lisp and that seems an invitation to more problems. I actually like how strict Erlang is with its ""true and false are the only booleans"" and if anything think you should be <i>strengthening</i> that, not weakening it.<p>In fact, in general, while I approve of the general idea of laying objects over Erlang in a useful manner, I think you want to distinguish between extending Erlang, fixing obviously broken things about Erlang (yes, thank you, default UTF-8 strings-as-binaries!), and merely <i>tweaking</i> Erlang. Tweaks are very much to taste, and may be very much more expensive than you realize, both in implementation quirks and the number of people you chase away from one of the core groups you need to attract to have success, which is current Erlang users.<p>In the case construct, IMHO the ""match"" clauses ought to be on their own indentation, not matched to the case. Obviously cosmetic. You don't mention whitespace sensitivity, so I assume you aren't using it.<p>On try and except: You may want to consider requiring that all exceptions be objects, required to be inherited from a base class. Consider Python's experience with exceptions and how they have had to slowly and painfully deprecate strings as exceptions. Erlang exceptions would have to be marshalled into a generic class; consider Perl's Error module for examples on how that works. Also consider giving the user some control over what that automatic marshalling is, be that setting the class or monkeypatching methods in or what have you. Exceptions-as-objects are very powerful but that power dissipates very quickly when you can't count on the exception being an object. (Also that automatic Erlang error class should be a subclass of the top-level Exception, it should not itself be that top-level exception. Subclassing is an ""isa"" operation, so if the base-level Exception class is also the Erlang-error-marshalling class, that's a claim that all exceptions is-a exception marshalled from an Erlang-level error.)<p>String interpolation: String interpolation is <i>freaking dangerous</i> and few people treat it with the respect it deserves. String interpolation is basically an invitation to write an escaping failure of some kind every time you interpolate anything. (XSS, SQL injection, Javascript injection, all sorts of things.) Strongly consider some way to make it easy for users to add easy-to-use encoding functions as part of the interpolation specification, and consider giving them some way to actually <i>always</i> default to some level of encoding and requiring an override to do raw interpolation. Or rigidly require a specification of encoding function with every interpolation spec; I think it is absolutely worth an extra character per interpolation point, giving the incredible number of massive security holes interpolation causes. Actually this has nothing to do with Elixir per se, this is almost universally a problem, I can count on half-a-hand the number of times I've seen this done even remotely safely.<p>inlist in the list comprehension is a grammar smell. You may want to consider backing off the magic there, I'm not sure it's actually winning you anything. Anywhere a language ""hides"" something from you is an abstraction that can leak.<p>Method visibility is extremely, <i>extremely</i>, almost unspeakably overrated. It is not a core aspect of object orientation. If you've added that because you passionately believe in it, ok, go for it. But if you've added it merely because you think it's how OO is done, I <i>strongly</i> recommend ripping it back out. It will be a recurring source of pain for very dubious benefit.<p>One thing that was missing: I'm looking for an OO-based Erlang layer that allows me to write one thing that matches the gen_server behavior, and then allows me to subclass from there to obtain yet more things that are also gen_servers. Perhaps you have that and chose not to show an example, but for me any OO layer missing that feature is a non-starter. As a general principle, work with OTP to the extent possible, don't create a parallel implementation, which I'm just saying so I've explicitly said it.<p>Also, let me just be clear, this is all my opinion based on relatively rapidly reading that document, but I thought it worth sharing.",1299703533

How interesting is a safe interpretation of the research that conforms to what I was taught in 2nd grade?  Its like someone posted an article extolling the virtues of the food pyramid or something.  Even my doctor has a more liberal interpretation of the research than this particular author (and he is probably more qualified to make this interpretation).<p>In the past I've experimented with quantities of sleep, polyphasic sleep, measuring sleep quality, light / sound in the room, sleep supplements, etc, etc.  Why?  because sleep takes up 25-30% of <i>my life</i>.  Its a no brainer activity for me to try to hack and optimize.  Further, given sleep is such a big part of all of our lives, I'm surprised more people on this site do not have a similar mindset about experimenting and tweaking their sleep patterns.<p>Show me some articles with new research, personal experiments, or useful tips that can allow me to hack my sleep - these kind of interpretations are much more useful to digest.",1299703380
