It happened there and it affected millions of people.<p>The nuclear industry has a couple of worst case scenarios which are extremely frightening. From the sabotage of a nuclear facility to large scale accidents like in Japan. I know not many industries which have that.<p>I remember years ago, the air here in Germany was very dirty. Then there were tighter regulations and improved technology. Now the air is much better, still not good enough in some areas - but the difference is huge.<p>When you have an exposure of radiation here, then you can't clean it up. The particles are everywhere. Tighter regulations will not bring improvements. The damage is done. Possibly for decades.<p>People here accept neither coal plants nor nuclear technology. They demand that most of the investment in future energy technology goes into renewables. This will not bring improvement in a day, but after a few decades a multitude of actions will make dirty and/or energy production phased out.<p>This scenario is planned here for Germany in 2050. Fourty years from now. Under the impression of the Japanese problems with their nuclear power plants, people are willing to accelerate that.<p>This means that for years there will be investments in new technologies, there will be implementations of those that not everybody will like, but Germany is a country with engineering tradition and this is a challenge people like.",1300114754

But this ignores a huge number of other factors which also contributed to the GD - massive ecological disaster, huge drops in trade caused by Smoot-Hawley et al, new anti-competitive laws and onerous regulations, new technology making millions of workers obsolete.<p>The claim that a banking crisis caused the GD is popular mainly because banks are easy to model.

Don't get me wrong but I just can't be scared with this after compiling ALSA drivers in Mandrake 6.01 (don't remember the exact version) to get a working audio output, or compiling kernel to get a working audio input, or rebooting to windows to download drivers for my Intel dial-up modem, booting back to Linux and then understanding that I'm missing a dependency, then booting back to windows and so on...<p>However, there are few issues that prevent me installing Ubuntu (or any other linux as problem with drivers exists in all distributions) on the home PC of my parents like \nupgrading from 10.04 to 10.10 my GPU gets hot as hell; when my colleague maximizes flash video to full-screen his X-server freezes; when my friend plugs his second screen both his external and laptop screens turn black and etc, etc. I understand that these problems occur because of proprietary drivers but I really hope that there will be some day when everything will just work.",1300114655

It can be very hard for technical people to work in computer forensics because many technically attractive strategies are off-limits to you due to constraints that are wholly non-technical.<p>Think of it like this. Police would probably find a lot more evidence if they were able to search your car/property without consent, but they don't because that would violate your civil rights. The acquisition situation is a little bit different, because it's not strictly a matter of civil rights. It's more subtle. We have the right to examine the computer, but the process has to:<p>1) Hold up in a court as irrefutable and demonstrate a process that is <i>inherently</i> resistant to tampering.<p>2) Discover the evidence required to execute the legal strategy.<p>All the evidence in the world won't convict someone if the defense can take the position that evidence was tampered with. Using the computer prior to examination is akin to taking a gun used in a murder to the gun range before checking it in as evidence. Simply testifying that you didn't tamper with it doesn't do the trick. It very quickly becomes a chicken and the egg problem.",1300113882

Systematic use of power. These banks strut like mafia bosses, because they're exactly like mafia bosses.<p>Their strength and survival depends on having power to push the consumer into beneficial deals. Their survival <i>also</i> depends on pulling the carpet from underneath when the consumer fails to jump through enough hoops.<p>Yes, it's all related to capital in the markets etc., but it's all driven by power.<p>I don't know why we want to ignore this, but as a society these power relationships lurk everywhere. It doesn't mean that they are immoral or anything like that. They're just a fact of human nature. Every contract signed or transaction made is made with the assumption that someone with power will ensure that it will go off without a hitch.<p>What is a contract except for the threat of violence sublimated into abstruse jargon?

You've spent a lot of effort getting boot time down - how about spending some optimisation effort on resume.<p>While I think about suspend/resume, it really bugs me that I have to authenticate to the screensaver before I can suspend my laptop.

To make users aware, though, the installer should really call out that it is optimising the installation for SSD so the user knows it has been identified correctly. It would be useful if the installer could also recognise SSDs during upgrades and give some advice on what's not configured optimally too.<p>When I plug a USB memory stick in a short time after I removed it, reopen the nautilus windows that I had open last time.

The ""D.C. libertarians"" or ""business libertarians"", associated with folks like Cato, the Koch brothers, Club for Growth, etc., are more likely to see the American business community as essentially on the correct (i.e. libertarian) side of things, and advocate for them to be unfettered more from government regulation as a way of improving things.",1300111960
