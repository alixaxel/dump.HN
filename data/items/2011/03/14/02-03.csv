How did they find a complete list of users to select from randomly?  (For example, I can bet they excluded anyone who didn't speak English.)<p>To survey 1% of Facebook users these days, you need to contact 3 million people.  A sample of 200 could easily be completely inaccurate, and I can say with absolute certainty that it does not justify a headline like ""41% of Facebook Users"".  They can't even know it's 0.01%.<p>They should at least publish some other aggregate info.  For example...once ""randomly"" selecting 200 people, did they find that half of them lived in the same country, or 3/4, or 90%?  Did these people have anything else in common besides a tendency to share personal information?  Couldn't the experiment be easily repeated 2 or 3 times to see if the distribution holds?  (That wouldn't help much given the sample size, but it would show a lot more than they have now.)",1300071508

2321127,comment,2320873,2320873,0,0,sophacles,,,"You know, the other day I was lamenting the sorry state that is caching on the web. I decided a pretty good protocol would be similar to this: make a standard http header that includes a SHA of the content for that url.  That way if the content changes the SHA changes, and you get really good cache-ability without the worries of content timeout etc[1]. Further, cache control pragmas/headers/etc don't accidentally get misconfigured in a bad way. Caches just send a header request upstream and if the header hasn't changed, just blast the content on the presumably faster/cheaper local link.<p>[1] They could still exist for hints or what not, but I presume reasonably advanced caches will be able to heuristically figure out how long the content lasts and do things like start sending results while waiting on the header to return... with some sort of reset if it turns out to be a bad cached result.",1300071451

And then very ""intelligent"" blog articles try to rationalize a cancer causing, radiation inducing thing. Nuke plants that are old, not kept up to date, etc are very very dangerous. As economies ebb and flow, the demand for energy always is present, but the resources to keep a plant up to spec are not.

2321110,comment,2320076,2320743,0,0,zinkem,,,"You're partly right, but I think a game like WoW would exist even if there weren't a market to exploit (although probably not on the same scale with today's technology). Look back to the 80s and 90s when these types of games existed for cheap or free.<p>Many of the ""psychological manipulations"" present in WoW were present in the genre long before someone at Blizzard (or Sony or whoever else) decided those game play mechanics can make a boatload of cash. The tone of your post suggests that games are designed from the bottom up as a psychological manipulation tool. This is most certainly not the case; they are designed to be fun (although I could buy the argument that this stuff is being done consciously with WoW now, and would not be surprised if evidence were presented). For the most part these ""manipulative"" qualities in games were discovered/researched after gaming became popular, they did not insert these manipulations into games to make them popular. Most of this psychology stuff is pretty new to popular game design.<p>So far I haven't even addressed the original point of my statement, the artistic merits. WoW is a huge 3d environment created from scratch by a team of talented (and I'm sure very well paid) artists. There are many people who are excited about the lore of WoW the same way others get excited about LotR. To say:<p>""The achievement of WoW is to inflate the importance mouse clicks to an insane level by a more complex mechanism.<p>That is all.""<p>Especially with the ""that is all"" added to the end, this statement dismisses the creative work that went in to WoW to create one of the largest 3d interactive worlds ever made.<p>Anyway, both services offer value to the user but I'm just sayin' give credit where credits due.",1300070940

Protocol was really straight forward: If it's running, shut it down and get it to the lab.<p>Because we were working in the US Trustee system, we were dealing with business owners who were either in bankruptcy where a trustee had been appointed, or receiverships, which almost always involves a trustee (or like appointee). This means we weren't chasing kiddie porn, we were looking for the movement of money. Were we to encounter end-to-end encryption, the password is just a ""motion to compel"" order away. Failure to comply means you sit in a jail cell until you cough up the password.<p>Having said that, I don't recall ever having to go that far. Neither did we encounter any seriously hardened systems. Anyone smart enough to encrypt a system end-to-end at a company was usually on our side by the time we got there. In large businesses where this type of encryption is common, there is an IT person who can get past it. Bad business people have a tendency to make enemies out of their employees, and the trustee knew who to take care of.<p>In instances where we didn't have access to employees with the required knowledge to get in to systems, we relied on industry tools. We were mostly trying to crack in to things like QuickBooks files, Outlook PSTs, and protected documents, so not what you'd normally expect from a geek perspective (john, l0pht, etc). A lot of the stuff was proprietary, and at the end of the day, brute force and dictionary attacks were usually very effective.<p>We rarely encountered disk-level encryption on the systems we examined. App and document level passwords were the norm. I used to run the disk images through STRINGS(1) to extract every bit of text on the drive. Then, I'd break whitespace to newlines and use that as my dictionary. When you have three or four computers worth of strings, coupled with relatively unsophisticated users, you don't often strike out. We had a 100% success rate using standard crackers and the technique outlined above. It seems that users can't resist typing their password in plain text at some point in the life of their computer.<p>> Did you ever come across any exotic filesystems that EnCase can't read, like XFS?<p>I don't think I ever examined a computer that wasn't Windows XP. These were strictly business cases, so anything that wasn't Windows was a server, and that was a very rare case. Most of the time, we got approval to simply run the server systems in question to get the data we needed. The rules of engagement with servers were a little different. Servers involve a lot of multi-user access, so the chain of evidence requirements were a little different. We had to be the most careful with the personal workstations of the owners and accountants. I'd find emails requesting off-shore accounts, shell companies, etc. These had to be bulletproof in order to pin down the business owner.<p>I can't stress enough that I operated in a non-criminal, largely unsophisticated environment. Our rules for preservation were mostly precautionary. There was very little trial risk in our organization. It was mostly a matter of trying to identify assets and dig up any evidence that the owner was acting in a way that would put them in hot water. The trustee would use these items to squeeze the debtor in an effort to repay lenders.",1300070226

The execution is how this idea is made. In your case, this would be your research and unique math algorithm. The business plan is how you plan to market and monetize this product. A successful business requires all three factors.<p>When I said that an idea is being worked on elsewhere, I meant that somebody has at some point tried to solve that pain point for your customers. They are your competition. I stand by this statement. You seem to be arguing that your execution is unique, and I absolutely agree. Your execution has to be unique, or else you would be guaranteed to fail. Based on your description, it seems you are in an ideal position to execute your idea successfully, and I wish you the best of luck.<p>Based on the above definitions, I am suggesting that you can and should talk about your idea without talking about your execution. Share what problem you're solving, but definitely don't tell anybody the results of your math research. Using your example of a cancer pill, you should talk about your pill to anybody who will listen without sharing <i>how</i> the pill is going cure cancer.<p>I disagree that business plan factor are trivial after execution is handled.

Here a a few things & there are many more that you will not be able to access from JS:<p>- camera/video<p>- photo library<p>- address book<p>- embedding a smooth map view: you can get google maps to appear but it will not be as smooth as the native MapKit control<p>- all the goodness of CoreAnimation but the CSS animation on iOS made tremendous progress in each release<p>- speed: even if with iOS 4.3 and the Nitro engine JS is faster, the compiled Objective-C / C / C++ will most likely be faster<p>- re-use various existing runtime library (Facebook Connect/ DropBox / ...)<p>Please do nit think that I don't believe in pure web app on iOS or other device. Some app can fit well the model abd make perfect sense to do as such, but I will strongly recommend that before comitting to a 100% web app, check that all the features you want to achieve are doable through JavaScript/CSS",1300068553

It happened to my nephew, several thousand dollars in cash seized from his college dorm room (he was a bartender, but should it matter? it isn't illegal to have cash is it?), no charges filed and it would have cost him more than they seized to attempt to get it returned. Back in the 80s, when I was in high school they seized a local family's home because someone said they bought acid from a boy who lived there. It made big news back then, this stuff was new. The family lost the legal battle, they couldn't prove they didn't know their kid was selling acid. The authorities couldn't prove he was selling acid either, but that doesn't matter in these cases. To have your property returned, you must prove you are innocent or ignorant which are both almost impossible things to prove.",1300068171

Make a venn diagram for groups. When you friend people, you select their group(s) by dragging their icon to the right circle/shape. A video/slideshare by google on here a while ago showed how friend groups and cliques were more varied than just one big group. Play off that concept and let people create their own boxes.<p>Option B: Create a pseudo-tree of connections. Play to people's egos and show them at the center of the tree. Make the neighboring vertices be groups and let friends branch off the group. The pseudo part comes in when people are repeated within groups: either repeat them as vertices on the tree or have more than one edge coming off. I prefer the later, as it would make for a cooler tree.<p>But really, whatever you make will be better than facebook. \nAlso, probably should never let other people see a person's groups.
