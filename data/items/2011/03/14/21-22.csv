2324685,comment,2318492,2318689,0,0,mkramlich,,,"> I lost 20 pounds on Seth Roberts's fixed-point diet (aka the ""Shangri-La diet"") and gained 10 of them back after the diet stopped working, but it's ridiculously easy and works better for some people than others.<p>I've heard that said about every Capital D Diet Plan. I have a hypothesis about weight loss which is that it's actually simpler than many people make it out to be. Your body basically has inputs and outputs when it comes to food. If you want to lose weight and/or trim up, you need to either decrease how much food goes in, or increase how much your body burns as energy or turns into new/replaced body cells. That's pretty much it. The overwhelming number of people with weight problems (assuming exceptions are folks with genetic disorders) are just people who are eating too much for what they're body is doing, or, doing too little with their body given the amount of food going in. The type/mix of food matters too, but that's also a no brainer -- don't eat junk, but if you do, eat as little as you can and spread it out with healthy/efficient stuff -- and if you do eat more junk, then you better work it off more to compensate.",1300139698

At the same job, depending on circumstance, I was paid off with both comp time and overtime, and its surprising how different I felt the experiences were.<p>I definitely liked having the time off, but I generally squandered it since I was still decompressing from the extra work (I should note that, in this job, comp time generally came from working through the night - literally midnight to afternoon - on a Friday night leading into a week on call, then followed by the comp time). During a crunch time on another project, 60+ hour weeks weren't particularly rare, but we were paid overtime (at our regular rate).<p>I definitely preferred the paycheque over the time off, unless I could quickly bank enough time to take a full week off.<p>I think the choice comes down to your personal situation. Younger, single folks - like I was then - are probably much more likely to want to work through the pain in exchange for ""extra"" cash. Married folks, particularly those with kids, are probably much more inclined to take the time off to be with their loved ones. It's very much a personal choice, and I think an employer that understands that and treats the situation accordingly will get a lot more loyalty and respect from their workers than would an employer who paints everyone with the same broad stroke.<p>That said, I seem to recall reading - in Peopleware, I believe - that workers who push past 40 hours a week <i>need the time</i> to compensate, and I believe that they need to have <i>more</i> time than they worked to recover. I'd have to read the book again to be sure though.",1300139658

Every single study on every single metric shows that energy from Nuclear power is the safest and cleanest source of energy we currently know about, and yet the 'risk' boogie man is always at the forefront.<p>And in a weird way, by stopping implementation of power plants, we have sort of 'frozen' the perception of the risk based on experiences from the 70's. Have you ever compared the safety of a car you drove in the 70's with a car you drive today? Any different?<p>How do we 'grow up' past our 20th century fears and step up to save people, the planet, and our sanity by taking a more 'grown up' view of the risk / benefit analysis of nuclear power?<p>I really give Bill Gates credit for putting significant funds into the travelling wave reactor concept. He's looking at being able to take advantage of a safe way to generate power and consume left over waste products. How cool is that.

But the situation at Fukushima-Daiichi is still very dynamic and many questions remain.

2324569,comment,2324064,2324475,0,0,cstross,,,"Here's my problem with not encrypting metadata:<p>Suppose we have a determined attacker who is looking to target DropBox accounts. They can attempt to crack username/password pairs, or maybe intercept an entire SSL session and do a brute-force attack on it later. (If there are virgin credit card records in that session stream it may be worth doing this even if the cost is CPU-years.)<p>Letting this attacker see the names of files in a session gives them a clue as to what's stored in the DropBox account in question, and therefore lets them choose their targets -- if a user is uploading nothing but files with names like Hot-Fuzz-Directors-Cut.h264, they probably don't want to bother: but if the user is updating files like customer-accounts-backup.sql or passwords.txt, there may be money to be made. If the metadata is encrypted it forces attackers to tackle accounts at random in hope of finding something worth money. Which is much less attractive because the attacker has to do a lot more work in order to be assured of a pay-off.<p>At the very least, it would be best if the decision of whether or not to encrypt metadata was in the customer's hands. (Then maybe I wouldn't need to keep my business-critical files on DropBox inside an encrypted filesystem image, which almost certainly causes a much worse performance hit than an extra SSL roundtrip.)",1300137776

2324437,comment,2321919,2323819,0,0,mpyne,,,"> Conflicting information keeps coming out about possible worst case scenarios (and their relative likelihoods) with the nuclear reactors.<p>There is only one worst-case scenario, so although I very much agree that the information coming out of Tokyo Electric Power Co. and the Japanese national government is inconsistent, that doesn't mean new ""worst-case"" scenarios become possible.<p>IMHO the worst-case scenario is fuel melting through the reactor pressure vessel, through the thick steel containment which was not damaged in the hydrogen explosion, and through the bottom of the concrete containment (the top of which was damaged), and then from there into the environment.<p>The worst-case plausible scenario from what I can tell (which again, has been true from the moment they lost cooling systems for decay heat removal) is fuel melting to the bottom of the reactor vessel, possibly breaching the primary boundary but getting trapped by the steel containment, with possible further release of gaseous radioactivity.<p>I say this because cooling the fuel if it is outside the primary but inside the steel containment is much easier than cooling the fuel inside the primary: you must merely submerge the steel containment in seawater (which would boil away as it heats up), but this time you don't have to worry about pumping to high pressures. The fuel was transfer its heat across the steel containment to the seawater.<p>As long as the steel containment is intact (as was true last I heard, but refer to my earlier point about TEPCO) then there would be no additional release of radioactive contamination from this. If there are air leaks in the containment that would be worse, but a portable radiation monitoring device would quickly identify such areas so they can be quickly patched or covered to at least keep contamination from spreading.<p>So, I also disagree with ""unimaginably bad"". Unimaginably bad might be something like coal slurry breaking through its retention walls and killing all aquatic life in a nearby river for hundreds of miles (as actually happened in Kentucky in 2000 IIRC). At my last check all three reactors that had been operating at Fukushima-Daiichi have probably had fuel damage, which means that any steam they vent from the plant will contain radioactive contamination. So, definitely bad.<p>Unfortunately I can't seem to find to many numbers for activity concentration (how frequently the radionuclides are actually decaying) or for dose rate (a measure of biological damage per unit time). A Guardian article mentions 680 microsievert per hour to the northwest of the site, which would be 68 millirem/hour, which is a value that is actually fairly high, but far below levels that would lead to immediate health risk.<p>For a point of comparison, there are (inhabited ;) spots in the world (Ramsar, Iran) where you would receive 70 millirem/day, every day, which is far above what a trained radiation worker would be permitted to receive and yet still appears to have little (if any) effect on the local population.<p>Of course any unnecessary exposure is unacceptable! But I also wouldn't come close to calling it ""unimaginably bad"", except in regards to the economic cost to TEPCO and the substantial loss of generating capacity (which as you mention, can have a substantial economic impact).",1300136474
