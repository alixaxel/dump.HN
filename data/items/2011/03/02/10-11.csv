If lots of people think like that, then the sorts of information goods they like will become better-funded, and information goods that few people like will become less well funded, which is surely a feature rather than a bug.<p>The purpose of an economy is to make things people want; I believe my solution achieves that.

The workforce that was raised in an era when management (at least where I live) could (officially) earn only 5 times as much as factory floor worker and when workforces primary motto was : You cant pay us as little, as little as we can work.

This stands for public and private sector - with the difference that private sector had to improve a bit.<p>Everything is highly unionized - but unions are not the same as in western world. In socialist countries union was a paradox - so their existence in industry was limited to being a political propaganda apparatus - and they haven't changed a bit from then.

I have some pre-alpha stuff cobbled together and it's going well.

As much as I enjoy this stuff, my other passion will require the majority of my time and given it's a huge money sink, I'm hoping this new hare-brained scheme will partly pay for it.<p>There's a lot said on here about having total ultra-focused passion to your project and how you'll fail to get anywhere/attract interest/attract co-founders with anything less.

Germany, on the other hand, cut taxes and reformed its labor and welfare systems in the mid-2000's but in a way that prevents the system from equalizing.
