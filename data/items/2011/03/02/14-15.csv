If you are looking for safe and clean in the Triangle, there is always Cary. It has received many accolades for its family-friendliness.<p>Safe and clean is not really what I'm looking for in a city though. I'm more interested in the culture: food, music, art, interesting people and companies. Also, my wife and I were looking for a cool neighborhood to live in and found ourselves overwhelmed with great options: Trinity Heights, Trinity Park, Duke Park, Watts-Hillandale, Old West Durham, Forest Hills, Burch Ave, West End. Can I walk a mile in any direction and not encounter any sketchy streets? Nope. Durham is a little more integrated and not quite as homogenous as other communities. And I consider that a plus. :-)<p>I'm really looking forward to living in Durham.

Really talented musicians from NC Central's Jazz program show up and jam.<p>Durham is definitely not without its flaws. There <i>are</i> areas that are unsafe. There are also areas that are suburban wasteland, such as near Southpoint. But the downtown is increasingly alive, filled with people, walkable, and gritty. I'm looking forward to the grit and being around to see Durham continue to change!",1299077920

Small startups are typically nimble. They're commandos. At some point the beachhead is established and you need an army. Once you've won the war you need the police.<p>At some point in a company's history it will switch from an attacking posture to a defensive posture. Microsoft has almost all of the desktop OS and office software market. There's nothing really left to attack there. So now they're chasing shadows, afraid of the golden goose dying. Everything is seen as either a threat to Windows/Office or a means to sell more licenses.<p>Microsoft bought the (then very successful) Sidekick, tried to do a followup, for political reasons had the entire thing rewritten in a Windows OS (that delayed things 2 years) and you ended up with the Kin.<p>Windows/Office are so big (in terms of MS revenue) that nothing else matters.<p>Ultimately Microsoft is about selling Windows/Office licenses to large enterprises and OEMs. Everything else is a distraction (including the consumer).<p>Now compare this to (the quite brilliant) Jeff Bezos. When he came out with the Kindle I was rather surprised to see two teams working on this: the software team and the hardware team. This entered the public eye really with the iPhone/iPad when the software was ported there. At first I thought ""that's going to kill the Kindle hardware"" and it might, but that's kind of the point.<p>If the Kindle hardware is good enough to stand up on it's own merits then it will survive. If not, Amazon is already invested in the tablet/smartphone segment. So both teams are motivated to succeed. This is an object lesson in having the right incentives.<p>Apple springs to mind for the obvious reasons: they completely reinvented the phone and now the tablet. Now every phone looks like an iPhone and every tablet looks like the iPad.<p>Apple, unlike Microsoft, are a consumer hardware and digital content company. Their OS exists to sell hardware. A lot of people see iOS and think that OS X is doomed and eventually all Apple hardware will be in Apple's walled garden.<p>This is a very Microsoft way of thinking.<p>Under the covers there are a lot of similarities between iOS and OS X but iOS is still very different. Where Microsoft simply tried (and continues to try) to sell Windows computers in the form of tablets, Apple made the right tool for the job. What that does to the future of OS X, if anything, is irrelevant. The experience is what matters.<p>Oh and for the record, I don't think OS X is doomed. It's probably not as important as it once was but it will still power the ""trucks"" Steve Jobs talked about last year. If anything, OS X will simply be made to look more like iOS and you see this in the Lion developer preview.<p>The problem with Microsoft is they have a business wonk as a leader (who is no visionary of any kind) and they have no courage for the kind of risky decisions they'd need to make to reinvent themselves.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/06/commandos-infantry-and-police.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/06/commandos-infantry-...</a>",1299077156

So why do bad websites happen to good restaurants?<p>Or maybe, just maybe, that ""good judgement"" that chefs and restaurateurs supposedly possess is only ""good"" when they apply to food and managing walk-in businesses? You shouldn't expect a chef or a restaurateur, however good they are, to be proficient in information aesthetics, and, in the same way, you shouldn't expect a type designer to have good judgment about managing a restaurant business.<p>Then the article goes on to say that ""the website is a sign of the times. It represents the trends of that moment."" Well I got news for you -- it is precisely that sort of thinking that got the restaurant websites into the Flash-infested hole they are now. Yes, no one builds websites in Flash for restaurants <i>today</i> yet <i>everybody</i> and their grandma did five years ago. C'mon people, it shouldn't be that difficult to understand that one should follow trends only insofar as they don't interfere with readability, accessibility, user friendliness, and information clarity. Those last four principles are timeless; they don't change -- if someone truly applied them five years ago, the website would have survived and probably would have needed only a minor cosmetic change to stay current.<p>> For designers and users, the emphasis now is on accessibility.<p>And why wasn't it five years ago, huh? Then, ""we're a small restaurant so we can’t really pay for it..."" Oh please, stop the pathos -- why did all those itty-bitty small restaurants pay significantly more for a Flash website five years ago when a more accessible non-Flash version would have cost them way less? Where's the critical thinking?",1299076962

That's going to be bad enough.\nThen consider there may be proxies in the way, intentionally or otherwise, so you probably want to know the IP address the customer is hitting your product with, not their computer.<p>Most of us on HN are probably smart enough to find out our own IPs a half dozen ways - it's the 3rd party support that's tougher.",1299074516
