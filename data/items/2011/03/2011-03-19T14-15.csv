I left the PR industry after several years to pursue a career in development and know a bit. I'm not a superstar or the world's greatest BSer but I know a thing or two.<p>The thing about these general press relations articles written by a journalist or media outlet is that it's tailored to them.

It's a problem with ANY app storing configuration options inside the actual language.

I see it happen all the time, and not just in PHP.  Perl, Python, Ruby.<p>The problem is that to change the config options, you are essentially changing what amounts to the application, and if you break your config, you break your application.<p>The standard way of storing config options in PHP is with .ini files.  At least, in my circle.  Sure for quick scripts, we throw it in the actual code, but whenever we have to manage more than a few config options, it get's moved out.<p>I realize I'm expanding on what you said a bit. =)  I just want to make it clear that this isn't a PHP problem.

Unfortunately the publishers ban this and the writers must relent since the only way to get their book  known is if it comes from a major publisher. They justify this mostly based on promotion costs, but this is not even close to their profit margins.<p>Books are expensive because there is little competition, particularly with k-12 schools, largely based on political lobbying.<p>Of course, we aren't likely to dissolve lobbyists anytime soon; but the idea of socially conscious startups is to dream big.",1300546019

The words to find are the same, but the arrangement of letters is different for each student.<p>It is trivial to write a program to generate word search puzzles, so I decided to make the problem more interesting by adding a difficulty parameter.  I could generate puzzles with a range of difficulty by varying the following factors:<p>* direction -- more difficult puzzles have answers in diagonal and/or reverse directions<p>* density -- more difficult puzzles do not necessarily have the answers uniformly distributed in the grid but can have dense groupings<p>* dummy words -- since some students search for any words in the grid, you can fill it with words that are not actually target words to make the task more difficult<p>* decoys -- you can fill the grid with slight deviations of target words in order to make finding the actual target more difficult",1300543544
