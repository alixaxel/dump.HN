The difference is really simple:<p>* Introverts get tired when interacting with people and recharge their energy when they're alone<p>* Extroverts get tired by being alone and recharge their energy when they're  with people<p>Extroversion and introversion doesn't say anyone about how shy or social people are. There are a lot of introverts with great social skills and a lot of extroverts with good inward skills.<p>That being said - it's obviously much more normal to be a shy introvert than it is to be a shy extrovert. It does happen though.<p>I'm an introvert and used to be a really shy guy with low social skills. In the last years however I gained a lot of confidence and social intelligence.

It currently makes about £36k GBP in profit per annum, which means it's close to the point that with a tight belt I could jump.<p>The hardest thing for me isn't spotting or monetising the opportunity, but in balancing everything for a reasonable quality of life without burning myself out. That and discovering and handling the minefield that is running your own company and figuring our the finances, taxing, invoicing and asset management.<p>My company does community websites, forums and the like. I chose to start with areas I'm most interested in, but have avoided areas where there isn't an after-sales market. I aim making the lions-share of the revenue from affiliate schemes such as the eBay Partner Network, Amazon, and then Affiliate Window has a lot of companies running schemes specific to the communities I'm running.<p>I don't push the affiliates... I just aim to build the communities up to the point that enough conversation produces the links to used or new items that then produces revenue.<p>Once a community is successful, I look for another.<p>What I've discovered is that revenue earnings relate to purchase price of items, and that you can make significant money in high-value items sold through eBay. I would now recommend people look at cars, motor-homes, boats, etc sold through eBay, and then build affiliate based communities around those. Which means building communities who love and use those things, and affiliate earnings is a natural by-product of letting those people communicate.<p>There is a lot of money in affiliates with a low entry barrier so long as you can attract the people who will click on the links, and if you happen to have also attracted people who would post the links (you can auto-rewrite server-side to include the affiliate element) then you have a winner.<p>So that's what I do in my spare time (30 minutes per day), and it's wildly successful given the effort invested (I'm using off-the-shelf forum software).<p>I could even make this my job full-time, except I personally need more stimulus than just running a farm of community forums.<p>Also... beware the politics. If you can stick to a same-sex topic where people are unlikely to sleep with each other, you'll get a lot less politics.",1300624344
