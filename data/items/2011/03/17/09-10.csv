Objects dont have that property, Pure Functions do.</i><p>I see this <i>exactly</i> the other way around. Objects makes sure you don't have to worry about what's on the inside, but if you use pure functions you need to know how the function is implemented, how it processes data, how it expects input to be and how the output will be.<p>Using pure functions requires you to seek out lots of information and verify implementation. Not that you shouldn't investigate this when using OOP, but in OOP a lot more of this is formalized in class-definitions IMO making the interaction easier to understand.<p>The way I see your analogy, is that if you use pure functions, the electricity in your house needs to know what material the bricks are made of so that current doesn't accidentally leak and cause a fire. With OOP this is a detail you don't have to worry about as long as the pieces fit.<p>If that sounds somewhat flawed or too simplistic, I will take the liberty of blaming the poor metaphor.

Wire transfers cost $20-$40 for each transaction (And usually are associated with systems with such names as ""Large Value Transfer System (LVTS)"". ACH is usually only allowed with accounts you can prove ownership with and they charge for pushing money into another external account, but usually not for pulling money.  Even then they hold the funds for 3-4 business days. It's cheaper and faster to just order paper checks, write them down, give it to a teller or ABM to take the check to deposit into your account than to use ACH or wire transfers.  It's even worse in canada.  At least US banks have ACH transfers and wire transfers available on their online banking websites!  The closest thing is Interac e-transfer.

Even if you are not, having gone through a similar phase back in early years with that exact same motivation, I am!<p>This is a text book usage of social engineer. Putting in divorced parents, single child getting all the attention from the engineer dad making the kid an above average amongst his/her peers, and then putting in a girl, so to make you focus less on the flaws in the story and drool over the hot-geek image more... evergreen combination.<p>I would doubt though that Forbes came up with this on their own.

2335512,comment,2335407,2335407,0,0,topijo,,,"I recommend an MBA. More for the exposure to the motivation behind organizations than anything else. Since no one individual can make lasting impact alone, the world is ran through organizations, whether political, for-profit, or non-profit. The MBA gives you the tools with which to understand how organizations run, and being a creative individual, you will find ways to apply your natural talents to these new tools. For example, my background before MBA school was semiconductors. Very creative, but very technical. Then I went to business school, and soon decided I wanted to apply my technical creativity to a more artistic endeavor. So I enrolled in film school. Now, I am an independent filmmaker. Considering how pragmatic an individual I am, I would never have made this transition if my MBA hadn't provided tools to understand this new industry and how to position myself to benefit from it. the bottom line: your world just gets bigger. How far out you want to go is up to you. Hope this helps.",1300352728

I'm not familiar with irradiation units and how they correlate to DNA damage, but all amounts are harmful to the molecule. Ionizing radiation damage can be fixed via repair pathways, but it's simply a function of probability as to when this machinery fails in a critical location.<p>The paper might be interesting to read, though, especially if it got cited. As always, news articles tend to inflate claims and miss the point entirely.",1300352619
