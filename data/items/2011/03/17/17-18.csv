You can copy BSD-licensed code into your GPL-licensed library with no problem, but GPL-licensed code copied to a BSD-licensed library will have problems. GPL-licensed code into a BSD-licensed library prohibits redistributing the resulting work under BSD.<p>> Completely and egregiously wrong.

Apple's spell check did not flag de-copyrightizanator!) has failed, and the header files Google shipped for third parties to use do in fact contain copyrighted code under GPL, then there may indeed be a problem for third parties.

Well, for a while newspapers (and later local tv affiliates) were the only mass communication channels available. That put them in a unique position to serve as gatekeeper of news and information for a community, which allowed them to make money off of being a broadcast medium as well as their own original content. So newspapers were able to make money off of classified ads, rebroadcasted wire reports, comics, etc. This situation allowed newspapers to bloat up into huge organizations and make a lot of money off of little effort. The original investigative journalism within a newspaper made up a shockingly small percentage of their total efforts. The internet has made the broadcast functions of newspapers utterly obsolete, making the only economically useful function of newspapers their original reporting, which they do very poorly and also very rarely. Newspapers have a self-identification as this whole broadcast / gatekeeper enterprise, they have been having a hard time imagining they could be anything else (such as an organization that <i>doesn't</i> print classified ads, wire reports, or marmaduke comics).<p>If I knew what the newspaper of 2020 was going to look like I'd be building a business around that (and I may do so regardless). I know for damned sure that the newspaper of 2020 won't be dominated by material that is unnecessarily rebroadcast, and unfortunately that includes a lot of what's in the NYT today.<p>As for HuffPo, that's not a source of news, nor is it the future of journalism (it may not even outlast the NYT). As to ""paying for a high-quality product"" I dispute the notion that the NYT is anything of the sort.

At some point, after checking five or six stories, the doubter will realize the deniers are either intellectually dishonest or eager to remain ignorant.  The real damage is when someone hears two or three provocative ideas from deniers and never learns anything more.  <i>Especially</i> if people refuse to engage with them.<p>I put in my dues exchanging emails (over a period of months) about biology with a white supremacist.  He was a very bright guy just starting a law career, and he didn't reveal his ideas to many people.  I think he was impressed that I was able to provide point-by-point responses to the claims he made about human evolution.  He was very well read in racist literature, especially the older stuff from a time when more sophisticated people were still openly taking the position that non-white races were biologically inferior.<p>He was under the impression that a lot of the points from those old books were still unaddressed by ""mainstream"" biology, and the fact that I was able to provide him with straightforward answers and pointers to further reading discredited a lot of his current sources.  I don't think I cured him of his racism, but I did convince him that biologists weren't as stupid or brainwashed as he thought they were, and that his sources of information did not stand up to modern ideas, because they were obsolete in some cases and simply ignorant in others.  His tendency to believe in the superiority of white people remained, but I destroyed his belief that the issue had already been scientifically settled and was being ignored or suppressed by current biologists.<p>Addressing the issues honestly is the only way to make progress.  It's sad that much of what is written about untouchable political issues  is written to gratify people who are eager to agree with the author and just need some authoritative reassurance.  ""The Mismeasure of Man"" is an egregious example.  If it included white supremacists (or just people who learned towards believing in racial inequality) in its target audience, if it addressed itself to those people with an intent to persuade them, it would have been a lot more useful.  Of course, it would not have won accolades -- it would have creeped people out, because people do not want to see those ideas taken seriously.  What they want, and what ""The Mismeasure of Man"" gave them, is reassurance that those ideas have been conclusively dealt with and can be ignored.  But that doesn't actually accomplish anything except providing some peace of mind to non-racists.  The goal should have been to shift the ideas of people who are racist.",1300382405

You should immediately stop buying things and budget your income so that you're saving a few hundred dollars a month, and endeavor never to get below a certain comfortable pad.  If you're in IT, you can easily get a $10k pad in place within one year of having your first job.  Once that's in place, <i>then</i> you can think about owning a television and other consumables.  Not before.<p>- If you regularly find yourself with no money in your wallet, that's a symptom that you're not thinking ahead.  I tend to keep between $50 and $200 in my wallet.  If I buy something and notice that I've only got a couple 20's in there, I'll make a note to either stock up from the sock drawer or hit an ATM when I get a chance.  ATMs are a way to get money out of the bank.  It's best not to think of them as a replacement for your wallet (since that's the way to maximize your fees).<p>You don't have to have lots of money to do these basic things.
