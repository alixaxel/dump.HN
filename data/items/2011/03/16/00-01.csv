A short-term exposure of 1Sv is a ballpark value for acute radiation sickness, and you'd get that in 2.5h.<p>Like the IAEA says, that's a point value right in the plant, but if the workers were exposed to that sort of radiation level, saying that ""no one will die from radiation here"" is not justifiable.",1300237122

2330202,comment,2329842,2329842,0,0,po,,,"Japan takes a lot of criticism for being a closed off culture. After living here for a while I have started to believe that it is necessary to support these values. Multiculturalism means lowest common denominator. There are efficiencies you can gain by having a monoculture. Nobody has to lock their bikes, subways can have nice cloth seats and you can walk around in any neighborhood and be safe.<p>When I came to Tokyo, a lot of foreigners I met who had been living here complained about the uptight nature of Japan. Too rigid, too exclusive, too slow to change.<p>Before Tokyo, I lived in a very nice part of Brooklyn. I remember I was walking down the street and I saw a man with his child come out of a store. The kid unwrapped his new toy and promptly threw the package onto the curb. I had a flash of anger and was thinking ""what's wrong with that guy not correcting his kid?"" As I was thinking this, the guy threw his cigarette pack cellophane on the sidewalk. He had different values than me, and I had a dirty street because of it.<p>In a place like Brooklyn you learn tolerance and how to live with other people's values on a day to day basis. In a place like Tokyo, the system shuns you until you adopt their values. I don't think either is necessarily better but you should be aware of it when you live in Japan and feel left out.",1300237093

It does a really good job of incrementally building up to more complicated problems. It starts out with puzzles using basic if p then q style logic and moves all the way up to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem in a way that is both accessible by and entertaining to someone as young as 10.<p>It took me about two weeks to a month to read and give each question due thought at a pretty leisurely pace, though I am sure most would take many much less time. (I had to stop to keep up on homework/study for tests for about a week of time.)<p>I don't know if I became a better programmer from it, but it is very much inline with the hacker spirit.

It's the simple observation that without reasonably accurate data, valid analysis cannot be done. We don't have most of the data pertaining to Chernobyl, and we never will. That is mainly because the USSR was a totalitarian state with rigorous information control systems, and it didn't like to be embarrassed by its nuclear oopsie-daisy.<p>Good scientists--those of the WHO included--do their best with what data they have, and don't make claims that can't be backed up by data. Because there isn't enough data to support it, there will never be a comprehensive scientific analysis of the real impact of the Chernobyl event... at least until we get some kind of time machine tech.<p>Until then, you can't <i>KNOW</i> the impact of Chernobyl. Sorry, but you just have to <i>GUESS</i>.

People destroy and loot when they feel that the world has forgotten them and that help is not coming. During Hurricane Katrina the government was quite slow to respond. In Haiti it took nearly two days to reach twitter/the public and trigger international relief. Almost nobody was there to hold them over until then, and chaos happened.

But it is easy enough to make those backups look like read-only file systems (bup includes an FTP server, HTTP server and FUSE module that expose a backup set through the respective protocol or as a filesystem).<p>But since bup builds on git, and a bup backup set is actually a git repository, you get all the git related stuff for free - e.g. bup supports cryptographic signatures in the repository by way of git's signing support -- although, for now, the ""bup"" command does not implement them (so, if you want to sign or verify the signature, you'll have to use git on the repository rather than bup)<p>Bup's deduplication is comparable to rsync's (and it reuses rsync's main tool for that). If you change a byte in the middle of a 100MB file, you'll likely need to transfer ~16k to or from backup (compared to the other version of the same file). That's also true if a byte was inserted in the middle of the file. And if you backup 100 copies of a 100MB file, was just a few bytes changed in each file compared to each other file - you'll need less than 150MB of space/storage, rather than the 10GB or so without deduplication.",1300235321

Setting up medical billing costs quite a bit, which is why they charge for the premium versions of the app. Kivatinos also notes that most doctors pay upwards of $50,000 for a similar electronic system.<p>The bigger question is, will Drchrono be forced to pay Apple the 30% in app subscription fee from June 30?",1300234075
