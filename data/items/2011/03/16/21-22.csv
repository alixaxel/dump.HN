They play together on an immersive big screen. You aren't going to do that with a tablet. You aren't going to have kinect with a tablet. \nAre serious gamers going to use WoW on a tablet?

It's much easier for me to type \int_0^\pi \sin (x) dx than it is for me to go click-click-click-click in Word. But besides that, when you're writing proofs, for example, and you have to keep referring to the same symbol, say sigma, over and over again, in LaTeX, you would simply write $\sigma$, but in Word, you would have to do Insert->Symbol or some nonsense. Several more seconds wasted, and that adds up when you have 100 occurrences of the character sigma in your document.<p>TeX has a learning curve, but it's not even actually that steep.

It's new and I know there isn't a lot of activity on it, but I'm working hard to try and get it off the ground. Here's a rundown of the site...<p>What it is: PopuGamer is a gaming review website focused 100% on user-submitted reviews, kind of like a Yelp for gaming.<p>Why I started it: As an avid gamer myself, I've read my share of total BS game reviews by professional reviewers, and I wanted to create a place where regular, everyday gamers -- those without relationships with game publishers and developers or access to pre-release games -- could discuss, debate, and discover great games. Just like Yelp democratized the restaurant review process, my hope is that PopuGamer will do the same thing for game reviews.<p>I'd love to hear what you guys think and if you have any advice on building a community from scratch.<p>URL: http://popugamer.com<p>Thanks for your time, guys. I really appreciate it!",1300311736

You haven't really addressed that -- you're attacking a strawman. I'm simply curious as to <i>why</i> VRBO's parent company hasn't decided to handle bookings directly.<p>VRBO already supports transaction processing -- they use it to sell the listings. They also went to all the effort of providing a consumer insurance service. Why didn't they add support for processing the booking transaction directly and guarantee it as a matter of course?<p>My guess is that because to do so would wading into a regulatory quagmire, and as an established company (rather than a disruptive startup), they have more to lose. Maybe Airbnb knows this, too, but is hoping to get away with it anyway -- at least long enough to either change the regulatory environment, or see their exit and leave the problem to someone else (see: napster) ...<p>.. but I could be wrong, so I asked the person who has the details :)",1300311718

Giving users and sellers a better way to showcase their second hand products.   Right now we're focusing on users acquisition and marketing but kind of stuck, meaning no growth.  We're getting about 500 visits/day and around 5-10 people register/day but not many people are uploading videos.   We want to get users more involved in the community and eventually list their used stuff with us.   As of now I'm bootstrapping  my startup where capital is very limited.<p>I'm thinking of \n1. reaching out to bloggers and get some PR to increase more traffic to the website.\n2. Then hire some people to build a mobile app so users can upload their stuff easier and faster.\n3. Run some contests to motivate them to sell their unwanted stuff lying around their homes.   \n4. Contact local used car dealers, furniture stores, and yard sale associations offering people to list their products on the website for free.<p>Which one of these should I do first or not do at all?

To do that ...<p>""show your courage"" - you know, in the face of someone telling you something is stupid or impossible, do it anyway.<p>And I'll add one<p>""show your humility"" - when you fail, admit it, do a post mortem, learn from it and then go back to getting stuff done.<p>It sounds trite but really if you want to found a company go out and start one.

This is impossible. Why? So phones that still have trackballs don't have whacky scrolling behavior going on for them. But the ListView has inertial scrolling. How the heck can I possible explain this to my client without sounding foolish or lazy?<p>- I want to animated a cell disappearing from a ListView. Again, impossible.

And when we do, the problem with carriers + manufacturers holding sway means whatever apps I build won't see any improvements on phones until Ice Cream is released <i>and</i> manufacturers ship phones with it. We're talking June or July at this point, right? For basic animation. That was in iOS 1.0. In June 2007.",1300310222

The emphasis on the 'typographic quality' of the results is very different:  TeX goes for the highest quality, and HTML is to be quick and dirty.<p>Yes, both had smaller beginnings:  For TeX, Knuth wanted to write his books.  For HTML, Berners-Lee wanted a physics newsletter.<p>At this point there is a huge difference:  TeX is solidly frozen, and HTML continues with changes as fast as Jeff Jaffe and the rest of computing can implement,<p>In the future, sure, HTML could replace TeX.  For the very high quality paragraph setting, there's no fundamental reason HTML could not specify and implement that.  For the math, similarly.  There does need to be an 'executing language' (TeX is a programming language, maybe Turing machine equivalent, and not just static text), but JavaScript might suffice.<p>A big advantage would be that HTML now knows about all the characters in all the languages.<p>But such high interest in math is likely in conflict with reality!",1300309962

It's not just in the browser, it's throughout the whole experience, so the raster trick for zooming that's mentioned doesn't explain it completely.<p>Google really needs to sort it out. It's a shonky user experience that really doesn't need it to be. I was certain that it was hardware acceleration that was missing, but obviously not. There was that bug ticket which indicated that Google thought it was garbage-collector related, but then that was supposed to have been modified in 2.3.<p>It's really pretty poor, and is certainly not helping to sell devices.

We aren't talking about lifting weights or running the mile where you can know your own abilities and compare them to another person's - intelligence just doesn't work that way. Interviews and conversations are the best way I know of to tell how ""smart"" someone is, but there are problems there as well.<p>The problem I have in mind (there are others) is that it's not very easy to tell if someone is smarter than you are. I find that it's easy to tell if someone is less intelligent than I am because they don't recognize their assumptions, draw incorrect inferences or are otherwise sloppy. However, in a sense I'm just testing for the absence of stupidity and not the presence of intelligence. I find it very difficult to tell if someone's actually smarter than I am or just more knowledgeable.<p>What I would suggest is that you have several people interview this person separately (ideally on separate topics) and use their opinions to formulate a judgement. If, after conversations on different topics, 5 engineers say ""this girl seems to know her stuff"" then it's a much safer bet that this is person is a bar-raiser than if it's just you. Yes, you'll likely be turning lots of people away, but that's what happens if you keep raising the bar.",1300309296
