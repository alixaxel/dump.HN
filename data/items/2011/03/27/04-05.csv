At the same time, a vigorous community of\nprogrammers employing functional languages has come into existence.<p>CUFP is designed to serve this community. The annual CUFP workshop is a\nplace where people can see how others are using functional programming\nto solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and collaborate;\nwhere language designers and users can share ideas about the future of\ntheir favorite language; and where one can learn practical techniques\nand approaches for putting functional programming to work.<p># Giving a CUFP Talk<p>If you have experience using functional languages in a practical setting,\nwe invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the workshop. We're\nlooking for two kinds of talks:<p><i>Experience reports</i> are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to inform\nparticipants about how functional programming plays out in real-world\napplications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights\ngained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical; reflections\non the commercial, management, or software engineering aspects are,\nif anything, more important.<p><i>Technical talks</i> are also 25 minutes long, and should focus on teaching the\naudience something about a particular technique or methodology, from the\npoint of view of someone who has seen it play out in practice. These talks\ncould cover anything from techniques for building functional concurrent\napplications, to managing dynamic reconfigurations, to design recipes for\nusing types effectively in large-scale applications. While these talks\nwill often be based on a particular language, they should be accessible\nto a broad range of programmers.<p>If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone\nto do so, send an e-mail to avsm2(at)cl(dot)cam(dot)ac(dot)uk or\nyminsky(at)janestreet(dot)com by 15 June 2011 with a short description\nof what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should\ngive a talk about. Such descriptions should be about one page long.<p>There will be a short scribes report of the presentations and discussions\nbut not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting is intended\nto be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange. You do not\nneed to submit a paper, just a proposal for your talk!<p># Program Committee<p>* Anil Madhavapeddy (University of Cambridge)\n* Yaron Minsky (Jane Street)\n* Jun Furuse (Standard Chartered)\n* Marius Eriksen (Twitter Inc.)\n* Michael Williams (Ericsson)\n* Mike McClurg (Citrix Systems R&D)\n* R.

I also want the mouse to be 100% optional. Its nice to use it when I'm pointing and clicking anyway, but when I'm not, eg, when I'm coding or in a terminal, I want to be able to control everything without leaving the main keyboard. As such, my window manager of choice is, of course, a tiling window manager (musca), and it is truely lightweight - a few K lines of C code, a few KB compiled binary, very fast, very low memory usage. Hell, it delegates its menu to dmenu (which I find to be an awesome little program - useful, very fast, tiny, easy to use and no dependencies besides xlib).<p>I run Musca on an Arch install (on an eee PC) for true lightweight minimalism :)",1301201744

Only took about 30 days for AT&T to realize that wasn't going to work out. As one of the few who got and still has that plan, I can assure you the very same reason it's awesome is the reason the ""cloud tablet"" won't happen (at least to the degree pundits expect) without a major breakthrough in wireless bandwidth: data traffic will be enormous.<p>I'm sure someone could better run the numbers than I, and I expect it would quantify the intuition. Upshot is: to get thru the cloud computing barrier requires bandwidth not just available, but in use, to an astounding degree. Oh, I'd like a real cloud experience, as my 64GB iPad is getting a bit cramped for want of instant access to my entire music, movie, book, photo, and video collection, along with remote desktops to four computers, high res videophone the norm, and at some point real 3D teleconferencing. All this demands a user experience buttery smooth, which requires significant buffering orders of magnitude more data than anyone will in fact use (it's just there if they want it). Times millions of users, you don't run this over 3G, what passes for 4G, and maybe not even what most assume 5G will be.<p>Now, Apple is smart folks with lots of connections and clout and cash. Maybe they can do it. They almost had it with the iPad 1 launch, but then the unlimited plan was capped at 2GB - and that makes all the difference. I'm thankful I can throw around gigabytes of data without worry ... and then remind myself most tablet users can't.

2374139,comment,2374026,2374026,2,0,profitbaron,,,"I think that, the ""Facebook Killer"" will be something entirely different to what Facebook is today. The reason is based on a few things but look at all these ""Google Killers"" - Mahalo, Cuil, Blekko, DuckDuckGo etc with the exception of Bing none are really seen as a threat to Google. Cuil has deadpooled, Mahalo has changed business model and we're only really seeing what Blekko can do which goes to prove the idea, that for something to beat Google/Facebook its going to have to be something new. Such as the evolution, of Facebook becoming a threat to Google so much so they are focusing more on social aspects with +1 etc.<p>However, going back to your question and looking at it with regards to ""open source"" issue you raised, its important to note that at Facebook they are very open to the idea of opensource having, released many things into the open source community themselves - <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/opensource/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/opensource/</a> and Facebook even provide a public mirror - <a href=""http://mirror.facebook.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mirror.facebook.net/</a> of many open source services. This shows that, an ""open source"" service won't kill Facebook - look at Dispora (the ""open source"" Facebook) that hasn't worked which goes to show that, if something is going to ""kill Facebook"" then it won't look like Facebook.<p>For instance, Facebook doesn't look like Google but as I highlighted earlier Google are noting Facebook is becoming someone considered a competitor - especially if they move into search - which is why they are focusing on +1 etc.<p>Additionally, there's actually an interesting article about the Facebook Killer not looking like Facebook posted by Mashable's Pete Cashmore on CNN here: <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2010-11-26/tech/cashmore.facebook.killer_1_facebook-social-network-digg?_s=PM:TECH"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.cnn.com/2010-11-26/tech/cashmore.facebook.ki...</a> which is also worth a read.",1301199187
