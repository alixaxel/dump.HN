Along the lines of (i) check whether it is actually the bottleneck, (ii) use a better algorithm, (iii) dont do it etc etc. Usually accompanied by (mis-attributed) quotes. Such advice would typically be the highest voted.<p>What galls me is that they assume, without any basis, that the person has not (a) benchmarked the code,  (b) is obviously running an inferior algorithm and (c) just because they have not worked on an applications were speed mattered, the poster could not possibly be working on something where speed matters.
