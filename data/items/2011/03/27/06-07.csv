They took investment from angel investors, and my brother opened up shop in his home town in India, which is a small city. IMO the key to their success was that they were able to find this one guy who bootstrapped the entire business in India and managed it very well. Also, since this was a small city, they were able to find stable employees at reasonable salaries, unlike cities like Bangalore, Mumbai etc. which are very expensive and people keep switching jobs for salaries.

Instead what we see is finance growing and other industries declining. To me that suggests a general dysfunction in the role of finance. It simply isn't doing the good it's supposed to.</i><p>Well, I don't know that I find that very persuasive.  Industries rise and fall all the time, for many reasons; the world is a complex place.  Perhaps a useful financial instrument now is keeping things from getting worse somewhere else.  Or perhaps it will bear fruit in a decade, as one would generally expect with an investment.  Such an argument seems hasty without a good understanding of what the relative growth rates of different industries under different conditions <i>should</i> be -- a rather tall order.<p>I do certainly see the moral distinction between George Soros' currency manipulation and Warren Buffett's shrewd investment, despite the fact that both men made their money with money. But I don't think it would make sense to reckon their true productivity by comparing their fortunes.  Likewise, if one is going to suggest general dysfunction in the financial industry, I'm much more interested in what you think it's doing wrong specifically -- where the growth that you think is unhealthy is coming from -- than how big it is.<p>To talk in concrete terms, I think I read elsewhere that a lot of the recent growth in finance has been in insurance. It seems sensible to me that if a lot of people have lost money, insurance, and its role in mitigating financial risk, would be more important.  Without it, we might see people completely unwilling to take on financial risk at all until they had more money, which would be devastating.  At a first glance, I don't see anything unhealthy about such an industry's growth being decoupled from the rest of the economy--or even inversely correlated.<p><i>And as for the auto industry - they shouldn't have been bailed out either - that doesn't somehow make it better that the financial industry was.</i><p>Oh, indeed, I am not arguing that.  Both were terribly bad.  I was arguing only that a bad, but specific, historical event doesn't make the industry as a whole fundamentally bad.  No one would say, ""The government bailed out the auto industry -- making automobiles is fundamentally parasitic on society!""  I mean, making those particular automobiles, sure.  But all automobiles ever?  That's overblown.  But people do seem to take the financial bailouts as evidence that the industry as a whole is amoral.",1301207813

Why, in 2011, do we not have this?<p>It's odd, but we spoke of Amazon and Google in hushed voices, as we saw them as our biggest competitors -- we figured that both of them would have services shortly, and we saw our early mover status as our predominant advantage.

I think UC Berkeley moved the first CS class for CS/EECS majors to functional concepts and Scheme in 1989 and MIT even earlier, though the latter abandoned it later.<p>Yeah, but those aren't really the same reasons CMU is switching over. Scheme was historically taught because it offers the opportunity to teach computer science, as opposed to merely teaching programming. Most freshman ""CS"" courses are oriented around the latter.<p>The shift into Java/Python/$OOP_LANGUAGE was precipitated by the demands of the real world (eg, the job market). CMU is leading the pack in that respect -- it just so happens that FP is a better fit for the type of work their students will need to do, given the growth of multicore and distributed systems.<p>OOP has its place, but it is far from a panacea.

2374321,comment,2372720,2373327,1,0,Dove,,,"Thanks for that.<p>I did know about the do syntax in Haskell, but I didn't think it really made the language usefully imperative.  Sure, it's okay if you're trying to kick off two or three unrelated calculations, maybe if you're after side effects.  But I didn't find it much to fall back on when trying to do something complicated and having a hard time thinking about how to break down the problem without for loops and case statements and value accumulators.  Maybe it's more robust than I know, but it seems like such a small piece of such a big language.  Calling Haskell imperative on account of that seems like calling perl OO because you can kinda sorta do basic OO stuff most of the time.<p>I am also having trouble understanding the claim that the ideas are orthogonal.  I can see plainly enough that they aren't literally the same thing: an imperative language breaks a problem down into simpler <i>steps</i>, while a declarative one breaks a problem down into simpler <i>definitions</i>.  And a stateful language accumulates progress in changing values, while a functional language does so by resolving expressions.<p>So far so good, but I can't really decouple the concepts.    How would you break a problem down by time, but track results through logical resolution?  Isn't the point of a step or instruction to leave something about the state of the program changed--I mean, isn't it inherently stateful?<p>It seems to me the advantage of imperative programming is that the steps are logically decoupled, just as the advantage of declarative programming is that the pieces are temporally decoupled.  So how in the world would you make a declarative program accumulate progress via state?",1301206062
