I don't know about you, but I wouldn't trust any data that came from an authoritarian government, especially one run by a bunch of Russians, especially one that collapsed 20 years ago (likely destroying countless incriminating documents in the process), especially concerning a deeply embarrassing incident such as Chernobyl.<p>The public may be overreacting to the nuclear threat posed by the Fukushima reactors, but this seems like a subtle attempt at rewriting history.<p>(I wouldn't be surprised if there is a UN report 20 years from now proving that Saddam Hussein did indeed win re-election with 99% of the vote.)",1301205578

You know, doing stuff to increase visibility of artists and pump up the various scenes than they currently do with their current ""you upload, we take a cut"" mode.  Like having local iTunes concerts, performed by artists selling on iTunes. Free admission if you buy a $20 iTunes card. Or putting on impromptu gigs at various venues like coffee houses, dive bars, or local music clubs to generate some buzz around talent.  Get Woz involved and resurrect the Us Festival under the iTunes brand, with indie artists from all sorts of genres.  Music is about so much more than pumping sound into your ears.<p>I agree with the ""changing of the guard"" sentiment, but I think it better to disrupt from the outside, rather than prop up the old guard for a while longer.

Based ONLY on the ""take the bus"" comment, I would set up a private meeting with your boss and tell him/her that you don't like their attitude and how you are treated, that you are extremely unhappy and that if it doesn't change immediately, you will quit (and I would follow through if there are no changes over the next week or so).<p>Now, factoring in everything else doesn't leave them in a strong position. I don't mind working long hours, or even on weekends, BUT I have to be rewarded for doing so. If I am doing more than normally (in your contract, or in similarly or better paying jobs that you can easily get elsewhere) expected, then I expect to be rewarded and appreciated for doing so.

2374295,comment,2374271,2374271,2,0,Skywing,,,"I guess it all just depends on what you value. Personally, I thought I really wanted to find a job in California doing programming. I finally got this job that I thought would be everything that I had dreamed of, and shortly after moving 1500 miles away I really got the chance to learn what I truly valued. I found that it wasn't being in CA, or money or even working for a cool, young company - it was being around the people that mattered to me, my family and friends, my pets back home, the city that I was familiar with. I was very unhappy because I was so far from these things. Talking on the phone and using Skype only reinforced my desire to move back. Being told to just endure it for a year or more only made me wonder why I should need to put myself through something I disliked so much. So, against just about most logical reasoning from a business and resume standpoint, I quit the job and packed up my car and hit the road back east in one day. I don't regret it one bit and am much happier because I made that decision. I did have a job that welcomed me back, though, so this helped.<p>It sounds like your situation is mostly against the company itself, whereas mine had nothing to do with the work, but perhaps this story of mine can help you somehow. :P",1301205179

2374277,comment,2374135,2374135,3,0,parrispreston,,,"The standard is to use # in anchor tags that don't link anywhere that get hijacked with javascript and typically using jquery use e.preventDefault() which will stop the # from going into the address bar. You can also use return false. But e.preventDefault() is best practice. You need the # in the href because without it older browsers will not act like its a link which will prevent :hover from working. The # signs you are seeing all over the web are probably people who are not implementing preventDefault or return false. You could also be seeing them for sites that attempt to use something like jquery address for ajax navigation. If you are attempting to copy and share one of these links and it is not working then the developer didn't set up the ajax state management correctly for the particular app you are using. On a side note, you should probably leave these types of programming specific questions for stack overflow. I wouldn't consider this appropriate for hacker news in my opinion.

I actually trust the Linux community far more than Apple to keep things working over a longer-term timeline (which is great for servers, but I don't care much about on my desktop).",1301203314

As someone who has built a number of small business websites in the past, I could see using a lg.cx link.<p>Some comments:<p>Permanence is always a concern with url shorteners. Especially for small business websites where I'll implement the site (and the associated admin allowing them to customize much of it on their own) and sometimes not touch the code again for years. I don't know what the solution is for this concern but it's worth noting and it's something that business owners ask about when you are using ""new"" technology.<p>Don't add comments by default. Yelp already exists and in general comments allow for trolls more often than useful, meaningful information. Meaningful comments generally come from a community. Maybe have a checkbox to allow for disqus comments.<p>An alternate take on comments... Moderate and scope them. Allow for comments that are actually ABOUT the directions and location. This is probably the ideal solution. But it may also be a lot of (needless) work.<p>An embeddable widget would be great. Ala google maps. Something that could be embedded with the ability to customize the design minimally. Just enough customization so that it matches the site it's embedded on. When I'm working on a small business website I'm always looking for drop-in reliable widgets that customers are happy with. Ideally the widget would be a drop-in replacement for google maps. But still with all the useful additional links and description found on a lg.cx page. It's an easy sell since it offers more options for the users.<p>As for customizing the name in the link - that doesn't really matter to me. I can see why it would be cool. But you've already solved the problem - shrinking insanely long google map links and providing a single location with links to multiple map services. I'll likely wrap an lg.cx link with a meaningful description in an <a> tag if it's on a website or in an email. I can see customizing names as useful for ""true"" bit.ly uses lg.cx though.",1301203257

Or at least he isn't intending to. He's comparing strategies for relating to various groups of people. Many readers are misconstruing this.<p>Two pieces of context to keep in mind:\n1. He writes in the same piece, ""I’m not saying women are similar to either group. I’m saying that a man’s best strategy for dealing with each group is disturbingly similar.""\n2. He retracted this post and isn't standing by it. Probably because a large portion of his audience is pulling out a message he didn't intend to communicate, and doesn't really agree with.<p>>>>>""Well...

When you could put it into a savings account and every month it was worth a little bit more and never less?""<p>That question set the stage for an interesting discussion about risk and return, but the really important part was a discussion about money, money that you needed to pay the bills, vs money that you needed ""just in case"", vs money that you were saving to have available in 30 or 40 years for your retirement. The complexity of money management is something that develops with a deeper understanding of the role of money in the context of your current and future life goals. A mutual fund is of little value to an 8 year old, but a great tool for someone planning their retirement.<p>The linked article shows someone who has a photo manipulation program, and that program has image adjustment tools that he has never used. He erroneously generalizes that to an unsupported hypothesis that <i>nobody</i> ever uses those tools, and then goes on to talk about photo applications which are much less flexible (Instagram and its competitors) and how he does use their tools. It is a great learning moment.<p>This is a huge trap for young entrepreneurs and it helps to think about it and not fall into it. The platitude is ""know your customers."" This guy clearly gets along just fine with a tool which makes amusing transformations 'easy' sort of the MacOS photobooth equivalent. And yet the tools he belittles in his mini-rant are ones that are used daily by artists all around the world, and there are even companies built around still more manipulation 'effects' because an artist doesn't see a picture, they see input into what they are trying to express.<p>So when your customers come to you and ask you for these features in your tools, it helps you get to know them better and helps you understand their needs. And while we often start by building tools for ourselves, if we can add a feature that other people find useful (even if we don't) and it gives wider appeal to that tool, its a Good Thing to do.
