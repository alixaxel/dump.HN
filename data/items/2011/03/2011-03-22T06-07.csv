2353422,comment,2352521,2353284,0,0,reneherse,,,"Right. What all these different examples of licensing do is provide some level of protection from complete technical incompetence. Which of course is a worthy pursuit, I just don't agree that the best way to do it is necessarily by licensing. (And unfortunately I'm not going to be able to precisely articulate some alternatives at 3am :)<p>The historical pattern in the US seems to be that professional licensing, introduced as protection from incompetency, inevitably evolves into a way of limiting competition in a field by restricting the number of practitioners. At least on architectural exams, to the best of my knowledge, the maximum number of those who ""pass"" each year is set in advance.<p>It's a slippery slope once you start regulating entry into a field. The regulating body comes under political pressure from anyone with a financial stake, especially practitioners, educators, and major consumers. I'd wager that soon after you need a license to call yourself a software engineer, you'll need an accredited degree and years of internships before you can sit for the licensing exam. It's played out in similar fashion in the other professions.<p>There are other ways of ensuring competency without the use of government or quasi-government institutions. In software development, incompetency generally wastes time and money, not lives. With stakes this low, perhaps something as simple as a standardized testing service that could be used by HR departments to screen applicants would be viable... (Please pardon my designer's ignorance if something like this already exists in the development world :)",1300777179
2353421,comment,2353225,2353225,0,0,mskierkowski,,,"Would you be targeting experts, semi-experts, or beginners? If beginners, are you looking at people who just want to get a website up and running, or want to eventually do web development regularly (i.e. they actually want to learn to build websites)?<p>I ask because it sounds like you are casting a very large net with a tool like this.<p>My theory is that much of these tools are obsolete not just because they produce bad code, but because the market has been eaten up by better alternatives. Experts are more likely to use a good text editor and CSS frameworks and great new features of HTML5; thus they don't need tools like dreamweaver to produce things that they now can do more easily. New users who just want to build a website but don't want to learn to develop websites regularly are more likely to be drawn to a service like wix.com or wordpress.com. The only segment I'm not sure has been touched (perhaps because I'm uniformed), are new web designers who want to learn web design, not just to create a one-time project. In that case you might be better off interviewing college/university students who just finished their first few web design courses.",1300777166

The part you do actually use costs them about 10 cents a month on Amazon's published pricing, and one could reasonably assume they have a better deal than publicly available.  At a buck a year and what I make out to be a viral factor of something like 20, you're approximately the cheapest cost of customer acquisition ever.  (If that worked for my business at scale I would be <i>rolling</i> in it, and my LTV is much lower than Dropbox's is.)<p>How they make money is fairly simple: use you as a customer acquisition channel to get people who have money using the service.  Charge those people many, many times what servicing them actually costs.  Does it matter if there are cheaper options?  Pfft, no.  There are cheaper caffeine delivery vehicles than Starbucks coffee, but since people don't choose coffee primarily based on price, if they hook one more weekday latte drinker that gets them a LTV of several thousand bucks at a margin of ZOINKS%.  Dropbox isn't Starbucks, but their unit economics can be reasonably assumed to be ""quite favorable indeed.""",1300777005

I agree with you that messages/information need to be delivered tactfully and with thought. But I disagree that the solution is to offer a lie.<p>Why isn't the obvious solution to offer honest, meaningful ""message-level"" answers instead of blunt, uninformative answers?<p>With your example, the spouse can answer that 80's leggings make anyone look terrible, that he loves her, and will plan to continue loving her, that he finds her attractive in ways that were not present when they were both younger. In business, you can answer ""No our product doesn't do H, but it does J."" You can answer ""No I can't be sure that the lights will stay lit in the morning, but I believe that it will, because of X Y and Z."" If your customer walks, and your business fails, then so be it. Your business did not fail because you spoke the truth, it failed because you couldn't keep the lights lit.

Part of what might actually be happening is that after seeing the header for each of the 3 columns, the eye sight jumps to the links at the bottom of the columns because it is higher contrast than the body text, and then the visual focus can't help but leaking further down into the ""Oh ma"" footer which also has higher contrast than the column body text, and then for each column the reader has to make a more concentrated effort to go back and focus on what that important content said.

Most of it is noise that obscures what's actually happening - you do much better by studying history than watching the news. For instance, you'd do well to study the history of financial crises during one, instead of watching the news. The news say that armageddon is coming, whereas history says buy stocks after the crash.<p>Though occasionally, you do get bushwhacked - the thought process goes like this: ""WTF? My country is bombing Libya? <i>google... google...</i> Huh, my country is bombing Libya.""<p>Analysis - I think the article makes some good points, but the conclusion is overly simplistic.<p>In terms of securing their current government, a regime hostile to the USA needs to look at a few factors, such as:<p>1. Are they on the US leadership's radar already?<p>2. Does US leadership believe the USA has enough resources to to make war on them without excessively compromising the economy or military capability elsewhere?<p>3. Could further arming provide a casus belli for an administration that already wants to make war?<p>4. What's the US leadership's current geopolitical strategy for the area?<p>North Korea is interesting because they have the fourth largest military in the world, and they've got ballistic missiles pointed at two of America's closest allies in Asia - Japan and South Korea. A coalition could absolutely defeat North Korea, but at <i>huge</i> potential costs, nuclear weapons aside. So in their case, yes, arming with nuclear weapons probably helps their security, especially while America is already in two deep military conflicts.<p><i>(Note: I'm being descriptive here, not proscriptive. Obviously I think North Korea having nuclear weapons is a bad thing)</i><p>On the flipside a lot of petty regimes like Cuba and Venezuela are mildly hostile to the USA but not on American leadership's radar as a threat and the American people would be against a war with them. In their case, arming with nuclear weapons would be a very dangerous gamble - they're basically safe from any U.S. offensive action at this point, but you'd be provoking a still very fierce tiger if you tried to get nuclear arms. Especially Cuba - I think American discovery of nuclear armament in Cuba would result in a near instant invasion.<p>The regimes and governments with the most interesting questions to ask themselves are the ones that are loosely aligned with the USA right now, but stand a very good chance of having hostile relations later. My gut reaction is that places like Saudi Arabian and Pakistan become more domestically secure against American action with nuclear weapons, but arming is risky - if American intelligence, leadership, or media happened to discover some blatant financing or backing of terrorism or insurgency around the same time the nuclear program was discovered, they might find themselves occupied. They're already next door to regions we're at war, so it doesn't even open another front and the key supply chains are already in place... U.S. leadership might decide they'd prefer to install more explicitly friendly leadership in those places if they tried to arm up.<p>In regards to Iran, I think it's point #4 - ""What's the US leadership's current geopolitical strategy for the area?"" My take is that the American leadership really wants the Iranian leadership out, but they think it's going to happen organically pretty soon and don't want to give the regime an external enemy to fight for unity's sake. Though, I think some of the more public war-dogging Iran was doing during Bush's administration was crazy - that administration seemed to really want to attack Iran, especially if operations had gone more smoothly in Iraq and Afghanistan.",1300774351
