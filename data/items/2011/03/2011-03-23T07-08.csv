The question is, why? Perhaps it's because it is so much more difficult to understand. When a dam breaks or when parts of an oil refinery explode, the result may be catastrophic but at least we can understand what is happening, on an intuitive level. When something goes wrong with a nuclear reactor, it is so far removed from anything in our everyday world that it's difficult to understand on that same intuitive level. If something is on fire then we can see and hear it and we can use our experiences of other things being on fire to understand it. If something is radioactive then neither of the above apply.<p>So perhaps there is something about nuclear that makes it uniquely frightening (even if those fears are irrational).

2358429,comment,2356735,2356980,0,0,pbiggar,,,"> The various bits generated from and added by the autotools shouldn't be committed. autoreconf -i works really well these days. That's INSTALL Makefile.in aclocal.m4 compile config.guess config.h.in config.sub configure depcomp install-sh ltmain.sh missing mkinstalldirs.<p>This is a matter of opinion. When you have dependencies which rely on specialist tools, it is a good idea (and accepted practice, though this obviously could be argued), to commit your generated files too. This means that the files don't change depending on the version of autoconf/bison/etc that's installed on a user's machine.<p>As I recall, years ago some folks wrote up all these ""version control best practices"" for some conference, and this was one of the ""rules"". But it's common sense too - autotools is deep enough magic that most people won't know to run bootstrap.sh, or autoreconf -i, or whatever.<p>(Ironically, google code doesn't agree with this, and won't let you trim generated code like this from the diffs they send.
