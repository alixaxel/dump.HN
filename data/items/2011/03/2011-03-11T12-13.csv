Do you have capacity to hire?<p>Courting investors is a full time job, but so is hiring if done right.  You probably can't do both with just two of you.  If the goal of raising money is to hire more people, and you've already got enough cash to hire even one, do that first.<p>Just make sure you hire into a position you believe can increase your profit.  Spend time thinking about it.<p>Companies your size grind to a halt while raising capital and it can take months.  Once you've expanded a little, multitasking becomes easier.  If you're lucky (and this is what you're trying for), you may find that your new hire increases your profit enough while you were looking for investors that you can afford to hire again.<p>If the new hire doesn't increase profit, you can still take investment (especially if you've been doing the leg work after maxing out your headcount), but you're going to have to figure out how to hire effectively eventually, you'll just have more money in the bank.",1299848399

Or they may be downvoting because you are wrong. ;)<p>This story violates neither the letter nor the spirit of the rule against ""video"" of a disaster; aka cheap sensationalism. Rather, much of the thread is the opposite of sensationalism: e.g. patio11 on the average state of Japanese disaster preparedness.<p>This story has all sorts of HN community relevance, ranging from <i>how are community members experiencing this on the ground</i> to <i>how do otherwise abstract geology papers manifest in real life</i> to <i>hey, wait, my startup is sitting in a prime earthquake zone; how should we prepare?</i><p>And, you know, this is a magnitude 8.9 earthquake. They don't happen every year. We can afford a handful of threads on each one. It's nice to try to have an <i>interesting</i> news site, but if this isn't news one has to question the entire <i>concept</i> of news.

It's certainly debatable. Depends on what field.<p>You probably know most of most of the excellent business strategists in finance and technology. For statesmen, probably Deng Xiaoping or maybe Lee Kuan Yew.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew</a><p>> Who decides?<p>It's a subjective thing, like ""best painting"" or ""best painter"" - you could put metrics to it or rankings or something, but in the end it's all subjective.<p>> Rommel was a great strategist. Is it better to be Rommel or to hurt fewer people and to be forgotten?<p>Actually, interesting you chose Rommel. Rommel was executed by the Nazis (forced suicide, technically) for being part of the plot to overthrow Hitler. I think it's fair to say that if that plot had been better executed, then millions of lives would be saved. So that's the flipside - better strategy can save millions of lives as well.<p>For what it's worth, Rommel is a hell of a comparison -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel#Popular_perception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel#Popular_perception</a><p>Super honorable guy. Was opposed to war crimes, opposed to the Holocaust, opposed slave labor, believed Hitler should be arrested and tried for crimes and replaced... he's the only member of the Third Reich leadership with a memorial or museum in Germany (he has both).<p>But anyways, it's kind of a false dichotomy. The Romans had an expression - ""Si vis pacem, para bellum"" - ""If you want peace, prepare for war"" - I do believe in that, and sometimes - like Hitler blitzkreiging Europe or Saddam invading Kuwait - military action is necessary. But it's never desirable if avoidable.",1299847850

Morality is a strictly personal matter, and anyone that tells you that you have a moral responsibility to do something is confused. Nobody can tell you what your moral responsibilities are other than yourself.<p>In this light, the parent post is right. ""You might have a moral responsibility"" implies that <i>you</i> may feel compelled to do something. The frequent misinterpretation is that you have a responsibility to someone else, which is false. If you feel compelled to carry on a job you hate to save lives, you have a moral responsibility. If you do not feel so compelled, you do not have a moral responsibility.

Also what do you mean by ""spend a decent amount of time installing xcode""? 5 minutes? 10? Whoa, not a big deal.<p>Anyway I fully agree that apple should be very quick in releasing a free downloadable compiler toolchain and charge only for the IDE.",1299845401
