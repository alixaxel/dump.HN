The first, when I was just getting in to the industry, and didn't know better. The second, not so long ago, when I should have known better.<p>The first thing I've learned is that I can't accurately judge my limits.

Suddenly I'm writing code so bad, I'm committing code that doesn't even work, but thinking it does, because my brain is in outright rebellion.<p>Both times, I couldn't code for six months. The first time, I just tried to hide it. I quit my job, and took another. I wrote almost no code in those six months and was paranoid I'd be found out and fired. I wasn't, thankfully.<p>The second time, I took a few months off work, and requested a change of job for a period of time, so that I didn't have to do any coding. The second time was really bad, I started having panic attacks just looking at code on a screen. I'd start sweating, heart racing. It was horrible.<p>What I ended up doing for most of those six months at home, was building little plastic robot models. No computer use. Just quiet, methodical, brainless work.<p>Eventually I recovered, and started coding again. I'm better than ever now, which is good.

Ashcroft, which he called ""The Big One,"" since it was challenging the power of congress to keep extending copyright terms as they have been continually since the beginning of the 20th century.  Lessig lost the case, which was a crushing defeat to him because he believes that with the right strategy it could have been won.<p><a href=""http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2004/story_lessig_marapr04.msp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2004/story_le...</a><p>Lessig says that his mistake was framing the case around a somewhat abstract argument: earlier cases like <i>United States v. Lopez (1995)</i> had found that when the Constitution grants congress an enumerated power, that power must be interpreted in a way that makes it limited.  The theory was that if congress could keep extending the term of copyright whenever more works were about to fall into the public domain, their power over copyright terms was effectively unlimited.  It seemed like such a simple, watertight argument and the Supreme Court had bought it recently for other cases.<p>Lessig made this argument the center of his case, and redirected every line of questioning with the Supreme Court justices back to this theory.  When Justice Kennedy asked if there was any actual harm <i>in practice</i>, Lessig answered:<p>""Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. Nothing in our copyright clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress. Our only argument is, this is a structural limit necessary to assure that what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws.""<p>The justices wanted to see the actual harm, but Lessig only gave them an abstract argument.  This is unfortunate because Lessig has made an entire career out of describing the benefits of ""Free Culture.""<p>The EFF is surely aware of <i>Eldred</i> and its unfortunate outcome, and it appears that their strategy is much more focused on showing the actual harm:<p>""In their briefs, both Mr. Golan and the Internet Archive pointed out that allowing Congress to remove works from the public domain inserts potentially paralyzing uncertainty to the system and harms people’s First Amendment rights to receive and share information. These concerns are even more pronounced now in light of technologies that make sharing and storage more accessible, and allow important institutions like the Internet Archive to thrive.""",1299601202

2301408,comment,2300711,2300711,0,0,codeslush,,,"Hey - congrats!  I wrote an entire business plan around a very similar concept 10 years ago!  Never executed on it, but still think about it all the time.  Since I know this is too big of a thing for me to tackle, let me share some of my features with you that I think (hope) can help.<p>1.  Assuming you've purchased the equipment to do mass production (i.e. automated print fulfillment center with folding/cutting/licking/stamping/etc... features then make sure you're doing address cleansing for the extra postage discounts.<p>2.  Make a utility print driver so I can ""Print To Postal Shout"" -- this is VERY easy to do, at least on windows.  You can get freeware, or near freeware, to act as the actual postscript or pdf driver and it will alert your application when the file is done printing - you can then kick in and do something meaningful with it (i.e. submit to your service).  I've written such print wizards in the past and would be happy to elaborate if you're interested.<p>3.  In combination with number two above, this is where you can expand your reach considerably.  Forget about that template that I have to download.  Through the print wizard, you pick your addresses and contacts from a list of contacts, or start adding them.  Since your program is controlling the wizard, you can get the addresses in the format you want.  Upon completion, create an XML doc (or similar) and call a web service or ftp service to submit the document(s) to.  You can either encode the actual document into the metadata of the xml file (slower) or give it a GUID and point to it from the XML metadata.  I highly recommend an FTP based approach for file transfer as it is fast and you can give your customer progress feedback or even sync in the background.<p>4.  When using the driver, ask the user HOW the document/message should be delivered.  They will build an address book over time (maybe you can even tap into an existing CRM if they have it) and offer email/fax/postal/premium).  Think of this from people who want to send an email to 100 people, but only 95 of them have email addresses (hard to imagine these days, but used to be very common).  Hope this makes sense.  Further, it's a way of offering MULTIPLE delivery methods in one easy wizard.  You get to charge for the fax and postal and maybe offer the email free.  For example, I want my lawyer to see the document I need reviewed right away, but I also want to send hard copy to him and cc myself.<p>5.  If you could somehow incorporate electronic signature / notary / SOMETHING into the documents and build up a crowdsourced delivery mechanism that would be completely disruptive.  Meaning, I'm in California and I want to overnight this signed document to New York.  I could send it to your service and have its authenticity verified, then you can reach out to your New York based notary/courier and have it delivered within a few hours to the New York address.  Way cheaper than FedEx and if you can somehow get this implemented it would cause your service to absolutely explode in usage.  Plus, it would be more environmentally friendly!  :-)<p>6.  Offer stationary / letterhead for the customers to design and use.  This could be a real problem for mass printing though.  At minimum, you should offer different qualities of paper for it to be printed upon.  This is a ""nice to have"" and nothing I would focus on right away (IMHO).<p>7.  You could offer discounts on the actual costs if the user was willing to have ads printed at the bottom or top (or inline) in the document.  This wouldn't be for official correspondence, but more for the casual messages you might not otherwise mail, but since it's free, or near free, why not.  The beauty of this:  It WILL get opened and read by the recipient.  Here you have a personalized letter sent to someone with local adverts printed directly on it.  The recipient is almost guaranteed to read it and see the advert.<p>These are off the top of my head.  I could drum up that old business plan / feature spec and give you more details if you want.<p>Hope these ideas are useful to you.  As proven:  Ideas are useless w/o execution - bad on me for not doing this myself.<p>EDIT:  P.S. - target Salesforce.com as a market because this is especially useful for mobile sales reps who have to fax and mail from hotels all the time.",1299601132

Regulation is great, but I'm not sure you can attribute the speeds you see in foreign broadband to that alone.<p>In the quest for ""balance"" between public and private interests, the Telecom Act of '96 created a scenario where carriers still ""owned"" their network, but had to share access based on a set of rules. The problem is, everyone who came to play still had to use the same old infrastructure.<p>The RBOCs weren't stupid. When it came time to upgrade the infrastructure, they came to the table ready to negotiate. Because they knew the voting public would never accept a publicly built and owned nationwide fiber optic network, the carriers negotiated incentives so ridiculous, they almost sound like a work of satire.<p>Cable companies managed to avoid the regulation hammer altogether, but have consistently ""out innovated"" the telcos. I use that term loosely, but when you're studying regulated vs unregulated, it's pretty easy to see that unregulated ""won"" here in the US. Unregulated didn't really win though. The regulated model we use here in the US is flawed.<p>When carriers are forced to share their privately owned infrastructure, the incentive to upgrade the network goes away. The US is too large, and land-use rights too difficult to navigate in order for there to be a competitive market.<p>I believe we'd be much better off if we were to adopt a model not unlike our national highway system. All the fiber would be laid and owned by the public. Regional tandems would work just like they do now, but would be publicly owned facilities. Private carriers would pay for space at the tandem, but anyone is able to come and bid at auction, similar to the way spectrum is auctioned off. The incentive to keep the infrastructure up to date would be driven by voter interest.",1299601031
