IP is essentially protection racket. Sure you can learn a little bit of the dance but it won't unless you're on of the 'big boys'. In the end, there's no great difference between between a patent troll and a corporation seen as having 'legitimate ip'. IP rackets resemble <i>states</i> in the sense that they are gangs trying to suck the fattest t<i></i>t they can find.<p>The best strategy isn't to ""know what's legal"" but to <i>avoid attention</i> `till you're big enough to kick the snot out of these bandits.<p>IP mavens are [INSERT SOCIALLY DIMINISHING ADJECTIVE HERE].",1299038340

Why? Well, we don't have to compete with a bar full of people for places to sit / stand, and we don't have the noise and buzz of a full bar to deal with.  BUT... conveniently, SplatSpace is within walking distance of both a bar and a coffee shop!  So if people get tired of mingling at SplatSpace and want food/coffee/beer etc., we can migrate - individually or en masse - to one of the other establishments.<p>The other positive is that we have access to a project at SplatSpace, so if you want to bring a laptop to demo a project, or practice pitching your project or something along those lines, we can do that sort of thing.<p>It'll still be pretty unstructured and free-form, but this does give us some more options.",1299038046

2278381,comment,2277831,2277831,0,0,sarahmccrum,,,"I once had an employer who seemed (to me) to prefer people who were (in my opinion) pretty inappropriate for their jobs because they had so little ability to do them. I found it very difficult to understand at the time, because I generally like to have people around who are better than me at most things, so I can concentrate on what I do best.<p>It was interesting over the years, though, to see what happened. That particular employer was a great believer that anyone can learn anything, and she was incredibly patient with some people who really were not gifted at all in their area of work.<p>Above all she valued loyalty (and in key areas, such as finance, she preferred absolute stupidity). I learned a lot from her. I saw that most of the clever people who were around left, often when they were most needed, whereas the slower, more loyal people were still there getting the job done. I also learned that loyalty and commitment are more valuable than brilliance. I saw that she liked stupid people in sensitive areas because then they couldn't mess up in any serious way. They made lots of small mistakes but they didn't have the ability to make big mistakes and they always asked whenever they didn't understand what they were doing.<p>Personally I think there is a balance here. I would find it hard to go as far as she did, but it certainly caused me to look at people decisions in a different way, which I would never have come up with if I hadn't seen her in action.",1299037940

There is a practical limit -- and it's a low one -- on how many people can borrow and benefit from a single copy of a book, even if a library buys that copy and then lends it out freely to the public. If everyone wanted to rely on a library model instead of buying their own copies, libraries would have to buy many more copies. Thus the people behind the book would still get compensated, and thus the loop would be closed and there would be a meaningful incentive to create and share books in the first place.

Almost everything you said about Steam there might be true today, but if everyone was legally allowed to openly redistribute content, most of the potential advantages Steam offers by not sucking as much as the other approaches today still disappear. It all comes down to convenience and reliability, and I see no reason to believe that social networking tools wouldn't quickly evolve at least as much of both as any centralised, controlled service. After all, this has been happening within the modding community for years.<p>As far as donations, I do understand that the point isn't whether everyone pays. However, you still need whatever total you raise from whoever does donate to be worthwhile. Given that (a) there is nothing in today's law stopping someone from adopting that approach if it truly provides a better incentive to share their work, (b) various people have tried, and (c) I'm still waiting to hear about the market-changing success stories, I think a major cultural shift would be required before a purely donation-based model could provide incentives as effective as even the broken copyright mechanisms we have today.",1299037064

I don't like Apple's business practises and never have, but this 70/30 split furore is hilarious to someone who has worked in retail and supply before. It is entirely normal for a retailer (apple) to take this kind of split in the retail price and the supplier/wholesaler to take 70%. In the retail industry I worked in, the retailer took a 35-40% portion.<p>This split is yawningly normal in retail. What's not normal is the huge numbers of ""one-person"" wholesalers... who have very little in the way of business experience and see that split as a ""tax"" rather than payment for a service.",1299036419

However, this rarely means that they're good enough to succeed at that thing without working on it. I.e. if your ex wanted to make a living as an artist she'd still likely have had to go to school / practice extensively before being good enough that people would have bought her stuff.<p>Also, and I don't know whether this is the case with your ex, it's entirely possible that she was better at art because she'd been idly drawing over the years. I've certainly known people who wouldn't call themselves artists whose default idle activity is to sketch away on a piece of paper. They're vastly better than me, because they've been practicing in a low-key way for years.<p>Natural talent just gives you a head start on others. Someone willing to put in more effort than you can still be better than you.<p>I suppose this may break down around the limits of a field, especially one rooted in physical activity. E.g. Michael Phelps seems to be nearly perfectly physically adapted for swimming. If he never practiced then he'd be easily outswum by anyone half-decent... but by putting in massive effort training he reaches a point where he's practically unbeatable.",1299035354
