2302099,comment,2300711,2302019,0,0,codeslush,,,"Building a print driver is a very daunting task - so let me clarify.  Don't build it yourself!  There are programs out there that will serve as the underlying driver and you can hook into it to launch your program upon pdf creation.  I believe I used print2pdf in the past to launch my own wizard.<p>You can modify the registry entries to have the print driver called ""Postal Shout Printer"" -- upon user selection, it prints the document to your desired format and then launches your executable.  From this, you get the filename and start all the processing.  Step One:  Who would you like to send this to, Step Two: starts the upload, etc...  I built this wizard functionality over 10 years ago for a client and that's what triggered my idea that you've started to execute on.  Back then, it was VB6 exe that was being launched and it was incredibly stable.  I wrote some winapi hooks to get byte transfer speeds and calculate remaining upload time, etc...  Also, hooked it into a CRM system so that the document could be linked to the CRM.  Slightly different use case, but same net result.<p>I'm sure that driver isn't the only one capable of launching your own executable.  I did a lot of research back then (including writing my own driver) and had many options - the pool of options must be much greater now.<p>I had the ability to create everything on my own back in the day, but I didn't have the capital to purchase the equipment necessary to make it all happen.  That would have ran into the millions of dollars and I was never able to push it through (didn't really try that hard I guess).  I should have just done the printing manually to build up a user base - but I didn't know much about business or even how to do it then.  Heck, I still don't!  :-)<p>My email is in my profile if you want more info.  Or, feel free to ask here - your choice.",1299610741

2302095,comment,2300244,2300244,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've had severe burnouts, and don't want to go through one again. It sucks and it's a waste of time. I've avoided it this far by simply refusing to sacrifice that much. There are some things (e.g. my relationship with my girlfriend) that I will not sacrifice. At 50 hours per week, I expect an explanation. At 60 hours, I want to be paid back in vacation time. If this means I'm fired, I'm fired. Unfortunately, not everyone has this option, but this approach has kept burnout at bay thus far.<p>It's not that I object to working more than 40 hours per week. Considering the time I spend reading about technology and learning new things, plus side projects-- programming, writing, game design-- I've probably been working 65-75 hours per week on average since high school. But if a boss wants direct control over <i>all</i> of that 65, there better be a damn good reason for this arrangement to exist, especially because I learn a lot more on self-directed work than I do by doing what I'm told to do.<p>I think this is a great essay. I think motivational crises happen because ""work"" for most people is psychological monoculture, and we're not built to be that way. I get annoyed when people idealize hunter-gatherer existence, but it was better in one regard: people did a lot of different things (making clothes, building houses, finding food) for work. Specializing for a few years to solve a hard problem is great, but no one's working life should be limited involuntarily to one tiny corner of one discipline, a sub-specialty for which if demand for it collapses, that person is utterly fucked.<p>If you want to see the desperation of the modern working person, consider what working people do on their vacations: picking their own fruit, hiking, working on open-source projects. They're so deprived of opportunities to actually <i>work</i> by their office jobs that when they have free time, they actually do activities that most humans would consider work. I wrote about this phenomenon here (<a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/those-who-work-for-free-and-are-paid-to-do-nothing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/those-who-wor...</a>). It's the fact that their lives are consumed by work-that-isn't-work that makes these motivational crises so common.<p>Unfortunately, outside of the most innovative few percent of technology startups, burnout is treated as a feature rather than a bug. Look at Wall Street or the mainstream ""corporate ladder"". It's a war of attrition: wear people down until 95 percent have motivational crises and quit or get fired, then choose the (badly damaged, but still functional) remaining 5 percent to be the next generation's leaders.",1299610691

Every other reasonable version control system I've ever used will happily merge the upstream changes with my not-yet-committed local changes. But Git refuses. This is annoying.</i><p>Commit-before-merge is not a limitation, it is a feature of DVCS's. Merge-before-commit is broken by design, as you are modifying your unsaved work, and there is no way to get back to your pre-merge state (say you decide the merge conflicts are too much to deal with at the moment).<p>So you are correct, git will not let you merge if youmhave uncomitted work that would be affected by the merge, but it's really just trying to keep you from losing work, not trying to annoy you.<p>That said, this is one of the use cases for 'git stash' which will set aside your uncommitted work. You can then do the 'git pull' and then unstash (stash pop) your work. The advantage of this is that you can always undo the merge if you decide it's not what you wanted afterall. With merge-before-commit, you'd have no such option unless you manually set aside your work.<p><i>But what if I have multiple sets of locally-hacked-up changes? Like suppose I was working on one change when I realized that there's something else I should really fix first. ""git stash"" quickly becomes limiting, since you can't name the individual changes, so you get this list of changes that you don't know what they are or what branch/commit they were based on. In other VCS's like Perforce, you can have multiple sets of independent changes in your working tree. Not possible with Git AFAIK.</i><p>This is what branches are for. Do not be afraid to commit work in progress... you can always polish up that work before you share those changes. For example:<p><pre><code>  git checkout -b feature origin/master\n  edit, ut oh, interuption,\n  git commit -a -m WIP\n  git checkout -b bugfix-1234 origin/master\n  fix bug, git commit -m ""fixed bug""\n  git push origin HEAD:master\n  git checkout feature\n  git reset HEAD^ # removes the WIP commit, but leaves its changes in your working copy.\n</code></pre>\nI hope that gives you a better idea of how you can use branches. You might also want to spend some time reading up on rebase -i. Basically, start thinking of your localc branches as independent patch queues that you can freely edit, reorder, etc until they are ready to be shared. At which point you can push them out to the world.<p>HTH.",1299610117

This is something you need to worry about whenever you pass a function pointer into a library, as there might be an exception-unsafe function higher up in the stack. Propagating an exception up through it is potentially extremely dangerous.<p>That said, using exceptions can still be a good idea, especially if your code doesn't need to be portable or if you know the platforms in advance, and you are careful about passing around function pointers. All you need to do is ensure that any of your code that might be called from third-party code with questionable exception semantics won't throw or propagate any exceptions, e.g. by installing a catch-all exception handler in it.",1299608806

Very sorry to hear about your experiences - I think this highlights quite clearly what a serious thing burnout can be.<p>Hopefully you won't mind if I mention my experience - though I didn't do a computer science degree (something I very much regret), my engineering degree was a very difficult time for me - a family situation carried on throughout the degree, a very, very serious situation (and also very personal, so not going to go into detail), as well as very many other bad things happening to me on what was already a ridiculously difficult workload (my Alma mater has a great reputation based on working people into the ground).<p>There are so many stories I could tell about that time... will stick with just one, however - in my final year my dissertation supervisor treated me like a research assistant - going off and looking at stuff for him which he'd review then throw away, rinse + repeat all year until 2 weeks before the dissertation deadline when he told me I didn't have a project (if I didn't hand anything in that would have been my degree over with, I would have had to repeat the entire final year elsewhere, and would find it hard to actually get a job, so pretty damn major).<p>After 2 weeks of 18-hour days I managed to write a 100-page dissertation and code (in fortran!!) the entire model myself. I eventually got an A grade for the dissertation despite everything, but this supervisor told me afterwards I couldn't pursue a PhD with him because I was a bad student (yeah, kinda dodged a bullet there, not to mention that it would have been a distraction from what I've come to realise was always my calling - programming).<p>In fact my degree choice was largely influenced by 'spiritual' beliefs held by my family, so I had the endless conflict of not actually liking my subject (I wanted to do maths or computer science) while trying to actually survive it.<p>I can't tell you how absolutely destructive that was, it's taken 6 years to even be able to cope with studying on my own, let alone doing the kind of work I need to go in the direction I want to with programming.<p>Anyway, now things are way more positive, focusing on studying the things I need to learn while avoiding burnout (see my other post).

On a busy coding day, I easily create a few branches. If you also count temporary branches on non-development testing machines (I do driver development on Linux for fun) that can easily reach a dozen.<p>Now what for? I create branches to test merges with other developers code, branches before refactoring my in-progress stuff (so I can go back and pick up the original branch with all its history in case it was a dead-end). I do new branches for simple fixes, tracking down bugs (versioning all test-patches so you can check the next day/week what theories you've already tested is sometimes extremely useful). Sometimes I just do a new branch to get the feel of starting with a clean slate.<p>Once a month or so a look at all the branches lying around and delete those no longer useful.<p>All this is only possible because git branching is _cheap_. Orders of magnitudes cheaper than on any central rcs. And the best part is that git never ever loses anything. git reflog shows you _all_ the states you've gone through to the current one. So all these branches are actually valuable.",1299607789

Tim, our sysadmin, was the emergency contact and was on top of things ASAP, but didn't have the particular knowledge to fix it himself. That required a developer.<p>2. He called me first, since the problem <i>appeared</i> to be in Kiln. I'm a Kiln dev, I can and have fixed things on a Sunday evening after a deploy. I missed his first call, but got back to him within 3 minutes (the 30 minutes mentioned in the article was Ben's guess). I started diagnosing the problem and realized it wasn't Kiln specifically that was the problem, but something in the communication between the two. That meant we needed a FogBugz dev, which we got quickly, and possibly a deploy..<p>3. That led us to investigate rolling the specific account back to the previous version. 98 percent of our updates are reversible, but as Ben mentioned, this particular release included not one, but two irreversible database migrations, and since the upgrade step had run successfully, going back would not be an option.<p>4. All tests passed (both automated and manual). Ben has updated the article to make it clear that all but one API call between Kiln and FogBugz was working, and the one call that was broken, the one that lead to this crash, is called very infrequently (on the order of months for some accounts). Yes, integration tests should have and will cover that one API call, but missing one corner case is very different than not doing integration testing.<p>5. Given the situation we were in, the problem will always be solved more quickly when we're in the office than when we're at home. We take every possible precaution to avoid outages, but they will still happen, and moving to mid-week deploys is just another precaution to decrease the impact of these outages if and when they occur in the future.<p>So in short, yes, this is the very definition of real software, and we take this very seriously. Your bullet list of armchair quarterback suggestions grossly oversimplifies the situation.
