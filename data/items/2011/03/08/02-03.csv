Dogs are assets. If all government departments are told to use accrual (rather than cashflow), they need to depreciate assets.<p>So the account needs to figure out how dogs depreciate. Should you assume that a dog has a useful life of 10 years, and loses 10% of its initial value every year? Or that it exponentially decays, as it gets older and less able to sniff bad guys? Or should it only be 5 years? What do you do if a dog ends up working long past its expiry date?<p>It can be tricky to come up with sensible numbers.

Chef is really good at integrating with your application (especially if you are using Ruby). I typically think of Chef as a framework to program your infrastructure against. Puppet is more of the middle manager. :)<p>Both are easy to test, with Puppet winning slightly with 'puppet apply <manifest>'. Chef-solo is nice but takes a little bit more to setup (solo.rb and node.json for example). Either way, test and see what you think will work best for you.",1299552678
2299615,comment,2299409,2299409,0,0,DougBarth,,,"We've been using Puppet to manage our servers for some time now. As a group of developers doing our own operations work, we've found puppet both good and bad.<p>Setting up puppet was relatively straight forward. We had the puppetd auto-updating our servers for a while, but ultimately decided to manually run it when deploying changes. Managing zero-downtime changes was more error prone with it running.<p>Some aspects of Puppet have over time proved frustrating to us. The top annoyance is we never quite figured out a good way to test our puppet changes before checking them into git to deploy them to our puppetmaster. That has lead to a number of ""fixing errors"" type commits. The second annoyance we've found is actually highlighted as a feature: no implicit ordering of operations. While it might sound great to be able to reorganize your configs without fear of breaking the deployment, we've found that the tradeoff is that you don't find out that your configuration doesn't define its dependencies correctly until you try to kick a new server after spending months incrementally adding to your existing servers. For us, at least, having an implicit top to bottom ordering would lessen that headache.<p>Despite some of these headaches, simply having our configuration in version control is a huge win for us. We can setup a box much more easily, and we have a comment trail of why changes were made.",1299552624

2299613,comment,2299404,2299404,0,0,hasenj,,,"It's my opinion that ""adolescence"" is a new social construct that is not universal and not innate. It's more likely to be a self-fulfilling prophecy more than anything else.<p>In older times, teenagers (above say, 14) were considered men, or young adults. They would fight in armies, or even lead them. They were likely to be married and maybe even have children.<p>For all intents and purposes, people of age 16 are not much different from other adults except in that they don't have much experience in life. The only reason they ""rebel"" is that society still treats them like children. Imagine a 30 year old man being treated as a little hopeless child by his parents; of course he will show signs of resentment. It's not because he's ""crazy"", it's the natural response.<p>Perhaps the reason is partly due to school. If you're in school (below university/college level) you're a child ""by definition"" so to speak (from the society's point of view).<p>If I was in charge, I would design the school system so that elementary and secondary school end by the age 14 and then when you're 15 you'd be already in college.",1299552601

Just looking at the way our school systems treats teens is enough to come to a full understanding of why teens develop so slowly.

Without actually being challenged as a complete human being (rather than just mentally in some small part of your brain), why would the brain need to develop?<p>I believe the most detrimental part is the fact that teens themselves often don't see themselves as ""complete"", ""grown up"", or as adults.  This leads them to see and treat everything through a particular lens that they can excuse any behavior on.

It wasn't a terribly large team, and it was quite easy to know who was performing, and who wasn't.  As we were meeting all our deadlines, and I never felt like I was being taken advantage of, I never saw it as an issue.<p>My program manager, on the other hand, firmly believed in the 9-5 mentality, even when it was clearly not working for our team.<p>Before that, I worked at a job where I was free to come and go as I pleased, so long as the work got done.  The work got done, generally ahead of deadline.  Admittedly, I was the only 'developer' on that team, but with careful hiring, and a slow evolution toward freedom, things were a-okay.  When I left there for greener pastures, we'd had consecutive years in which each year was better than the last, dollar-wise.<p>To beat the horse dead, you really got it right the first time, in that I'm free to take or leave the offer.

That sexual drives are perhaps not universal, and that they can be very largely shaped by your culture.<p>If so, then something like adolescence could likely also be susceptible to such an effect.",1299551001

There is sort of intermediate transition time, when (basically) you can have children but you are still a junior member of our society.<p>I have tutored a fair number of teens, and my trick is to treat them like adults who are still practicing (and thus need <i>some</i> supervision).  I am straight up about it too.<p>I think a lot of public school is geared toward getting working class people ready to be treated like children all their lives at the factory/ restaurant/ wherever.   But usually the system wears them down, and they are docile alcoholics or tv addicts, afraid of their bosses and schoolteachers, with really low self esteem by the time they are 20 or so. So kids rebel or ""have fun"" (sex, drugs, rock and roll) while they can -- who wouldn't?<p>I went to a private school myself, where we were all getting ready to have self-driven, challlenging, interesting lives, and except for those of us with seriously screwed up family life (yes, I blame them ...), everybody had really good relationships with teachers and parents.  It made total sense to us to study and learn to interact with older people.  Who wouldn't?",1299550917

Your single test machine has to do ~three times the work, so you should expect slower performance here. (I'm oversimplifying somewhat.)<p>You'll see significantly improved performance on a linear test (in my informal testing, 3-4x speedups) by adding an extra two nodes. <i>Parallelized</i> tests pretty much scale linearly with nodes.<p>In practice, I've found Riak to be slightly slower than MySQL. Direct reads/writes tend to be fast, but JSON parsing can bite you and denormalization requires more writes. The major advantage is that the Riak system can scale linearly with nodes, and that it can fail in predictable and resolvable ways.<p>As an example, the feed system I'm currently building on Riak will survive a total network partition and allow full reads and writes from every node with no data lost. Everything is automatically merged when the partition ends. The vclock-tagged multi-value functionality of Riak is exceptionally powerful when you want to design these types of systems, and is, in my mind, worth the performance hit and additional design complexity for certain classes of problems.<p><i>This was last year so maybe Riak's performance has increased since then.
