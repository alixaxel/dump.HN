The argument that development tools should be free and readily available is a principle of software freedom.<p>I don't want to paint this as black & white, because things rarely are, but on the continuum of free (as in freedom) vs non-free, you'd have to live in a cave on the moon to still cling to the idea that Apple is anywhere near the free side of the scale.<p>You, as a developer, have to make a decision about how you will support your principles. Apple has certainly made theirs. They view their entire platform as theirs to do with as they wish. That is the anti-thesis of freedom. Do not expect this to change.",1299815853

2312063,comment,2309213,2311240,0,0,ohyes,,,"I have not done any reframing whatsoever. You never framed the conversation to begin with.<p>You said, point blank, that composition is better than recursion in functional languages. Better. I called BS.<p>How, exactly, then, do you define 'better'? You didn't give an operational definition of 'better' (which is your responsibility, not mine), so I made up my own.<p>If you don't like it, then be more careful with your claims. It certainly is not 'better' in all meanings of the word. (at least any of those that are clearly defined or measurable for me. In retrospect I see that you were talking about 'style' but 'style' is pretty impossible to measure as it is entirely subjective).<p>..<p>I wrote a similar function in the same language, and it was twice as fast as yours.   Your function, therefore, wastes operations. (At least twice as many, approximately). That isn't a small amount!<p>I'm not even serious about Clojure and my solution seems pretty straightforward. Unless all recursion is rocket science, it is very simple recursion.<p>(Granted I had to RTFM to write it and I suppose a proper name might help, but it would help your implementation too).<p>Why do I need dozens and dozens of ravioli functions that I'm just going to forget that I implemented clutter my name-spaces? Please, for the love of God, at least use a letfn/flet/labels.<p>What is the next developer going to do when I am dead or have retired to my private island? He'll have to learn, not one, but 3 different functions, and know what they do. None of your composed functions are particularly self explanatory.<p>In what way do you think you will get a 2x improvement through the improvement of other functions?<p>I suppose if you write a new compiler for Clojure (perhaps a sufficiently smart one?), it could happen, but you will not get that type of improvement simply by improving the 'pack' function, for example.<p>The way that you are going about collecting the values is fundamentally opposed to efficiency.<p>'Creating homogeneous groupings then counting the size of those groups' (what you did) is going to be slower than 'counting consecutive same things' (what I did).<p>This isn't really about raw efficiency, this is about a fundamentally broken thought process used to describe the algorithm. That broken thought process is a result of attempting to shoehorn the answer into the realm of functional composition.<p>Anyway, I respectfully disagree.",1299815752

2311987,comment,2311197,2311197,0,0,nl,,,"This analysis is pretty superficial.<p>Yes, ARM is ahead on low-power devices, and yes Intel can (and probably will) catch up, especially as ARM moves towards more powerful processors (dual core, etc). This article did acknowledge that at least, which most seem to miss.<p>It does go into a few of the advantages of the licencing model (""this model enables OEMs to customize integrated chips that conform to different form factors"", etc), but it didn't discuss the disadvantages this model brings.<p>For example, Intel has a pretty significant lead in building chip foundries. AMD hasn't been able to compete successfully at the high end because of that, and the ARM licencing model doesn't generate the profits needed to go head-to-head with Intel in foundry and high end research.<p>This is a real problem for ARM. To quote Ars:<p><i>First, there's simply no way that any ARM CPU vendor, NVIDIA included, will even approach Intel's desktop and server x86 parts in terms of raw performance any time in the next five years, and probably not in this decade. Intel will retain its process leadership, and Xeon will retain the CPU performance crown. Per-thread performance is a very, very hard problem to solve, and Intel is the hands-down leader here. The ARM enthusiasm on this front among pundits and analysts is way overblown—you don't just sprinkle magic out-of-order pixie dust on a mobile phone CPU core and turn it into a Core i3, i5, or Xeon competitor. People who expect to see a classic processor performance shoot-out in which some multicore ARM chip spanks a Xeon are going to be disappointed for the foreseeable future.<p>It's also the case that as ARM moves up the performance ladder, it will necessarily start to drop in terms of power efficiency. Again, there is no magic pixie dust here, and the impact of the ISA alone on power consumption in processors that draw many tens of watts is negligible. A multicore ARM chip and a multicore Xeon chip that give similar performance on compute-intensive workloads will have similar power profiles; to believe otherwise is to believe in magical little ARM performance elves.</i><p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/02/nvidia-30-and-the-riscification-of-x86.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/02/nvidia-30-and-t...</a> (read this whole article - it's very good).<p>That leaves the low-to-midrange to ARM. As has already been noted, Intel is quickly becoming power-competitive there, and is very, very good at producing chips cheaply.<p>I'm not saying ARM isn't an important competitor, but I am saying the whole ""ARM will eat Intel from below"" narrative is naive. It's going to be a fierce competition, and it's not at all clear that ARM's business model really is an advantage at all.<p>Meanwhile, Intel can hedge it's bets and play at the licencing game, too. For example, they have experimented with licencing Atom manufacture to TSMC (the same ARM foundry mentioned in the article): <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/160496/intel_opens_up_the_atom_processor_to_tsmc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/160496/intel_opens_up_the_ato...</a>",1299813452
