A kick in the pants for which I thank you.<p>CEO said he didn't intend on having me attend investor meetings because blah, blah I was too green. I figured I'd work hard for 6 months and change his mind. Never happened. At the time, I didn't see the need to go to investor meetings, didn't see that they'd be a good use of my time. But now, with a CEO who meets with customers and investors alone, he actually can call all the shots unquestioned because he's the only one with knowledge of what they need.<p>He was actually honest with me, before I even started, that he didn't think I was true co-founder material... by saying that he'd not be bringing me in on investor meetings. I was just naive and thought I could ""prove myself"". And I only got to double-digit equity because of going on deferred cash for so many months (far more than he thought it'd take to get VC). I just let myself deny it, figuring I'd win him over with 12 months of hard work. It never happened, and now my attitude is weak, my work ethic has become mediocre, and I just need to change everything: circumstances and attitude.",1300579093

Anyone building a system (e.g., for a startup) or maintaining/extending an existing system should be aware of these numbers -- if for no other reason than that they are fully aware of any tradeoffs they are choosing to make (""well, optimizing for seeks on write is premature at te moment, we need some users first, but I can at least add a level of indirection to prepare for future improvements."" or even ""yes, I know this will require refactoring as soon as we have XXXX users, but f-it, we gotta get to market.

Back when the Amiga was a hot machine to work on there were two compilers Lattice C and Manx C, Lattice was the one sanctioned for development and it took a long time to compile and link, Manx on the other hand compiled really really fast. A number of developers discovered that the fast compiler had a weird effect of making it easy to try lots of things quickly, rather than contemplating what you needed to do next.<p>Then recently Randal Munroe published an XKCD cartoon on attention deficit management [1] which when I saw it, it really resonated with this same experience. Basically by slowing things down, quality improved. Clearly there is a fundamental principle here somewhere, something along that lines that there is an ideal pace for development (perhaps unique to each individual) where going faster or slower than that ideal negatively impacts quality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/862/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/862/</a>",1300578317

Good preparation for an interview of a scientist who just published a news-making paper would be reading the paper before the interview.<p>It's just as easy to cite papers on the radio as in print to make the paper findable, by saying something along the lines of ""a paper by A. Smith and B. Jones published in the 1 April 2001 issue of Science.""

In order to be vulnerable, you not only have to, say, allow a user-mode program to write on a page marked as executable (something I remember some high-end processors from the late 80's could prevent) but you actually must have a buffer overflow to go with it.
