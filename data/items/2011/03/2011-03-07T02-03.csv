2295770,comment,2295356,2295587,0,0,trotsky,,,"I've heard the issue discussed by interested parties, though certainly not international law scholars. It seems the commonly held opinion is also a rather simple one - an electronic attack that causes a building to explode would be the same as bombing the building, stealing classified documents electronically is espionage, and so fouling nuclear enrichment would be sabotage.<p>The critical difference is proving who did it. If you want to prove who bombed your building often there is some physical evidence that can be pretty conclusive. Chemical signatures of the explosives, photographs from customs, caught on video, what type of plane it was etc.<p>Electronic attacks often fall more in the lines of having circumstantial evidence. Even if ""everyone knows"" who did it, it probably falls short of proof unless someone takes credit.<p>Is sabotage an act of war? I'm not sure if there is a set standard. In practice it often seems to get a pass - the CIA was apparently responsible for sabotaging a pipeline in Siberia in 1982 without any international outcry. Especially in the realm of non-proliferation the international community seems to be mostly united.

2295765,comment,2295524,2295524,0,0,wittjeff,,,"Tips for minimizing the food budget:
- Cut your meat intake in half or lower. It's expensive, and you'll feel better. Avoid red meat in general, as it is most expensive.  Eggs are the cheapest protein. Tuna is probably second.
- Generally speaking you should consider rice, potatoes, oats, and beans the base of your diet. They're all cheap if you buy them unprocessed.
- Get in the habit of diluting everything that is processed by half.  So if you get a package of cheesy rice mix for 1 euro, add a cup of plain rice to it.  Likewise with Tuna Helper, etc. I don't know why they put so much spice mix in those things.  Also you can do this with canned soups -- add a can of beans or veggies, and you have two cans of soup for a lower price.
- I would encourage you to cut out sweetened soda all together, as I believe it has almost no nutritional value and is probably the leading cause of obesity, but if you can get the large containers (they sell 3L bottles over here) on sale they are probably the cheapest source of calories.
- Make your own coffee and tea.  Get a thermos if you don't have one.
- Consider milk a luxury.  It is relatively expensive for what you get out of it.<p>Cutting out all of these things that are above-average cost, you may wonder what damage it will do to your health. I'm a firm believer that optimal nutritional health comes from 1) greatly lowering the excess bad stuff and 2) eat green things.  Really, anything loaded with chlorophyll is probably good for you, and will fill in the gaps in your nutrients.  I'd bet you could live on rice and spinach alone indefinitely.<p>When I was in college I a single-burner hot plate and a 1-qt non-stick sauce pan for just about everything.<p>So basically the cost-minimizing technique is to eat as most of the Chinese do.<p>We have a few discount stores over here (I'm thinking of one in PA, but I know of another in MT) that sell dented cans, out-dated (but perfectly good) boxed food, etc. for roughly half of regular retain price.  It's the same thing you'd get at a regular grocer, but the packages aren't right.  If you have one near you it could save you more than any other diet-changing strategy.",1299465363

Frankly, though, I'm not sure whether there's something BitBucket really ""invented"".  There doesn't seem to be much that either can do and the other cannot, aside from BitBucket's ability to make unlimited private projects (of limited size, of course) where GitHub cannot.<p>Usability seems to be a major difference between not just BitBucket and GitHub, though -- it's also a major difference between Mercurial and Git themselves.  Between the two, I find I like Mercurial/BitBucket much more usable than GitHub/Git.  The big advantage GitHub/Git has is popularity, basically, and I've never really been one to let a lack of market-dominating popularity hold me back.<p>Anyway . . . to answer your question more directly:<p>I don't pay much attention to the fiddly corner cases where they differ in total functionality, so I don't really know who came up with what features first.  They've both been evolving pretty quickly, from what I've seen, so I'm not sure anyone else can really say what features one has copied from the other, unless they were working on one of the two and involved in the imitation process.<p>I don't even see why it matters.  It's like open source software: imitation is a good thing, because good features get more widely used, and everybody wins.  It doesn't have to be a competition.

2295723,comment,2288382,2294166,0,0,jtheory,,,"A few thoughts on this...<p>Almost anything that can be automated can be done manually (or with minimal scripted automation) first, often with pretty good results.  It's generally a good idea to start simple, and don't add complexity and extra work (like configuring/managing automation!) until you are addressing actual needs that you have... at that point, you can measure the pain to decide how much effort to put into the fix.<p>The first step to automated deployment is manual deployment using a checklist.  Before automated unit tests, you have to write unit tests, and be able to execute them manually.  Before automated rollback, you have manual rollback.  Etc..<p>Are your developers able to run the entire project locally?  If so, you are starting off with frequent <i>local</i> deployments, and if you encourage them to implement features in small steps and sync with version control after each step (i.e., at least once a day) then you also have achieved frequent integration builds - each developer is doing them independently.  Next, throw in a script that executes all of your unit tests, and run that yourself daily (don't automate it into every build... that'll swiftly make them too slow and devs will start avoiding builds...), then email everyone when something is failing.<p>In other words, with a simple cultural standard -- don't hide in a hole and code for a week, and write unit tests! -- you have already solved (for a small team) most of what continuous deployment addresses.  And you haven't put any time whatsoever (or spent money/time hiring someone) into setting up some non-trivial automation yet.<p>The other advantage is that by the time you <i>are</i> seriously ready to automate your build, it may be quite different from what you have now -- it depends on where your project goes, if you make a large pivot, mix in new technologies, and so on.<p>This solution might work for quite a long time; are there good reasons to implement continuous deployment instead, from the start?<p>Other than the cool factor, I don't think so.",1299464460

2295713,comment,2294755,2294755,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I've seen a few commenters remarking that SEO is a zero-sum game. I hope to refute this to some extent.<p>Yes, there is only so much room at the top for any given keyword like 'buy Viagra'. Also, there is only so much room in the market for a product like Viagra. (I'm using Viagra because of it's infamous relationship to search engine spam.)<p>This is true of any market. You have market share, and you have your slice of the pie. Most marketers, entrepreneurs, and economists have gotten past this concept with the acceptance of creating value, or the 'growing pie'. But somehow, the general sentiment towards SEO doesn't make the connection. After all, if you're not in the top few rankings on the SERPs, you're not getting clicks. It makes apparent sense that there is only room for 3-4 'winners' for a given keyword.<p>The problem with this is that good SEO involves a traffic strategy that goes beyond the single most obvious keyword. There is an unlimited supply of keywords to choose from. Maybe 'buy Viagra' is too lofty a keyword to search for, but 3 minutes of brainstorming could produce other avenues to attract traffic. SEO isn't just the process of optimizing for a keyword, it's in choosing the most relevant keywords to capture the market, including the unrealized market.<p><i>If you are marketing your startup based on your competitive advantages or differentiating factors, then there is room to differentiate and win with your SEO. It's time for an example:</i><p>Lets say there is only one type of car in the world. There is also a global car market of say, 100 million cars annually. To the casual observer, any new car maker would be competing in a zero-sum game. The only way to sell cars is to take car sales away from the one type of car maker. If you're selling the exact same car, then you have doomed your business. What about a different car? How about a 2 door car. Maybe it gets better gas mileage. Now you have your competitive advantage. Your marketing strategy is now to emphasize how you are different. Some portion of the car market will want your different car. They may even specifically look for a '2 door car', which your one competitor doesn't offer. Imagine an SEO strategy for this new car. You would probably pick keywords that emphasize your differentiating factors ('2 door car', for example). Why would your competitor be optimizing for '2 door car'? You've expanded the market for cars, and similarly have found an uncompetitive set of keywords.<p>My point in all of this is to say that while from an extremely narrow point of view, SEO could be considered a zero-sum game, but when you broaden your perspective it becomes evident that it's no different than any marketing for a business. In business it's possible to discover and meet new customers without taking away your competitor's customers, and similarly you can optimize and win on keywords without a ranking arms race with the other competitors. Optimize based on your competitive advantages and differentiating factors and you'll do well. If you don't have any such advantages, you've got bigger problems than poor SEO.",1299464210

The system became sclerotic, and over time, the economic engine of the world turned creaky and sluggish.<p>""Germany, by contrast, was almost entirely destroyed by World War II. That gave it a chance not just to rebuild its physical infrastructure but also to revise its antiquated arrangements and institutions . . . with a more modern frame of mind.""<p>On the other hand, Britain is arguably not very far behind Germany even today, as Britain later had opportunities to learn from failure.

At first this might seem counter-intuitive to you, but I've seen dramatic reductions in the error rate just from picking good features or a reasonable model structure in a way that's not easy to automate.
