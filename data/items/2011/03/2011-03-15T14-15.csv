Nuclear power plants are expensive, and they have vast hidden costs that are offset to society (how much will it cost to Japan to clean up this mess? is this added to the cost?). Many countries are already getting a very significant percentage of their energy from renewable sources, things like solar power or wind power are getting more efficient by the day, and if a real, massive and sustained investment was done in this area I think we wouldn't be having debates like this one in 10 years. And I won't even enter to discuss topics like energy independence, which are <i>huge</i>.<p>Anyway, clearly a complicated issue, not trying to convince anyone here of anything.",1300201123

In scenarios where all engineered safety systems were ruined, there was still a period of hours to take corrective actions before onset of core damage.<p>Now, you may argue that what indeed went wrong in the case of the Fukushima plant was that the ""redundant systems"" didn't provide the ""backup protection"" the experts relied on. I see this report is confident this would not be the case were the terrorists to hit a nuclear plant, but based on what happened in the last few days I'd say the confidence level for that scenario is bellow 100%.<p>Anyway, thx for those downvotting me, and I hope I'll never be proven right.",1300201085

What happened is nothing to sniff at. So making a big deal over Chernobyl is no problem.<p>Second, the problem is that the anti-nuclear movement is trying to make people believe that it was much worse than it was, in an attempt to use irrational fear to bolster resistance against nuclear.<p>These are people who have no problem with lies, to them the end justifies the means, they will do anything they can, including breaking laws to stop nuclear power.

2327729,comment,2327320,2327579,0,0,scott_s,,,"I think saying ""magically survive"" is being uncharitable to bhousel. What it has made me reconsider is the notion that even if we're able to design a system to withstand the problems we do foresee, it still may fail because of the problems we don't foresee or considered too unlikely.<p>I know this is almost a tautology, but when the stakes are as high as a nuclear powerplant, it's important to consider.  Nuclear powerplants are the poster-child of massively redundant fail-safes. If we (as a species) are not able to design a system to withstand natural disasters when we know the stakes are as high as possible, then maybe we shouldn't play that game. While a massive tsunami is rare, it's not necessarily rare on the time scale that we expect nuclear plants to be operational. Given our track record, perhaps we can expect a serious problem once every 50 years. That's really infrequent - but it still might be too frequent considering the consequences.<p>I haven't come to any conclusions, and I don't think bhousel has, either.

2327655,comment,2326502,2326502,0,0,pge,,,"One of the music theory things it took me a while to understand is why different major keys matter.  In an idealized world, one can start a scale on any frequency and move up in whole and half steps (WWHWWWH) and have a scale.  So why talk about the ""key of G"" vs the ""key of C"" if all that denotes is the frequency of the note we start on (which can be shifted up or down arbitrarily to suit the range of the instrument or vocalist)?  The answer lies the physics of frequencies.  The notes are not exactly the same from key to key because the whole and half steps are not exactly the same width.  A perfect ""fifth"" (e.g., C & G played together) from a frequency perspective (meaning the two frequencies that resonate together creating a harmonic one octave above the lower) has a frequency ratio of 3/2 meaning the G is 1.5x the frequency of the C.  The octave has a ratio of 2 (the high C is twice the frequency of the C below it).  G is 7 half steps above C and the octave is 12 half steps.  So if we walk our way up the piano in fifths, after 84 half steps, we would have a note (3/2)^12 = 129.75x the original frequency.  But if we do the same on the octaves, we get 2^7 = 128x the original frequency, so the note we need to make all the major fifths sound right is different from the note we need to make the octaves sound right.  The two are diverging slightly.  So the result is that we can tune an instrument perfectly in one key only or we can tune it in a compromise of all the keys which sounds okay over a short range but sounds worse as we try to cover a wider range. If you're interested, there's lots of good reading on the subject (google ""well-tempered"" or ""meantone"").<p>EDIT: I realized I assumed a key concept in there. When two notes are played together, a third is heard (the ""beat"" frequency).  If f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the notes being played, f2 - f1 = the beat freq.  An octave sounds nice because the beat disappears (2f - f = f, so the beat is the same as the lower note of the octave).  Other ""pleasant"" chord combinations are ones in which the beat does not clash with the first two note (e.g., is an octave of one of the notes).",1300200109

Well, IMHO this is a purely arbitrary cultural artifact resulting from the evolution of the keyboard (first in pipe organs). Since the octave is divided into 12 chromatic tones, you could in theory devise a keyboard with alternating white/black keys. However, the organ keyboard evolved in the middle ages, when chromaticism wasn't fully developed, hence, it appears the ""white notes"" of the keyboard appeared first, then later, the black notes added at the appropriate positions within the chromatic scale. See this, along with the accompanying picture, which clearly shows a small keyboard with the white keys only:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ#Keyboards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ#Keyboards</a>",1300199311

2327495,comment,2326545,2327490,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Part Two<p>III.  What TeX is Good for.<p>No single piece of software is everything, and neither is TeX.<p>It is possible to look at TeX and wish for more.<p>So, just what is TeX and what is it good for?<p>The history is clear:  For Knuth's series of books, 'The Art of Computer Programming', the publisher Addison-Wesley told Knuth that for his next edition they were going to use an approach to typesetting that would reduce the 'typesetting quality' of the results.  So, Knuth wrote TeX so that he could do the 'typesetting' for his books himself and deliver to the publisher 'camera-ready' copy or perhaps just some files.<p>So, Knuth wrote TeX to let him write his books.<p>Knuth presented his work to the American Mathematical Society that quickly took TeX seriously.  Why?  For typing math, TeX is terrific, was much better than anything else, and mostly still is.  Otherwise, the typesetting quality is about as high as typesetting gets.<p>So, TeX is also good for developing camera ready versions of papers in mathematics.<p>Quickly TeX became the international standard for word processing of more mathematical material in all of the more mathematical fields in science and engineering.<p>Since then, TeX has been used for the word processing for many books in mathematical fields.<p>TeX is good for such word processing:  TeX was designed for such work and is heavily used for it.<p>Note:  With TeX, Knuth was essentially looking backwards in time, not forward.  So, he was writing software to automate, with high quality, what was old and solid but slow and expensive in manual typesetting for mathematics and to be printed on paper.  So, he was not trying to do all of word processing, graphical design, interactive user interface, and software development for the future of information, computing, the Web, and civilization.<p>Notice the typesetting and 'graphical design' in Knuth's 'The Art of Computing' and 'The TeXBook' and in papers with a lot of mathematics:<p>(1) There isn't a lot of color; mostly it's just black and white.<p>(2) There fonts are not 'stylish' like can find in printed advertising.<p>(3) There are only a few tables and figures, and the figures are mostly simple line drawings, X-Y graphs, or photographs.<p>(4) The output is to be on paper and not 'interactive' or continually updated.  That output can also be converted to PDF and still not be interactive.<p>(5) Typically the writing is by no more than a few authors so that the techniques for coordinating the work of many people on one large software development project are not relevant.<p>Net, the emphasis is on the technical content and not the typography, graphical design, GUIs, or large work groups.<p>So, now we know what TeX is good for.<p>IV.  Warnings.<p>For the math, be well advised to stay with just Knuth's math fonts standard in TeX and the AMS fonts and symbols.  Once you are staying with these math fonts, for the text just stay with Knuth's Computer Modern fonts that are standard in TeX and work well with the math fonts.<p>For developing your own high quality math fonts for TeX, that'd be a LOT of work.  For using fonts for text other than Knuth's standard Computer Modern, it would be a lot of work to get them to work well with Knuth's math fonts.<p>If you are not doing math, then you can work to use fonts Helvetica, Bookman, Century School Book, etc. for your text, but then there will be some question just why you are using TeX.<p>If you are developing a Web page, then use HTML and whatever, maybe ASP.NET, that helps writing HTML.  TeX and HTML have very different purposes.<p>If, compared with TeX, you want a lot more or something very different, then you will likely run into problems from limitations from the original intentions of TeX.<p>If you want something as good as TeX where TeX is good plus a lot more, then don't hold your breath while waiting for it.<p>If you want to write a better TeX yourself, then start with Knuth's voluminous, exemplary, polished, very finely detailed documentation in volumes A-E of 'Computers and Typesetting'.  After reading that material, you may decide that you have better things to do than writing a better TeX.<p>Don't think that TeX and HTML compete:  They are designed for very different purposes.",1300198296

My Background.<p>I was an early member of the TeX user's group (TUG) and have been a serious and happy TeX user for 15 years.<p>I use TeX itself just as Knuth wrote it and rarely have anything to do with LaTeX or any of the other extensions or preprocessors.<p>The TeX installation I use is ProTeX 1.2, which now is relatively old.  From ProTeX 1.2, beyond TeX itself, I make heavy use of three more programs:  (1) The screen preview program YAP (yet another previewer).  (2) The program DVIPDFM.EXE for converting TeX output files with extension DVI (device independent file) to PDF.  (3) The spell checker Aspell.<p>I type my input into my favorite, general-purpose, programmable editor KEdit.  Nearly all my typing for anything goes into KEdit -- blog posts, e-mail, notes on cooking to car and house maintenance, programming in ASP.NET, Visual Basic .NET, C, PL/I, Fortran, Rexx, etc.  And I use Aspell for essentially all my spell checking.<p>Point:  My means of input to TeX is just this general purpose text editor.  I do a lot of typing, use this editor heavily and have for 25 years, and, thus, have good facility with it.  So, I minimize typing into anything else and am pleased that for TeX I can type just into this same text editor.  In particular, for entering TeX I want nothing to do with any other tools for typing.  I would consider converting to an editor better than KEdit, but I see no candidates.<p>I have a Ph.D. in applied math, and for me TeX is one of my most important professional tools.  Why?  A crucial reason is, for typing math TeX is well designed.<p>Since TeX has high quality in many respects, I also use it for nearly all my higher quality word processing -- letters, foils, technical documentation, business plans, etc.<p>II.  How to Use TeX.<p>There is a book, Knuth's 'The TeXBook'.  It is polished documentation, very carefully written to make first and easy things easy but still contains a lot of detail.  Really you need a copy of the book and to read at least the easier parts cover to cover.<p>In its internal design as software, TeX makes heavy use of the idea of 'macros'.  The main idea of the macros is just string substitution.  The main use of the macros is just to replace some frequently used long patterns of typing with short patterns.<p>The macro language is powerful enough that TeX is really a programming language.  Yes, the language supports arithmetic, string manipulations, if-then, loops, and reading and writing files.<p>The language also has an elegant 'architecture' of scope of names.  So there is the nested and static scoping of what is typed in and also the nested and dynamic scoping as the macros execute.  For this scoping, there is memory management with a push down stack with some enhancements.<p>So, a good TeX user will write some macros, and I have over 100 that I have used for years and write new ones occasionally.  I have macros for tables of contents, automatic numbering of chapters, sections, tables, and figures, cross referencing, bibliographic entries, simple lists, ordered lists, and lists with bullet points, putting TeX annotation on figures, using some of the special math fonts from the AMS (American Mathematical Society), more in memory management, etc.<p>TeX has a concept 'verbatim' which means to produce output 'just as entered' and that might contain characters such as '$_%\' usually treated in special ways in TeX.  I have several macros for verbatim, and some of these are good for listing source code and TeX macros.<p>To create a new document with TeX, I make use of the windows in Windows:  So, I have one window with KEdit with the document I am creating, one window for the screen preview program YAP, and one window to run the TeX program itself.  These three windows work well.<p>So, I type in my document, run TeX, and look at the output in YAP.  The process works well.<p>If there is some tricky TeX usage in my document, then at the tricky part I repeatedly execute a fast loop of type, run TeX, and look at YAP.<p>TeX is so efficient that on a PC with a 1.8 GHz processor, usually TeX is done in less than two seconds, maybe less than the time it takes for me to get my finger off the Enter key.<p>I have enough experience with TeX that now I rarely have to look at my copy of 'The TeXBook'.  E.g., my main collection of TeX macros are all in one directory and have documentation, and I have a KEdit macro that displays the directory of TeX macros so that I can easily check details.  I have many examples of TeX usage, and for something tricky I've done before I just look at the old example.<p>Generally in my computer usage, I want to script things; TeX is easy to drive with scripts, and I do that.<p>Going back at least to Xerox PARC, there is a 'paradigm' of computer 'graphical user interface' (GUI) based heavily on buttons like on a kitchen appliance and a mouse for pushing the buttons.  Microsoft's Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are based heavily on this paradigm.  There are 'integrated development environments' (IDEs) for writing software that make heavy use of this paradigm.  There are Web browsers, and now there is more with 'smart phones'.<p>GUIs have revolutionized computing:  E.g., on the Internet GUI Web browsers are one of the main differences between the current Web which is changing the world and various 'bulletin board' systems that came before which changed little.<p>But GUIs have some problems; TeX is not based on GUIs, and I don't want it to be.<p>There is an old description:  ""With 'what you see is what you get' (WYSIWYG), what you see is all you've got."".  To see the importance of the difference, with TeX your input is explicit, in text, in a file, and, if you wish, with some documentation of any tricky parts.  E.g., my simplest verbatim macro has 54 lines of documentation and 7 lines of TeX code.  So, with the 'explicitness', you know what you did, can copy it, use it again, document it, modify it, etc., and all such things are more difficult to worse with GUI WYSIWYG approaches.",1300198244

    Yes, this is true! and BT Infinity customers will benefit from the removal of

    Once removed, heavy user customers will be able to download/stream as much as
    they wish without having their speeds restricted.

    BT will remove the FUP controls currently applied to customers with ‘atypical’
    usage. Today atypical users are restricted at 300GB usage and account for less
    than 0.5% of the BT customer base. BT will not target any individuals with
    restrictions based on usage levels. However, we still have traffic management
    policies that will restrict certain applications / protocols, such as P2P,
    when the network is busy.

    As BT continues to invest in the network and network bandwidth we can now
    remove these restrictions and ensure the experience of the wider customer base.

    (Note that charges will still apply for going over limits on BT Total Broadband

I find it very frustrating that Western music breaks the twelve notes into two classes: the ""naturals"" (ABCDEFG), and ""accidentals"" (A# C# D# F# G#, and enharmonic equivalents). Playing guitar, I have come across people explaining barre chords -- a single fingering for a type of chord (e.g., major, minor) that you can shift up or down the fingerboard -- as ""you can play any chord with this: E, F, G, A, etc."", and ignoring almost half of the possible chords. I'm convinced that the naming of notes to simplify playing in the key of C major or the relative A minor has inhibited players from gaining a real understanding of intervals.<p>To wit: when I play piano, I play in C.

2327454,comment,2327336,2327336,0,0,cletus,,,"The OP raises some valid points (agree with them or not).<p>> 1. Phone storage vs. SD card storage<p>As much as people much like expandable storage it is, by definition, more complicated. There are currently two simple models:<p>1. All internal (the Apple model); and<p>2. All external (the digital camera model, even though some do have up to 1-2GB of internal storage).<p>Having a mix is like having two hard drives. You're suddenly asking your users to make decisions about things they probably don't care about or that they do care about in ways you can't predict. Will they want this app on internal or external storage? What about this music?<p>All external works for digital cameras because the OS (firmware, etc) is in the camera. The photos and videos go on the card. You don't lose functionality when you take out the card (apart from edge cases like saving profiles on certain high end DSLRs).<p>This is why I believe iDevices will <i>never</i> have an SD card slot. Or, if they do, it will only be for very limited use, much like the Camera Connection Kit on the iPad.<p>> 2. The epic list of applications (ELOP)<p>I find this a little strange too. If someone installs something, it appears at the top level in iOS. On Android, mainly due to manufacturer customization, you have less ""home pages"" for your apps (and they're generally filled with crud you need to remove). Making your newly downloaded app harder to find is a little odd.<p>> 4. Inconsistent interaction<p>This is like the one/two button mouse argument. iDevices have one button, the home button (as well as volume and, on the iPad, a mute/orientation lock switch). In part for this reason, iOS apps are extremely consistent.<p>Android has 4 buttons: back, home, menu, search. IMHO at least 2 of them are unnecessary. App developers use them in completely inconsistent ways, which tends to frustrate the user.<p>The way I describe iOS (and Apple in general) is that they make the right choices for most users most of the time. Nothing will ever make everyone happy. The uncomfortable truth is that this is really the best thing to do for the market as a whole.<p>Many tech-savvy people chafe against what they see as choices being taken away from them (which they are) but they're also under the illusion that a) they need these choices and b) having these choices, by definition, is better. Neither is true. You may like these extra choices but that doesn't mean that they're good or that you <i>need</i> them.<p>Again, we can make a Windows/Mac comparison. Windows apps are horribly inconsistent. Mac apps are almost completely consistent. That makes learning new Mac apps much, much faster for experienced Mac users. By the same token, put a Mac user in front of Windows or a Windows user in front of a Mac and both will flounder (I don't buy the argument that Macs are <i>inherently</i> easier; it still comes down to what you're used to). The learning curve is definitely gentler on Macs however. Same for iOS (vs Android).",1300197733

Having a checkbox to enable/disable the snapshot may be a useful option too. So then the user can still send a message, but without the snapshot.",1300197730

What is this ""convenience-privacy continuum?"" I just did a web search, I can't find anything. Citation, please. Third, I dispute your suggestion that there is nothing to see here. Strongly. Forcefully.<p>If someone has never read anything about or by Mr. Stallman, there is plenty to see here. There may be nothing to see here for <i>you</i>, but when you say ""Nothing to see here,"" you are speaking in absolutes. I have read a fair bit about his beliefs and I found a few things of interest in the article, such as the discussion about the Replicant variation of Android and the Tivoization of Android by carriers. This may not be news to you, but it's news to me.<p>Therefore, I say there <i>is</i> something to see here.<p>I can't speak to your thinking or motivations, so what follows is a general observation: On HN we have a principle of not downvoting comments just because we disagree. Upvotes and downvotes are ideally applied on the basis of whether they contribute positively to the discussion. A contribution can be made simply by opening a new line of thought, even if the premise is flawed.<p>I am not going to get into whether I agree or disagree with Mr. Stallman's beliefs. However, I will suggest that his various missives, rants, and other statements contribute positively to the general fabric of discussion around software freedom and personal privacy. This suggestion is open to discussion: I am aware that some people think his zeal does more harm than good. But that's what I believe.<p>I said above that I believe the article provides a public good by including information that someone like myself may not have already known. I now suggest that the article also presents something that is a public good by contributing positively to the general fabric of discussion about cell phone technology and privacy, even if you or I might disagree with Mr. Stallman's views.<p>You are free to draw your own conclusions, of course. I'm just trying to explain mine.",1300197651
