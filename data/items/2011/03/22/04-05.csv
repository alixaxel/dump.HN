The amount of effort that went into that transition was staggering.  For his part, Jedberg said [1] that preparing and maintaing redditOSS will likely be one of the first projects for their new hires, as it will make development and maintenance on their current codebase that much easier.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2345247"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2345247</a>",1300769969

All international agreements are ultimately contingent, the question is how much shit has to change between now and the point where your agreement would fall apart that dictates how strong and resilient your agreement is.  Gaddafi's no chump, he knows nobody likes him, or he wouldn't be such a paranoid mofo.<p>Likewise, Iran and North Korea know how distrusted they are by NATO nations.<p>North Korea is a particular instructive example, as they <i>did</i> go through a period of disarmament and verification, only to renege on their agreements.  They got what they wanted from the international community, and after their incentives changed (presumably things weren't <i>as</i> dire as they were before), they told everyone to go fuck themselves.",1300769695

In those professions you mentioned, all people who (legally) work in the field must undergo a process of training and subsequent certification.

Yes, there are people that cheat the system, but the licensing exists to weed them out and protect the consumer.<p>Software ""engineers"" undergo no such process or requirements. I can learn ruby in my basement in a year, call myself a software engineer, and get hired building any number of apps. Is my work critical enough that someone may die if I am not certified?
