2353597,comment,2351910,2352076,0,0,Someone,,,"<i>a mark cannot be registered if it consists solely of a generic or purely descriptive term. ""Store"" is generic.</i><p>Yes, it is, but as far as I can read from the Bloomberg article, the question at hand is about the combination of ""App"" with ""Store"" (if 'App' were the claim, they would have to go after Google, too). I haven't read Apple's claim, but I am fairly sure that Apple will argue that ""App Store"" is not solely a purely descriptive term. Also, there are many trademarks on more generic terms. For example, ""Jaguar"" is a trademark of Linotype (<a href=""http://www.linotype.com/3228/jaguar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linotype.com/3228/jaguar.html</a>)<p><i>If it should be granted what it seeks, how will other vendors be able to refer even generically to what they are offering?</i><p>""a place where you can buy software"", or even ""a place to buy apps"" (if, as I assume, they are granting that 'apps' has become or always has been generic)<p>Counter-argument: if someone invents a new category of item and spends money to establish a name for it, why should everybody be allowed to go along with the ride? Should an inventor immediately come up with two terms, even before knowing that others want to copy them?\n[Two not-so-good-examples of this I can think of are Royal Mail and KLM. Both have almost generic names (KLM = Royal Air Line Company), British stamps do not even have a country designation on them.]<p>I do think Apple may be too late to claim the term is specific for their store, but I think it will be a close call.",1300783960

I certainly do not want everybody to be equally rich, or, much more likely, equally poor (let's call this ""equality of arrival""). But I would like a more equal society at the starting line (""equality at the start""), and not only for reasons of justice, but because a system of haves and have-nots that in fact makes it much harder for the sons and daughters of the latter to make it is also depriving society of people who could make a contribution, and sometimes never get the chance to. As a result, society will end up being poorer. I do not at all think it is by chance, as a counter argument, that countries and societies where women, who make up 50% of the population, are on a more equal standing with men - think Scandinavia, or Holland, or Germany - are also among the richest, not to mention happiest and most peaceful, in the world.",1300781538
