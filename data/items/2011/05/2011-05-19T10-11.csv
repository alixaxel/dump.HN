A functional brain has ""meaningful synapses"", i.e. neuronal assemblies that represent a given concept, shape, etc... .<p>Getting these out of the box is impossible AFAIK, because of the sheer number of neurons and connections to relate to one another.

2563482,comment,2562929,2563286,11,0,Peaker,,,"The main advantage of sexual reproduction is faster evolution. It makes evolution like a huge parallel computer instead of like lots of small, very slow serial computers.<p>If you examine asexual reproduction: you get a ""tree of evolution"".  Each node in that tree is slightly ""more evolved"" than its parent on average (natural selection prunes the devolved ones more than the evolved ones).<p>However, each branch in the tree has to evolve every single feature independently from its sibling branches. You only inherit evolutionary enhancements of your own ancestors.<p>Assuming a tree of depth N: each node in the tree has only O(N) ancestors, and thus, about O(N) evolution experienced in each node.<p>With sexual reproduction, you also recombine the evolutionary advancements of two ancestors into new nodes. It is no longer a tree, but a DAG of nodes (Directed Acyclic Graph).  Each node now has O(2^depth) ancestors.  Evolution can recombine features that took a long time to develop into a new baseline, and evolve from there.<p>This is an <i>exponential</i> increase in evolution speed -- and I believe that is so incredibly huge of an advancement, that I predict that even species we believe are incapable of sexual reproduction, are probably sexually reproducing (e.g: exchanging DNA in some way) because it is too huge of an advantage to give up.<p>Lastly, I find that it is interesting that there's a similarity between sexual-based evolution process to one of the frameworks we use for parallel computing: ""Map/Reduce"". Take a single node in the tree, and just ""Map"" (mutate & select) over it multiple times, you get slightly better nodes.  Now combining the mutated & selected nodes together into descendants is much like ""Reduce"". ""Map"" is not a useful parallel computation, but ""Map & Reduce"" is.",1305800643

Look at the revenue growth: 2009: $120M, 2010: $243M. Over a billion invitations sent last year. 75% of the Fortune 100 using their professional services as part of recruiting, and they have already diversified to three separate and solid revenue streams.<p>They are not profitable but that is because they do not want to be - they have doubled investment in R&D, development and marketing in the past 12 months. They still have plenty of room to expand, especially internationally.<p>I am not surprised that their target listing price has increased a number of times since the filing - they are on target to reach about $1B in revenue in 2012/13 and a market cap of $3B seemed low, it might still see a sharp first-week increase with the new list price.<p>Excellent return for the investors, who have only had to invest $103M[2] to date (Greylock, Sequoia, BVP and Kopelman). Not sure why they went with the NYSE over the NASDAQ, but this IPO could be a nice investment if you are looking for a tech IPO.<p>LinkedIn haven't nearly received the amount of coverage they deserve, it is a web 2.0 sleeper hit that went about building its business with little controversy, no huge news splash, no secondary market price surge, and no personality conflicts (at least not in public).<p>Edit: And not to forget, LinkedIn has made some excellent contributions to open source software, especially with Voldermont, their distributed kv store (I have used it in dev but not in production, it is pretty cool).

It could seem really cool at first time but your back will hurt like hell next morning. Beside it's more healthy to sleep on a hard mattress.<p>Anyway all of mattresses I saw are two sided. One side is little softer then other. Test the harder side at the store (it should be comfy for you) and if after several nights your back will hurt - flip to the soft side. You need to sleep a several nights on the mattress as your back needs a time to get used to it.",1305800302

Frankly I think you should try to ignore the money aspect, but when a few k is a sizeable percentage of your total salary, I know this is difficult to do.<p>10+ years later I've lived in 3 countries, flown business a lot more often then I would probably have paid for myself, and enjoyed the sort of perks you seem to like the look of in option 1. I've done some interesting technology based work along the way, but I've also done a lot of administrativa.<p>In my case, it was important that the organisation kept trading for the duration of my year's internship, or I wouldn't have recieved the course credit. If this is applicable to you, it is something to consider in your choice. Remember both organisations (their Australian office at least) could have risks in this regard.<p>Good luck!",1305799875

We're thinking of modeling our licensing structure after Sonatype's... if only we could figure how they do it.<p>Our base framework, call it software A, will be an open-source version, maybe GPL or Apache licensed. It contains lots of other GPL software, particularly the dual-licensed Sencha's ExtJS library.<p>Our commercial version, call it software B, is a slightly enhanced version of A, targeted at business users (ie. intranet).<p>Since one can't embed GNU GPL'd software in Apache-licensed OSS, we probably have to choose GNU GPLv3 for A, which is an umbrella for most common oss licenses. <i>But that would make it impossible to have a closed-sourced B software package based on A</i>. Or wouldn't it?<p>Sonatype has a similar offering: Nexus OSS and Nexus Professional. Nexus Professional is an enhanced version of Nexus OSS. Nexus OSS is released under a GNU AGPLv3, ""GNU Afferro General Public License"" [sic], http://nexus.sonatype.org/license.html<p>Now, how can Sonatype release Nexus Professional closed-source when its base, Nexus OSS, is AGPL'd? Aren't they breaking their own license agreement by reusing the community oss software in their closed-source, commercial Nexus Professional?<p>As far as I understand, to commercially re-release your own open software as closed-source it would need to be licensed under MIT/BSD/Apache in the first place, ie. IBM Rational Dev. and Eclipse. But then... I'm confused.<p>Besides, their software, like ours, has ExtJS, which is GPLv3 for OSS, but not for commercial use, which makes it impossible to use Nexus OSS in a business intranet without buying an ExtJS license. Right? Dunno... since ExtJS is actually commercially licensed on a developer base, using OSS that contains ExtJS is actually ok. But then developers from the community can contribute to Nexus OSS Github repository, which kindda makes the ExtJS license useless as there are endless developers contributing to the Nexus OSS project, whereas Sonatype probably only pays for their own ExtJS developer licenses.<p>I know, this is a mess of a question! But our startup will have an offering that is similar to Sonatype's, and we're not sure their licensing is consistent, or even legal, so we're afraid to imitate them.",1305799804
