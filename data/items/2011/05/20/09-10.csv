I would probably need to dig out the docs to figure out:<p><pre><code>  01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700\n</code></pre>\nbecause of the ambiguous 01/02.<p>Also having the year consecutively after the time is a little weird.<p>Seems like big-to-small ISO times (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) might have been a better choice.  They're logical and unambiguous, irrespective of locale.

Just because one can binge so much that the difference is irrelevant hardly means that the difference isn't important in general.<p>The study this cites early on suggests that a low-carbohydrate diet with N calories a day is roughly equivalent to a low-fat diet with only 70% of N calories a day.  So a 2000 calorie-a-day low-carbohydrate diet is equivalent to a 1400 calorie-a-day low-fat diet.  That result is <i>huge</i>.

I occasionally see CPU reviews with white-boxes benchmarking at something like 120W for idle power and 200W for full-throttle work, for CPUs rated at 90W or so.

Why do smokers smoke, knowing full well by now that it will kill them earlier than non-smokers? Why stuff obese people themselves, knowing full well that it will cause serious health issues down the line.<p>Let's take this one step further: Is the reason/mechanism a smoker smokes the same why I browse reddit and HN all day instead of working on my PhD?",1305882596

Hailing from a 3rd world country with a master's degree from US, I work here on a H1B visa.<p>In near future, I want to start my own company. Currently, I want to write some mobile apps and sell them online. However, my employer is not very friendly with such policies and having side projects officially may hurt my chances of getting promoted at work.<p>To fix this I came with the following solution:<p>Start a LLC in US under a cousin's name(a homemaker and US citizen) and sell apps under that LLC's name. I will run the company under her name. Once I decide to go full time on the startup, I am planning to have an arrangement so that I can buy back the company for a nominal amount.<p>Is this a good approach? Also is this legal? Are there better approaches?<p>TIA.<p>PS: I hope people will understand the reason for posting this under a throwaway account.",1305882519
