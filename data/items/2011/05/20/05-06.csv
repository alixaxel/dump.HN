For comparison, the Tyler/Longview (nearest city of size that isn't a suburb of the other) area has about 415,000 people.  The population of the next-nearest major area in Texas?  Dallas/Fort Worth at 6.6 million people.  The question of what makes up ""small town America"" is somewhat fuzzy, but Tyler, compared to an 70 minute drive (not at all unreasonable for a state the size of Texas) west, fits the bill.<p>The other point from anamax about the city slicker teaching the yokels how it should be done is very apt.  There is a reason why hackers gravitate towards Silicon Valley: people like to be with other people who are doing the same thing.  Tyler is by no means dumb.  As the author--who admittedly also posted here that he didn't want to debate the article--points out, there are two universities (University of Texas-affiliated, I might add) and two junior colleges.  The area is also home to pipe and robotics companies.  It is also very insular, especially when it comes to ""being shown how things are done"" because the Dallas area has been the older, wiser brother to Tyler for decades.<p>Oh, and ""nothing about local politics?""
