2519712,comment,2514254,2518241,1,0,wtallis,,,"The ""unusual code"" portion of numpy is the entirety of numpy. It's BLAS for Python. Once it's well-optimized, basically any other numerical code or libraries for python (things like scipy and probably large portions of PIL, and applications built on them) should do reasonably well written in pure python running on PyPy. The JIT in PyPy should be able to offer good performance for non-numerical, dynamic, branchy code, so you will very rarely have to drop down to a lower-level language (C or RPython) except for FFI.<p>JITs can help with tight loops that can't be identified and optimized at compile time, but that's not what Numpy is composed of, and code using numpy shouldn't have to go through several iterations before the Numpy routines get identified as hotspots and optimized. Numpy implements algorithms that are designed to be easy to statically compile into machine language code that makes efficient use of memory, FPU, and cache resources.",1304647090

Because an old PC with equivalent specs is essentially free (anything from ~2000 onwards.) Thousands of them, desktop and laptop, will be being recycled or landfilled every day.<p>Linux on x86 hardware is standard enough that you can effectively call it a standard platform for developers, already, same as this.<p>The remaining key advantage (I guess) is size.

2519682,comment,2519051,2519252,10,0,rexreed,,,"At $4 a gallon, I might even challenge that. I recently calculated the cost of driving from DC to Boston, which is regularly a $240 or so ROUNDTRIP on many airlines.<p>It takes 2 tanks of gas each way (about a 350 mile trip, 20 miles per gallon, 15 gallons per tank). The gas cost alone is close to $240. Even if you managed to burn 3 tanks instead of 4 during the trip, you're talking 45 gallons @ $4 a gallon, which is $180... and that's just gas.<p>The tolls are around $20 each way. So, now you're up to $220. And what about food? Add another $20 or so. More maybe.<p>So, now it costs the same to drive as it does to fly. And that's not even factoring in the cost of your TIME. It takes about 7 hours to drive from DC to Boston. It takes just over 1 hour by plane. Even factoring in the airport wait and transport, you're doing better... and you can do stuff while the plane flies while you can't do anything while you're driving. And then there's traffic. And the wear and tear on your vehicle.<p>And this is for a relatively short trip.<p>So, is driving really economically better? I did the math. I did the trip. It often doesn't make sense. Do the math yourself. Only for short trips does driving beat the cost of flying, and in which case, why you would be flying anyways? On the east coast, I just take the train or a bus. $20 gets you from DC to New York. Another $15 gets you to Boston. You can't beat THAT.<p>So, the cost of gas has completely changed the economics and argument of drive vs. fly. Flying is almost always going to be cheaper, if you can book your flight early enough to get the discounted fares.",1304645955

I live in an urban city in Arizona where there's only one well known/reputable VC in town, not a lot of angel investors in here. If you are a tech startup in AZ, I guess you know what I am talking about. The culture is very different to those in SV.<p>I am about to launch my startup and currently is in the seed stage and have a working prototype done. My team just did a pitch an hour ago to this guy, had no high hopes as we've heard various kind of comments about him. We pitched the whole idea, first question asked was about the revenue source, second sentence that came out of his mouth is ""do you have a business plan written yet""?<p>Just after this sentence was launched, I knew exactly that this is the wrong person to talk to. Which top VC's/angels in SV asks for a business plan during a seed stage of your startup (if there is one please let me know, then maybe my perception is wrong)? I get his point that we need to do more market analysis/research on the app, however to actually have a solid well written business plan at this stage is just ridiculous.<p>With regards to market research, I asked him if we created a website for user to signup, remind them when the product is launched(using service such as launchrock) and showed him we have 500k users signed up, would he be convinced enough in the market of our app? Then he sort of gives an ambiguous answer to it. Again, a ridiculous thought from my point of view. Almost every startup nowadays do use this strategy. I guess he just doesn't notice that.<p>Point to be made here is that, doing a startup is hard, but it's even harder when you're outside the valley. I know it's all about your effort of you to get connected/network, so you can reach Paul Graham/Dave McClure/Yuri Miler, etc. Some say that if you can't get those connections then you lose already. I don't have any connections with people in SV who can introduce me out to these great angels/VC's and that adds another challenge for me. There is a startup meetup here, but only 5-10 people is in the group and mostly they are just talking about side projects that they have, no one rarely talks about angels/VC's (another dead end for making connections to SV). Was planning to just put up my startup at angel.co and see what happens, don't know whether it's the right time or not. One concern is that most of those investors doesn't invest outside of SV. Would be way much easier if I am at SV, so to new startups out there in SV, be grateful for yourself as you're already one step ahead of us who are outside of SV.<p>Yet, this is just another confession from a startup founder experience.

2519615,comment,2519146,2519407,6,0,thyrsus,,,"The two thirds of the article that exposes the ""rule of law"" as the antithesis of a consistent logical system is quite useful.  I think it accurately portrays the reality.<p>The author appears to hold the pre-eminence of property rights over competing rights.  The result is an extremely polarized economic system.  Medieval feudalism as a model legal system?  Yet, we appear to be trending in that direction.  When property rights take precedence, then the holders of property buy the ""legal"" outcomes they want, and they buy the ""law enforcement"" they want, and they buy the ""laws"" they want.  Such is the author's proposal to remedy the current unrealistic expectations.<p>The free market proposed by Adam Smith in ""The Wealth of Nations"" was premised explicitly on a consistent, logical system of moral (God's) law, enforced by the Church (a.k.a. the state - far less distinct at the time).  Without that premise - and the article's author takes care to destroy precisely that premise - the free market is destructive.  Asymmetries in information and power create monopolies, bubbles and crashes.<p>So the law is inconsistent and illogical.  It is good to remember this.  It is good to remember that any large or long lived community can be shown to have betrayed its professed ideals.  It is good to remember that historical ideals - our own as well as society's - have typically been superseded by better ones.  Does that mean we should abandon those ideals, and let ""the market"" rule?  I agree with Holmes, if only in this: ""repose is not the destiny of man"".  Rather, one works to move toward the ideal; the failure to reach it means there is more work tomorrow.  Peace, Justice and Freedom will not find a logically consistent incarnation in our lifetimes nor in our children's, yet the work must continue.",1304644228
