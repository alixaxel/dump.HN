Also, computers take everything literally, they don't say ""Well, that's not what your face is telling me."" or think the patient is lying, delusional, or misinformed. You can ask the patient on a scale of 1-10 of their certainty, but again, there are other problems.<p>""What are these red dots?"" Also seems non-trivial to diagnose. They can be tested, or more questions can be asked of them, but this seems like an awful lot of work to be managed by a computer alone.<p>It's a good, or even great thing to research, but it seems far from implementation, and that's just from an engineering perspective, imagine the legislative hoops that will need to be leapt through!",1306457988

Some comments based on my initial usage.<p>Three bug-ish type things:<p>* If you have an entry without both a first and last name - say ""Dad"" - it displays the missing portion as ""(null)"".  So, in my case, it shows ""(null) Dad"".  I'd personally prefer it just displayed whatever it had and skipped the null.<p>* Clarify the ""None"" value in the ""Notify Days Before"" option.  Does ""None"" mean 'Don't notify me at all' or 'Notify me on the actual day'?  I tend to like to know on the day of, so I can call or otherwise contact the person.  Without tinkering, I can't tell if the app does that or what this option really means.  If the app can't notify ON the day, I'd really like it to.<p>Two requested features:<p>* Anniversary Support - I absolutely love that it populates itself from my address book based on the Birthday category.  It would be doubly awesome if it did the same with the Anniversary entry as well!  Perhaps have them appear on the ""Upcoming Birthdays"" screen with red calendar days instead of blue ones, and make an option to disable them if the person desires.<p>* Two Stage Reminders - It would also be cool to have two of reminders to trigger.  Basically remind me a X days before and then the actual day of.  X days before so I can remember to get a gift or make a plan, and then the day of to remind me again because I'm stupid :-).  Other people would only want to be reminded once, so it should certainly be an option that can be disabled.<p>Two things I love about the app:<p>* If I had Facebook, I'm sure that integration would be awesome and useful.  Automation is very cool.<p>* I love how it tells me how old they will be.  Saves me from having to figure that out every time a birthday comes up.<p>This is a really cool app.  I hope you continue to work on it and it continues to be successful for you.",1306457656

Given what you say about its toxic incentive structure, it's no wonder that the legal profession is held in such frequent contempt.

The typical patient isn't presenting with a rare disease worthy of a medical TV drama, and instead the main problems are patient-interaction ones: getting the right information out of them, picking treatments that the patients will be satisfied with and follow, figuring out what complicating lifestyle factors they might have, building trust with the patient and family members, etc. With the increasing influence of evidence-based medicine, where doctors are supposed to follow experimentally validated rubrics, the diagnosis itself is often semi-mechanical anyway even when done by a human.",1306457226

2589929,comment,2588696,2588696,17,0,billforsternz,,,"I enjoyed this article, I always find the argument that ""these days you can't beat the compiler"" fishy. I remember more than 25 years ago I wrote an 8080 machine code interpreter in 8088/86 assembly. My innermost interpreter comprised 3 lines of asm;<p><pre><code>  lodsb     ;al = *si++
  mov ah,al ;eg if al=3eh (=mvi a,dd), then ax=0x3e3e
  jmp ax    ;eg goto 0x3e3e. Preloader puts the emulation
            ; code for mvi a,dd followed by another copy
            ; of the inner interpreter at cs:0x3e3e.
</code></pre>
This approach uses 64K to sparsely store the emulation code for each of the 256 opcodes at 0x0000,0x0101,0x0202 ... etc. which seemed a pretty outrageous waste of memory at the time. But it was worth it because none of the 3 inner interpreter instructions modified the flags, which meant I could use the native 8086 flags to directly emulate the 8080 flags, a huge speed win. Remember that the 8086 had LAHF and SAHF instructions to help solve this very problem, yet my approach avoiding the whole flags issue was still twice as quick as commercial equivalents.<p>Okay admittedly this is all irrelevant dinosaur nostalgia from the perspective of modern technology, but it reinforces the point that there's no substitute for human creativity when it comes to real hardcore optimization tricks.",1306455283

And while I am inclined to give Mr. Shapiro the benefit of my doubts, believing that he likely has several cards secretly tucked up his sleeves, the argument that every great brand needs an alternative brand has never really been a great way to grow a product or service.  In fact I often use the Coke/Pepsi argument as exactly the opposite argument.  Relying only on brand differentiation as Pepsi has tried, will always result in massive marketing / advertising costs, and little product or service differentiation.  Instead of being a Pepsi to Coke, I believe that new products or services need to create a new consumer opportunity instead of simply a new package.  So instead of thinking about Coke v. Pepsi, Mr. Shapiro would do well to aspire to be either Red Bull, or Snapple, or Odwalla, or any number of successful market changing adventures.
