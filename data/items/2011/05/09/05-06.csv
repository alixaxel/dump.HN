See:<p><a href=""http://ycharts.com/companies/MSFT/revenues_ttm#zoom=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycharts.com/companies/MSFT/revenues_ttm#zoom=5</a><p>MS revenue has continued to climb to this very day, with only a drop during the recession.  Outside of Apple, there aren't many companies that wouldn't take this type of revenue growth at this size.<p>The article makes a mistake a lot in the tech sector make which is that if MS isn't doing better than Apple then its in serious trouble.  Doing worse than Apple is hardly an insult.  There are probably no more than a couple of companies in the world that are doing better than Apple.  Yet, there are few F500 companies that can match MS's revenue/profit growth -- yet almost all can beat its market cap growth.",1304920747

All the countries you mention that have high GDP per capita and high GDP growth have high economic freedom scores.<p>Trying to argue against freer trade for economic growth is like trying to argue with someone who says the Earth isn't round. China, India, Poland, Russia, etc., etc., grew their economies rapidly by moving to privatization and eliminating barriers to trade. Economists across the aisle support free trade; for example, read Paul Krugman's views on free trade in his Wikipedia entry (or research Goolsbee's, Geithnner's, Stglitz's, DeLong's, Sach's, Summers', etc, etc, etc, -- not to mention the plethora of economists' from across the other aisle -- views on free trade's effects on economic growth).
