[2] demolishes your argument -- look at the horizontal spread in the developed countries.  These indicators are hard to measure, too; for an alternate measure, look at [3]: examine the vertical distance between Portugal and Australia.  Or, if you prefer, in the middle of the graph between Ja/UK and Ireland.  Or on the right side between NZ and the US.  It's safe to say that economic freedom doesn't correlate all that well with GDP, not to mention that correlation neq causation.<p>Not to mention for every Singapore there's an Ireland to match.<p>[1] <a href=""http://filipspagnoli.wordpress.com/stats-on-human-rights/statistics-on-gross-domestic-product-correlations/#4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://filipspagnoli.wordpress.com/stats-on-human-rights/sta...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://filipspagnoli.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/economic-freedom-and-income.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://filipspagnoli.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/economic-fr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://filipspagnoli.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/economic-freedom-and-gdp-correlation.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://filipspagnoli.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/economic-fr...</a>",1304917185

Yes, you are lucky my friend, you have landed in the lap of California’s finest public transportation system. I love it too (when I visit). Unfortunately its impact is small when you’re talking about the state of California and therefore cannot give it state-level credit (everywhere else in California public transportation sucks like NC).",1304917165

The more you get out, the more places you go, the more people you'll meet and network with, you'll eventually find someone who completes you and you complete them.<p>Find someone who solves your problems and you solve theirs, your personalities match up and that's your partner.

2527604,comment,2526622,2527396,3,0,dmfdmf,,,"There are two fundamental epistemological issues with respect to reason. i) how do we form concepts and what (in reality) do they refer to and ii) how do we reason from specific observations to general conclusions and validate our conclusions (i.e. not deduction but induction).<p>Both of these problems were known (and unsolved) by the Greeks.  Ayn Rand (in my judgment) solved the first problem, the problem of universals. How do we form concepts (classes) and how are they connected to the actual things subsumed by the concept.  Her answer was that concepts are formed on the principle of measurement omission, which means the objects that form a class posses some trait(s) which is present but unspecified. This is what she called the ""some but any"" principle. She said this is the same principle behind algebra in that a variable ""x"" represents <i>some</i> quantity but may have <i>any</i> quantity but remains unspecified.<p>She explains all of it in her ""Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology""<p>As far as induction, she never tackled that but she did say that she thought the basic principles of induction are probably buried in higher (calculus or above) mathematics. She was being tutored in mathematics at the time of her death, hunting for the principle of induction. In my view the principles of induction can be found in the work of E.T. Jaynes on (Bayesian) probabililty theory and the logic of science.<p>My own view is that AI is stuck because we don't yet have the basic principles of how reason works, so we can't program a computer to do it.<p>N.B. Most people know of Ayn Rand because of her advocacy of selfishness in ethics and capitalism in politics and economics. What they don't realize is that her views in these higher level branches follow from her deep thinking in the more fundamental levels of epistemology and metaphysics.",1304916734

However, if i wanted to slowly hack away at some code while watching TV in the lounge with my partner or do some coding while at my parents place, I was out of luck.<p>To solve this problem I bought a AMD C-50 equipped Acer Aspire 522 the day they were available here. Despite having only a 10.2"" screen and a ""netbook"" processor, I find it does everything I want to do with a portable computer. The battery life, size and weight give me great portability (+1 for couch-hacking). The dual-core APU never locks up or stutters, even when playing 1080p video via the HDMI port. The DX11 capable graphics even play WoW and Minecraft great at native resolution (1280x720), and allows me to hack around with OpenCL GPGPU programming from my couch. NOTE: I upgraded the memory to 4GB, i would recommend an upgrade to at least 2GB for anyone who has/is getting this laptop.<p>I definitely think switching to a lighter form factor with more portability has allowed me to get more done because I can literally have this machine with me at all times. That said, I waited for this laptop specifically because it was portable, cheap, and had a decent screen resolution. If i were recommending a laptop for someone, I would probably reccomend something in the 12-14"" range, unless they're going to have a desktop to do the grunt work, as I do.",1304916483
