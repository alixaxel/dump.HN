This is true, writing long responses on the iPhone is a pain because of the keyboard (which your app doesn't seem to solve) and because the iPhone text editor doesnt put scrollbars.

For example, some people reply to a comment of a comment with a new root comment, and that new comment doesn't make sense until you read the other tree.<p>I don't mean to be a negative Nancy it's always important to ask about the value add to the potential customers.

The Windows OS thrives because of native software, and most of the native software works only on Windows. So from their point of view, it's not a very good idea to help push the web forward to make (web) apps cross-platform.<p>The reason why they might've changed their mind a bit lately, is because they also have cloud offerings now, and they'd rather have enterprise (mostly) customers continue to use IE instead of moving to a competitor's browser.<p>But it seems they still don't really want to go fully cross-platform. This is not obvious yet, but I think we'll see it with IE10, where they want to tie the hardware acceleration to the Windows OS. That's why they've started marketing the idea of ""native HTML5"" lately, which basically means HTML5 that is hardware accelerated through DirectX, which of course works only on Windows.
