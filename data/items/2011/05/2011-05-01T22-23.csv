2504285,comment,2503967,2504131,4,0,jwatzman,,,"Exactly -- this is an important point Harper misses here. In SML, you can have functions of type ""unit -> unit"" and have no idea what the heck it is doing. The language allows effects, and so it could be doing <i>anything</i>. Even a function ""int -> int"" or whatever could be doing nasty effects behind the scenes. You just can't tell. (Style dictates that non-benign effects in the last case are to be fiercely avoided, but the former case comes up a lot.)<p>In Haskell, all the effects are encoded into the type. You might have 200 different monad transformers -- maybe monad, list monad, state monad, etc etc all layered on top of each other -- but the information is there if you want to decode what the type means. Effects can sneak in with unsafePerformIO, but this is also considered terrible style. The huge types you can get from all the monads and monad transformers can certainly be a problem, but there's a tradeoff to be considered here that Harper just dismisses.",1304290056

A basic problem with education is that the technology has stagnated. The public school classroom has not changed much in 50 years. Teachers still have live lectures during class, kids still do homework at home. Each teacher's class size is the same as the other teachers' in the school. There's no innovation aimed at dramatically reducing costs and raising outcomes.<p>The cause for this stagnation is obvious: the education industry is controlled by people who have a strong interest in keeping the education process inefficient and labor intensive. When was the last time you heard a teachers' union or a department of education support a technology that promised to reduce the cost of education and the number of teachers? Instead, the public education industry is focused on making education more inefficient: requiring teacher certification, reducing class sizes, increasing funding, etc.<p>The most promising recent developments in education have come from outside the establishment. Wikipedia makes it possible to get a fairly good understanding of any subject quickly and for free. Khan Academy features thousands of ten-minute long micro-lectures covering most of the math and science taught in schools through high school along with software to test mastery and help students tutor each other.

The pool of high-quality new teaching candidates seems limited (and quite possibly shrinking);  current compensation levels for teachers, relative to other job opportunities, is almost certainly a contributing factor.<p>Your argument is effectively responding to the idea that ""we don't find that pay package attractive enough to make us want to be teachers"" by saying ""but you're using the wrong word- you should look at compensation."" Okay, then ""we don't find that compensation package attractive enough.""<p>I certainly don't think that just paying teachers more is going to fix anything. But the vilification of the profession, which the article laments and you effectively condone, is in my opinion a big distraction.

Some rules should be more lax (I once spent twenty minutes having to explain why I was in the hallway after the bell rang in order to avoid detention [the answer was that my locker was on the other side of the building from my classroom]), but most systems are too lax. We try to keep students around who have no interest in learning because it ""keeps them off the streets."" This has two results. First, even if they make it to the end, they probably wind up on the streets anyway. Secondly, they drag down those who do want to learn or would be willing to learn such that their chances of excelling are minimized. We should have more remedial job training (not sure how well this would work, but other analogous programs such as rehab over jail have proven quite successful) and stricter rules about whether students can stay in school or not. These shouldn't be performance based per se, so much as based on a student's effort to complete assignments, pay attention in class, etc. We consequently end up paying a lot of money for people who don't learn anything and bring down those who could. We'd also have to pay for the job training, but it's shorter curriculum would serve to save money and probably increase their chances of gainful employment.
