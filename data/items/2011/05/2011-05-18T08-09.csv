That's real money that could be used to earn more money somewhere else.<p>On the other hand the 2000$ bike is perhaps so much nicer that you ride it more often and have more fun doing it. It might last longer as well lowering the fun factor even more.<p>> With things like digital cameras (or any consumer electronics), it's silly to expect anything to last more than 10 years, on the very long end.<p>I think that's an unreasonable assumption. I had a Kyocera camera (designed in 1999) but even though I would call myself frugal (some people would call me cheap) and I didn't have much money I basically had to replace it around 2006 because of technology progress and lack of batteries, replacement parts.",1305709133

2559550,comment,2559355,2559357,6,0,pieter,,,"You're right, but Intel is working on it.. One major problem so far is that Intel didn't have ANY SoC's, and no-one wants to ship a 5W chipset next to the processor on their tablet. Their future SoC's might change that, but it's still unclear how much demand there is for their chips.<p>The big difference with Intel's approach and ARM's approach: with ARM you can license the core and build your own SoC, which means there are many different SoC's to choose from for handset manufacturers. Being limited to just the chips Intel chooses to produce won't be very attractive, especially as you loose a very nice way of product differentiation. I wonder how handset manufacturers will work with that.<p>If there's going to be competition between ARM and Intel on this scale, they'll probably both have their own pro's: ARM is very customizable, up to the point where you can choose your own FPU next to all the other stuff you put on an SoC. Intel might have the advantage of power consumption and speed if they get their act together, and will be able to use smaller manufacturing processes earlier (11nm), but you'll have to use Intel's SoC, which so far don't exist, are unproven and probably will never offer the freedom ARM SoC's have.",1305709070

I then had two telephone interviews, after which I received an email asking me to choose two interests from a list of about two dozen (which was <i>not</i> an easy task!).

Myself, I was in the pool for <i>two and a half months</i>, and had pretty much given up on getting anything when I suddenly heard back that I had a place.<p>So, it might be different for ""real"" jobs with them, but in the case of my internship they did exactly a skill-set matching (in a way), and there was no ""job cart"".",1305709019

A never ending cycle of buy cheap/replace broken cheap stuff.<p>>For example, I use to drive sports cars and convertibles, but now I drive cheap econo-boxes. Why? They tend to be more reliable, less expensive per mile to maintain,<p>The point of buying quality is that it is cheaper to use and maintain.  I think you're doing an apple/orange comparison here.  Your sports cars were probably on the low end (and the quality end is probably just not attainable by working class people) while your ""cheap econo-boxes"" are probably higher on the quality scale for their class.  You weren't being cheap here.<p>I know plenty of people who do go cheap with cars: they buy old used cars so they can do the repairs themselves.  And every weekend that's exactly what they're doing: repairs.  If they ever stopped and counted up their costs in time, parts and eventually replacing with another clunker they could probably lease a BMW cheaper.",1305708619

Another good way of looking at it is that managing your spending should be like managing any other finite resource, like time.<p>No one really thinks it makes sense to save your time by not spending time on anything at all.

Sure, buy quality items if you can afford them, they'll often be worth the investment - but choosing to be frugal because of difficult financial circumstances is <i>a good thing</i>.<p>Most people don't need half of what they buy.<p>As for 'being fugal makes you a loser'; I think if the choice is being seen as a loser by the author of the article, and being broke and / or in debt - I'd definitely choose the former.<p>I'd possibly understand if this kind of rationalisation came from a government wanting its citizens to spend their way out of recession.  Coming from a free thinking individual, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",1305705628
