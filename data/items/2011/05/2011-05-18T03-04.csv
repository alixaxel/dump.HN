2558995,comment,2558270,2558654,2,0,jtheory,,,"Well... many of the problems people are listing seem to apply to other door styles as well (like a minivan's big sliding door, or a two-door car), and actually aren't noticeable problems there.<p>It's a bit too easy to get caught up in shooting down ideas, I think.<p>Here's a shot at spinning it positively:<p>- if you have kids in the back, no need to worry they're going to open their own door while you're doing 75 on the highway (sure, there are child safety locks... are you sure the little switch is where you think it is?  If you ever carry adults in the back, or once your kids notice there's an interesting little switch there, it probably isn't)<p>- tight parking spaces; you (or your child) will never ding another car again while opening a door!  I'm also frequently in super-narrow parking garage spaces, where it can take some creative gymnastics to squeeze through  the door, particularly because I have to get a baby from a rear-facing carseat in the back of a 2-door hatchback  That highlight in the video looked pretty appealing to me -- this is a frequent annoyance.  I also have a nice little dent on my own door (the only dent on the car...) where someone banged my door with theirs in a parking lot, and left without leaving a note.  These are pretty common use cases.<p>- Raining?  Zing open the big door (and pop open a big umbrella or two) and let everyone get out at the same time, quickly and easily, helping each other without dodging around four large wet pieces of metal jutting out of the side of the car -- you can even hop out of the back seat to help your grandma out of the front without a big, wet, dirty door in between you.<p>I'm not sure I want these doors -- to be sure, there'd be a price premium, and there may be other downsides I haven't seen yet -- but I'd consider it, with or without a map pocket (er, they could have one with a closing lid, I suppose).",1305690905

Their social restrictions really are nuanced! They allow a lot of freedom to the rich/intelligentsia of appropriate ethnic groups and restrict the ""restive"" segments of their population.

2558974,story,,,8,3,johnwood,"Ask HN: Another Equity Question",,"Hi HN, I would greatly appreciate your advice regarding my situation.<p>Sometime back, I was offered 7.5% starting equity going up to 10% (beta go-live) by a start-up.  The start-up consisted of one Business and one Technical guy who were working on the idea part-time for a few months before they contacted me.  An equity only offer was made to me and it involved no salary.  The plan was for the three of us to continue to keep our day jobs and continue building the site part-time.  Before the offer, I was shown mockups of the proposed site and informed that the back-end was already done, and that I was to build the front-end for the site.  I accepted the offer based on two considerations: a) Based on my estimation of the effort to realize the mockups shown, b) Based on the back-end of the site already being done (I was expected to do a simple presentation layer that needed to be added on top of it to access the functionality).<p>However, over the next 5 months, the mockups that I was shown were changed substantially and the effort that I had initially estimated increased by a factor of 3 (or more).  Additionally, almost all of the back-end of the system which was supposedly done, now completely needed to be reworked.<p>At the time of the offer I had inquired as to what the equity break-up was and had not received a clear answer.  But, the project sounded exciting, the two guys looked strong in terms of the value they added to the company, the back-end of the system seemed to have already been built and the 7.5% to 10% equity sounded reasonable for the effort.  However, with how things progressed over the next 5 months, I started questioning if the equity break-up was really fair.<p>I let them know my concerns and also tried determining what the current equity break-up of the company was (how much between the two guys, how much set aside for investors, option pool etc).  The reason behind this question was for me to determine if I really wanted to continue in a setup where I was doing as much work as anyone else, came in at the same stage in the company as the other two guys, faced the same risks and still only got 10% while they shared 45% and 45% between them.<p>However, I was told that the equity break-up was confidential and was only something that was discussed between the ""founders"" and the ""board of directors"" and it was inappropriate for an ""employee"" to know.<p>So, I quit.  I want to learn from this experience.  Did I do the right thing?",1305690289

Patents encourage innovation by rewarding it.<p>> It is only a recent perversion of the goals of IP that they are solely intended to serve as property<p>That's simply absurd and has no basis in history.  Patent assighment is not new, and that's a fundamental characteristic of ""property"".  Moreover, US Patents have always worked by restricting what other people can do.
