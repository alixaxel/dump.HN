I've made my code fully 1.9.2 compatible.  My specs take on average 3.5 times longer to run in 1.9.2.  Profiling that shows that close to 60% of the time is spent in Kernel#require.  Now, it's pretty common for people to say only profile in the production environment, but I need to be able to run my specs.  And it's not acceptable to shell that out to a CI server or to run REE in dev. mode and deploy with 1.9.2.  Running in spork is a gross approximation, too; I've seen way too many issues there.<p>My suspicion is that if you have a small enough project, the speed difference is negligible.  If you have a large project, it becomes much more pronounced.  So, it'd really be nice for me to continue to upgrade and improve my Rails-based app without having to drag along an environment that's going to hobble me.<p>FWIW, I do know people that have started on 1.9.2 and rolled back to REE because speed was such a problem.",1305474889

If you aren't familiar with how exception handling works under the covers, I encourage you to spend some time looking into it.  It's really quite interesting and will likely impact your future design decisions in some way.  Learning about longjmp and setjmp clarified a lot of things for me.<p>Now, I could be completely off-base and 1.9.2 may be the only system out there that has managed to make exception handling a cheap operation.  But I'm highly skeptical of that.  I think the more likely scenario is exception handling is much cheaper in 1.9.2 than 1.8.7, but still not cheap enough to favor over virtually anything else.  I've not read anywhere in the linked issue or in the following comments that suggests using responds_to? was any slower than handling a NoMethodError exception.  If it is, that largely points at a failure of responds_to? more than it trumpets the speed of ruby exception handling.  And pretending that exception handling is fast enough for flow control and thus other problems needn't be fixed can land a community in serious trouble.<p>Now obviously there are exceptions to every rule.  But the default position of any programmer really should be to reserve exceptions for exceptional circumstances because they are almost axiomatically slow, regardless of language or platform.",1305474120

The ciphertext is then sent to Google over the reverse-engineered wire format.<p>Since they aren't sending actual text to Google, they don't have access to server-provided features like spellchecking or exporting, and they didn't try to handle simultaneous collaboration. However, they assert that if you share your extension's settings for a particular document, your collaborators can all get updates, they just can't type when you type. They also found they hit Google's document size limit pretty quickly, since encrypting individual characters makes the document 16x larger.<p>In exchange, they claim this gives them enough security to update documents over an insecure channel (they cite China blocking https access to Docs as a compelling example), and Google only stores an encrypted form of the document, so the contents are unrecoverable by Google.",1305472515
