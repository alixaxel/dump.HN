2549243,comment,2548467,2548467,0,0,9999,,,"""The Hotz incident was followed in February by a German police raid on the apartment of Alexander Egorenkov, another hacker who had distributed software that let PlayStation consoles run homemade games. Other technology companies have found ways to channel hackers' energy without resorting to lawsuits. Microsoft (MSFT), for instance, permits hackers to unlock its Kinect gaming device and invites some of them to its conferences. Google (GOOG) pays white-hat hackers who help identify bugs. Sony is far more uncompromising, says Robert Vamosi, a senior analyst at security firm Mocana. ""Hardware manufacturers like Sony just aren't very good about listening when a security researcher presents them with a flaw,"" Vamosi says. ""<p>That paragraph I just quoted up there is some of the sloppiest journalism I've ever seen.  The analogy being drawn is completely without merit.  Microsoft is ""hacker"" friendly because they allow people to fool around with the Kinect?  And Sony is hacker unfriendly because they removed a feature (the Linux install option) that they feared would lead to massive piracy?  And Google is just great because they offer bounties for security flaws?  In what way are any of those facts similar?  None of them are even referring to the same sort of ""hacking.""  If Google made a game system that made its money based on licensing fees from software sales, it would do everything within its power to prevent piracy.  Microsoft already does this.  Running homebrew was not what Sony was trying to stop.<p>What I'm about to say will probably be very unpopular here.  Anyway, the ""hacker"" (I hate their usage here... they should say cracker) excuse that they are just trying to enable homebrew software is utterly laughable as well.  As soon as Geohotz was successful, numerous other companies capitalized on it and went to that next (tiny, tiny, tiny) step to enable running pirated games.  Should Sony have sued Geohotz?  Probably not.  But what did Geohotz honestly think people were going to do with his developments?  Does he want people to keep making games for the PS3?  Did he honestly think that people wouldn't immediately turn around and use his progress to pirate games?  The ethics of this supposed ""hacker"" community leave a lot to be desired, and I truly wish we could return to the old usage of the term, and stop applying it to people that are really just safe crackers and thieves.<p>Our laws are completely inadequate for addressing this kind of abuse now, and I dread to see what sort of draconian measures will be put in place in response to this sort of shortsighted, unethical, and lame ""hacking.""  If you don't want a closed system, then don't buy it.  This is what will give us more open systems in the future, not enabling pirates.",1305430736

Are there any popular open source projects written in Python (or built on Django)?<p>For example, back in 2005 I setup a personal Wordpress install on a Dreamhost server (also coming from a finance background, with some prior HTML experience).

A similar project in the Python world would be a great introduction, but at a cursory glance, Django seems a little too low level.

If there isn't, it will just drop off.

Claims that more expensive cables put forth greater video or audio fidelity are nonsense;""<p>directly contradict this at the end?<p>""No one saw any appreciable difference between the $3 cables and the $120 cable, or any of the cables in between. However, we did notice a curious phenomenon: the screen appeared slightly darker and a bit more saturated when connected to the Blu-ray player with the Monster Cable 1200 High Definition Experience Pack cable. The HDTV showed that it was receiving the same 12-bit color depth information through each cable, so the more-expensive Monster cable wasn't pushing through more color detail. Again, the difference was minimal, and could be corrected by calibrating your HDTV.""<p>The contradiction there immediately makes me assume all of their testing methodology is bogus and any other ""facts"" they introduce in support of whatever argument they're trying to make are probably suspect...<p>I know they're right, and multi hundred dollar Monster Cables are snake-oil, but I'm also left with the distinct impression that anybody who finds the Monster Cable's transmission of a digital video signal ""curiously darker and more saturated"" has shown themselves to be incapable of convincing anyone that they know enough about what they're doing to change anybodies opinion.

But most of these courses require you to buy the appropriate textbook which, while cheaper than tuition, isn't exactly a low barrier to entry. You really can't can't replace a college course with an audiobook. You need problem sets and reference materials, too. If there's a programming assignment sometimes tools and sample code are provided in the lab environment, but the open course version typically just puts up a scan of the handout. There are exceptions, but complete online courses is certainly not the rule in my experience.<p>Khan Academy has a nice web app that auto generates solvable problems for various subjects. But even those kind of lack the quality of regular problem sets. For most of the subjects I tried you just get the same problem over and over again with different constants until you switch subjects.<p>Basically it's nice that all these universities are making lectures available. But open textbooks and problem sets are really what's needed next in my opinion.<p>Also, it would be nice if there was a Wikipedia of course material where editors could construct a course out of the best pieces from all of these university sites. Especially considering so many are piecemeal as is.",1305428728
