He is saying if you have 1024 woker_connections, at 2 per connections per user, you'll get 512 users per worker process.  But the truth with most modern browsers is it is 4 connections per user, woker_connections = 1024, that is more like 256 users.  So if you really want to service 512 users, you need to set woker_connections to 2048.

It's just that again, some framework did reinvent the wheel where they should have been using what already works (or help on it).<p>> That's why there's Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI exists<p>you are just telling me that there is yet an other way of doing the same thing but in the PSGI environment.<p>All in all, I still don't see what the PSGI spec/protocol and the modules that evolute around bring to the environment. \nI don't see why we should have a superset of CGI,which is a language agnostic protocol,that binds with Perl via PSGI.\nReally don't get the idea...Is this binding between Perl and the protocol lead to way much better performance?(better than FastCGI?)<p>I've never used mod_perl as it is only useful for Apache but\nI knew that using FastCGI could open me many servers and better performance without having to change much and care about even the language.<p>I guess my environment is too far from the \nproblems you seem to encounter and fix.<p>They are new things where I think, yes, this is going to be good but here, the ""pintokita"" moment does not arrive at all.<p>I can only hope that DotCloud will offer a simple support for fastCGI (CGI::Fast) with Nginx.<p>By the way, adding some script examples for CGI::PSGI and other related modules would be much appreciated (The doc is too elliptic and assume we know already that much about the PSGI context and Plack system)<p>Thank you for your time and efforts anyhow!",1304236293

If you ask them ""what fascinates you about american idol?"", the answer you're most likely to hear is ""wtf, what do you mean?"".

I personally think it's fantastic.<p>The thing is, I actually take offense to people who call a language ugly. Just because it doesn't prioritize the kind of expressiveness you desire doesn't mean whining about it makes you cool or a better programmer. What everyone here who says 'Objective-C is ugly and outdated' should be decrying is the relative lack of choice of implementation language for iOS.<p>I like Objective-C, because I look at it from the point of view of C. It's a systems language with support for OOP that  I find completely satisfactory, which prioritizes flexibility, predictability, and maintainability over raw speed and constraints. On the other hand, I love that Java and similar languages in its family can reason a great deal about classes and their interactions, and I love that Python and Ruby step out of the programmer's way when you just want to make something --<p>-- But to write software for an embedded platform that can be natively fast when needed (the C part of ObjC), but offer a solid OOP abstraction, and to reconcile these two needs as well as expose some of the lower-level workings of the OOP system to the developer when they really know what they're doing and need it? I think Objective-C is hard to beat there. It's a language fitting for projects from small-medium size to very large. It's not the only language that I feel can scale like this, but again; that's a problem (availability of alternatives), not a reflection on Objective-C's language. The language combines the low-level with the high-level, and is many things for many needs, yet is without the rigidity of a Java-style type system, yet is also without the inability or difficulty to deeply reason about high-level language structures as in some more dynamic languages, Objective-C manages to allow sufficient and sloppy ""it just works"" implementations, for when you just need to bang out code that works well enough, as well as encourages polished and well-engineered APIs (such as Cocoa's).<p>I think Objective-C balances these concerns - small or big, dynamic or inflexible, as well as the reality of mobile devices' limited memory capacity, particularly well. I would make a more cogent argument were I more awake and if I did not have a splitting headache, but I think it's extremely unfair to call (or imply it) Objective-C strange, or that it survives merely because Cocoa would not be supported if another language were to replace it. Although I may be in the minority (at least amongst those who are posting here in this thread), I think it is a fantastic language.",1304236108

2502583,comment,2500859,2502048,3,0,kragen,,,"Scheme operations are mostly early-bound, even more so than Common Lisp; you standardly use vector-ref or string-ref, for example, instead of nth. (There are Schemes where this is not true, such as RScheme, but Racket is not among them.) Vectors aren't resizable; for that kind of thing, you must use lists. You can't attach arbitrary properties to some arbitrary object, the way you can in JS or Ruby. You can't introduce new variable bindings in the middle of a block. (What you do instead is make a new nested block.) Finite maps (assoc, make-hash-table) are second-class citizens. Standard Scheme is nonreflective; you're supposed to do your metaprogramming with macros, not reflection and interposition.  (I don't know how much reflection Racket supports, but I'd guess almost none.)  The object-literal syntax is quasiquote, which is clumsy.<p>It does have dynamic typing, but that's not what it means to be a ""dynamic language"".  Dynamic languages are late-bound; everything is up for grabs at runtime.  In standard Scheme, this is true in the fairly useless sense that everything depends on the bindings in the global namespace, so you could in theory (set! car somethingweird), but this is very rarely practical; it almost serves only to make optimizing Scheme compilers difficult to write.  Aside from that, the language leans much further toward early binding, doing things at compile-time, and using efficient data structures at the cost of flexibility.",1304234280

On general hack nights the club will provide the food and caffeine as long as people are working on something. On themed hack nights everything we make will involve a certain theme. Also, if there's a student or professor who wants to show how to do something like knitting or creating a web page we'll provide them with the supplies they need, take care of the paperwork, and promote it. All they'll need to do is show up.<p>That's one of a few things I have planned for next year, and I'm going to be planning more over the summer.",1304234266
