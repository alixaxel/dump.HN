Built on different philosophy, so the workflow is slightly different, however in some areas (what to backup, what to sync and how) has more flexibility.<p>One missing feature is syncing directories with others. Probably the architecture that gives the security makes this a difficult task.<p>To compensate for that, there's a pretty good feature of web-share. Can share anything you backed up, with a separate password that you can revoke any time.<p>So in the end: I keep Dropbox but removed most of my files from there, started with SpiderOak, and playing with AeroFS (similar functionality on peer-to-peer architecture).",1305341806

Yours ideals will be silenced, tactics will be defeated, and openly publishing that you do not wish to conform to the drug laws of America, that includes all drugs not just simple cannibis legalization, you will be signing a social death warrant for yourself and family. People who do not put on the FAKE, politically correct ""face"" of our capitalistic society will be dealt with and discriminated (avoided) from ""normal"" Americans and their ideals required for survival. The farthest you can possibly get is to the position that ron paul is in right now, the political black sheep who votes comprise of stoner college students and ignorant druggies, or zealous liberals. Our government knows the majority of Americans want to end the war on drugs, legalize cannibis, and end this losing battle of attrition. They have seen the polls, statistics, opinions, letters from johnny from Columbus Ohio, and they DO NOT CARE. If you think this country is going to risk economical downfalls, inflation of the American dollar, admit wrongdoings not only to its people, but to the multiple countries that follow out ideals of drugs willingly, or more commonly through force, you are living in a ""dream world."" This country will not legalize drugs that will eventually convince drug users to turn their back on capitalism, because materialism, competitiveness, and politically correct ideals of America do not matter to them anymore because they rather get high. It is a beautiful pipe dream that our country unethically, in a myriad of immoral ways, rips away from our freedom, along with so many other supposed freedom's Americans use to have ( and i guess don't matter anymore because they were written hundreds of years ago), so politicians can get votes, smear ideals of a race, and many other reasons.

The phrase ""I write codes"" (as in, ""I write programming codes for a living)"" is definitely okay/correct, IMO (for the reason given in my previous comment above) - though no experienced programmer with a good command of English would use it in normal conversation, because it's not colloquial. I was referring more to a situation like if he/she is talking to a layman and happens to use such a phrase, to describe his/her work. Remember, I said ""strictly speaking"" - and strictly speaking (in other words, pedantically), I don't think there is anything wrong with that statement.<p>But overall, I get your point. For a similar yet contrasting example, consider this real statement of an ex-boss of mine: ""I can tell you what code to write, but I can't write _a code_!"" which was both BS and grammatically wrong, of course :-) He did not stay my boss for long ...",1305339311

Macros were never meant to 'offer guidance for improving your semantics' however they are the mechanism that makes it possible to create your own new semantics (which is just not possible in any other family of languages). The semantics that you want to create are often specific to the domain you may be working in. Learn from those who have mastered the domain and created their own semantics and then come up with your own.<p>2. It's clear that you've been drinking the OO koolaid for a while. Let it go and try really learning macros. Leave the baggage at the door, it's just not required where you can go with macros.<p>3. Ruby is a badly diluted hack that borrowed some ideas from Lisp and other languages. No you cannot accomplish in Ruby what is possible with Lisp macros. For a start all the Ruby mechanisms that you suggest execute at runtime. Ruby does not have direct access to it's AST the way that Lisp does. Lisp and Ruby are not even in the same class of languages. Contrast Ruby with Java, and then yes it looks great.<p>If your talking about the ""hundred-year language"" then just forget Haskell. Lisp is the future, go and learn Qi. Qi has a turing complete type system, this is already light-years beyond what Haskell's type system will ever have.",1305338923

What if one file just happens to have the same hash as another completely different file uploaded by a different person? Then all of a sudden, this really important contract that you think you have stored online and in the dropbox folders of your four different computers gets automatically deleted and replaced with a completely different file everywhere. And if you have set up automatic backups like a good boy, it may even be automatically replaced in all your backups before you figure out the problem.<p>I know you will say that the hashes are long enough so this should not happen until dropbox has trillions of files, etc. But those calculations are all based on assumption of random data in the files. We all know that various computer files may have structured and patterned data. It is possible for the data in certain types of files to be structured in such a way as to produce a much narrower range of possible hashes than generally assumed.<p>And with 25 million users and hundreds of millions of files, God knows what may happen.",1305338873

However, it can also be a bit of an escape mechanism, making it a pyrrhic victory.<p>In code if something is wrong or not working right you know it can be fixed. Sometimes the fix is not easy, and requires lots of work, and research, and testing but after nearly ten years of coding experience I know that if something is wrong I can fix it. There is no problem in code which can't be solved. (Obviously excluding some things like the traveling salesman problem, etc.)<p>Real life isn't like that, because many factors are out of your control. You can not debug a relationship, or undo a mistake like you can roll back a code update.<p>At times I find myself retreating to the dependable, stable world of coding, in which changes can be implemented easily and quickly, and where mistakes are easily discovered and corrected.
