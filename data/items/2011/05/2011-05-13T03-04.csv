2543495,comment,2542242,2543159,2,0,corysama,,,"Once you get the data and the shaders over to the GPU, its going to draw at pretty much full speed.  That said, penalties for running on the web include:<p>Even a well-written JS app on a great JIT is going to have trouble keeping up with an equivalently well-written native app that has access to SIMD, cache-aware memory layouts, prefetching and other native features.  My CPU can do 200 million matrix x vector multiplies per second using SSE3.  In Firefox4 JS it can do 20 million.  Impressive, but not equivalent.<p>On Windows, you are probably running GL on top of a D3D translation layer.  That adds overhead to an API that you sometimes want to call into 60,000+ times per second.  The GLSL to HLSL shader translation step is a big pain during load times.  I'm not sure how much of a run-time penalty it causes.<p>Web GLSL is somewhere between HLSL Shader Model 2 and 3 from 2003.  The latest desktop GPUs run Shader Model 5 which has many sophisticated features and performance opportunities.  However, many of those are a bit too sophisticated for casual 3D programmers.  Hopefully WebOpenCL will come eventually and shrink that feature gap.",1305259190

The desktop OS ecosystem lock-in that Microsoft enjoyed for so long is definitely on its way out.  It will take a long time, since every big company painted itself into a corner with vendor lock-in solutions like Windows, Blackberry, SAP, Oracle, etc, and there are a LOT of people whose job is entirely devoted to maintaining that lock-in.  I think we're looking forward to a bloodbath in Enterprise IT in the coming years.  I see it every day in my job: big companies are serious about getting off the desktop right now.<p>If you're in enterprise IT and you disagree with me, remember this: unless you're the CIO, you'll be the last to know.",1305257029

A lot of work is off-loaded on GPU's now days, and theoretically there should be no reason why talking to the video-card through a browser should be slower than talking to it through a portable executable (.exe). The reality of it is that there is far more sandboxing and verification that needs to be done since no one likes having their browser crashed out of the blue. As for performance of languages (JavaScript vs C or x86), naturally, you will always get more performance the closer to the iron you are but it's getting fairly blurred and compilers/interpreters are pretty damn smart these days.<p>I realize I'm not answering your question entirely, but what I read between the lines is you're wondering whether WebGL will be able to replace ""native"" applications, performance-wise in the future.
