At the peak on the first day is was up more than that (~80% IIRC).<p>Microsoft did no different to LinkedIn, Gates actually wanted to price the stock lower to assure that a liquid market would be created. They re-priced the listing late in the process, just like LinkedIn did.<p>Most of the Microsoft negotiation with Goldman was about commission charges.<p>This was all the same thing, both hot stocks who could dictate a lot of their own terms. The only difference is that we got a good insight into the Microsoft process via that Fortune article and the only insight we got into LinkedIn were press releases (most announcing another tilt up in the price)<p>See my last comment about how list pricing works and why nobody got 'ripped off':<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2571248"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2571248</a>",1306036781

For example, way back in the mid-90's when Compuserve was king I ran (for about a year) a paid online magazine for Science Fiction (""Radius"" in case you ever ran across it). Because it was online (Win HLP files and in later issues this new fangled HTML stuff), folks heard about it fairly quickly. Because it actually paid a professional rate (3 cents a word, good luck getting even THAT now), I was quickly innundated. So much so that after a year I gave it up just as it was starting to break even. Why? Because I had gone through so much DRECK that I couldn't even read the good stuff anymore without noticing the problems I got from even writers who had been in Asimov's and Analog. It would take almost three years before I could convince myself to read a page of SF again.<p>Bringing this back around to my ""point"", I find it interesting that you don't have a ""Quora"" or ""Earbits"" of online fiction, let alone Science Fiction anywhere. I wonder if that's because there are more people who listen to music than who read... or some other problem? Or maybe it's just that my experience still is the average one, and because you need talent to pick up a guitar and get out even a chord, and not so much to write, perhaps there's just so MUCH noise versus signal in writing that you can't curate it successfully (short of being a traditional publisher, and we all know how well they are doing these days).",1306034859

I think the fundamental problem is that of generalization. Someone may intuitively understand how to do a specific task themselves, but how do you take that idea and make it generic enough to be useful?<p>Programming is communication about how to solve a problem. So lets skip the whole computer language implementation detail. Dont start with computers. Start with problem solving. Make the implementation language a list of steps to be performed. Split off people into pairs  have them write down descriptions of how to solve some problem, and then have their partner act it out. You get to talk through parse/compiler errors instead of having to translate something that only really makes sense when youve seen it a couple hundred times.<p>Once people are comfortable with taking a problem and producing steps to solve it, picking up a syntax to say the things theyre already comfortable talking about seems like a much smaller step.<p>Long term, weve got to start doing this earlier. Grade school. Hell, preschool. Why should analytic problem solving be something youve got to wait to learn?<p>-----<p>Other thoughts while I'm here:<p>We need to get over the math obsession. Yes, it's important. Yes, deep computer science has lots of math. But you don't teach someone to love music by first trying to get them to understand music theory. Let's cut out the parts that aren't essential. Let's take a lesson from unit testing culture - start with the smallest thing that will work. Big O isn't one of those things. Once people can come up with simple algorithms on their own (remember how great those first little wins felt?), it's a great opportunity to lead into complexity theory. But if you do it too early you'll just scare them off.<p>Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think everyone has the ability to learn basic programming and the analytic skills that go with it.

A work specially ordered or commissioned (check!) for us as a contribution to a collective work (nope!), as a part of a motion picture (nope!) or other audiovisual work (nope!)[2], as a supplementary work (nope!)[3], as a compilation (nope!), as an instructional text (nope!), as a test (nope!), or as an atlas (nope!), if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.<p>Case 2 does not apply because first a tattoo doesn't seem to fall into any of the categories that can be a work for hire. Even if it did, there would have to be an EXPRESS agreement that it is a work for hire, and that has to be executed as a SIGNED and WRITTEN instrument.<p>[1] The determination of whether the hired party is an employee is determined by the common law of agency. Factors involved in this are who controls the manner and means by which the work is accomplished, who supplies equipment and tools, where the work is done, the duration of the relationship, whether the hiring party can assign addition work to the hired party, who hires assistants for the hired party, and things like that. Unless the relation between Tyson on the artist was very atypical of the relationship between tattoo artist and customer, the artist was not an employee according to the common law of agency.<p>[2] An ""audiovisual work"" is a work that consists of a series of related images which are intended to be shown by the use of machines or devices, such as projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds (if any). Since a tattoo is a single image, not a series of related images, it is not an audiovisual work.<p>[3] A supplementary work is a work that is created and relates to an existing work.

2572508,comment,2570609,2572462,5,0,cwzwarich,,,"> One thing that was a little annoying was their discussion about purpose of undefined behavior. That is, I don't believe ""undefined behavior"" in the C Language exists for speed as such. Rather, undefined behavior is machine-specific behavior and it exists in C so the programmer can write machine specific code, the C Language being a ""high-level assembly language"" or ""system-programmer's Swiss army knife"". Speed is one outcome, certainly but there are other ways to get speed (a Just In Time Compile can come at least close naive c code). The point isn't speed. The point is ""do anything"", the point is that a chip designer can write c code and look on his screen to see the resulting assembler and decide where to go from there.<p>If this were really the case, then they would have made the behavior implementation-defined rather than undefined.<p>A lot of the choices of undefined behavior seem like they were made due to the laziness of implementors, especially the purely syntactic ones, e.g. token pasting creating multiple tokens or unmatched quotes. It is pretty crazy that a C compiler is allowed to do anything if you miss a closing quotation.",1306034238
