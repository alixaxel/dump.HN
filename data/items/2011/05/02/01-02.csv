It could be an interesting approach to have an alternative additional interface that makes browsing the sample code (maybe with annotations?) front and centre, with a focus on programming techniques as a major differentiator, with scores as an adjunct. At present the visitor is encouraged to start from benchmark scores (either for everything, for a problem, or for a language) and from there move to source code later, but there might be a way to frame it as ""let me flip through solutions to problems like X and tag the ones I like the look of, then let's see how they performed""<p>It's a pretty vague idea, and I don't have much of a handle on how it'd work from a UI perspective, but its seems like it might head off some of the kneejerk responses you get from kneejerkers like me ;), plus it could help encourage some of the uses you're describing in your post.",1304300154

If not, I don't see your point.</i><p>The point is purely practical, not so much legal. When employees are on salary, it's worth doing whatever you can to make it convenient for them to stick around and stay longer. Providing perks such as free food helps with that - it helps get more work hours out of people for a given salary. The perks are in some way a <i>substitute</i> for extra salary, and likely to save the company money in the long run. Especially perks that save employees time, like letting them start work on the bus during their commute or letting them have meals right on campus so they don't lose time driving elsewhere.<p>Whereas hourly employees get paid for each specific hour they work so there's little benefit to encouraging them to stick around longer than they would otherwise be inclined.
