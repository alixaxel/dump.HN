2527890,comment,2527746,2527746,10,0,iwwr,,,"<i>Believing in the gold standard is disbelieving in capitalism</i><p>This betrays a deep ignorance of capitalism. It's not about ""making money"", but rather about exchange. The two parties in an exchange both expect (and usually gain) greater value afterwards.<p>Capitalism means ""private ownership of the means of production"", where the ""means of production"" are the capital goods. Money or ""financial capital"" is just one possible facet of capital.<p>Strictly speaking, there is no money creation out of economic activity, outside either: gold mining (when you have a gold standard) or monetary expansion via the fractional reserve mechanism. What is made is: goods, services and capital for future investment. People eventually want goods & services rather than money itself. And even those who seek money as an end in itself are in fact trading valuable services for pieces of paper (or whatever form money has in that instance).<p>Now, as for the argument that bitcoins are ""pointless busywork that produces nothing of real value"" the value comes from having a robust and forgery-secure digital <i>token</i>. Whether it's good enough to be used as money remains to be seen.<p>Bitcoin is still more or less a proof-of-concept. Even if the underlying foundations, like SHA256 are found flawed, it remains a valid scheme for p2p crypto-tokens, with different crypto primitives.",1304927931

Sure, yes, a lot of corrupt manipulations also go into real currencies but that's because these currencies are controlled by human beings <i>and</i> can be life makers-or-breakers for people.<p>I guarantee you that if a truly substantial amount of dollars were sunk into bitcoins, a whole lot of dubious things would happen, some of which I might be able to think of and others of which neither you nor I would think of.<p>Here's just a sampling of specifics: Gold is nearly perfect as a physical currency and store of value. Yet gold has booms and busts. But if bitcoin has a bust, why would it ever rise again rather than some other ""cybercurrency""? And <i>if</i> bitcoin could crash that way, the thought of this tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy and there you are, it's doomed to collapse.<p>And that's just one point - ""...where do I begin?""",1304927636

2527881,comment,2527193,2527193,9,0,lionhearted,,,"I like Microsoft, but as a disclaimer before my analysis - I bought 400 shares of Microsoft stock a little bit ago at $25.79 per share.<p>Here my thoughts:<p>-Microsoft's price/earnings ratio is around 10, which I feel is pretty good for a company with a lot of stable revenue base and a chance at upside.<p>-This article talks about Microsoft's poor performance in tablets, which is true and worrying. I'm not sure Microsoft will make that ground up. They do have an excellent research division, though, and I'm wondering if they can make a strong showing in the next generation of technology after this. I don't know what that'll be, but new input devices should be coming online. The Kinect is <i>amazing</i>, I was really blown away playing with one in Singapore. If Microsoft can build on that to do alternative input and the next generation, they could have a huge renaissance.<p>-They have a very solid installed base. Government and business are very likely to keep running on Windows and Office. For consumers, even if tablets totally take over - and I'm not sure that'll happen - late adoptors will be buying those pre-installed Windows laptops and PCs just like always.<p>-$50 billion in cash reserves means they've got a lot of time to figure something out going forwards. Lots of cash + some very stable covering their fixed costs + big research division = seemingly a pretty safe buy with some upside.<p>I don't think it's a good stock to buy for short term appreciation - it might well go down over the next 2-3 years. But I'm comfortable holding it for 10 years. I think there's a decent shot it pays well in dividends and holds its value and a decent shot for lots of growth and appreciation.<p>Of course, maybe the house does fall over.

2527877,comment,2527521,2527831,18,0,potatolicious,,,"I immigrated from Taiwan in the mid 90s and went back this month, the first time in nearly 17 years.<p>When I left, it was squarely sitting in second-world status, but I was surprised to go back and find a modern, bustling, clean, developed nation. There is infrastructure there, unlike most American cities. I live in Seattle, and <i>everything</i> around here feels like it's falling apart - you walk around and there's the distinct feeling that you're walking through a relic... something from another era, now disused and slowly decaying. I did not get this feeling anywhere in Taipei. Everywhere you go something is being overhauled, more metro lines are being built constantly, there's new construction, new businesses. Technology is being integrated into people's lives in a wonderful way - even my 80 year-old grandmother navigates all the touch screen smart-card kiosks in the MRT system like a pro.<p>It was a bit of a disappointment to come back to Seattle and pick up a paper transfer riding a dilapidated bus that doesn't even have a voice-recorded stop call-out feature. It's even more depressing to watch all the political infighting in the city about rapid transit buildouts - the Taiwanese tunneled through much more densely populated, existing developed areas years ago, and now they get to enjoy one of the most advanced rapid transit system I've ever seen, while here in Seattle we've been sitting on our ass about this issue for 30 years.",1304927443

A mobile phone from 5 years ago is clearly inferior to most people whereas a computer from 5 years ago is mostly adequate for most users.<p>Agreed, and also the dominant software platform has not emerged yet, like it has with the PCs. The market is still highly fragmented and applications are routinely being written for many platforms. There is still time for someone other than Apple and Google to build something there.<p>In the meantime, MS has quite a bit of time I think. Those mobile devices will remain ""niche"" devices for a long time, as these platforms mature. Right now using my phone while i'm outside the house or using a tablet on my couch is great, but that doesn't mean i can dispense with my desktop, where MS is king. That will remain for probably a long time.<p>The holy grail in my opinion is a single device that i can use as a phone, and also hook up to monitors + peripherals and get a full unabridged desktop experience. Why have two devices when you can have one. Obviously the Atrix is already a step towards that, so i'm not pointing out anything particularly new. Of all the existing players, I think MS is potentially even better positioned than Apple to get in on that game since they already have a lock on the desktop platform.",1304925827

Basically, it comes down to the amount of time you spend reading documentation versus actually writing code.  If you are solving problems on Project Euler, you're not going to read much of any documentation (unless you're unfamiliar with the programming language you're working with)--you'll be solving the problem.

2527828,comment,2527394,2527778,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I don't think the practical risk here justifies any such thing, because all of this is occurring in a market with possibly one of the lowest barriers-to-entry of any market in human history. With the ubiquity of screen scrapers, the power of various programming languages and environments, and the interconnectedness of the web, any attempt to jail your data can usually be met, quickly, by a large number of people.<p>For example: back when Facebook was really irritating everyone, Diaspora came along. Now, Diaspora should probably be considered a failed project at this point, but along the way there was a not-small number of developers that came forward and said, ""hey, I already did this, start with my code..."", and if the anger over Facebook hadn't subsided, I have no doubt that at least one of those projects would have become successful.<p>Or, for another example: when word got leaked that Yahoo was going to ""sunset"" Delicious, it took me all of a few bucks and a couple of clicks to export every last one of my bookmarks to Pinboard. (Thanks Pinboard!)<p>Proprietary software, by contrast, carried much greater risk, because it often used secret data formats which were extremely difficult (or impossible) to reverse-engineer, and because it was much more difficult to scrape the data from the screen in a reliable way. I have direct experience with this: small grocery stores tend to use a product called NCR ScanMaster, which at least semi-recently was ""powered"" by a truly atrocious Btrieve database backend, which was unreadable without the schema files, which nobody would give you without lots of money. It was damned hard to reverse-engineer too; I have a proud history of that kind of thing, and it totally stumped me for all but the simplest of data extractions.<p>One of my clients needed to be able to make special sale-related changes to large numbers of products on a regular basis without paying someone to sit there and key it in all day (and make mistakes while they were at it). We eventually came up with using AutoHotKey to control the screen and data fields, but even that was rather challenging because of ScanMaster's variable time delays between screens and AutoHotKey's limitations.<p>Contrast that with <i>anything</i> web-related, where I could use PHP or Javascript & Greasemonkey or one of any of a number of solutions to parse and scrape the content of any site within a matter of hours.<p>I can't read the article right now -- the site is down -- but the thing about Stallman is that he's a radical, and he will see his epic foe everywhere he looks. Cloud computing and SaaS have become popular, and are replacing many aspects of traditional desktop computing, but if he's making the claim that there is just as much danger, in terms of personal freedom, with cloud computing and SaaS as there was with proprietary desktop software or timesharing systems, well, he's just plain wrong.<p>He's also, in this context, probably completely irrelevant. I suspect that his opinions of cloud computing or SaaS will have epsilon impact on the industry, no matter how loudly or oft-stated.",1304925127
