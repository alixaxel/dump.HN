LinkedIn had benefited from computer algorithmic trading that jacked it's price to extraordinarily urealistic price to earnings ratios.  p/e is a metric in which stocks are valued.  How much the company is worth divided by the yearly earnings.<p>To say LinkedIn got screwed is to say the dot coms got screwed in 2000.  Guess what?  The only people that got screwed were the share holders.  LinkedIn should be jumping for joy that their peice of shit company is worth anywhere near 8 billion dollars.

First, the functional paradigm <i>is</i> important and a step forward for most problem domains. Second, none of the current crop of functional languages is going to truly break into the mainstream.<p>I think it's more likely that we'll see more and more functional techniques trickle down into mainstream languages than it is that we'll see a pure functional language adopted as-is.

This is the one thing that PHP really, seriously got right: no application server.<p>I think you mean PHP has no 'apparent'. It damn well does have an application server, it's called mod_php embedded in Apache processes or php-fcgi backends.<p>The thing is, that PHP apps DO fail after a certain number of requests, it's just hidden from you. Internally PHP ships with a MAX_REQUESTS (which defaults to 1000 I believe), after a backend has served that many requests the process is recycled (an expensive and non-ideal operation on high load applications).<p>If you do a look around on Google you'll find this behaviour ships with PHP because of 'known memory leaks'. Rather than fix memory leaks the authors have opted to restart on an arbitrary number of requests. Does this sound like good design to you?<p>You think there's no application server because you've likely never worked on anything substantial enough to notice the silly string holding the whole mess together.",1306550989

2593745,comment,2593578,2593578,4,0,ankrgyl,,,"His arguments about the existing functional languages can be roughly split into two categories: \n    1.) Languages refuse to make compromises and therefore are obscure (Haskell, Erlang)     \n    2.) Languages are crippled by making too many compromises (F#, Scala).<p>He presents good arguments about why both types of languages can't currently break into the mainstream, but it unfortunately seems like these options form a partition of the possibilities (i.e. a functional language must fall into one of the two). If this assumption is correct, then by his analysis <i>no</i> functional language can break into the mainstream.<p>I'd love to see a discussion over whether or not that assumption is valid, but for now let's assume it's true. I don't think the languages are the problem. Instead, I think it's the general momentum and consensus of the community. Without books like Learn You a Haskell (<a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a>), Haskell would be an order of magnitude more difficult to begin learning. I'm still trying to figure it out, and there are a lot of examples of topics where a similarly good tutorial would ease my learning. Eventually, as the language gains popularity, more and more such work will exist. Furthermore, if popular companies demonstrates that it's a great choice, more people will want to pick it up. If all this stuff happens, our intuitions will grow and adapt to make such a language a natural choice. In summary, the future of functional languages depends <i>more</i> on our understanding and promoting them as a community, as opposed to the languages themselves.",1306550636

An employee can use his general skills and expertise freely in any position, as these are not tied to misuse of confidential, proprietary information. The tension lies between your right to work freely using your skills and restrictions placed on you to the extent you learn confidential things in your old position.<p>Thus, the general answer to your question is that, yes, you can work for another company doing a payment service even if you have worked for PayPal, but you can't use or disclose trade secrets from your former employer in your subsequent job. Do gray areas come up in such situations? All the time. Usually, they don't lead to lawsuits. In extreme cases, they do; in abusive cases, they also do, though these are not justified (i.e., where a former employer wants to chase and punish an employee just for having left employment).
