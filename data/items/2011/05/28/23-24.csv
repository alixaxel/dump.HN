For example, when I was there UBS had: non-officers, Associate Directors, Directors, Executive Directors and Managing Directors, in increasing rank.<p>Other banks do the same with other keywords instead of ""Director"". VP for example. Or whatever. The point is, it's just a rank scale that's meant to cover all the ""officers"" and provide them with sufficient apparent title that clients won't feel like the person they're dealing with is some junior guy.",1306627171

2595494,comment,2594625,2594625,7,0,lars512,,,"This article is effectively discussing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which in its strong form says that language constrains the thoughts you can have, and in it's weak form says that language merely influences your thoughts. Wikipedia's article on linguistic relativity probably explains it better.<p>The strong form is clearly false -- when was the last time you wanted to say something but struggled to find the right word that expressed just the nuance you meant? In the end, you may have settled for a more complicated explanation, simply because you didn't know of an English word that fitted. The lack of the word didn't stop you having the thought or feeling though.<p>On the other hand, the weak hypothesis is clearly true. Some of the article's examples show that you can't have simple expressions in some languages without being expressing gender, compass direction, seniority, etc. To express these things, you need to mentally aware of them, at least in the sense of having some background cognitive machinery that makes it available to you when forming utterances.<p>It will be very interesting to see how the evidence converges over time.",1306627108

He just knows the rules of the game and plays it extremely well.""  I think that's nice in theory and may make folks feel good especially as its impossible to prove/disprove but arguing his success is the result of playing a game better seems wrong.<p>-- There isn't any factor which suggests the importance of the market the startup is going after.  While management and momentum are alluded to in the 14 factors, market seems to be missing, no?  And this seems to be a major gap.<p>-- It's not clear how success is measured which would be critical to dissecting patterns of success?  It seems its measured in part by funding received.  But given an overwhelming majority of funded startups don't succeed, not sure funding is an appropriate proxy for success.  It may be necessary but is certainly not sufficient to guarantee success.<p>-- While large companies can use data to achieve better results, that's driven by the fact that they are generally more in the ""exploit"" portion of their maturity curve, i.e. eeking out another percent or two of market share, margin, revenue growth, etc.  Startups on the other hand are about ""exploration"" (vs the exploit of the big cos) and while the practices of Ries/Blank make that exploration more rational, well-conceived, it remains an inherently uncertain thing.",1306626896

2595481,comment,2594495,2594658,2,0,brianleb,,,"As a pharmacist with an interest in depression, I have to strongly suggest you give it a try. Conspiracy theorists will now jump out and say ""That's because you make money when he takes drugs!"" No, I don't make much money when someone picks up a $4 prescription for a month's worth of citalopram, sertraline, trazodone, or paroxetine. But I know how depression can affect (and cripple) a person's life, and because of that I have to suggest that you at least go see a doctor to talk about it. Explain to him that you're skeptical, that's fine. Be open to suggestions, and be willing to try a few different drugs. We don't have depression completely figured out and only about 1/3 of patients achieve remission on their first antidepressant (about 2/3 achieve remission by with their second monotherapy trial).<p>Dependency is not an issue. You will not crave your antidepressant. You may, however, feel strange if you stop taking it suddenly (I cannot clearly explain it - 'strange' truly is the effect). Some of these drugs do have withdrawal symptoms, and again, this is where conspiracy theorists jump out and say ""That's because you're addicted!"" No, you are not addicted. You were taking a medication that modulated your neurotransmitter levels. If it was successful, over a period of time, your mood will be altered. If you stop that suddenly, wouldn't you expect your mood to fluctuate until your body readjusts? Of course you would.<p>Taking an antidepressant does not 'kill off' parts of yourself. It will allow you to be /more/ of who you are - without the anxiety, without the sleeplessness, without the morbid thoughts, without the intrusive thoughts, without the feelings of guilt. It allows you to break through the wall that normally holds you back.<p>If you are interested in further discussion, please email me. I have a lot to say on the subject.",1306626676

If all  (non-function) instance fields are assigned new values - like the Point example in the article - it is basically the same.<p>Prototypal inheritance makes a difference if one instance inherits field values (other than functions) from another instance. But this does not seem to be very common.<p>I believe one of the original use cases for prototypal inheritance were to save memory by letting GUI controls share common properties. Eg. if you had 10 buttons on the screen which all had the same color, same dimensions etc. With class based inheritance each instance would have their own copy of all properties, even if they have the same values in each instance.<p>I don't think that kind of optimization is relevant in modern JavaScript.",1306626414

2595467,comment,2594495,2595423,7,0,brianleb,,,"History time. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy was actually discovered in the 1950s when reserpine, then used as an antihypertensive, was noted to cause depression. Reserpine acts by blocking the transmission of neurotransmitters 5HT, NE, and DA. Given that over twenty drugs, all with different actions on different neurotransmitters, have shown efficacy in depressed patients over the last 60 years, I think it would be rather shortsighted to dismiss the significant body of literature dedicated to the role of neurotransmitters in depression.<p>There are certainly many theories, and depression is a complicated disease. It is primarily modified by neurotransmitters, however. That much should be clear. Beta adrenergic receptor sensitivity and downregulation are also involved - but to what extent? Hypersecretion of cortisol (or lack of cortisol suppression) is also a factor - but to what extent? Even thyroid hormones are implicated.<p>Like I said, I'm not saying there is no inflammatory problem in depression - I said that we have no antidepressants based on this idea (and as far as I know, there are none in the pipeline in at least Phase II trials). Do I think inflammation is involved? Yes, I do. Do I think it's directly going to lead to more treatments for depression? No, I don't.",1306626155

The main idea was that a sleep cycle lasts approximately 90 minutes, and you feel better rested when you avoid waking up in the middle of a cycle.<p>Since then, I always set my alarm clock to sleep a multiple of 90 minutes: 6h, 7h30min, 9h... (6 hours more often than not, but I might change this, having read this article...)<p>I used to dream all the time. I haven't dreamt since I started doing this. I guess I still have dreams, but I never remember them. I think you only remember dreams when you are woken up in the middle of REM sleep (in the middle of a cycle).<p>A nice benefit of my current sleep pattern, is that I fall asleep very fast, instead of waiting in bed for up to 1 hour like I used to.

The NESARC, which included more than 43,000 adults found slightly lower prevalence rates than the NCS-R (13.25% lifetime and 5.28% 12-month), perhaps because the sample included previously omitted groups of individuals with lower prevalence rates (655).
