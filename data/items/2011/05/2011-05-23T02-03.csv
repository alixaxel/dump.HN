That health coverage is tied to employment creates a fixed cost on employers per-employee, rather than a transferrable marginal cost.  It is nonsensical that we manage to have both high unemployment and long work-hours, but yet, it's cheaper for this to be the hiring pattern.<p>All of that said, within the scope of software development (more relevant to this board), a major factor is Brooks' law, which leads to the startup culture of 80-hour weeks being ""how things are done"".",1306119529

2574844,comment,2572546,2574548,1,0,derefr,,,"OSX is actually pretty good about file associations in general; every app publishes a list of extensions it can open, and the list you get in the Open With context menu is generated from that. The difficulty is simply that almost everything in OSX can do one thing or another with image files, and without any association to an already-open app, the OS doesn't know what you're trying to accomplish. Are you converting the image to a different format? Viewing it? Editing it? Attaching it to an email? Setting it up as album art for some songs you have? Etc.<p>The real problem is that files represent a noun-based model of user interaction, and apps a verb-based model, but what we want is neither; in the user's mind, he is actually performing a <i>task</i>, and both the relevant data and the functions to manipulate it are subservient to the task being accomplished. (Disclaimer: with this in mind, I've been working on a GUI that would have a sort of to-do list/notification system as the system shell and hierarchy of organization under which both data and applications reside, thus always giving both each datum and app a context it can examine to determine what apps, or data, respectively, are relevant to its current instantiation.)",1306119395

2574824,comment,2573656,2574758,8,0,keane,,,"'Keep Your Head Down' and 'Do not get in their way', are I realise, perhaps not the optimistic slogans people like to hear. I consider myself a geek and based on my own experience and also discussions with other geeky people, I think geeks and hackers and generally creators have a difficulty accepting what the state is doing based on two key traits of (many) geeks: idealism and belief in rationality (perhaps these attributes contributed to Sonne's behavior). The world, of course, as far as its political organization and practices go, does not operate based on science, rationality, or fair play. If anything, you might best understand the government's actions by considering individuals' psychology, and how those individuals will behave when given power over others.<p>What you see in Toronto, and in Sonne's case, is part of a never-ending conflict between individuals with respect for liberty and individuals with a need for authority. Authoritarians and libertarians have been clashing as long as humans have existed. A spoiler: the authoritarians win.<p>Consider this passage from Bertrand Russell:<p>""I am naturally pugnacious, and am only restrained (when I am restrained) by a realization of the tragedy of human existence, and the absurdity of spending our little moment in strife and heat. That I, a funny little gesticulating animal on two legs, should stand beneath the stars and declaim in a passion about my rightsit seems so laughable, so out of all proportion. Much better, like Archimedes, to be killed because of absorption in eternal things... There is a possibility in human minds of something mysterious as the night-wind, deep as the sea, calm as the stars, and strong as Death, a mystic contemplation, the intellectual love of God. Those who have known it cannot believe in wars any longer, or in any kind of hot struggle.""<p>A soldier was insulted when Archimedes insisted he finish working on his math problem before obeying the soldier and meeting with a general, so the soldier killed him. Today, while immediate techne are different, those two psychologies still exist. And while the soldiers might not kill you, their apparatus will not hesitate to imprison you and ruin your life in other ways (or in the case of Giuliani and Tomlinson, will indeed kill you). And so, as Russell points out, better to spend your limited days on eternal things, like Archimedes, then to fall into their game and be distracted by petty struggle.<p>Hunter S. Thompson summarises the protesters of the 1960s:<p>""The hippies, who had never really believed they were the wave of the future anyway, saw the election results as brutal confirmation of the futility of fighting the establishment on its own terms. There had to be a whole new scene, they said, and the only way to do it was to make the big move  either figuratively or literally  from Berkeley to the Haight-Ashbury, from pragmatism to mysticism, from politics to dope... The thrust is no longer for ""change"" or ""progress"" or ""revolution,"" but merely to escape, to live on the far perimeter of a world that might have been.""<p>As Gavin McInnes says ""Boomers, who are masters at glorifying their past, insist they stopped a war, but we all know it was Kissingers relentless bombing that ended it."" Protest does nothing. The success of the hippies was not their conflict with authoritarians (our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrates how they won and always will win) -- that was a complete failure. The success and value of the hippies was their ability to create autonomous zones and safe enclaves from which they could explore personal growth and become, as Russell advises, absorbed in eternal things.",1306118150

It creates an intimate entanglement between the internal implementation details of the super- and sub-classes. Every time you extend a class or override a method that wasn't explicitly and carefully designed to be subclassed and overridden safely, you are _writing hacky code_.<p>There are, of course, places for hacky code. If you understand why something is hacky and feel it's a worthwhile trade-off then by all means you should be able to do it. Java, though, encourages people to pepper their code with such hacks before they have learned why they shouldn't.",1306116120
