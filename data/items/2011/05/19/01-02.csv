I'd still imagine the maintenance costs on this thing, consisting mostly of a drag engine, propeller, and chute would be less costly than that of a traditional airplane wouldn't you agree?<p>I do agree it would certainly make sense to opt in for covering the car as well. I was mostly making the point the liability rule could be a baseline showing insurance companies had no reason to charge a higher rate than, say, a sports car (under a minimum coverage scenario where they cover only liability costs).<p>It appears this vehicle costs $84K.

So, to minimize exposure, you want to trust as few of them as possible.  Now, obviously the Sony incident shows us how trusting big companies is not a good idea, but in general, bigger companies are going to try harder to protect your data because they have more to lose.  Your weekend project has nothing to lose if it starts spamming my Twitter followers.  But I really didn't mean to bring up this particular topic; I apologize.<p>I'm discussing OAuth in the context of allowing applications to do stuff to your Twitter account, not to authenticate you as you.  So Twitter isn't owning your users, you are merely allowing users to delegate their Twitter permissions to you on a fine-grained basis.  This is nice because it allows, say, an app to read my public tweets, but not to send them.  Giving an app my password means it can do anything, and all I can do is change my password (killing all legitimate apps, too) if it does Something Bad.  I think we can agree that that's sub-optimal.<p>I personally will not use apps that require me to use a third party to create an account.  I don't mind running my own OpenID server, though, or delegating it if I'm feeling lazy.  I do mind being locked into someone else's platform forever.",1305770189

2562593,comment,2561915,2562039,16,0,zedshaw,,,"> I'm OK with requiring OAuth. It's hard to trust third parties with data they collect themselves: see Sony and Gawker. It's even harder to trust them with data that belongs to someone else: they might one-way-hash their own passwords, of course, but they can't do that to your Twitter password. It's probably sitting in a database, cleartext, for every rogue employee or cracker to see.<p>That's a load of FUD crap the OAuth and OpenID projects perpetuate.  If you can't trust the 3rd party then why the hell are you logging in?  If it's a matter of ""they might get hacked"" then why is Twitter suddenly special and is somehow magically more safe?  Trust me, based on what I hear Twitter is not more safe than Gawker.  How is a <i>more</i> complicated login system safer? More complicated things like OAuth are not safer, they're just more complicated.<p>The entire security premise of OAuth is junk.  It's only advantage is that Twitter/Facebook/Google become the owners of your users and can leverage that against you or the other site.  It's just idiotic to say that the only way to secure your access to SuperHackable.com is to go through Twitter.com as if that makes SuperHackable.com better or that Twitter.com has some sort of magic super powers.",1305769758

2562556,comment,2560879,2560879,21,0,angusgr,,,"I went on an interesting journey with this article. I first clicked expecting to see what Paul Buccheit succinctly labelled ""Limited Life Experience + Overgeneralization = Advice"".<p>I found generalised advice, without a word on the author's actual experience. Which I generally dislike, because I like to know who's telling me things. I'd much rather read ""Here are some things that worked for me and might work for you"" than ""this is what you should do"".<p>I also nearly gave up because of poor opening sentence construction, bad jokes (""Drinking Heavily? Not Another Neckbeard?"") and outright sexism (""Teh Womens"").<p>Also offputting is the arrogance that comes through the article's tone of ""the master"" giving omniscient advice. Every great programmer I've personally met was humble about what they could do, and the Dunning–Kruger effect would seem to suggest that's not coincidence.<p>But then I started thinking about how it's hard to give advice to newbies when you have experience. I mean, my advice on ""what worked for me"" to start programming is ""Have your parents buy you an Apple //e when you're a kid, learn AppleSoft Basic and then try to learn 6502 assember, keep making things and learning from mistakes for 20+ years and you might be on the right path to become me but then again this might be the wrong path to become you."". That clearly doesn't translate on several levels. And I'm relatively young blood who wouldn't dare give advice on this topic. If you're older and more experienced then your story is going to be even more complicated, and harder to translate.<p>That's when I decided to look at the author's bio. And from right here on HN: ""I started learning how to program with Ruby about 10 months ago"". Combined with their own bio[1],  this suggests they are actually pretty new to this too.<p>Which would seem to be bad, but it's actually a tremendous advantage when giving advice to newbies. So my advice to the author, if they're reading this, is:<p>* Rework the advice you clearly want to give around your own experiences. For example, you say ""read the Dragon book"". Did you actually read the Dragon book? Which parts? What did you learn from it, and how did you apply the knowledge? What did you need to know before you could begin to understand it? Tell us what you did, that you think someone following in your footsteps should do.<p>* For a second example, you say upfront to learn both Ruby and Python (seemingly concurrently, which I think sounds like an awful idea) but your own experience seems to suggest you learned Ruby first.

First, a little background: I've loved computers ever since I was a kid. I've always loved learning new stuff and I've made some pretty cool side projects. Somehow, I never even considered the job aspect of it until a couple years ago. I guess I was too busy enjoying it to realize it was a viable career. Anyway.<p>I've been working at a web agency for almost a year now, I'm in some gray area between intern and developer (in that I get paid as an intern but work on full projects without supervision like a developer), and I'm starting to learn that the challenging parts of it aren't what I thought they'd be. Having some difficult task that requires learning a new way to do things isn't a problem -- it's why I fell in love with computers in the first place. I've learned in the past few months that the hardest part is sitting for hours and grinding away at someone else's kludges of spaghetti code.<p>We're primarily a PHP shop, and we mostly do business websites with typical content using our proprietary CMS. That's not incredibly exciting, but it's at least not terrible. Occasionally they have an interesting requirement, API hookup, etc. Sometimes I make WP themes (for SEO purposes :() or make a Drupal module, and that's also not bad. I enjoy starting a project and building it through 'til the end. Where it gets painful is when we inherit clients that have an already existing site made by their DBA that didn't know what he was doing, or worse yet, our sales team scores a client that has an ASP site (""We're technology neutral"" i.e. we'll take anything) and it gets dropped in my lap even though I don't know a damn thing about ASP and don't even have a Windows install around to work on, so I'm live-editing the site using Transmit and TextMate. Oh sure, I speak 'coder-speak' so the language doesn't matter, except that the guy that made it obviously didn't speak coder-speak and has an almost incomprehensible abomination that works, but, oh my god I don't know how and I don't want to know.<p>Oh, or my favorite: the guy that already spent his $500 on iLance (http://www.ilance.com/) and then realized he couldn't make it do what he wants so he hires us and we have to use iLance because he already bought it, damn it! while iLance is probably the most incompetent chunk of PHP I've ever looked at. Seriously, like ""I don't know how to use arguments to make this expression, so I'll just concatenate a string of PHP code from the post variables you sent me and ram it through eval()""-bad.<p>tl;dr I find it miserable to work on someone else's sloppy code. It feels like I'm doing a job no more skilled than sweeping the floors at a supermarket or something. Just pounding away at a keyboard for 9 hours and then going home feeling like my brain is fried. Does it get better? Does my situation (with dramatic, frustrated emphases accounted for) seem typical, or is the place I work just particularly messy sounding? Any advice?",1305768119

Printing the source of the function with no extra work is especially valuable if I grab the non minimized version of a new javascript library and want to poke around and see what everything does.<p>+ I do think the ""Net"" tab displays requests a bit more concisely than Chromium.
