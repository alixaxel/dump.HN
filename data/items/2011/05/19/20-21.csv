But I do know that MacBook Pro prices with Thunderbolt are similar to without, probably because the thunderbolt controller also does DisplayPort (I wouldn't be surprised if Apple built the connector themselves, actually. Maybe ifixit knows.)<p>The market is different than when they put USB into the iMac now mainly because there are large amounts of cheap USB peripherals which USB 3 is backwards compatible with. I think (but haven't done any research) that the number of companies making USB peripherals now is much (one or two orders of magnitude) greater than the number of companies making PS/2 or parallel SCSI when the iMac was released. The personal computer market has grown a lot, and USB now has much more momentum than anything else had when the iMac was released. People (such as my mother) are going to buy a new computer and are going to want it to work with their existing external hard disk -- they're not going to transplant the disk to a new case. So USB, especially is USB 3 peripherals can run at slower speeds over USB 2, is going to stay for a little while. Thunderbolt is going up against an entrenched competitor, and if you compare to the HD format wars, both players worked with DVDs. If Blu-Ray didn't and people had to have two boxes instead of one, HD-DVD probably would have won. The best Thunderbolt is probably going to do for the near future is be the new FireWire.",1305837744

As the race weekend progresses they'll continue to lock down setting and begin to extrapolate to the permutations of every rival car in order to work out strategies.<p>Even during the race its not just the team's two cars and some guys on the pit wall...

2565261,comment,2563718,2563718,1,0,yangez,,,"I made an account just to post this. Hi everyone!<p>First, I think this is a fantastic idea and I signed up instantly, privacy issues notwithstanding. Not only can you exchange coding favors and build a reputation, you can also practice your design and development skills in a variety of projects, which might be an additional major draw. I can't wait for this to get underway. This is one of those ideas that I wish I thought of.<p>That being said, I really think you should explore this idea further and create a dedicated website for it. A mailing list is great and easy to maintain and all, but a reputation-based service has to have the appropriate mechanisms to work well. It wouldn't take that long either.<p>Envision a site where jobs are listed as they're approved and removed as soon as they're completed or claimed, with discussion and advice flowing freely between parties. The site would keep track of projects both requested and completed by each member, and award appropriate kudos within the community to encourage and reward participation. People would be able to link to their profiles, which would display which projects they completed for which sites, on their resumes or facebooks or whatever. You could make a leaderboard of top contributors, and perhaps a provider request system that may eventually involve money. It would be like Elance except eroding the barrier between ""service providers"" and ""employers"" - instead, everyone would be both.<p>There's tons of potential here. Once you get critical mass, monetization could go far beyond ads: off the top of my head, you could skim paid projects, offer premium filtering capabilities and other services to paid premium users, or even get paid by companies that come knocking on your door wanting to hire some of your more skilled members. You could maybe even provide a service for members to tutor other members (serving those who go to your site for practice) and take a % of that $ too.<p>I realize this goes far beyond a simple ""scratch my back and i'll scratch yours"" paradigm, but I really think you might have something. The cherry on the top is that some of the smaller features that you might want to add to the site can actually be crowdsourced to your community :)<p>So yeah, great idea.
