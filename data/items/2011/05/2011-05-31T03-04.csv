What I've found is that most of his Cydia (and, presumably, Android) apps do rely on at least one GPL-licensed component. Note, however, that he <i>can</i> sell GPL'd apps, and the GPL <i>specifically</i> allows this: he just need to release the source code (edit: or give it to people when they ask).<p>However, looking at his GitHub, his source releases are <i>not</i> timely (although they do seem to be complete). If ZodTTD just added ""dump source to GitHub"" as part of his release process, there would be no issues here. I don't think ZodTTD is deliberately trying to steal money or code from anyone, but I think he misunderstands the importance of putting out the source code for his emulators <i>right away</i>, as they are released to a store.<p>(However, there is one exception: SNES9x has a license specifically forbidding commercial use.

I don't usually go crazy with macros in my own code (a few here and there, where they're really needed), but having them in library code is amazingly helpful; the DSLs for various things are amazingly rich. Have a look at ClojureQL and tell me there's a nicer way (conceptually - it isn't as feature-complete as it could be) to integrate your app with a database.<p>Beyond that, it's that Clojure feels like a very well designed tool for people to use. Dozens of times, programming in various languages I've thought ""this task would be so much easier if only the language had X"", and Clojure more often than not has the X I'm thinking of.<p>The community is a big help too. It's full of smart, friendly people. It's small enough that you can get an answer from someone important (Rich Hickey once optimized some code for me), but big enough that you <i>can</i> get an answer reasonably fast. It's thriving and innovative as well, with people trying new and interesting things all the time.",1306812879

For real, large software projects, the case for a less expressive language is not nearly as convincing, because the shortcomings of the language mean that programmers aren't able to write the same quality of code. For example, compare the outright mess that is concurrency in C or Java to the much easier concurrency available in more expressive languages. As parallelism becomes far more important for people who need high performance (yes, I know concurrency and parallelism aren't exactly the same thing, but they're similar) this advantage of the less expressive languages is likely to diminish, if not disappear outright.<p>[Edit: Added-- This is analogous to the static/dynamic typing debate. Dynamic typing test drives extremely well but multi-developer projects in dynamically typed languages usually turn into outright nightmares, due to problems around interfaces. Static typing's better for large projects. Same with expressive languages: assembly's going to win on microbenchmarks, but writing good code in less expressive languages becomes impossible as the size and scope of the project gets large.]",1306811207
