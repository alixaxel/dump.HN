They care about money as evidence that people really want what you are building.<p>Who is going to use your ___ in production first? Cuz you won't really know if it's good until they are using it... good in the sense of helping them out.

It seems that anyone who doesn't take the envelope the gay rights people are pushing is suddenly an illogical homophobe, afraid that buttsex is going to bite and poison them.<p>Even an argument that homosexuality altogether is immoral and should not be socially acceptable behavior is not the same thing as being afraid of persons that perform homosexual acts; it's merely ostracizing the behavior, as one may ostracize a person for meth use, though it'd be silly to call one that supports meth prohibition a dopephobe just because he doesn't think meth use should become a social norm.<p>You can dislike a behavior without fearing it, and you can have rational reasons for that dislike.
