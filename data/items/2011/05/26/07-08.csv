2586980,comment,2586632,2586632,4,0,sardonicbryan,,,"As a ""product guy"" myself, here are some ways that I feel I contribute to my team. To give some background, I started at my current company (a growing consumer internet company) in an interaction design role, but transitioned into product as I and the company grew.<p>- I keep track of metrics. This includes KPI that I am monitoring on an hourly basis, as well as metrics on new features that we launch. The specific skills that are at play here range from being an Excel jockey, to being able to write sql queries and understanding our DB schema, to being able to analyze data.<p>- I help figure out what to do. This involves understanding how the product is performing -- at any given time, do we try to improve our user acquisition funnel, our retention or our monetization? Where are our biggest opportunities? Are we more likely to improve our acquisition funnel by 5 percentage points or our 7 day retention by 15 percentage points, and which one would have a bigger impact on long term average revenue per user?<p>This involves both understanding our product, and spending a lot of time doing competitive analysis on similar products.<p>- I help develop features by thinking about how they should work. For example, if I figure out that compared to industry benchmarks, our 2 day retention is is about normal, but we see large attrition between day 2 and day 7, how do we address this problem? What makes people come back to our product, how can we measure it, and what levers can we pull to improve that number?<p>- I also have an interaction design background, so I often wireframe features that address the above point.<p>- I also translate feature ideas into functional specs, including thinking about and documenting error cases, process flows, various entry points into the feature, any new analytics that need to be built to track the performance of the feature and any new admin tools that need to be built to support the ongoing feature functionality.<p>- I also then work with engineers and QA to balance the potential feature improvements against the time/effort/risk it would take to build those features, and the help organize the features into actual sprints. When the unexpected happens, I help decide whether to cut scope, delay the sprint or push the entire feature into the next sprint.<p>- This one is a bit fuzzier, but I also think strategically. Based on where my product fits in with my company's portfolio of products, what kind of risk profile do we need to take on in terms of developing features? Is the team currently in a position to succeed in terms of staffing, support services, etc?<p>I like to think that I am contributing to my current team by doing these things (and more!), and while product roles differ somewhat from company to company, to me the essence of a product person is someone who uses analytical skills to make sure that the team is working on the things with the greatest chance for success.",1306396164

And, they are not ""catch-up"": they are released both before and with more interesting changes than Lion or (what we've seen of) Windows 8.<p>However, what Cupertino and Redmond are up to isn't ""nothing"", it's just not the desktop. The Windows Phone ""Metro"" UI is downright amazing when you use it, and iOS isn't bad either. Sadly, and I was hoping this would be better this time around, the open source world is still years behind on mobile.<p>(I'm not counting Android here, and that's a shame.

Please don't assume what I might think about something.<p><i>... and you must not consider them to have killer FP value either.</i><p>That part is true,  to the extent that they are not ensuring referential transparency.  Mind you  ""What makes an FP language?"" is a great flame-war topic, but for me it has to be more than ""Has first-order functions"" or  ""Has pattern matching.""   I can get that in Ruby if I want but that doesn't make Ruby a functional programming language. It's functiony at best.<p>Also, pointing out features one does not like in a language is hardly <i>hating</i> on it, and I see far more Scala cheering than dissing on HN.  I wish Scala users well.  It's just not for me.<p><i>As someone who has used several functional and OO languages, I can witness that Scala is doing something very special and is not worthy of the criticisms you give it, whether or not you like Mirah more, and I am certainly a fan of Charles Nutter's work.</i><p>It's not a question of <i>worthy</i> or not.  It's a matter of whether my comments accurate or not.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong (such as with my initial concerns over the size of the required bundling of runtime libs).  But if I'm right then, well, people have to decide if it matters or not.<p>A few years ago I saw Bill Venners give a talk on Scala and while I appreciated that functiony features were finding their way into Java land the option to have code that was a OO here, FP there, really put me off. It seemed the language did not strongly encourage (or, better yet, out-right enforce) a set of conceptually simple, well-defined ground rules.  That is, one would have to keep track of various coding options that were at odds with each other (OO being about carrying around and managing state, FP being close to the opposite).<p>If Scala and it's combination of features works for you, great.

Should mark some items as followup I guess.<p>Holidays are difficult to plan for me, never know when can take, should take, need to synchronize with other people, work etc. Besides it feels good to waste time on days off. That's when the brains come up with new ideas. Wasting a day typically means spending it on something that I then thought was most interesting, which is the right thing, yes? If I'm bursting to do something, I do it.<p>I guess for me the same that plan x -> y -> z doesn't work. Such processes are inflexible. It should be possible to do x, y and z in whatever order I feel like and all of them should be possible to finish in one go. Or not do at all. Now how to string a bigger project together ...?<p>Cooking part is interesting. What do you do with fresh foods or they are just no on the menu? We cook for 2-3 days at a time and it does take more time than to heat stuff up.<p>Many of your choices require commitment not only from you but from your family and friends. How does that go?",1306394348

And miners can choose to not include your transaction in the block (ie, if you don't meet the fee requirement they chose).  It's entirely possible for your transaction to be continually pending and never accepted.<p>In practice, it takes within about 10 minutes for the first confirmation to go through, and 10 more for each one after that.  Most merchants will likely be interested in waiting for a few more blocks to be added before totally accepting, but that can be solved by middle-men that provide insurance against double-spending, allowing immediate transactions.  And transactions move across the network quite quickly - I tend to see them appear well within a minute.",1306394151
