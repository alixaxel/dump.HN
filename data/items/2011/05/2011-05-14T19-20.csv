2548423,comment,2547772,2547772,2,0,ChrisMac,,,"Another critique you can level against CBT comes from the thinking behind Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).  I've read books on ACT that argue that trying to rationally challenge and control and manage your thoughts often has the paradoxical effect of making them stronger, and making them more prominent in your life.  A common comparison is that a person trying not to have negative, depressed thoughts is like someone trying not to think of a red lion; you can't make yourself <i>not</i> think something.<p>The ACT approach to negative thoughts and behaviors is more mindfulness based and is about accepting the things that come from your mind without necessarily getting sucked into them or being controlled by them.  Personally I think bits of several approaches can help.",1305402955

Before Microsoft, there were a variety of hardware platforms, each with their own libraries and languages... not unlike the situation today with phones. Developers had to choose what to target... not only Mac vs PC, but different video cards, different sound cards, different network stacks, etc.<p>Microsoft took that fragmented market and unified it under a set of standard APIs for both hardware makers and software developers to target. I would consider that an innovation: the loose coupling that they enabled allowed <i>much</i> faster innovation in both hardware and third-party software.<p>Interestingly, Netscape tried to play the same game on top of them (unifying Windows, Mac, and UNIX under one standardized API), and though Microsoft was able to destroying them, Webkit has succeeded where Netscape failed, and it is slowly making Microsoft irrelevant, just as Gates feared.<p>Other than that, I don't think Microsoft invented much.

Briefly: income earned by overseas subsidiaries is not taxable to the American corporate parent until those overseas earnings are sent back to America via a dividend. Here, rather than pay a 35% rate on their overseas profits, Microsoft chose to use it to acquire another company, essentially delaying taxation on that income until much later into the future, if ever.<p>Edit: There is no advantage to the reverse (MSEuro buying a US company), since the US-earned income is taxed in the US at the US corporate rates, which are much higher than the European corporate rates.

The fact that you can put a toilet in doesn't make you a master plumber. Immigrant labor floods the low end of the market and starves off the supply of new laborers to the higher end because there's no career path for an illegal, casual worker. That's why a skilled master plumber often can get away with charging $150/hr.<p>Frankly, white collar jobs like IT are if anything, easier than most trade jobs.

To me, this is a clear indicator that nobody has beaten placebo and we really need a different model.<p>If we practiced surgery the same way we practice psychiatry, we would be routinely trepanning people if they seemed 'resistant to conventional treatment'. There is no sense in psychiatry that it is unethical to administer unproven treatments without clear informed consent. This has to stop. Psychotherapy needs to develop a firm framework to prevent patients from being subjected to pseudoscience, or it should be abolished and reformed from scratch.<p>To be blunt, psychoanalysts are vampires, extracting huge fees from vulnerable clients with absolutely no evidence justifying the time and expense. I see them as no different to psychics or faith healers. They obfuscate the argument by debating the merits of various therapies with no basis in neuroscience and no strong evidence of efficacy.
