2515592,comment,2514020,2515540,2,0,blasdel,,,"Have you not followed any of the development of the WebSockets protocol and its eventual retraction? It was originally fairly simple and used the <i>Upgrade</i> header that was specified for exactly this sort of thing. Unfortunately, since nobody really used it before, broken implementations in proxies are widespread making it impossible to use without opening up security vulnerabilities.<p>Sure, <i>http-equiv</i> could be parsed out by the webserver or a proxy and transformed into real headers, but since none of them bothered to do that, the browsers parse them. The end result to the user is largely the same (just that you're unlikely to successfully get a 304). Expecting proxies to do anything intelligent is what's ""fundamentally incompatible"", not <i>http-equiv</i>.",1304549868

I attended the 10th anniversary party, which I believe was in 2010.<p>- Microsoft didn't need to launch a Microsoft-branded 411 to collect utterances, for they had acquired Tellme and had many utterances coming in under their umbrella of services<p>- Tellme's bread and butter was speech recognition on the telephone and they are still in that space today, so Bing411, 1-800-555-TELL are still relevant for them.<p>I can also say that a lot of the speculation in the article about Microsoft's ""reaction"" is just wrong.

If they are cash rich, you can try to license it, sell it, or any number of things.<p>But if you have a revenue sharing agreement in place, their interests are aligned with yours.

Microsoft plays a traditional long game: market penetration, brand loyalty, development stack, ""synergy"" (real or imagined), etc. Google plays a much more subtle game. They'll do something like GOOG411 just to get better voice recognition algorithms. They'll also do things like develop a state of the art web browser just to jostle the browser development community out of its laziness and propel web standards and browser performance forward. That sort of thing is just not in Microsoft's DNA to do or even conceive of doing.",1304547966

If nothing else, the service will still reflect 37s in some way in the periods following the change in ownership.<p>I also think the value that 37s is giving SF is being somewhat overestimated. The revenues are going to be tied in with the amount of people looking for designers. As long as the stream of good customers does not dry out, the site will continue to do very well. At this point, how many customers are being brought in because of 37s? I don't know, but that would be something I'd have to get a better idea of before considering a purchase. I think SF has already gotten all the value from the 37s name that it can, or at least is close to that point. Early on, being a 37s product had tremendous SEO, linking, social news, etc. value. That stuff is already built into the product, so the 37s value is mostly limited to drawing in new customers.
