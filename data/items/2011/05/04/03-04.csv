The original comment said:<p>> <i>That also leads me to mention that Github, as good as it is in 'social' coding or whatever that means, does not fill a gap for a proper resource on how to use Git.</i><p>Well, Scott Chacon (#4 githubber I believe?) wrote the book to demystify Git.  Of course, there is a certain irreducible complexity there, but I think Github has made a significant contribution there, so I don't think it's fair to level this criticism at them out of passing unfamiliarity.",1304481477

Composability allows you to define a scope that globally applicable like (eg. ""published articles"") and then add additional constraints in a controller (eg. ""tagged X"") using the logic of relational algebra to construct a sane query.  Could this query be slow?  Sure, it's still your responsibility to make sure the schema supports that query.  Writing SQL manually does not absolve you of that responsibility, it just means organizing a lot of SQL strings somehow.<p>Here's what you're missing, and why ActiveRecord works: if you halfway know what you're doing with a RDBMS, 95-99% of the time the query generation just saves you writing a lot of boilerplate SQL.  It's true that sometimes you have to drop to a lower level to hand-craft a query, but ActiveRecord in no way prevents that.  Again, I don't know what kind of ORM hell you have been put through, but I assure you that an ORM does not need to be this horrendous performance killing black box that you think it is.",1304481286

2512726,comment,2512635,2512635,1,0,kennet,,,"I made this comment awhile ago:<p><i>For myself, there are two things that are really pissing me off: 1) Lack of security by default, 2) Lack of choice in client-side scripting. I am at the whim of JavaScript which is pretty terrible. Of course, there is no hope of anyone producing a browser that offers an API, and a set of languages that can access that API. So it's just JS. That's fucked to me. I have more gripes but I'd like to keep this post short.\nOn the server side, it's easier. We have more choices, because our clients are not tied into a specific server technology; I used to write PHP, but since then I moved on to something that's a lot more thought out for serving webpages. MVC is the ideal for this kind of thing. The server will give the browser what it wants, and this does not concern the customer. On the browser end? We are screwed. There is quite likely nowhere to go.\nUnfortunately, we have four big companies (Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera) pouring in a lot of money to keep this technology afloat. And it's very sad. These companies should be leading the way, not holding back technology.</i><p>Glad to see things are moving forward. I hope this leads to a more general API later on down the road.",1304481189

The work they do is about 15-20 years ahead of the rest of the world. And it doesn't seem like work.<p>I can understand your financial situation. However, you DO get summers to work and make money. Once you have a school such as that AND projects that you mentioned on your resume, lucrative summer jobs will be easy to find. Trust me on that, I essentially work for 4 months then go to school for 4 months.<p>Also, credit history aside, make sure you atleast apply for student loans.

It doesn't claim to be an implementation of ECMAScript Harmony, though it looks similar to one. The choice of a non-ECMAScript media type (text/traceur instead of application/ecmascript;version=harmony or something similar) lends me to believe that they want to create a new language entirely. Also, text/traceur doesn't isn't registered, so the private type, text/x-traceur should be used instead. It's unfortunate that library authors completely disregard media type registration nowadays. In order for text/traceur to be registered, there actually has to be a formal specification of the Traceur format, since it's on the standards tree.<p>It's great to see work in making Harmony more accessible to everyone, but it doesn't make sense to make it another language.",1304481098

Consider the list of TorButton bugs that have already been fixed: <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?group=priority&component=Torbutton&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&col=points&report=14&type=defect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?group=priorit...</a> How much would you bet that there isn't at least one more anonymity-compromising bug in there?<p>The new design seems much less Rube-Goldbergy. That said, I still think this style of interface offers only quite casual protection, since it relies on (the forked version of) Firefox not having any bugs that leak information. So any adversary who has enough resources to obtain a zero-day Firefox exploit that allows arbitrary code execution is able to completely deanonymize you. This is probably good enough for e.g. the masses in Iran, but not for would-be Wikileakers.<p>What I really would like to see is a virtual machine setup that lets you run your webbrowers in a VM, and provides the guest OS with a simulated network interface which actually connects through Tor. That would make for a much smaller attack surface. But last time I looked, I couldn't find one.",1304480952

The big downside is that it assumes a prior knowledge of JS, so you'll still need other resources to really learn what's possible with JS/CS.<p>And my even more niche advice is that, for me, what really built up my momentum was to rewrite someone else's JS site in coffeescript. It's definitely a roundabout way of learning, but I basically got to learn coffeescript and javascript at the same time as I pored over this other person's code line by line as I rewrote it.<p>I don't know how common my syntax ""hang-up"" is, but if you do start looking at other languages, I would advise that you seek out sample programs so you can get familiar with what the syntax looks like.
