2590386,comment,2588262,2589822,4,0,jessedhillon,,,"The only reason why you don't need super in Go is because you cannot embed multiple interfaces <i>except</i> if their sets of methods are disjoint. This eliminates super's job of allowing programmers to differentiate between base classes with conflicting method implementations.<p>Without this, Go requires you to design your class hierarchy in a way that is cleaner, but the super concept is still not superfluous -- because you do sometimes need to reference an ancestor's implementation in Go.<p>You embed an interface and then explicitly reference the embedded interface by name. The Go interface<p><pre><code>  type ReaderWriter interface {
    Reader
    Writer
  }
</code></pre>
is exactly like this Python<p><pre><code>  class ReaderWriter(Reader, Writer):
    pass
</code></pre>
To get at a particular superclass implementation, you pass the class to super, like so:<p><pre><code>  def read_and_write(self):
    super(Reader).read()
    super(Writer).write()
</code></pre>
which in Go is:<p><pre><code>  func (rw *ReaderWriter) ReadAndWrite() {
    rw.Reader.read()
    rw.Writer.write()
  }

</code></pre>
So it's not superfluous -- there's an equivalent syntax to super which involves referencing embedded interfaces.",1306468730

This is business, I understand why their policies are what they are, and I'm prepared for the chance that they may choose to stop doing business with me at some point in time.

I aim to do more and more of my production code in Fexl if possible.  The hedge fund accounting software I wrote in Perl is quite complex, managing a large amount of intricate state.  I chose to represent all that state as a completely flat key-value store in memory, where I write out the keys that changed at the end of each batch.<p>Naturally that approach seems at odds with a purely functional language such as Fexl, but I'm trying to overcome that apparent mismatch by just doing the key-value stuff in Fexl.<p>There are some fans of Fexl out there, myself included, who are not yet completely clear on how to use it for production code.  The jury's still out.  I hope that samples like this will help.",1306465910

2590306,comment,2589440,2590191,6,0,barrkel,,,"Prison: rehabilitation, punishment, deterrent, segregation. Punishment is largely about the victims, justice being seen to be done, etc.; it shouldn't affect crime rates in ways that don't also come under rehabilitation or deterrence. Segregation (keeping dangerous people apart from the main population) is not relevant to our discussion here, I think.<p>Is slave labour rehabilitating? More or less rehabilitating than productive labour? A net wash? I personally think education would be more rehabilitating. Perhaps that can be combined with labour? Probably not chain-gang type labour though.<p>Deterrence, I'm more skeptical of. I don't think prison time has a lot of net impact on crime. Someone on the point of committing a crime, but with their rational thinking cap on, may be evaluating their expected punishment; but that expected punishment will be moderated by their expected chances of getting caught. Obviously, if they expect to get caught, they would not rationally choose to commit a crime; therefore, very drastic changes in punishments need to be applied in order to stay significant after the criminal has taken into account the chances of being caught. (Yes, there's risk / reward calculations where very high rewards may justify taking higher risks so the expected punishment has higher effects, but I think big bank robberies etc. are not the majority of crime we need to be worried about, at least outside of white collar crime, which does need more focus.)<p>And that's all with the rational thinking cap on. Other crimes where rationality appears to be less evident - I'd guess most non-organized violence, for example - the punishment is very far from mind, if it's in mind at all.<p>I think if you're truly interested in reducing crime rates, what you have to focus on is increasing the probability of criminals getting caught and convicted, so that deterrence is credible. Reducing repeat offenders requires more focus on rehabilitation. Fiddling with the punishment in and of itself is, IMO, unlikely to have a large impact unless it's a disproportionate change, which would make it unjust.",1306465648
