There's much less network latency when the edge locations are closer to the end user. There are dozens of good DNS providers out there. We currently use DNS Made Easy, and we're thinking about using Amazon Route 53 as well.<p>If you have multiple web servers servers in different locations, you might be thinking of ""Geo-DNS"" -- this actually directs the end user to the nearest web server. There are pros and cons to this approach, namely that the end user may be using an intermediary DNS server that's not actually very close to the user. For example, you might end up sending all Comcast users to your east coast USA server, no matter where in the USA they actually are.

If I were to take my interpretation of software being unpatentable to the absolute extreme, I would say that the microcode in modern CISCy CPUs would also be unpatentable. This could lead to an interpretation where CPUs are also not patentable.<p>I had an inkling feeling that the software/mathematics argument is not compelling (not because software isn't mathematics, but because the practicality of invention and patent render it different in practice), but couldn't articulate it.<p>I still think that software patents have turned out to be dangerously unproductive in practice and so would rather see them abolished entirely than in their current form, but I think I more fully understand my position now.

2555650,comment,2554909,2554909,6,0,hncommenter13,,,"I grew up in Clayton, MO, and this is the former St. Louis Bread Co (now Panera) that I have been going to since the early 90s.  I live in SF, but I go back there several times a year, and I have been to this store since it went to its current pay-what-you want model.<p>A few observations:\n1. As the article indicates, the system is really confusing.  People who haven't been there before have no idea what's going on.  They ring up the total amount as if you were purchasing the food normally, and then it's up to you what to do.  If you decide to pay, they can make you change.  For example (IIRC), your sandwich is $7.50, you put $10 into a little donation box, and they give you change of $2.50. The first few times I went I wasn't sure what to do.<p>2. It's in a fairly nice area of St. Louis (right across from the county courts+jail as well as several small high-rise office towers). There isn't a huge homeless problem like you would have in downtown SF, where it would effectively be a soup kitchen.<p>3. The neighboring businesses hated it--they viewed it as a big chain driving them out of business by undercutting prices on lunch.  One business on the same block posted a big sign in its front window protesting the move.  I don't know if any competitors have actually closed as a result, but they certainly didn't like the idea.<p>4. This location of BreadCo/Panera has always had low-price day-old bread and pastries available, iirc.  They are now pay-what-you-want, which means mostly free.  They keep bags of them by the door, and I have seen folks (most of whom look like they need it) take them.<p>Having been there a few times and as a fan of STL Bread Co, it's hard for me to believe that this would work on a large scale.",1305618412

2555601,comment,2554807,2555158,12,0,martinkallstrom,,,"I started my first company, a web consultancy firm, seven years ago. I also have a daughter who is seven years old, Linn. I started out of my home office, which allowed me to spend time with my family while being at work. It was great but became stressful after 6-12 months because I felt I was at work all the time except when I left my home. I then moved into a proper office.<p>I started my second company five years ago. I also have a second daughter who is five years old, Julia. This company was a much more serious venture. I was appointed CEO, we were four founders and raised 1M€. We all worked long hours and had a great time from the start. Now we are ten employees and I'm still the CEO.<p>Here are the immediate effects I have seen from starting a new company simultaneously with getting a kid, twice:<p>- You focus on the business model and sales, sales, sales rather than just cool tech, which is beneficial for everybody involved. However, there is always room for cool tech as well.<p>- You have to push yourself to get to work, and do good stuff everyday. Because your family depends on it. You don't settle for mediocrity.<p>- You get a counter-balance that keeps you in check. Especially when you are successful with doing something fun it is very easy to burn out. Out of four founders, two of us have kids while the other two didn't at the time. I'm sorry to say that those two burned out and left the company, while me and my other child-bearing co-founder remained.<p>- You raise kids that get an entrepreneurial outlook on life. They think it is natural to have your own company, to be the boss of your own life.<p>- If you are blessed with healthy kids, having them is hardest work in the beginning. Everything gets easier and easier from day one. At least so far.<p>All in all, I don't regret for a second my choices the past years. Because what are the alternatives? Not having these awesome kids that now rock my world? Not having started these awesome companies that have defined a lot of who I am today? No way.<p>If you get the opportunity to start a family with someone you love and who supports you, don't hesitate for a second. If you get the opportunity to start a company with people you'd love to work with, don't hesitate for a second.<p>If those two happen to you at the same time? Wow, you are truly blessed with good fortune! Go kick some major ass!",1305616453

2555592,comment,2548069,2554376,1,0,cwp,,,"Oops, I guess my original question was a bit misleading. The blog post I was trying to dig up organized the company with a US parent in order to be friendly to US investors, but that's not the issue that concerns <i>me</i>.<p>The problem is that I'm a US citizen starting a Canadian company. The US has laws that are designed to prevent people from running all their income through foreign companies as a tax dodge. (See, for example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_foreign_investment_company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_foreign_investment_comp...</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Foreign_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Foreign_Corporation</a>). I say ""minefield"" because the application of these laws depends on subtleties of accounting and tax filings (not my strong suit), and the cost of screwing is are potentially quite high. (Eg, the IRS might decide that I should pay personal income tax on my company's gross revenue.)<p>Now, it's not completely untenable; I do know a couple of people with US citizenship that have started Canadian companies and haven't had any real problems. However, I'm thinking it might be easier and safer to have a US entity other than my personal self own the foreign corporation. Right now I'm trying to figure out what's involved in setting up such a structure and whether or not it will actually help.<p>Anyway, thanks for the response and congratulations on your success!
