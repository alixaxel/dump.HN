2524277,comment,2523583,2523583,5,0,Ras_,,,"'Taxi wars' is also current in Finland. Few young entrepreneurs tried to enter the market with moped-car taxis. Those teens were immediately choked out of existence with heavy handed bureaucracy. We've also had Maxi Taxis (a more serious venture), which entered the streets of Helsinki unannounced. They were trying to exploit a loophole (minivans registered as trucks) in the legislation. Besides heavy lobbying against them, they were constantly harassed and even physically blocked by taxis and their drivers (very radical approach in regards to current Finnish society). Maxi Taxis folded quickly as the legal loophole was closed in record time.<p>Our taxi licenses are cheap, but supply is artificially restricted. The Ministry of Interior decides how many taxis can operate in each town. Taxi licenses cost about 300 euros; processing expenses. Toughest prerequisite is a short (few weeks, cost less than 1k euros) taxi-entrepreneur course.<p>The Ministry of Interior resorts to micromanagement. They set the maximum number of licenses for each and every town based on estimated need (which is quite sensitive to lobbying). For example the current maximum number of licenses in Helsinki is 1386 (for a population of 590k). In 2008 100 new Helsinki-licenses were issued, and just as anamax commented above: It was protested with an argument ""Cabbies don't make a ""living wage"" as it is"". This number was reduced by 51 in 2010.<p>There are queues, but they are generally not very long (in Helsinki you might need to wait for 10 years, but many smaller towns have free spots which you can claim without delay). You can drive a taxi as a hired man as the license is vehicle-, not person-specific. Hired man gets paid about 30-40% of the turnover of his rides.<p>Both the number of licenses and fare rates are national monopolies. A ride of similar length costs the same in Helsinki as it does everywhere else. Rates are set by the Ministry of Interior.<p>No price competition and artificially restricted entry to market. Friction with modern society: heavy. Taxi monopoly might not be the first to fall, since we still have, e.g. state monopolies on gambling and liquor. Of these, the former could end soon thanks to the EU.",1304793651

The system is huge and complex due to the fact that it stretches LLVM far beyond what it was meant to handle. For example, LLVM was never designed to have platform-independent bitcode; to make it work they basically had to find ways to make the x86 data layout sorta work for all platforms. Additionally, LLVM bitcode is <i>huge</i>; it was designed to be an intermediate language for compilers, not a packaging mechanism for application distribution.<p>If we were to use PNaCl, even once Google sorts out all the technical issues, in order to compete with native mobile apps, a whole ecosystem of toolkits and libraries will have to be created. That will take time, and we will see growing pains just like the ones we're seeing with mobile app frameworks for JavaScript.<p>Compare this to the status quo with JS. In two years, JavaScript will be as fast as NaCl for 90% of applications out there. Look at the speed of LuaJIT, which is the closest cousin to the modern JS engines, compared to C [1]. And this is on scientific number-crunching microbenchmarks! We don't have to throw away the lingua franca of the web in order to achieve good performance.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2009-06/msg00071.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2009-06/msg00071.html</a>",1304792707

(capitalization in the paper) Post-colonic: ""What drives it and how can policy tackle it?"" (I had to decapitalize.)<p>The paper explores a large number of factors, but it is diffult to see how the base premise is anything other than Inequality needs to be 'tackled'.  Where destruction of the middle class is happening, that needs to be tackled.  Extreme poverty needs to be tackled. Creation of a middle class in countries that lack it needs to be tackled. Inequality, however, is a metric, and one that is oblivious to whether things are getting better or worse. Successfully tackling inequality says nothing about whether the lives of people have gotten better or worse, it merely tracks uniformity of outcome.<p>I'm very supportive of policies that prevent social instablity, and poor outcomes.  My libertarian streak is weak at best, and centered around a distaste for government interfering in social policy.  I'm unhappy with framing this metric as problem, because it easily falls into the trap of helping make people unhappy with otherwise good outcomes. The metric used is inherently oblivous to outcomes that I think matter.<p>Churchill's ""The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.""  applies here.<p>I can agree we should have distributive tax policies due to falling real wages at the bottom, yet that point is obliterated by starting the debate with a relative metric that I do not agree should drive the policy.",1304791860

This shows a) commitment to wanting to work here, and b) shows that you can sole the kinds of problems we had to face before.<p>You know your version control, where someone had to go in and fix some bugs?
