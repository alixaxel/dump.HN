The cost for a qualified IP contract attorney to do an adequate document review of this document and explain its consequences to a typical member of the public that it is imposed upon would be more than $1000 per review. That would be necessary to enable informed signing.<p>We need laws getting this under control. These contracts should not be binding. The consumer side has no chance of understanding them even when they do read the documents. That means there is no real consent and no real moral contract. If companies insist on these extremely complex contracts for routine transactions, the companies should pay the full cost of legal representation for the other party.",1304827044

2525190,comment,2523758,2523758,2,0,dad,,,"There was a very good talk about this at #nodeconf this week by Tom from Joyent.  The basic summary was that threaded network servers, like Apache, say, approach the speed problem by ""pre-allocating"" resources, a chunk for each thread/instance. The issue is that there are a finite number of resources on each machine (RAM mostly), and blocked threads are eating up a slice of those resources even when doing <i>no work</i>.  This sets the upper bound of number of simultaneous connections that can be handled.<p>In an event based system the overhead for each connection is at least three orders of magnitude lower, sometimes four or five (hope I'm remembering this right).  This translates into _considerable_ increase in number of connections that can be handled simultaneously, not quite the equivalent number of orders of magnitude due to other aspects of the system becoming more of the bottle-necks, but still dramatic.<p>This was a data-driven observation, not conjecture or assertion.  I listened in during a break while the nodejs guys argued about approaches to getting TLS working better - they were worrying about the 1MB overhead for a TLS connection because that's a significant percentage of a connection handler.  Think about that for a minute in the context of an apache threaded instance.  1MB matters? wow!<p>I'm new to this area and this was very interesting stuff and seemed related to the various discussions below about a threaded system can do what an event based system can do.",1304825840

But even if you do that, you are still vulnerable.<p>Inside on* handlers and style attributes, the rules are different. Take something like this:<p><?php $foo = htmlspecialchars($_GET['foo'], ENT_QUOTES);?>
<a href="""" onmouseover=""a='Fantas<?php echo $foo?>tic';"">Mouse Over Me</a><p>htmlspecialchars() does its job here. It turns a single quote into &#039; however, inside on* and style attributes the &#039; entity is treated as a raw single quote. You need to double-escape in this particular case to be safe, or better yet, don't use raw on* handlers and style attributes. There are much cleaner ways to do those, but if you have to, don't ever put user data in them because you will mess up the escaping.<p>You can try a live example here:<p><a href=""http://talks.php.net/show/flux/14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.php.net/show/flux/14</a><p>It is not possible to write a single generic html escaping function that will work in all contexts.  If it was, I would have written htmlspecialchars() differently.<p>There are more examples of how you can mess up even if you always quote your attributes if your escaping function isn't smart. The UTF-7 hack was mentioned, which is good, but the invalid UTF-8 hack wasn't explained. That is, if you send an invalid UTF-8 sequence, like %E0 then certain browsers (well, just IE) will lose their minds unless you make sure you don't display that invalid UTF-8 sequence back to the user. So htmlspecialchars() does more than just escape the set of chars you mentioned, it also validates the characters and makes sure it never outputs an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.<p>0xE0 by itself is the first byte of a 3-byte UTF-8 char and IE will simply eat the following 2 bytes to make up the char. So if you output: ""<e0>""> even though the byte is inside quotes, IE will eat the following ""> and replace those 3 bytes with the dreaded (?) char, but more disastrously it will think it is still inside the quoted attribute so the next raw quote it sees will end the attribute and you have yourself another quoted xss hole.",1304825584

I want a system in place that will help them realize their potential.  There are plenty of authors who are now considered iconic, who had very rough starts and only realized their potential because someone in the publishing industry spent a lot of time and money helping them develop.  Frank Herbert is a prime example of this.  Despite all of the mentoring he got from experienced editors, he certainly broke a lot of new ground, so I'm really not all that concerned that ""unleashing experienced editors on new authors probably reduces variability in writing.""  Mentoring is all about helping other people develop, and part of being a good mentor is understanding that you're there to facilitate growth, not direct it.  We might get a little bit more uniformity from having editors mentor new writers, but I think that's far better than losing great works because they are never written when new authors have no choice but to jump right in to the sink-or-swim world of self-publishing.<p>Consider an author who has great potential, who will, given enough development, write bestselling novels.  Unfortunately, he's still too inexperienced and his current work could be described at best as mediocre.
If he tries to self-publish, his books will be (rightfully) criticized as being not worth reading.  He will not make any money, and will likely be forced to give up writing and take up another profession.  If he is especially persistent he might try again, but without a mentor his skills won't improve very quickly, and even if they did he still has to fight against his well-earned reputation as a second-rate hack.
On the other hand, if he sends his work to a traditional publisher, there is a chance that someone will see the potential in his work, pay him for the book, and work with him to improve it to the point where people will want to read it.  Then he'll get a crack at a second book, and the help he needs to make it better than his first.  In this way, he has a chance to grow into a truly great author.<p>As long as there are publishers who are able to successfully identify and develop such diamonds in the rough, and unless someone comes up with a different way to perform this task, the traditional publishers will not go away.  Even if they lose all of the authors who are good enough to jump right into self-publishing, that still leaves them with a significant role in the market, growing great authors.<p>I strongly suggest that you check out <i>Baen's Universe</i>: all of the issues are electronic and DRM free, and since publication has ceased, you can buy every issue ever for $30 (+ $6 for the very last issue).  Every issue has at least one (usually more) article about the publishing industry, usually focused on copyright and DRM.  The first issue includes an article explaining why the magazine was started, and it was to provide exactly the sort of development opportunities to new authors that I've been talking about here:

2525147,comment,2523758,2524401,0,0,rdtsc,,,"I guess ""blocking"" is overloaded here.  To me it refers to the process of performing IO, but you think about process states from the point of view of the scheduler (as in RUNNING state vs BLOCKING (or IOWAIT)).<p>Yes, if aio_* system was never invented, we wouldn't be arguing, but because it exists it introduces a new possible way of doing IO. It is a general enough way of doing IO and at hardware level we have DMA but in the land of syscalls we have aio_<i>.<p>Ok, just curious, what words would you use to describe what aio_</i> calls do?<p>Over the years many have thought of a way to bring that style of IO to networking. So far it works for disk IO very well. For example take a look at this benchmark from lighttpd for a sendfile:<p><a href=""http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/11/09/async-io-on-linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/11/09/async-io-on-lin...</a><p>It looks like there is a consistent 50% improvement in speed when using aio with a 1MB block.<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have that kind of improvement for network sockets as well? I think it would be and there have been many attempts over the years but nothing good yet has happened.",1304824391
