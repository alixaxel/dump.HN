By contrast, living organisms must function to a high degree in order to thrive during every developmental stage from a single-cell zygote to adult. The embryo as a whole must be a fully functioning system in its specific environment during every second of its entire development.

Simply not true. At the end of the day you need to change Bitcoins back to real money. The money that actually has some value because it (is supposed to) represents goods. The stuff you need in order to survive and live (food, clothes, ...).
Goverments can declare these ""banks"" that change bitcoins back to real money illegal - mabe because bitcoins can be used to launder money (because it's advantage is, that ""you can transfer any amount anywhere instantly without any authority knowing or interfering""). In this case all your money is worthless.

You can mutate classes at runtime, and even replace the class of an instance at runtime, OTOH Python cannot do the slot lookup optimization you speak of, due to its dynamical nature. Python shows that class-based inheritance is very useful (and easy to use) in a dynamic language.",1306675266

2596566,comment,2594521,2596545,10,0,jashkenas,,,"Yep, you've got that all about right.<p>There are a couple of fine points: In JS, using regular constructors, object slot lookups still tend to be O(1)-ish -- engines like V8 optimize the ""hidden class"" of the object by assuming that all instances share the same rough shape, with guard checks if you start to change your properties dynamically later.<p>Also, regular constructors in JS are much more memory-efficient than the popular alternative ""module pattern"", which looks like this:<p><pre><code>    var makePoint = function() {\n      var x, y;\n      return {\n        getX: function(){ ... },\n        getY: function(){ ... },\n        distance: function(){ ... }\n      };\n    };\n\n    var point = makePoint();\n</code></pre>\nBecause functions in JS are mutable objects with their own identity, guess what happens each time you create a point? You've just duplicated every function that the point uses as a method, including their closure. It gobbles up memory to the point where you can't make more than a few thousand instances of <i>any</i> object, no matter how small.<p>With ""new Point"", in JS, there's only ever one copy of the point's functions in use -- living on Point.prototype -- and all this is avoided.<p>Finally, class-based OO can be fully dynamic these days, it just depends on how you want to implement it: see Ruby, where any object can have a ""metaclass"" with its own complement of methods.",1306674571

It doesn't really add much. Once you get into the functional mindset, it becomes natural how this works, and the occasional place where you are forced to add a return statement becomes a place where there is almost certainly code smell. No returns is basically one of those constraints that helps guide you towards more functional code with fewer side effects.",1306674004
