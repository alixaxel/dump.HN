That is, I don't believe ""undefined behavior"" in the C Language exists for speed <i>as such</i>. Rather, undefined behavior is machine-specific behavior and it exists in C so the programmer can write machine specific code, the C Language being a ""high-level assembly language"" or ""system-programmer's Swiss army knife"". Speed is one outcome, certainly but there are other ways to get speed (a Just In Time Compile can come at least close naive c code). The <i>point</i> isn't speed. The <i>point</i> is ""do anything"", the point is that a chip designer can write c code and look on his screen to see the resulting assembler and decide where to go from there.<p>It may be the llvm folks bypass this point because llvm is ""virtual machine"" rather than a chip. But it is slight annoying not to mention this if ""What Every C Programmer Should Know""<p>Perhaps they should have called their article ""what C-programmers should know about optimizing compilers...""",1306032504

Small teams will value flexibility a lot more than larger companies.  The bias I would have against non-bay-area non-startup people is that they might not be as much ""self starters"" or otherwise flexible.<p>I'm sure you can convince them of your technical competence and soft skills, so maybe focus on flexibility and being willing to do what is necessary.  Plus, demonstrating your actual familiar with and love of their product and market.<p>It's a ""sellers market"" for tech talent in the bay area, so I think you've got a good shot.",1306030119

I can blow up the type size and read in less light than I need for a real book, without having a glowing backlight. They're only $140 which I made up in saved newspaper and magazine costs in about two months.<p>You do need to be more careful with moisture and dropping damage than with a book. (Buy the warranty.)
