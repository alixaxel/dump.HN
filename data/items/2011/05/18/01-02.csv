There's a lot of irony in that too considering that when I need a b-tree, I Google it.<p>It would be funny to bring an Android phone to a Google interview and then proceed to Google answers for questions they ask like this to point out how outdated the question is.<p>If it's anything like interviews at my company, we just aren't really trained on how to interview, so these questions come up because the interviewer may not know what to ask aside from things like this, and their last interview experience may have been when looking for a job straight out of college when this was all they really knew about, so this is what interviewers asked them about. In a way those questions may just be ""what you're supposed to ask someone in a CS related interview"".",1305683686

2558762,comment,2558625,2558703,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"At no salary, 7.5 is small.<p>What you should do is come up with fair salaries and rate each person's work accordingly. What I mean is this. Let's say that you're 30 and fairly senior with a moderate amount of team lead experience-- $150,000 / year-- and have been working for 18 months. Your junior co-founder, who's just out of college-- $80,000 / year-- has been working for 12 months. So your investment (opportunity cost) is $225,000 and his is $80,000. The market valuation of the company may or may not be $305,000... it could be effectively zero, or it could be an order of magnitude higher, but this gives you a sense of what the proportions should be. The younger person should have 80/225 of what you have. If he stays longer, that number should evolve in his favor, which is one of the things vesting is for.<p>Of course, it's not clear what these time-of-stay amounts will be from the outset, which is why you need vesting and other provisions.<p>In your situation, rate yourself around $120,000/year (intermediate seniority with a promising product) and a promising, out-of-college programmer around $90,000/year. You're not going to actually pay these amounts to anyone, but these numbers should be the basis for equity amounts. Also scale for above-board effort, giving a 1.5 multiplier on people who really give their all (set aside some equity for this).",1305683657

2558681,comment,2558250,2558622,22,0,rbranson,,,"It's already hard enough to run a reliable mobile data network built with industrial-grade systems on exclusive spectrum. Unfortunately, moving to a network like you describe, built on commodity gear doesn't translate to quality, redundancy, and scalability like it does with distributed systems.<p>Major cell companies are already doing what you describe. Example: both Verizon and AT&T have a fleet of mobile cell towers mounted on the back of trucks they park at large events if they think capacity is going to be an issue. If you look around at building tops in cities, you'll see arrays of panel antennas on many of them. These are for cell networks. Every site is intentionally designed and every single antenna is specifically angled and tuned, and their network engineers collect quality statistics from every call at every site, which are fed into massive data warehouses for quality analysis. They literally have fleets of people like ""the Verizon guy"" continuously drive testing their networks.<p>If anyone knows how to run mobile data networks, it's them. Seriously, network engineers at companies like Verizon are treated like software engineers at Google and Facebook. They keep the core business running and they are the rockstars. Everyone else, including the jerk in customer service, is basically a nobody.<p>From what I can tell, there is a sort of strange, pervasive myth on the Internet that the large cellcos have their heads up their asses and that somewhere, somehow, there is a kind of wild band of rebels with hacked 2.4GHz/5GHz mesh network gear and cantennas doing it for dirt cheap.<p>Please show me even the smallest evidence that anyone, anywhere is running a true mobile data network using a mesh network on commodity gear. This means continuous coverage for a metro area with low power, cheap, antenna-integrated MOBILE consumer gear, seamless site-to-site and channel-to-channel handoff from users moving at 80mph, high quality indoor coverage in large buildings that is basically taken for granted, ramp-ups/downs of 10k+ customers within hours (sports events, etc)... and on and on.<p>You'll find a few WISPs doing fixed site-to-site links and (poorly) blanketing areas with WiFi coverage, but nothing on the order of what cellcos do. The fact that one can hold a uninterrupted voice conversation using a $5 phone with no visible antenna while driving down the interstate at 75mph for hundreds of miles is a pretty awesome modern marvel.",1305681511

So if you are charging 100 USD a hour, and expect it will take 100 hours, you would be billing for 10,000USD.  Rather simple so far.  Then determine how you would like to be paid.  Common models are 50% up front, the rest on delivery; 100% on delivery (usually for F500 firms); or 100% upfront.   Billing by the hour, will annoy your clients unless the amounts are small.
