2502907,comment,2491725,2502876,2,0,bulknews,,,"> while (my $req = CGI::Fast->new) { myApp->run($req); }
> Is there a handler/wrapper for that?<p>Assuming that while loop is in your bootstrap FastCGI script, you can instead have an app.psgi (or whatever named) file with the content:<p><pre><code>    use CGI::PSGI;
    my $app = sub { my $req = CGI::PSGI->new(shift); myApp->run_psgi($req) };
</code></pre>
Now your new `run_psgi()` method should return the [ $status, $headers, $body ] array reference, instead of printing them to the STDOUT. And then the app.psgi can be run from CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl, Starman, Twiggy or whatever PSGI supported web servers.<p>For most web frameworks, the change should be minimal and straightforward: for example, CGI::Application needed less than 10 lines of code to implement this.
<a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI-Application-PSGI-1.00/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI-Application-PSGI-1.00/</a><p>(I implemented the original code, and markstos, the maintainer of CGI.pm and CGIApp now took it over. As you can see there's a small hack to capture the output - they're working on removing this hack by implementing the PSGI natively inside the CGIApp codebase)<p>>  WebGUI discovered FastCGI via a PSGI implementation but it's FastCGI who brought the speed,<p>No, they got a performance boost with our preforking standalone HTTP server, which is currently called Starman, not just FastCGI.<p>Speaking of FastCGI, although Plack has a FCGI.pm-based FastCGI handler, i've been working on another FastCGI based preforking PSGI server called fastpass. <a href=""https://github.com/miyagawa/fastpass"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/miyagawa/fastpass</a><p>It is XS dependency free (unlike FCGI.pm and CGI::Fast) and the performance is still the same with FCGI.pm, roughly like 4000 requests per second on my laptop, with a simple HelloWorld app via an nginx frontend. I guess we could do even better by doing optional XS parsing with pure perl fallback as well.<p>FWIW for a comparison, with Starman I get 7k and Feersum gets 9k requests per second on the same machine. (Of course the number is not <i>that</i> significant since in the real world, your application does more IOs, templating stuff and database handling, and the qps would be much smaller)<p>Again, the nice thing about all of these things is that your code, and everyone else's code, don't need any line of code change to support this new server, once you get PSGI.<p>> In the meantime, I will try to play with it on my spare time. I guess it will be the easiest way to discover what I might be missing...<p>I'm pretty sure you will :)",1304250124

Furthermore, I have limited Haskel experience, so I'm struggling to read this. In particular, the use of symbols and overall terseness are hard to get through.

</code></pre>
I found something that reads ""This module describes a structure intermediate between a functor and a monad: it provides pure expressions and sequencing, but no binding. (Technically, a strong lax monoidal functor.)"" Which is so full of jargon, my head hurts. And I even know what most of that jargon means!<p>So as far as I can tell, here's what's going on....<p><pre><code>  Foo <$>
</code></pre>
Defines a grammar production using the left argument as a constructor on the matched value of the right argument.<p><pre><code>  <|>
</code></pre>
Separates productions as alternatives; in a PEG Grammer style. Both the <$> and <|> operators combine functions to result in a big master function that takes input and has the result type that is the big `one of A, B, C` algebraic type that is defined earlier: ""Value"".<p><pre><code>  char8
</code></pre>
Matches a literal character (passed as an argument).<p><pre><code>  char8 '(' *>
</code></pre>
Reads a parenthesis and throws it out of the result set. Similar for the close parenthesis later on.<p><pre><code>  takeWhile1 isSpace_w8
</code></pre>
Produces a parser that consumes whitespace.<p><pre><code>  sepBy value (takeWhile1 isSpace_w8)
</code></pre>
Combines to produce a parser which reads a list of values (recursive here) and presumably eliminates the separators from the result.<p><pre><code>  takeWhile1 isDigit_w8
</code></pre>
Similar story, reads an integer.<p><pre><code>  Number . fst . fromJust . B.readInteger
</code></pre>
Is a composed constructor that may or may not parse an integer, forcibly assumes it will succeed to parse one (which we know because we're reading digits). That integer parse stops when it hits a non-digit, and the unconsumed characters are returned as the second element of a tuple, so we call fst to take the first element of the tuple, discarding the unread characters (the main parser will consume those).<p><pre><code>  takeWhile1 (inClass ""A-Za-z\\-"")
</code></pre>
Similar story again to the whitespace and numbers.<p>OK, yeah, so.... amazing. Incredibly brilliant little bit of code. But holy hell was that tough to read. And I have no idea if I'd be able to write it in only a few hours. I'm far from certain I'd ever learn to write it as fast or faster than something more verbose.<p>Please let me know if I've misunderstood something....",1304249401

According to the scientists, the color blue automatically triggers associations with openness and sky, while red makes us think of danger and stop signs. (Such associations are culturally mediated, of course; Chinese, for instance, tend to associate red with prosperity and good luck.)<p>Let's understand that, while the article discusses scientific studies, the above explanations are merely guesses. I would suggest something different: red stands out so much to the human visual system because it is the color of two very important things that did <i>not</i> originate as culturally mediated associations: (1) blood, and (2) many kinds of ripe fruit. I leave it to the reader to speculate how this might translate into accuracy and attention to detail.",1304247669

2502854,comment,2502103,2502103,9,0,jinushaun,,,"Based on the comments, seems like most people's objections of Objective-C are really objections about C: header files, manual memory management, function pointers, strong type system, too low level, no native string object, etc. I grew up with C, so learning Objective-C took maybe 10 minutes because it's basically C with some extra syntax for OOP. In general, one only encounters the ""strange"" syntax when dealing with methods. I personally love the method syntax because it's basically self documenting.<p>Which leads me to wonder, how many programmers both on HN and in general know C? I'm too young to already be a dinosaur in this industry... Where did all the C programmers go? Seems like programmers nowadays started learning how to code with Java or Ruby/Python and expect all other languages to be just as high level. Objective-C <i>is</i> low level, which makes it harder, but doesn't make it suck.<p>As a language, I think Objective-C is a fine one, but I must admit that it is a ""dinosaur"". The real problem is OOP paradigm. Remember, back in the late 70s and early 80s, OOP was new and exciting and C was the dominant language. People were trying to figure out what OOP <i>should</i> look like and how to make C more OO. NextStep (Apple) just happened to bet on the wrong horse. Obj-C went with Smalltalk syntax, while the rest of the world went with C++ syntax and ultimately the Java style syntax we know and love today.Seems like some developers can't wrap their heads around a non-Java syntax for OOP.<p>All that said, Objective-C survives only because Apple hasn't chosen another language to replace it for Mac and iOS programming.",1304247625
