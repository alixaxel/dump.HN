There's an element in the video of the blog posts that always crop up after a popular AskHN. You know, like ""how do I find people to network with?"" followed by 3-10 days of ""23 ways to make new business contacts"" HN submissions (if you peruse /new, that is). The thing that unites most of the blog posts I'm casting aspersions upon is that they purport to be about something, or a list of things, but they wind up weaving those things throughout an ersatz narrative (""Once upon a time in the dark days of CompuServe..."") that obscures the clarity you'd think they'd be trying to give to a list of 23 closely related things. I dunno, maybe that's just me.<p>In short, stop telling me why I'm going to use it, your recommendation engine isn't that good yet.

But generally speaking, if you are willing to mortgage everything you can, those people can help you.<p>Next, there is the question of a job.   Do you have experience?  if not, you are going to have a damn difficult time getting $40K on just a part-time job, and right now is an especially difficult time for people without experience.   In the bay area, positions for people of your experience are around $30-$50k/year for full-time, at the high end.<p>I can tell you from experience that trying to go to school while working a full time job is extremely difficult.

Personally, I think things are a lot better now.<p>I've shot a fair number of pictures (about 17,000 is the current Lightroom count) and I've just gone through and scanned all my film shots from pre-digital days. My strategy then was to shoot a bunch of exposures, painstakingly writing down the shoot setup (aperture, exposure times, etc.) After developing, I'd have to go back over my notes, compare the results against my notes and try to learn from it. It was an extremely offline way of learning.<p>Compare that to how easy it is now: I get immediate feedback and can change the shot until I'm happy with the result. I may take more pictures now, but overall they are a lot better than my old film ones.<p>With current technology you can get a lot more experience shooting.

Old ideas persist across generations even today.  Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, etc. etc.<p>Second, new ideas are not necessarily valuable anyway.  Having just moved to the SF Bay Area, let new age religions and whatnot be exhibit #1.  There's something to be said for passing the test of time.<p>Third, your implicit assumption is that immortality would then prevent old ideas from being cleared out, which is not necessarily the case.  The reason why older people 'cling' to old ideas is that as we age our neural pathways become calcified along current paths and connections, making it more difficult to change our minds about something.  If aging were inhibited, presumably that problem would be one of the ones solved as well, so people's minds would remain as agile and flexible as they were in young adulthood, indefinitely, and hence able to change and adapt new ideas.",1304473546
