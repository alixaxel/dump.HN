I find this very challenging to read with the ads moving around & the toolbar at the bottom sliding in and out. Additionally, scribd opens the document at a zoom level too small to read.  When I click the zoom button, the ads overlap the document and I can't read it.  If I click the fullscreen button the scrolling is so jerky its very hard to consume.  So at least for me, the reading experience in Google Docs is superior to Scribd.<p>BTW this is on Chrome 12.0.742.60 on a new MBP.  Perhaps scribd is better optimized for other browsers/platforms.",1306115990

2574777,comment,2574505,2574653,17,0,vacri,,,"Different memory types resides in different parts of the brain. Driving is a classic example - when you first start, you're trying to keep it all in your mind at once, and it's living mostly in your short term / working memory, which tends to be in your frontal lobe (bit above your eyes). The more you use a physical skill, the more it gets into your ""muscle memory"" and this is in effect transferring to the cerebellum, the small plum-like 'add-on' at the base of the brain (below the knobbly bit at the back of the skull). It's quite common for memory damage to spare things like 'muscle memory', partly because it lives somewhere else. Another curiosity is that vocabulary is resistant to damage - if the person can still speak (which in turn can be prevented by a huge variety of neural injury), you can get an idea of the level of their pre-event education by listening to the level of words they use.<p>Neurology is fascinatingly complex and we've really only scratched the surface of what we can learn about the brain. It is very unlikely that you would hear anyone that worked in neurology flat-out refute any combination of symptoms. I used to work in a seizure clinic and heard of a guy that had a seizure when he saw orange circles. No other colour circle or other shape orange, just specifically orange circles. This was confirmed through EEG testing. Never heard of another case like it, but you get unique things like this reasonably often in neurology.",1306115777

I was wondering what was wrong with my post and appreciate any feedback that can help me provide better comments in the future.<p>In my experience, those who are passionate about a topic want to learn about all of the topics surrounding that topic. If you like to drive, you're probably going to want to know what makes a car tick and even get your hands dirty. I know that's not true of everyone, but generally speaking, I think it is.<p>You don't have to be passionate about driving to be a good driver. However, given the choice, why wouldn't you want to hire the guy who lives and breaths cars if they are also an excellent driver? Their additional skills will not hurt to have around, even if they are not directly applicable to the job at hand.<p>If you are at all interested in the job, you're going to apply no matter what the ad says is required. However, the long list of requirements gives you some insight into what the company does.

2574758,comment,2573656,2573656,5,0,keane,,,"I think the lesson to take away from this is ""Keep Your Head Down"". I have some respect for a number of libertarian ideas and I would never defend the treatment of Sonne by the police and State. Nor would I agree with the authoritarian comments made on the article that he somehow deserves the treatment that he is getting. But if someone attacks a beehive and then is stung, it seems like they should have known what might happen.<p>Sonne's actions of filming the security measures and his belief that this was an effective method of action were very naive. There are a number of reasons why.<p>To begin with, the G8 (rebranded as the G20) has long been protested and the police response can be brutal. A protestor, Carlo Giuliani, was shot and killed by police at the 27th G8 summit (the police were surprisingly found not responsible). A bystander, Ian Tomlinson, was beaten to death by riot police at the meeting of the group in London. The Miami Model is being expanded and police are becoming militarised, with Long Range Acoustic Devices used on protesters in the United States <a href=""http://youtu.be/QSMyY3_dmrM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/QSMyY3_dmrM</a> and similar pain rays <a href=""http://youtu.be/dmuyLIrSjxI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/dmuyLIrSjxI</a> tested on protestors in Iraq -- when these devices and Miami Model tactics are the routine at summits and simple protests, it is foolish to talk about ""civil liberties"" and ""civil rights"" and ""the Constitution"".<p>Consider the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, occurring nine months before the Toronto summit where Sonne had trouble. At Pittsburgh, military police make snatch-and-grab arrests - <a href=""http://youtu.be/G8CNa_viKg0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/G8CNa_viKg0</a> . Peaceful people are denied the right to assemble - <a href=""http://youtu.be/etv8YEqaWgA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/etv8YEqaWgA</a> and marches are deemed ""unlawful"" - <a href=""http://youtu.be/5k0Y7_5a5d0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/5k0Y7_5a5d0</a><p>To see this atmosphere and then 9 months later to attempt to challenge these same authoritarians by filming them, purposely provoking them, and having them ruin your life and then being surprised by this is as naive as the college kids who chant ""Let him go!"" (in that last video above) as police drag away their fellow marcher. Police do as they please, and they are supported by their district attorneys and courts. Get in their way or challenge their authority in any way and enjoy the inevitable.<p>Filming a fence does nothing to the agenda of the G20 and even if you are only protesting the spending of the city of Toronto, it likewise does nothing. Peaceful assemblies are mocked, derided, and ignored by the politicians and bureaucrats who make up the Department of Homeland Security and the City of Toronto. And those protestors who employ property destruction? Breaking the window of a Starbucks does nothing to the G20 and it does nothing to Starbucks who makes up the cost of the window in less than one second of worldwide sales. Burning a Toronto police car? The city could care less as they will simply send the bill to the taxpayer (you and your neighbors).<p>Opposing these people and their secuirty apparatus -whether by peacefully chanting feel good slogans from the Sixties or by ""exercising"" and flexing your ""civil liberties"" and natural rights by filming a fence- is futile. Additionally, they will not hesitate to ruin your life, nor feel any remorse for someone who opposed them.<p>Do not get in their way.",1306114886

2574720,comment,2573247,2573247,2,0,domador,,,"How large and economically-successful a startup are you interested in?<p>I'm bootstrapping a native-client-software-based business.  My business isn't successful yet, but we'll see how things play out in the next couple of years.  I'm hoping that though web-based apps are all the rage, there still exists a large-enough market for desktop software. My economic goals are modest (though a wildly-successful outcome wouldn't be unwelcome).<p>For several years I've kept up with many, very-helpful startup-related blogs and sites.  The vast majority of these recommend launching web-app-based startups.  Even one startup owner who had hybrid approach phased out his desktop version (<a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/09/05/desktop-aps-versus-web-a...</a>)  So why am I developing desktop apps?  The main reason is that I care passionately about user interfaces and the effect they have on my experience as a user.  There doesn't seem to be a very consistent UI for the Web as a platform, not as consistent a UI as exists for Windows, Mac OS or GNU/Linux distributions.  Web apps have their advantages, but UI-consistency isn't their strong suit (nor do I foresee this changing very soon).<p>A second reason for my focus on desktop apps is that I want to scratch my own itch and make programs that I want to use myself.  I want to write high-quality software that 1) aids me with tasks related to various personal interests and 2) is desktop software, if possible.  I want to exclusively produce ""dogfood"" (though not necessarily programmer tools).  Having myself as a target user fuels my motivation to get up and work hard on making a streamlined, powerful, easy-to-use product, since I'll be using it.  Yes, I'll still perform usability testing and try to understand my other target users.  However, I believe it can be helpful to be a target user myself.  I can't imagine how hard it must be to develop software for an unfamiliar field or making a program whose only value to me is as a source of income.  (By the way, having oneself as a target user is generally considered by startup bloggers to be a mistake.)<p>A third reason for my desktop-app obsession lies in the opportunities I see to leverage the advantages of native client applications.  Various articles lists the advantages of web apps.  However, desktop apps have their own particular advantages, though many desktop applications fail to leverage them.  I plan to keep identifying these advantages and capitalizing on them.  At the same time, there's a lot for client apps to learn from web apps (and I hope to internalize those lessons as well).<p>As you can see, I'm a bit of a contrarian and somewhat stubborn about this particular issue.  It may turn out to be my undoing.  (I hope otherwise, of course.)  Check up on me in a year or two...  In the meantime, be careful about any advice you may draw from what I just wrote.",1306113548

Losing them is like losing parts of yourself, and it's extremely disconcerting.<p>I'm only 29, but I've had a few points of memory loss (amongst other mental issues). You've done things, significant things even, but have zero recollection. I've had to go to my email and IM archives to verify events and convince myself that yes, they happened. It's shocking when you find out days or whole weeks have happened, yet they are just erased from your mind. Imagine if a family member asked you about your trip to X, a place you'd never gone, yet everyone acted as if you had. You'd laugh and think it a joke, until you realised it wasn't a joke - then how'd you feel?<p>Coupled with dementia and other symptoms of Alzheimer's (or another loss of mental function), it's no wonder some would want to kill themselves. Why would you want to live in a disjointed dream, perhaps with a constant sense that something is terribly wrong, but not understanding what's happening? Why would you want to destroy others' memories of you, by leaving them with years of ""not you""?<p>I probably have 2 or 3 decades before things are really bad (perhaps a lot more with advances in medicine and technology), but if I ever get too bad, I'm going out on the highest note possible.

Clearly that formula doesn't always work for everything but estimates are often off and things happen, you need to pivot, shit comes up and money runs dry, whatevers... So if you think it takes 3 months to launch, assume 6 but strive for 3 or sooner. If you think you got 12 months run way, assume 6 but strive for 12+. It'll help ground you in case shit happens. 6+ ideas is too many (but I think you already know that). Before jumping ship, I'd recommend getting somewhere with iteration, MVP, anything... that gives you indication that this is a good bet to jump ship for (to an extent).

2574702,comment,2573839,2573839,20,0,aliguori,,,"This is a very well known issue (at least among virtualization developers :-)).  ESX does a surprisingly good job handling this but both Xen and KVM are still trying to catch up here.<p>The issue is small packet performance.  You can isolate it pretty easily with netperf TCP_RR.  In order to send a packet, the hypervisor needs to switch from the guest, to the hypervisor, and in the case of Xen, to domain-0.  These switches are very expensive.<p>Normally, you don't notice this because almost all I/O in hypervisors is done with a data structure known as a lockless ring-queue.  These data structures are extremely efficient at batching requests in such a way as to minimize the overhead of world switching by trying to never do it.<p>But TCP_RR is the pathological test case for this.  No matter how smart the data structure is, you still end up taking one exit per packet.  In particular, with small packets, you've got multiple world switches to move a very small number of bytes (usually around 64).<p>There are ways to improve this (using things like adaptive polling) but this is still an area of active development.  I don't follow Xen too closely any more but we've got quite a few new things in KVM that help with this and I would expect dramatic improvements in the short term future.",1306112728

Given that, I think the thought processes behind each are very similar:<p>In programming, design is just as important as logic. Code not only needs to be functional, but it also needs to look good. A visually attractive codebase is much more maintainable due to the basic human response to beauty.<p>In design, logic is also just as important. When designing an interface, for example, you are constantly solving problems about how the user is going interact with the design. The process of getting there is exactly the same as solving a programming problem.<p>I think there is a lot of ebb and flow if you don't typecast yourself. As a young kid I was quite interested in the arts. I remember spending a lot of time drawing and honing my visual skills because that's what I enjoyed doing. As I got a little older, I became fascinated by logic problems, remember spending a lot of time learning how to program.<p>Interestingly, as it relates to this discussion, now that I have grown older still, I actually have become much more interested in business and is one of the reasons why I follow this website. While I've closed a few deals along the way, my business deal abilities definitely lag behind the aforementioned skill sets. That I chalk that up to being much less experienced, not because of any genetic hinderances, however.<p>It is of my opinion that the biggest limiting factor is time. I was, perhaps, lucky that I started young which afforded me more time to put focus on both design and programming. Whereas for someone else who started programming in college it becomes difficult to fit in time for other interests, such as learning design. I know I spend less time doing business type work than I would otherwise like to because my plate is already full with other jobs. Because of that I miss the opportunity to grow in that area.",1306112617
