It's amazing how fine-tuned an intuition one develops after a while for code one's looking at when its structure isn't distorted by extraneous demands of the language. In Lisp, I find I am frequently (and often subliminally) processing visual cues to figure out what I'm looking at, prior to parsing what the text says, which is a slower thing to do.<p>Actually, you get the same effect in any language. You can tell a lot about, say, a Java program by printing it out, sticking the printout on a wall, and walking back 10 feet. But Lisp's regularity makes this effect richer, more powerful, and workable-with at much smaller scale.<p>Unfamiliarity reactions are not properties of the unfamiliar thing.

I haven't logged on for a while, but when I was involved a few years ago I had a great time building multi-agent systems inside of SL and pushing the limits of what their environment can do.  For example, here is a multi-agent ant simulation I did a few years ago: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehEzRUu4_RM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehEzRUu4_RM</a>  I also wrote self-synchronizing virtual fireflies and physics simulations.<p>For a programmer, it's a 3D, multi-user IDE where you can learn new programming techniques in real time with your friends.  Yes, people also use it for weird things and porn (unlike the rest of the Internet).  But there's quite a lot of genuine art, talent, and learning going on in there as well, and I still think it holds a lot of potential as a medium to teach people to program while ""playing a game.""",1306131284

Basketball wouldn't be all that interesting if you could just do whatever you wanted; oil painting is more interesting than photography because it is so much harder than pointing and clicking (sorry for the cheapshot, but you see my point); automatically generated music is never as cool as something that sounds like the composer struggled to make it happen.  I think we re-live the creative process with its challenges when we experience real art (you can feel the challenge in a hard guitar solo, for instance); if there is no challenge for the creator, there is no human experience for the audience to share.
