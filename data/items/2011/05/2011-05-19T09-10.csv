The most innovative line of smart phones in current century is solely designed and marketed by Apple Inc. and manufactured by Foxconn. A single gadget combining the power of various new features provided an advanced idea which created  massive changes in the mobile world. The idea of the Apple smart phone first time came to existence when Steve Jobs the CEO of Apple Inc. asked their engineers  to think about multi-touch touchscreen enabled display through which users can type directly onto the screen as a step to remove the physical keypad presented with most of the smart phones.<p>The 2G network supportive design of the gadget consists of an 89 mm TFT capacitive touchscreen display with a good resolution of 320x480 pixels which has been the most attractive display ever produced till date along with perfect outdoor viewing as well. It also comes with five physical buttons that have remained same over next  generations, even with the recently launched iphone 4. The multimedia enable phone also has software support to run various applications which came up for the first time with the launch of the Apple smart phone. Scratch-resistant surface with lots of inbuilt sensor like proximity sensors enabling auto turn off abilities, accelerometer sensor for auto-rotating feature of the display and ambient light sensor makes it the most valuable and revolutionary mobile phone powering up your hand. The orientation sensor utilized while browsing with Safari web browser is also well provided with the gadget.<p>Iphone came up with the industrial design in smart phones for the first time which made it the most beautiful gadgets ever seen. The rear side possess the 2 mega pixel snapper with the impressive Apple logo and the curved approach of the gadget provides a more comfortable grip to the gadget. The included charging dock also excels in standard with a sturdy approach. Call functions have been divided up into various categories for better performance with decent sound quality while making a call. It has also come up with numerous applications available at the App store for advanced utilities. Though being simple, the gadget has put forth high features embedded depicting advanced mobile technology and creating a revolution worldwide.",1305799067
2563432,comment,2561121,2561365,1,0,dspillett,,,"Is it really Google's responsibility though? You'll already be getting emails from your registrar telling you that the domain is about to expire. And it isn't just Google, any service that is linked to another account/service in this way would be vulnerable, so the headline should be ""don't let X expire while you have important stuff in Y that can be accessed through it"".<p>That said, a warning message on login would be nice. They could check the whois records on initial registration to see when the domain is due to expire, and verify that (in case it has been extended) before giving a warning.<p>There is an easy way to detect a domain expiring that would stop accidental access to data like this by new domain owners. IIRC on signup for Google's apps you add a TXT record to the domain to prove that you control it - if a domain is expired and renewed by someone else then this TXT record will be gone. Again there is no need to check on every login, just when the domain is due to have expired. Of course this does not protect against intentional access, as the TXT record could be remembered and re-entered by the attacker if they are registering the name specifically to get access to the data on accounts like Google apps.",1305799062

2563423,comment,2561354,2562565,1,0,hasenj,,,"This subject is just too philosophical for a HN comment, but I think there are at least a few problems with this argument.<p>First of all, almost by definition, we can't really look at anything that's not materialistic; it's just a limitation.<p>For instance, there's no way to prove or disprove the existence of awareness in something or someone. If a robot walks like humans, looks like humans, is it a human? Does it experience anything? Do insects have consciousness? Do animals have it? Does anyone besides me have it? Who says even <i>I</i> have it? How can we test for it? Can we even define it? Who says that my computer mouse doesn't have it?<p>Second, I believe that we only know a tiny fraction of what's out there, or of what's there to know, so it's hard to say that there's nothing beyond matter. And who even says that everything we looked at is materialistic? Is time materialistic? Can it be made from something else?<p>Third, there's nothing materialistic about awareness. It's not as though we can say ""it's like a computer program, just more complicated"". We can't say that emotions are like variables that control the behavior of a program.<p>Do you know any reason why awareness might be materialistic?",1305798671
