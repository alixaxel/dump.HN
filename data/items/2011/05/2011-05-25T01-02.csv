Even with LTE just around the corner, richer multimedia at higher resolutions will partially offset those gains.<p>Note that according to Nielsen's Law bandwidth growth rate, while sill exponential, is slower than Moore's Law (transistor count) and Kryder's Law (disk space), so we will be increasingly bandwidth limited as time continues [1]. For an example just look at SSD hard drives. To overcome bandwidth limitations the best SSDs now have whole ARM based computers in them to compress data on the fly, reorder operations on the fly, and run its own garbage collection programs just to save from going over the already very fast SATA bus which the latest drives fully saturate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen%27s_Law#Contributions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen%27s_Law#Contributions</a>",1306288753

On the other hand, a cursory examination of his comments would show that every response to ""the benefit of a humanities education is X"" is met with a reaction with something of the form ""engineering students can also do X"" (meaning that they are physically capable of doing it).<p>This reaction occurs regardless of the merits of the initial claim, and without a basic examination of its points. He then delves into what I can only call a petty dissection of the semantics of the argument. If I had said that a benefit of my education was the prominent role of public speaking and debate, no doubt that would immediately have been met by a predictable, worthless (in the literal sense of providing no value) rejoinder: CS students can debate also.<p>This is a degenerate point and not at relevant to a serious discussion of what benefits are provided by a humanities education. That sort of criticism can be leveled at anything.<p>This doesn't even address the fact that the way he has chosen to frame this conversation is totally absurd. ""CS doesn't do abstract"" is what he thinks people are saying, which would be a ridiculous statement to make. The terms of the debate don't allow for any sort of gradation or nuance -- this perspective can't admit that there is a qualitative difference in abstract reasoning between engineers and philosophy, while still allowing that both receive an education in it.",1306288421

JPEG starts falling off a cliff in terms of image quality once you push it to extreme compression factors (like down near quality-0), but WebP degrades very gracefully and relatively linearly.<p>The test images we put together turned into nearly unrecognizable blocky messes when compressed with JPEG, if they fit at all.  The same test images, compressed with WebP, looked surprisingly decent and were quite usable.<p>That said, if our photo storage budget had been 10 kbytes instead of 5 kbytes, JPEG would have been fine for the project's purposes.

Its true, if you work at Google people who you haven't talked to in years, or who imagine they knew you back when, will approach you to get you to hook them up with someone inside Google who can see the value of their idea/product/company/etc.<p>My short answer got down to:<p>""So nice to hear from you, be successful in your endeavor, develop market leadership, and execute faster than Google. The correct person from Google will then contact you. Cheers!""<p>There are a lot of things you can say about Google but 'unaware' isn't one of them. And especially if the technology at hand is so clearly a 'good fit' with Google then you can assume that Google is aware of it and if they haven't deployed it then <i>they have already rejected it</i>.<p>That last bit is key, for better or worse, nearly everyone at Google thinks they know better than you, they are smarter than you (or you would be at Google), and anything you think you know about the value of what you are doing is wrong because if you were right Google would already do it.<p>Now you and I both know that with great hubris comes great blindness, but the <i>only</i> way to convince someone at Google that you've got an idea that is both good and that they need, is to execute on it so well that it starts causing them some pain. Just <i>telling</i> them about it won't get you anywhere. Trying to get a meeting where you want them to sign a deep NDA to prevent them from stealing your idea is a non-starter.<p>The good news is that you don't have to worry about ""getting in touch with the right person"" at Google. Don't spend any time on it. Just do what you're doing well and if they care, they will get in touch with you. If they don't they won't and you won't have wasted any time courting them.",1306286610

While seventy bucks for half an hour's work sounds pretty good when you're a student, it turns out that lying in an incredibly loud MRI machine for half an hour while headphones play a nonstop series of bad actors enunciating the words ""It's eight o'clock"" while trying to sound ""happy"" vs ""fearful"" vs ""angry"" vs ""neutral"" is really hard and relatively unpleasant work. Anyway, the point of this story is that the actors on the recording obviously weren't <i>really</i> happy or fearful or angry about the fact that it's eight o'clock, so I always wondered whether my brain processed that obviously-fake emotion differently to real emotion.

2) A manifestation of nervous energy<p>A confident guy in the presence of an attractive woman will do #1.  A shy guy will do #2.  #2 displays the guy thinks he isn't worthy.  The sub-communication is neediness.  #1 displays that the guy is comfortable around women like her.  The sub-communication is contentment, abundance.<p>Women can tell the difference.",1306285361

In the big rolling jackpot games, the average payout is about 50 cents on the dollar, but after weeks and weeks of paying 10 cents on the dollar with no big winner, the jackpot builds until it's higher than the expected number of dollars coming in.",1306285355

Basically, if you have direct access the the DB you can loin to someones account without them knowing or permanently changing the password.  Granted, there are some minor issues with salting passwords etc, but protecting an account from someone with long term RW access to a DB and reasonable understanding of the system is next to impossible.",1306285279

That translates to a great company in Wall Street terms.<p>Look at McDonalds. McDonalds certainly didn't invent the hamburger. McDonalds probably never made the best hamburger.

I wonder what feature, or combination of features, is the differentiator here? Maybe it's the speed of search, or the loose document schemas combined with freetext search, the REST API? Some more examples and benchmarks would be interesting, when you find the time :)",1306285213
