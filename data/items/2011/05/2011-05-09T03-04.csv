It's called preferential selection and has strong historical/inertial ties.

2527488,comment,2527281,2527281,1,0,maqr,,,"I'm new to this bitcoin thing, but I think it's a great idea.  Here's what I think about the author's points, let me know if I'm missing something:<p>> ""Mining"" (they even borrowed the word!) bitcoins is pointless busywork that produces nothing of real value.<p>The ""mining"" activity is used for bootstrapping the network, the on-going processing of transactions, and the collection of transaction fees.  It is not busywork.<p>> Bitcoins are less convenient than paper currency.<p>For in-person transactions, this is probably true, but not for computer based transactions, where we're held hostage to companies like PayPal for simple transfers.<p>> Bitcoin denies the truth of capitalism, that it's about <i>value</i>, not about money, by preventing the money supply from expanding when the economy does.<p>I'm not sure how true this is, maybe an economist can weigh in, but considering that it's not inconvenient to divide bitcoins into smaller units, I'm not sure why this creates any problem.<p>>  Bitcoin allows for random unrecoverable effects like the 1930s depression.<p>I don't see how bitcoin would allow for ""random unrecoverable effects"" any more than Paypal would.  Is this related to the possibility of breaking SHA256, which the author also thinks is viable?<p>> Bitcoin removes government control over the economy, which means there is <i>no</i> control over the economy.<p>I think this could be argued as a benefit, but it's not like bitcoins are likely to become the one world currency.  If anything, it seems likely that a tiny bitcoin-based economy will spring up.",1304912864

Both are approaching 3 years old, so I've been trying to decide what to do about replacing them.<p>At this point, it's looking like the answer is going to be selling off the MacBook and (eventually) the Sony and consolidating into a single PC laptop. I have a reasonably powerful desktop for my needs (home-built Core i5 running Win7) and a nice Dell i7 laptop for work stuff, courtesy of work, so I'm mostly looking for a small and light enough personal laptop. I'm thinking I may just go small and cheap and leave the heavy lifting to my desktop PC, so I'm looking at some of the new AMD 'Zacate' E-350 systems that Engadget likes to refer to as ""notbooks"" -- probably the HP DM1, since it has one of the new clickpads on it.<p>I considered getting a MacBook Air, but decided not to. Even though they're very nice machines I'd really rather not pay the price premium, and I'm honestly not very enthusiastic about some of the things Apple is apparently doing with Lion. For the OS X-specific stuff I do -- mostly Ruby and Python in MacVim -- I can do it just as well in Linux and on the same platform I'd be deploying it on -- plus I can set it up to dual boot Windows and drop back into that if I want or need to.",1304912839

In most cases better than the good programmers.<p>The thing about good productive programmers is same as that in the US, they tend to stick around for long time in one company, take time out to learn and master the trade. And are not usually on the job lists. On the other hand, due to rapid growth it has become fashionable here for the bad folks to hop a job often. The trick is simple, the performance evaluation happens every year in most companies here. Before their performance is even judged, they fly to some other company.<p>Hiring is often done by HR's. They are given a template of standard questions flicked from the internet. Most of which are factual and don't test a candidate analytical ability. Questions like 'What is a class', 'Can you define X'. If you memorize the answer you can easily pass the interview.<p>There are dumps of questions available for clearing common certifications like SCJP et al. They say some jargons in interview, negotiate a good salary and join the company.

MS has been running with out it's founder for years and has been moderately successful.<p>If one is to believe the reality distortion field that Jobs is central to Apple's success then his health problems pose a major problem to the long term value of the stock.<p>Apple has some very serious competitive risks (Android) and some very serious internal risks (Jobs' health). Apple's stock price is based on the idea of maintaining 30% growth for the next few years, that's a much more difficult goal than to lose 2% per year. Also, Moore's law is still relevant in the mobile market meaning that people replace their phones fairly frequently to get better hardware support. A mobile phone from 5 years ago is clearly inferior to most people whereas a computer from 5 years ago is mostly adequate for most users. What this means is that there is still time in mobile for a major competitor to emerge. The desktop PC market is locked up and belongs to Microsoft. The desktop PC running Windows is also a core part of the business to a lot of companies in the same way that Mainframes are to the financial industry. Yes, Microsoft's Desktop PC business will continue to decline for years, but it's a steady essentially risk free revenue stream. The mobile revenue stream is still largely up for grabs.<p>Microsoft also has big inroads into enterprise sales which could solidify WinPhone 7 in the enterprise which would bring in some pretty big bucks.",1304912301
