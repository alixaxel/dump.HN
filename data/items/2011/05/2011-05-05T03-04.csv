Say a patient had a complaint about the cost of a visit, and stormed out of the office saying 'screw you' in the waiting room, and the review noted this. Other patients who were in the waiting room would likely be able to identify the patient. Would a doctor responding to the (anonymous) complaint, noting details about a patient's illness constitute personally identifiable information?<p>It's not easy from a doctor's perspective to identify such situations, and it's a very sticky area. Given that it's a sticky area, do you think any doctor would risk crossing the line? There are large legal risks involved here.",1304567956

Smartphones are the low-end. ARM is probably already too well established there for Intel to win it (with popular machines, OSs and applications dependent on ARM).<p>The danger to Intel is that as ARM improves in performance, it brings other benefits with it (eg. low power consumption; configurability), that are also valuable in high-end logic. Once ARM is performant <i>enough</i>, those server-farms could switch, to solve their heating/power problems.<p>But it's interesting that Intel hasn't made the low-end a priority, not applying their best process to it; maybe they have a reason to think they're safe.",1304566281

2516068,comment,2513661,2514475,1,0,kamaal,,,"Too much knowledge doesn't imply too much work, You are right. In fact what matters like always is the execution. If you have a process to remain productive, what matters is to execute that process well and with discipline.<p>That process might not be very great or best in class, but well executed bad ideas always lead to better result than badly executed good areas. Here is my hack for remaining productive. Which I have tinkered after reading David Allen's 'Getting things done'.<p>I have a table which has the following common fields. Task, Deadline, Started, Finished, Log, Priority and Next Step. A little modified from David's actual GTD. This table helps me do many things, first plan my tasks, next set a deadline to achieve it. Started and finished fields help me measure how much time I have taken to get it done. Log gives me an idea of complexity. Priority decides what needs to come next after what. Next step keeps me on tip of heels always generating new work for me.<p>I review this every night before going to sleep. And at least once a day if I'm hitting the daily deadlines. Now comes the most important of all, its called 'DISCIPLINE'. If one is not disciplined none of this ceremony works. Infact I would say better get disciplined before you get into all these techniques. Discipline is a personality trait, It has to be developed with patience, perseverance and practice. You don't get disciplined by tinkering /etc/hosts you get disciplined by making it happen even without tinkering /etc/hosts.<p>Another important part is review. You must review your progress every now and then. My review happens every Sunday afternoon, the review happens by measuring what I have done. What will I do and is all that really sufficient to meet my daily, weekly, monthly, six monthly, yearly and then life goals.<p>I make it a point to apply this not just to work, but even to my hobbies. My music practice and other stuff. Most of the users here have suggested very fine ways of measuring productivity I guess I will employ some of those techniques during my review process.",1304566056

If it wasn't they'd clean them up not just blow them up.<p>They'd blow it up in a hostile country such as Serbia where the remains of F-117 were transported to China afterward and the present Chinese stealth technology is a result of reverse engineering of those remains. F-117 was 20 years old in 1999 - and if this helicopter was so new and so secret that nobody has seen it before, they'd go pick it up as Pakistan is a ""friendly"" state.<p>It's just a standard transport helicopter (like MH-60 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_UH-60_Black_Hawk</a>) modified for special forces to have less of a radar cross-section. For example, they put rotor screws under a plate.<p>It's not so important for a helicopter to be stealth - if the pilot has NVG, it can fly during the day right over the trees, and few radars can pick it up, unless it accidentally flies over (in the radius of about 8km) of a mobile surface-to-air missile launcher. And they know where these are: JSTARS tells them where the sources of radiation are, and they set their path around those. They also avoided all towns where someone would detect them based on noise and make a phone call, or, god forbid, tweet.",1304565308

While doing that, I met my current cofounders for LikeaLittle, Shubham and Prasanna. They had left Microsoft, came to Stanford, and used to hang out there because they were trying to start a company. A mutual friend introduced us and after a month or two we decided to join forces.<p>So we started ProFounder. I worked there for about six months and then it moved on to L.A and I didnt want to go to L.A; I decided I wanted to stay in Silicon Valley and do some consumer Internet things. So, Shubham, Prasanna and I came back to Palo Alto, lived together in a one-bedroom apartment with no furniture, slept on the floor, subsisted off of rice, and tried a bunch of stuff until we caught something that worked.<p>This was January 2010. For several months we just brainstormed; it wasnt until October that we actually came up with LikeaLittle. We had probably tried 10 ideas before that and they all failed miserably. So, in October 2010, we created a first edition of LikeaLittle.<p>Weve been working together for almost a year, but before YC we had not done any fundraising. We were bootstrapping the entire time; we were living in a one-bedroom apartment our entire time together and then for a two month period, [my cofounders] lost their visas, so we had to go and live in India together. So we lived with my cofounders family in India and were doing the startup from there. It was interesting, the power would go out all the time and our users were in America so we had to be on U.S. time; all kinds of crazy stuff was happening.<p>But, in India there were no expenses. The family would make us food and wed stay with them; we literally had a zero dollar burn rate in India. So that was pretty fantastic; we kind of had an infinite runway. Weve basically spent the entire year living off of rice and beans and sleeping on the floor, together.""",1304565211
