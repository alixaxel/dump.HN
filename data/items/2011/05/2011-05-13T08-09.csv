It's since been reworded significantly, but this was the original style suggestion there (introduced on August 23, 2002):<p><i>In most cases, simply follow the usual rules of English punctuation. A few points where the Wikipedia may differ from usual usage follow.</i><p><i>With quotation marks, we suggest splitting the difference between American and English usage.</i><p><i>Although it is not a rigid rule, it is probably best to use the ""double quotes"" for most quotations, as they are easier to read on the screen, and use 'single quotes' for ""quotations 'within' quotations"".

2544006,comment,2543553,2543553,3,0,alexqgb,,,"Seems like a PR coup paid for by major banks who are majorly scared. It's all about sidestepping crime by saying ""There may have been SOME crime, but it wasn't the ROOT cause of the crisis"".<p>Therefore what? No prosecutions whatsoever? Does the author really think that the law on Wall Street is this relative? That criminal acts only attract prosecutorial attention in those rare (read 'nonexistent') cases where they are the clear and singular causes of global economic meltdowns?<p>The author goes on to ""point out"" that ""prosecuting these crimes is HARD."" Maybe that's what a hack being paid to lie might say, but actual prosecutors know better. Elliot Spitzer (who REALLY know this game, having seen it from both sides) noted in 'Inside Job' (a) how popular cocaine and hookers were (and still are) among Wall St. types (b) how simple it is to prosecute vice cases and (c) how easily they can ruin the careers, lives, and families of those who get busted. After all, the further up the status ladder you go, the harder these things are to live down.<p>Sure, prosecuting white collar crime by auditing paperwork is tricky, and that's what makes the approach a rookie move. The real pros (like Spitzer) don't bother. Instead, they run a dragnet that catches a number of bank employees with their pants down (often literally). They threaten them with the end of their jobs, marriages, and dignity over a bunch of petty crap that they can make go away IF the poor bastards dig up the kind of dirt on their bosses that the prosecutors could never find on their own. Magically, dirt appears.<p>Spitzer's big point, however, is that nobody works like this without their boss's approval. If there's strong pressure NOT to do their jobs, those jobs don't get done. And they're not going to get done if the White House is loudly signaling DO NOT investigate or prosecute.<p>Bill Black had some interesting commentary on this point exactly, including remarks by Gretchen Morgenson and Louise Story, who reported that ""in 2008, the FBI, belatedly, realized that it had improperly targeted relatively trivial mortgage frauds while ignoring the massive lenders that specialized in making fraudulent mortgages. The FBI developed a plan to reorient its resources towards the accounting control frauds that always should have been its priority. We now know that the Department of Justice (DoJ) deliberately, and successfully, sabotaged this effort to investigate the major frauds.<p>The second underlying scandal that their column disclosed is that two key members of what Tom Frank aptly termed Bushs Wrecking Crew  Geithner and Bernanke  who President Obama chose to promote and reappoint and make his anti-regulatory leaders sought to discourage or limit federal and state prosecutions, enforcement actions, and suits. Geithners express rationale was that the financial system extreme fragility made vigorous investigations of the elite frauds too dangerous.""<p><a href=""http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011/04/fiat-justitia-ruat-caelum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011/04/fiat-justitia-ruat-c...</a><p>In any case, we seem to be moving from ""yes, there was crime, but don't prosecute"" to ""yes, there MAY have been crime, but we CAN'T prosecute"" to ""yes, the crisis was bad, but it wasn't CAUSED by crime, so we're not about to prosecute.""<p>Matt Taibai summed it up best in his February RS column ""Why Isn't Wall Street In Jail?""<p>""Over drinks at a bar on a dreary, snowy night in Washington this past month, a former Senate investigator laughed as he polished off his beer.

How much money are these startups getting?  Anywhere from $50k to $1M.<p>300 startups * $1M = $300M in funding in angel capital this past year.  The National Venture Capital Association's numbers [1] states that Total VC in 2010 was $23B, which is still 1/5th of the VC that was spent in 1999, and is in line with VC investment over the past 10 years.<p>$300M in angel funding is roughly 1.3% of the average VC funding per year over the past 10 years.<p>What _is_ different this time around, is that there are hundreds of smaller bets being placed, rather than dozens of huge bets.<p>Are all of these hundreds of startups going to have decent exits?  No.  Are a number of them going to turn into successful businesses, perhaps.<p>But, what is going to happen is that hundreds of founders are getting an amazing education on raising capital, starting a company, shipping product, and trying to make money.  What really excited me is what Silicon Valley and the tech landscape is going to look like in 10 years.  What this surge in angel investment is doing is educating massive numbers of engineers in how to build and ship product.<p>As far as I'm concerned that's a huge win for everyone, regardless of how many exits there are this time around.<p>Is this a Bubble, really, who cares?

Companies have opportunities to invest money into things that a normal investor cannot. If a company can invest the money at an above average rate it should.<p>For US investors, it's even more clear cut as dividends would be taxed if payed out. If the company instead retains and prudently invests that money, the company in essence is able to generate a return on money that would have been payed as taxes.

In the past 5 years Novartis grows its revenue from 30B to 45, MSFT does it from 51 to 62. Keep in mind that it gets harder the bigger you are - if you're already sucking 51B from your customers, how the hell do you find another 11?<p>The flaw with speculating about the future is that anything that's certain will be priced into the stock immediately. Any other ""educated guesses"" you make might as well go to a blackjack table.<p>A lot of people think they're being prudent just because they're investing with a ""long-term perspective"". That doesn't get you anything in and of itself - I can buy a car and hold onto it forever but it'll never appreciate (well, until it becomes an antique). It's true that you shouldn't daytrade, that you should be willing to stomach holding something even if it loses value. But that just makes it more important that you understand <i>why</i> you've chosen to hold onto this stock for so long. And I don't think speculation about the future is a good basis for that decision. If you can point to something in the present (e.g, 18B in net income) there's a lot more assurance that you're actually getting something for your money.",1305273950
