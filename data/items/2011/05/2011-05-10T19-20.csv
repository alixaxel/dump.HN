2533881,comment,2532698,2533618,3,0,cicero,,,"Short wave radio allows global scale communications with very little infrastructure, and Morse code has many advantages over other forms of communications in the short wave bands. A Morse code signal can be understood in a noisy radio environment better than a voice signal at the same amount of power. It requires less radio bandwidth, enabling very efficient use of the limited short wave spectrum.<p>Short wave radio is not near as important now with the global Internet in place, but it still has reach to some places that don't have Internet connectivity. It is also a good backup technology in the event that something like a natural disaster or terrorist attack severely damages our Internet infrastructure.<p>Finally, communicating using Morse code over Amateur Radio is a fun and intellectually stimulating hobby. I don't currently have a rig setup where I can do this, but when I did in the past, I really enjoyed it.",1305057474

In particular, it's easy to see how formal descriptions can push mathematical generalization forward far before we have a suitable concept of the mathematical object we're describing.<p>I think we're all (incl. the op) in some kind of agreement here about the didacticism of math. The op didn't disregard the power and utility of mathematical languages — he came from being trained pretty heavily in engineering math, at least up to playing with higher-order differential equations — but instead was, perhaps not directly, arguing for increased metaphorical/physical descriptions in taught mathematics. He's just responding to the rather eye-opening feeling one gets when one starts to realize that math is so interpretable!<p>I think that's a perfectly fair argument to have. I know that in my own experience, I never understood the joy of math until the day that linear algebra took an interpretation as linear space transformation.<p>---<p>So we're just sort of all oscillating here in strong rebuttals of whatever interpretation of the ""heart"" of math the prior author champions for a while. Which is fun but unproductive.<p>---<p>I like the challenge of taking someone from physical concepts and metaphors directly to a mathematical object. I think it'd be possible, and maybe even useful when someone first starts to learn real math, but certainly it's not the most efficient way to become well-read. It'd be a lot like explaining the meaning of, I dunno, Día de los Muertos without immersing someone in Mexican language and culture.

We all know that most Android devices and almost all phones really only support USB slave. This is mostly electrical, their controller chips almost always support OTG or Host, but they simply do not provide +5v on the USB bus to power an external device.<p>Hence in order to talk USB with your phone you had the option of rooting your device and use OTG (if supported), or to make the accessory play Host. In the latter case the accessory needs to talk the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) protocol to the phone, which is precisely what MicroBridge did using exactly the same hardware as ADK (Arduino + max3421e USB host controller). The ADB protocol provides byte stream multiplexing over USB, meaning that your USB-enabled microcontroller can tell your phone to give you a bidirectional byte stream to TCP ports, running daemons like logcat, a shell, etc. To establish a connection with a running app, that app simply listens on a TCP port, and the MCU opens a byte stream to that port using ADB.<p>What ADK does differently however, is that it adds a new USB protocol to Android. It previously supported three configurations: USB storage device, tethering, and ADB. The new ADK protocol is much simpler than ADB and really just only offers a single pipe with just reading/writing functionality. This is much simpler to implement (although ADB wasn't exactly rocket science), but most of all it's much cleaner and doesn't require the user to enable debugging in the phone settings.<p>ADB implementations have sprung up recently for various microcontrollers, such as PropBridge <a href=""http://robots-everywhere.com/re_wiki/index.php?title=PropBridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robots-everywhere.com/re_wiki/index.php?title=PropBri...</a> for the propeller (which also comes in a DIP package btw, really nice for hobbyists), and IOIO for the PIC24: <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10585"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10585</a>. These people will support the new protocol as well, so I expect there will be quite a bit of hardware choice in the near future.",1305056224

It's perfect, even - if you really need all the gory stuff, sure, go get a copy of Jackson's book, or some 800 page tome on perturbation theory and the rigorous mathematical underpinnings of quantum theory, if you're going into the field you should absolutely know more than you can get from an intro text.

You can not perform any such equivalent operations for a given AI.<p>That you want to sit here and slice semantics about what we mean by ""human"" means you still aren't really getting it. The differences between definitions of humans are rendered but a small little point in the vast n-dimensional space of what an AI might be like. Which part of the point we pull the definition of ""human"" from is utterly irrelevant; AIs won't be any of them. They won't even be <i>biological</i>. Your intuitions about how they might choose to limit themselves based on human social norms is utterly inapplicable. If Hannibal Lector AI was walking down the street, he might very well decide to just eat you. Or the building you are in. Or the universe you are in.

2533731,comment,2530663,2531521,3,0,bluekeybox,,,"> doesn't it seem like too much intelligence wasted on too little substance?<p>That's an interesting argument. The answer is no, and it's because fashion and other seemingly frivolous pursuits serve a very clear function in the society. Finding a mate, a business partner, a friend, etc. is often very difficult. You generally want to hang out with the best, the smartest, the most influential people possible. However there is no easy way to tell! It would be nice and easy if the best and the smartest were also the best looking, but it is not always the case. Also, there is no ""IQ coefficient"" badge on the forehead. There is really no way to tell other than either by asking questions (too direct!) or by observing subtle social clues. Fashion sense and social skills are some of those clues.<p>From the other side of the coin, when you are smart, you want to advertise that. But it would be unsubtle to put up an IQ coefficient badge on your forehead. And being unsubtle (which equates to failure to consider all possible consequences) is seen as a mark of low intelligence. It is the same way in the human society as it is in chess. In chess, if you don't think through as many possible moves as you can, you lose. So you try to look smart, subtle, sophisticated, and up-to-date, at the same time without coming across as too direct or vulgar. It is very hard.<p>BTW, the unkempt ""nerd"" look is also an advertisement -- albeit to a limited audience.<p>It works the same way in humans as it does in lyrebirds. All animal societies share some fundamental similarities.",1305054951

Those are both excellent schools with top notch math departments, and the example that he mentioned in the article (about not really grokking the second order ODE and what it meant re: the phase space plot, etc.) indicates that he took a <i>seriously</i> badly taught class.  I'm kind of surprised you could get through a diff eq's course at either school without having such basic stuff taught to you...makes me wonder who the teacher was, maybe it was pawned off on a grad student?<p>Edit: whoops...just looked back at the article, turns out he <i>didn't</i> take that diff eq course at Caltech or Berkeley, it was at a local college.  That explains a lot.  I'm not going to say that there are no good teachers at mediocre schools, nor that there are no bad teachers at the good ones, but on average there's a huge discrepancy in the quality of the classes.<p>I had similar experiences, where I took classes at a local college while in high school, and thought I was stupid or something when I didn't ""get"" them, only to find that when I took them again at a better school they were, in fact, very easy topics.<p>I blame the textbook writers in part: for one example, Serge Lang's math books are <i>extremely</i> difficult as a rule, and leave a lot of the scaffolding out. Scaffolding which, when he taught classes himself, he always filled in to make for an amazingly smooth and effortless learning experience, but which lesser teachers would never think to talk about (perhaps because they don't understand it themselves, or at least don't understand how important it is to explain).  It's really a shame that even now, after so many centuries of teaching math to people, the effectiveness of the process is still so utterly dependent on the teacher.

It's terribly tedious, you can hardly represent more than five symbols or so.<p>I did my Bachelor's thesis on related techniques (pressing variable length strings into fixed sized vectors to deal with neural nets - URL below) - I can only say pertaining to neural networks that the decoding capabilities of NNs are severly limited. I actually developed a Jordan Network with a conventional additive sigmoid NN that could encode/decode more than 40 symbols! The technique was based on Cantor coding, but I had to set the weights by hand and could not retrain without losing performance (unstable fixed point attractor of Backpropagation through Time) - i.e. it's kind of a dirty hack.<p>It's also really hard to adapt parameters for sufficiently large nets (so my idea is that you need huge nets to represent language). In order to deal with this complexity limitation I've also looked into reservoir computing style networks (Echo State Networks) which use a large randomly initialized network paired with a linear learned network. ESNs may be good at modelling many kinds of temporal dynamics, but their capacity to represent relations seems rather limited as well.<p>So making an arbitrary length string walk into a vector may sound attractive, but either (a) don't expect to be able to decode it using conventional NNs or (b) don't expect to acheive compression, i.e. blowing up your representation may help (cf LVQ nets) and using compressing techniques such as Hinton's deep belief networks won't.<p><a href=""http://gpickard.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/well-heres-my-actual-thesis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gpickard.wordpress.com/2008/11/11/well-heres-my-actua...</a>",1305054153
