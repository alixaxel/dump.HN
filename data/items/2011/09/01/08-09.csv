When a specific SSL cert is created the private key is generated by the buyer (and never revealed) then the public key for that is sent to the CA and signed. In this way a link of trust is created between the CA and whoever bought the SSL cert.<p>Now, when a browser is used to go to a website using SSL it will ask that site for its cert, which contains the public key and the digital signature from the CA. If the cert is signed by a CA that the browser trusts then the browser in turn trusts that specific cert. The browser then uses the public key to encrypt a message to the site containing information for encrypting return transmissions to the browser.<p>The point being, all CA's are on an equal playing field, and fully trusted. The moment any one CA is no longer fully trustworthy or the moment its private key is no longer secure the whole system fails.",1314866654

That directly contradicts <i>Against Intellectual Monopoly</i>[1], which claims patents did more harm than good <i>in this very case</i>.<p>One reason is independent discovery: most innovations tend to be discovered independently and nearly simultaneously.  Like, when ""science is ready"", innovations just pop out of several people's mind relatively quickly. (See also Eben Moglen's folk theory of the internet and innovation: ""wrap the internet around a planet, spin the planet, and ideas flow out of the network"".)<p>If we accept that, the only thing that could have significantly slowed the development of the modern separate-condenser steam engine down is money.  Like, no single one investor is willing to risk making the first step, by fear of being eaten by copycats.  If this is so, then we have a tragedy of the commons.<p>Risk aversion in this case is indeed a problem.  I think it is mitigated however by (i) the first mover advantage, and (ii) variations of risk-aversion among individuals (combined with independent discovery, you get a winner-takes-all scenario).<p>Ah, before I forget: adopting an individualist point of view tend to favour patents: an inventor is <i>entitled</i> to reward (forgetting other's entitlement for freedom of invention).  If <i>I</i> didn't have that patent, then <i>I</i> wouldn't have done this much good (forgetting that others may have done it otherwise).  I know you didn't make this error, Cf your 2, but others do for instance by taking your 1 out of context.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/against.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/against.htm</a>",1314866432
