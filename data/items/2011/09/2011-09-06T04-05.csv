They'll get a whole lot of people who legitimately submitted hardware keys at the same time.<p>Invalidate/revoke the keys from steam? The hardware IDs they were using to run the promotion are still going to be out there in the wild, so they can't re-run the promotion, this would just minimize their losses in terms of lost profit.<p>As far as the keys being in plain text on the server, this doesn't even make sense from the perspective of how you design a web app; why not put the data on a separate remote/secure server? Why not at least encrypt it? Also, how are they matching the hardware IDs to the keys when people submit the official promo; are they actually doing a search through each text file to find the matching hardware key? The .htaccess mis-configuration is bad enough, but it's not the only issue here.",1315285192

2964188,story,,,28,16,newhouseb,"Show HN: Notational `ls` - Never get lost in code again (hour long hack)",,"Hey folks, I just wanted to share a quick script I threw together called notational ls.  One of the big problems of any code base (or any filesystem) is that it's hard to tell what's what - folder and file names often trade brevity for clarity.<p>So I thought about a version of `ls` that works like this:<p><pre><code>  > nls
    web: Where python web server files are stored
    ad_hoc: One time scripts 
    ios: Our IOS code
    images
</code></pre>
Adding descriptions is really easy too:<p><pre><code>  > nls images Images SHARED between both ios and web
    web: Where python web server files are stored
    ad_hoc: One time scripts 
    ios: Our IOS code
    images: Images SHARED between both ios and web
</code></pre>
So I whipped up said script in python and pushed it to github for all to use. Code is at https://github.com/newhouseb/nls, feel free to fork as you so please, but I must get back to real work. If there's enough interest it'd be great to turn this into a larger effort of improving the small things in our bash lives.  If you're lazy, here's the source anyway (github has comments and sane spacing) - enjoy!<p><pre><code>  from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
  import sys
  files = Popen([""ls""], stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0].splitlines()
  notes = {}
  try:  
  nls_file = open('.nls').read().splitlines()
  except IOError:
  nls_file = []
  for entry in nls_file:
  file, note = entry.split(':', 1)
  notes[file] = note
  if len(sys.argv) > 1:
  if len(sys.argv) == 2 and sys.argv[1] == 'bootstrap':
  for file in files:
  if file not in notes:
  notes[file] = ''
  elif sys.argv[1] in files:
  notes[sys.argv[1]] = ' '.join(sys.argv[2:])
  open('.nls','w').write(
  '\n'.join([file+': '+note for file,note in notes.iteritems()]))
  for file in files:
  if file in notes:
  print '\033[1m' + file + ':\033[0m ' + notes[file].strip()
     else:
          print '\033[1m' + file + '\033[0m'
</code></pre>
Note: I know this code isn't perfect, but it was a quick job and is what came to mind first and, most importantly, works. If you want to improve it send me a pull request/fork it on github (this is REALLY easy now with github's recent updates).",1315284811

Versioned file systems are a good idea now because storage is cheap; they were a bad idea years ago.  And Apple isn't avoiding a versioned file system because they hate you, or because of profits; they're doing it because they have to stay backwards compatible with programs that don't know how to work with a versioned file system.  Fundamentals matter; agreed.  But unfortunately, you can only choose fundamentals once, unless you (like, say, the Linux kernel) can rewrite all software that uses your system.  So instead of whining about people choosing the wrong fundamentals while abusing colorful analogies, do some research on helping ordinary programmers write future-proof systems.  Think: what would have been a design that would allow us to transition from non-versioned to versioned file system.  And remember that Plan9 didn't win, Linux just slowly stole features from it (and is continuing to do so).",1315284311

A i5 uses a lot more power than a Tegra2/A5, but is a lot more powerful.<p>An Atom use a bit more power than Tegra2/A5, but is a bit more powerful.<p>Intel is pushing Atom down into ARM territory in terms of power usage, and ARM is moving up towards Atom - and, to the surprise of no one who knows what they are talking about - the power usage at the same level of performance is roughly the same.<p>Arstechnica had an excellent article about this back when NVidia started talking about their desktop ARM push: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/02/nvidia-30-and-the-riscification-of-x86.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/02/nvidia-30-and-t...</a><p>A good quote:<p><i>It's also the case that as ARM moves up the performance ladder, it will necessarily start to drop in terms of power efficiency. Again, there is no magic pixie dust here, and the impact of the ISA alone on power consumption in processors that draw many tens of watts is negligible. A multicore ARM chip and a multicore Xeon chip that give similar performance on compute-intensive workloads will have similar power profiles; to believe otherwise is to believe in magical little ARM performance elves.</i><p>Intel isn't out of this game by a long shot. For example (Intel powered) Chromebooks perform roughly as well as an iPad in terms of battery life. There is little evidence that an ARM powered Airbook would do any better if it offered similar levels of performance (unless you believe in the magical ARM performance elves mentioned above).",1315283571

In a capitalist society they will naturally be acquired by whoever can make the most money. Maybe not initially but over time they will find the right (value maximizing) host. There is an inevitability to this. The value maximizing host seem to be so called patent trolls.<p>The role of government is to set the rules/bounds for capitalism. With patents you could argue that there is a problem with the rules. But I don't think you can blame the players once the rules are set. Capitalism is not about morality, but profit maximizing and resource allocation. The solution is simple. Change the rules of the game.<p>As a side note Paul Graham's patent pledge attacks the wrong side of the problem and will therefore not be effective.

At the time I was working for a large courier company, in an IT department, improving delivery tracking systems. To get someone off the scale in metrics not generally found in an IT department is an anomaly. Maybe if it was a group of artists I may have just been elevated and overlooked, but I guess the context was important for making me stand out.<p>I don't know what the tests where. I just took an afternoon off and went down to there offices and did the tests they presented. Its was on a computer and lots of behavioural questions and IQ type puzzles. I thin I did around 5 tests that after noon. They rang me back a week or so later and went throughout eh results with me, and then emailed me a series of figures and graphs.<p>Are they accurate I dunno? but the last set of figures which they went through had that creativity figure. But to tell a story of accuracy I'll tell yo a story about my friend who is in Mensa.<p>He worked out that the mensa test he was given was time based. So he paid his fee, answered the first few questions, then skipped all the rest and finished the exam in a few minutes. When all the weighting was put together he had scored extremely high on the IQ scale by doing this.<p>Is he a genius? I dunno. If its a genius move to outsmart mensa then yes. But he didn't really sit the test, he intact just spotted a flaw and abused it.<p>As for awards and validation. I think I've associated awards with the potential for negative thing to happen later. In my last position when I won the advertising award, a new pressure to be the best this year suddenly appeared... after all I was now recognised as the best in the industry... My daily work became more difficult because expectations are imposed on me that I didn't want or need. Hell running a news team + site is enough hard work without being expected to be an advertising maverick as well.<p>So its usually other people either that notice things I've done or put me forward, I never nominate myself. I hate awards.<p>I just want work and solve problems. I get pleasure from taking something that doesn't exist, thinking it through, and making it a reality. My house is full of useless inventions, toys, prototypes. I can't help myself. People often note on my inability to relax, I relax by indulging myself in ideas, which to others is the opposite of relaxing.<p>Seeing the results from those tests made me realise a lot of the problems I had been experiencing where probable never going to go away. Lets be honest (entrenched) IT is one of the least creative industries out there. Its generally very goal/problem focused, that often only has one or two possible outcomes.
