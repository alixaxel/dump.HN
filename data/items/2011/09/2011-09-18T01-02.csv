It'll offer you an opportunity to get feedback which can help make your product better.<p>2. It can turn a hater into a net promoter if you do it right.<p>3. Direct outreach from the founder of a company makes your firm more human (not sure what industry you're in but in ours, people really appreciate it).  It may not turn the ""gamers"" into buyers, but if you believe most people are good, they may be less inclined to game if you're not just some ""evil business""<p>And although I also sometimes remember rejection more than successes, I find these requests motivate me.<p>Note:  I've got no sense of volume you're dealing with so I'll caveat the above with that if it's becoming a time-suck.",1316310848

3009267,comment,3009228,3009228,42,0,chime,,,"> My guess is that the back-end supply chain / software / inventory management problems are just not as sexy as the front-end consumer-facing problems, or maybe the consumer-facing problems are just more intuitive.<p>Absolutely! I wrote MRP systems for a pharma manufacturing in Florida and the kind of stuff I had to do on a daily basis far surpassed the complexity of your  breathtakingly-beautiful but typical project-management webapp or customized T-shirt webstore. Let me be clear, complexity has absolutely nothing to do with the merit of one product vs. another. KhanAcademy code could be simple as 2nd grade math but nothing I ever write will ever be as beneficial to the world. However, complexity is expensive, takes time and dedication, and rarely pays off in the short-term.<p>There is a reason most supply chain software installations run in the millions to tens of millions. Here's an example of something I wrote while ago: A drag & drop scheduler in JS, kinda like Google Calendar that lets you schedule production jobs on different equipment, across different labor teams. When you change a single job on the schedule, it auto-calculates the entire requirement for the entire company. Moving one production job up (say shampoo for customer A) could end up in the company losing $500k because one of the ingredients that went into shampoo for A also goes into conditioner for customer B. This particular item has a lead time of 3m from China. And since order for B is significantly larger in amount, every single day of delay is money actually lost because you bought all the other raw materials for B on credit from the bank and now have to pay interest on it, while it just sits in the warehouse waiting for the raw material to be flown in from China.<p>Of course, this is something you want to avoid in the planning stage itself. And that's what the software does and warns the user within seconds of making any changes. One tiny bug in the code, say it doesn't correctly factor in the internal lead time from QC (this particular chemical needs to be sampled for microbiological contamination) and you just delay the project by a week. Putting up a pretty website is hard work but it is nothing compared to hiring 20 people to spend 3 months mapping out the multi-stage routings for 500 different SKUs. No tech-VC wants to invest in businesses that require a tremendous amount of operational labor. That's what banks are for.",1316310787

In my case, I would often spend a few hours working personally with the client, only to refund their money afterward.<p>However, I continue to offer the policy because my refund rate is low (about 1-2%) and the increase in sales due to the policy is substantially higher than that. The way that I see it, giving out a few refunds is a cost of doing business, and I don't begrudge refunds any more than I begrudge taxes, merchant fees or rent increases. Looking at refunds mathematically takes some of the pain out of paying them.<p>I'm also somewhat comforted by the fact that a refund policy is a way to resolve genuine client dissatisfaction: In my view, giving refunds to undeserving people is far preferable to clients actually leaving dissatisfied and possibly badmouthing my company.",1316310410

Well for ever is a taboo word that I would never use (not just in tech nowadays), but I think that their user base will ensure sufficient longevity in tech years (which is akin to dog years).<p>I believe that Facebook will keep being somewhat interesting by default due to their alluring ecosystem and viral potential for future entrepreneurs. Most new Apps are built with a clear strategy of broadcasting itself (and showing some of its features) through Facebook feeds. These new Apps have made peoples feeds a lot more interesting. I think Instagram is a good example of this. It made your friends amateur photos much cooler and aesthetically pleasing to look at; thus drawing you to a more interesting Facebook experience.<p>Their strength lies in their ecosystem and ability to let their users and developers easily create and share content. They have more or less nailed this down already (along with a revenue sharing system to sustain some of their infrastructure costs).  At the end of the day, even if they stopped innovating, theyve done such a fantastic play with their infrastructure, that it ensures that they remain interesting as long as new entrepreneurs keep developing Apps that enhance their ecosystem.<p>If anything, I think their need to copy and catch up with new breakthroughs from other social networks (i.e. Google+, Foursquare and Twitter) is actually making their product more convoluted and less appealing. Less is more in Facebooks case. That was the genius of Facebook from day 1.

3009216,comment,3009021,3009121,6,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>The main reason a lot of people are much more happier with Google+ and Twitter nowadays is not because some features are marginally better - it's because the atmosphere is so much nicer there.</i><p>Let's put some numbers around this interesting statement. Are there really a lot of people who find the atmosphere on Twitter much nicer than the atmosphere on Facebook? How about Google Plus? How many people find its atmosphere much nicer than the atmosphere on Facebook? And for the most important numbers, how much revenue is each of those companies gaining from the people who like each company's atmosphere best?<p>P.S. I like Facebook very well indeed, because my international network of friends is largely all there. I use Facebook much like a social linking service (not too differently from how I use HN), posting links I find interesting to invite comments from friends, and posting comments in threads about links posted by other people. The intellectual tone of the discussions I encounter on Facebook is very high--although that surely mostly has to do with how I met many of my friends. We (all my various friends and I) devote time and effort to cultivating a respectful atmosphere of people expressing frequently wildly varying opinions, as long as everyone is civil and everyone is encouraged to look up facts. That's like being invited to graduate seminars (a real-life experience I have had) on interesting subjects at any hour of the day that is convenient for me. As long as Facebook can monetize enough, somehow, to allow people like me who don't give it money (but arguably do give it content) to meet one another there, Facebook will be part of my life for a long time. After all, my FRIENDS are there.<p>After edit: regarding the comment elsewhere in this thread about the submitted article,<p><i>This is a poorly researched article that takes a few anecdotes</i><p>I can't say I necessarily disagree, but note for the record that most blog posts are poorly researched and mostly based on anecdotes. In actual fact, on HN poorly researched blog posts tend to be much more upvoted as new submissions than professionally written research articles. It's a rare case when a general readership of a website (e.g., HN's readership) prefers discussing careful research to discussing a few anecdotes.<p>Another comment asks,<p><i>Are people excited by search?</i><p>I was very excited by Google when it first became available. (I discovered Google before it was publicly announced, by noticing what search engines were spidering my personal website back in the 1990s.) Google's results were so plainly superior to those of Excite, Lycos, and even AltaVista (my previous favorite search engine) that I soon told all my friends about Google. Search results that turn up reliable, accurate, readable links are always a pleasure. The way to do better at search than Google does would be to somehow serve up better results more consistently--that would be exciting, if it is possible.",1316308496
