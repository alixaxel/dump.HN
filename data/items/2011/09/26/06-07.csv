Dave has made himself and his connections available to us far more often than I would've expected, given the fact that there are some 165 startups (I've shared a meal and/or drink with Dave 3 times in the past month, despite living in Chicago)<p>FeeFighters wasn't incubated at 500startups, but Dave/500 invested in us and we're a part of the family despite being based in Chicago.

The problem wasn't the customer base, the problem was the product itself.<p>In a word, it sucked. (Okay, two words).  The product looks and behaves like an alpha. The UI is counter-intuitive and unpolished.  It takes way too much effort just to enter a single student's grade for a single assignment.  This service actually makes a teachers' administrative burden worse, especially compared to using the gold-standard Excel spreadsheet.  Speaking of Excel...where were the export options?<p>This product doesn't do enough, or execute well enough, to justify being a paid product. (The demo video is the only truly polished thing on the entire site.) Hell, it isn't compelling even as a free offering.

I - these things are hard to forecast 100 years out, of course, because nobody knows what's going to happen. But when I was at the Annual Lithium Supply and Markets Conference last January, an analyst got up and basically told all the miners in the audience that there was going to be such an enormous oversupply in the last half of this decade that only the strongest were going to survive. There are a lot of people getting into the lithium mining business right now, but there seems to be more than enough to go around. And so I haven't seen anybody express concern about lithium supplies for any foreseeable reasonable number of these cars, you know, in batteries.<p>Of course, I'll just point out a misperception. A lot of people speak of lithium as if its oil. They talk about Bolivia or Chile being the Saudi Arabia of lithium. But you don't burn lithium. Lithium is a metal used to make a device that stores energy that's produced by other means. So it can be recycled. The batteries can be reused. There is plenty to go around for quite some time.</i><p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/06/08/136856479/leading-the-charge-to-make-better-electric-cars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2011/06/08/136856479/leading-the-charge-t...</a>",1317018085

I don't about US, but I tell you about India I country that I live in.<p>I don't think as a country we will ever make up or compete with what China is doing currently. Although I can tell you you can hire people here at equally low prices. When you talk of manufacturing. The first sort is machine made the other ones are hiring human beings.<p>The latter sort of is what is most tricky. You need people who are ready to do a repetitive job, that can add nothing to their knowledge on the longer and are ready to work for long hours for cheap wages. Most of that work is generally precision work that you can't do with machines. With machines, its a different story. You begin to see how you can recover your investment over time. But with people, you have to start to look at scalability issues.<p>I don't know about America. But I think its worthwhile to ask a few questions.<p>a. Is it possible to hire such large volume of people at such low prices in America.<p>b. Will those people, be ready to work for long hours on repetitive mechanical oriented jobs. Which gives no value on a persons career on a longer run.<p>c. Since these jobs are low paying, the retirement long term financial benefits won't be exciting. The health care benefits won't be much.<p>d. Since industries have to be all at one place, for inventory co ordination, infrastructure issues et al. People will be forced to live in low rent houses. Often of sharing and accommodation basis. Is this lifestyle ok with those mass quantity of people.<p>The way I see American lifestyle is more driven by spending, and expenses are really high for an ordinary American. Both in terms of daily expenditure and other issues like sending kids to college and medical benefits.<p>The larger question is will the mass American crowd adopt to the lifestyle I describe?<p>If the answer is yes, I see no reason why this can't be done in the USA. In fact if it can be done, then it must be encouraged. The government must make it easy and facilitate them. Why should the average American suffer because of me in India or some one in China. If any thing that can be done here(India/China) it can be done there(America) if the conditions are suitable.(both in terms of economic and other factors).",1317017010

3037815,comment,3036745,3037162,3,0,mmaunder,,,"Learn the basics on a dingy but dont' turn it into a meal. Larger boats are very different to dingy sailing. e.g. you'll find yourself purely working a grinder or being ballast on the weather rail. Dingy racing is short, real-time and the moving parts are a little different. e.g. no spinnaker poles on small boats, most big boats don't have dagger boards, big boats have spinnaker, gennaker, several jib's, often with roller-furling etc - so quite different.<p>Distance skippers (deliveries or racing) look for guys with a strong stomach who don't mind packing sails in the forward sail locker during a shitstorm or cleaning the galley or unblocking the toilet. People like that with a great attitude who come back asking for more and get along well with others are hard to find. There are some specific skills that help like knowing your way around a diesel engine, strong on navigation or knowing how to cook (well). Cruising in particular, most people who haven't spent time cruising have no idea how much time you spend repairing diesel engines. You'll get very used to the awesome smell of fresh diesel or diesel exhaust washing around the bilge.<p>I'm going to reiterate this: A strong stomach is important. My bro has found himself in 21 ft swells with a crew of four experienced sailors and 2 of them ended up lying in their bunks puking their guts out - completely debilitated and unable to help. Him and a 16 year old were left to get the boat out of the shit.<p>Personally I'm good for cruising trade-wind conditions but forget southern ocean deliveries/races. I don't have the sea legs for that. So know your limitations and crew accordingly.<p>If you're going to race, you'd beter get very very fit if you're going to work a grinder. I crewed an afternoon race around the cans once on a boat called America's Cup Challenge - it was a whitbread 60 - and worked the grinder with a friend. It's insanely hard work and my friend took pity on me after a few minutes and sent me back to the weather rail.<p>I would start by hitting ft lauderdale or another big sailing town and start networking like crazy - check the bulletin boards, grab beers with other crew, try to get on an afternoon race. There are a ton of guys, many of them non US citizens, who just show up in sailing towns each year and stay in a local crew youth hostel getting odd jobs until they line up a gig. Many of them have very little experience. If you're serious about racing you'll want to start working towards your skippers ticket. Good luck.",1317016879
