3002540,comment,2999174,2999174,3,0,aperiodic,,,"The real difficult part of explaining this concept to the layperson is getting them to understand what asymptotic complexity is. The example I always use when I explain this to people with little or no math or computer science background is sorting algorithms, explained using the following example of a deck of cards. Everybody's familiar with a deck of cards, and it doesn't take much more math than the most intuitive bits statistics.<p>Imagine I give you a deck of perfectly shuffled (i.e. uniformly distributed) cards, and decree that you need to find the ace of spades. What you have to do is go through each card one-by-one, and stop when you've found it. You'll have to look at, on average, 26 cards, since there are 52 cards in the deck, and each card has an equal chance of being the ace of spades. Now, let's say I add another 52 cards, this time with a defaced ace of spades, and wanted you to find the original (non-defaced) ace of spades, which is now just one card out of 104. On average, this'll take 52 cards.<p>Notice that when I double the amount of cards I gave you, the amount of work (that is, looking at cards) you had to do also doubles, meaning that for N cards, the amount of work is N/2. When the amount of work is directly related to the number of cards, excluding dividing or multiplying by a number that does not depend on the number of cards (in this example, dividing by 2), then we simplify things and say that this process for finding the Ace of Spades takes BigO(N) work to finish.<p>Now, imagine I give you that same deck, and instead of demanding that you find the ace of spades, I require you to sort it out into suits, with the cards in each suit in increasing order. One way to do this is to keep a separate pile for each suit, with that pile in increasing order. Deciding where to put the first card of each suit is easy, you just make a new pile for it. The later cards are not as easy, since you have to go through the pile and find the right place to put the new card.<p>Right away you can tell that this sorting takes more work from you than finding the ace of spades does. Instead of just looking at each card to see if it's the ace of spades, you first have to check the suit of the card to determine which pile it should go in. Then, you have to look through that pile for the proper place to insert the card. I won't go into the math, but it turns out the best way to sort a deck of cards into piles of suits[1] like this takes N * lgN work, where lgN is a fancy number that isn't constant, but gets bigger when N gets bigger, unlike the division by 2 in the ace of spades example. That means that sorting cards is harder than finding the ace of spades.<p>This business of determining how hard tasks like sorting cards are is called ""analyzing the complexity"" of a task. Except, instead of saying task, computer scientists like to say ""function."" The question of whether or not P = NP is a question about whether a certain kind of tasks called ""deterministic Polynomial"" tasks (which are referred to by the P) are as hard as another kind of tasks called ""Non-deterministic Polynomial"" tasks (referred to by the NP).<p>I have a second part that tries to explain the difference between determinism and non-determinism using a magic deck of cards where we can always draw the card that we want (the ""magic"" deck is, of course, merely a ""non-deterministic"" deck), but I've already spend an hour or so writing this first part up. I can post the second part of the explanation tomorrow, if folks are interested.<p>[1]: This is meant to be a memory constraint. Obviously, radix sort takes linear time too if the key sizes are constant, but has a memory overhead of N. As far as I'm aware–and please correct me if I'm wrong–the fastest sorting algorithms with constant memory overhead are comparison-based sorting algorithms, which take N lgN time. But, even if I am wrong, it's incidental to the main purpose of the explanation.",1316130048

3002481,comment,2999096,2999751,1,0,TheCondor,,,"The biggest difference between OpenSource and what's going on with Silverlight is that there is a lot more, possibly even complete transparency with the OpensSource and you have options.  I think if you do just a minimal amount of investigation you can get a good idea if a project is healthy or not.   Likewise, you ultimately do have the source,  you can look at it,  understand it and decide if you can maintain it on your own or not.  There isn't even a straight answer with Silverlight.<p>With Silverlight,  they're going to suffer the same fate IBM did with OS/2.    First they don't know what they want to do, it was a ""me to"" product because they thought Adobe was getting too powerful or worried about DOA JavaFX,  it might live, it might die,  they don't know.   Second, they don't know what to tell develoeprs that have invested in it,  these people don't retarget to your other technologies,  many of them leave after getting burned like that.   Mixed messages come out,  ""they're completely committed"" but their actions might not suggest that.  The third step, they will retarget it and say something like 'Silverlight is really for x,y,z applications'  maybe throw in a little 'we never really intended for it to replace the web or flash.'   Ultimately, they pull the plug,  any other company might attempt to sell the technology to a 3rd party to try and breath life into it or to make maintenance money from the few true believers that are left,  I've not known MS to do that and even if they did,  the damage is done once the uncertainty starts.<p>Just that fact that people are asking if Silverlight is dead pretty much dooms it.  MS has 2 options,  let it die or show some kind of overwhelming support and double down.   Anybody know how many companies have really bought in to it?",1316128375

3002477,comment,3002308,3002308,15,0,drewcrawford,,,"Source:  I've run an iOS contracting company for the last three years.  Here are some big problems:<p>* Lead qualification.  This is an enormous problem.  Lots of people want revenue sharing deals, etc., and it takes too long to work out whether they're serious about the project and whether I'm the right fit.  What do they do for a living?  Is this a corporate or personal project?  etc.<p>* Client acquisition cost.  Most of the options out there for advertising, etc., don't have a good ROI.  It's super difficult to measure advertising effectiveness because you only have a handful of ""conversions"" (new clients) and thus your results are never statistically significant.  It's all black magic and voodoo.<p>* Pricing.  We do 99% fixed quote so hourly rate isn't really the issue. In my market, you adjust the scope to fit the budget, not adjust the budget to fit the scope.  The problem is that clients play very close to the vest on what they want to spend, meaning I have to guess what they want to spend.  If I guess right, I get the project, if I guess wrong, I will never hear from them again.  The whole market is a game of chance, not a game of skill.<p>* Slow clients.  It doesn't matter if the feature takes 1 hour or 5 hours if the client takes 4 weeks to get back to you.  Tightening up our business process has improved this considerably from what it used to be, but I imagine a number of contractors experience this schedule unpredictability.<p>* Client education.  Milestones, scope, test builds, etc., are just not in the vocabulary for non-software-background clients.  Why the Estonian firm quoting $2000 for a $20k project is lying.  How to collect crash reports.  How to describe issues so that we can reproduce them.  etc.<p>These problems are WAY bigger than anything you've listed.  But about those:<p>* Project length - Rarely have I thought about this apart from the ""Slow client"" issue.  There are no projects too short, or too long, for me to do, particularly if it's well-paying work.<p>* Good requirements - we usually write them.  Being in the fixed quote business, we're pretty good at it.<p>* Scope creep - this is a minor problem for us, but we've tightened up the business process and are close to completely eliminating it as a problem.<p>* On-time payment - Another minor problem, recent changes to the business process are close to eliminating it.<p>* Negotiating the rate - we rarely do hourly work, so our version of this problem is the ""Pricing"" problem above.<p>If you are working on a startup in this space, please sign me up to give you feedback, as I could go on for hours :-)",1316128158
