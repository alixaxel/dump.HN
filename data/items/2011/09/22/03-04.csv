3024756,comment,3024342,3024679,1,0,kkowalczyk,,,"It's not enough to list the things that web does well. There are many areas in which web hasn't caught with capabilities available for a decade in Windows or Mac<p>Just one example that is particularly painful for me: it's still impossible to build a high quality code editing component on web platform. There are many valiant attempts but none that approaches the speed, quality and convenience of the best desktop editors from 10 years ago.<p>Another one: you can't build an ssh client as a web page because there is not enough socket support. You can do it by going through your own proxy, but that's not secure from the user point of view (you could spy on his traffic without the user knowing it).<p>Those are just two relatively simple things that you can't do on the web and there's much more.<p>Also, the velocity of change in the iOS/Android/Windows compared to velocity in web is not in favor of web. The (only recently added) capabilities you cite are just web catching up with old technologies. Amiga 1000 was doing excellent sound in 1985. Windows XP had vector graphics in 2001 etc. There's nothing to be proud of that we get those things in 2011.<p>iOS/Android/Windows/Mac OS X are being evolved much quickly than the web. They improve on the strengths they always had over web (speed of the apps, more capabilities, new paradigms like touch) and incorporate the best features of the web (integrating cloud storage in latest Mac OS and Windows etc.).<p>Also, the recent increase is standardization is caused mostly because the problem outline by Joe has been partially addressed: Google stepped up as the ""owner"" of the web and most of the recent advances are driven by Google (web sockets, spdy, webm, html5 spec being maintained by a Google employee, V8 forced everyone to raise JavaScript perf etc.).<p>Standard process was a disaster for a long time when it was done by W3C with working groups populated by employees of big companies with conflicting agendas.

Maybe I'm just bad at managing my career or something.</i><p>Sadly, that's about the norm in this industry.<p>There's a reason why the average software engineer burns out after 5 years. The legacy/maintenance burden is a real problem, and it ends a lot of careers.<p>There's a lot to be learned in maintaining <i>one's own</i> projects, and I think everyone should maintain their own stuff, instead of being ""promoted away"" from maintenance, but I think maintaining other peoples' code is only a strong learning experience when the code is of very high quality. In that case, it doesn't feel like maintenance.<p>What happens is that poor maintenance practices lead to more maintenance work in the future, and the norm in the software industry is for maintenance to consume 70-90% of developer time. Sloppy maintenance practices self-perpetuate. With proper practices in place, it should be 30-40% at the worst.<p>The biggest fuckup in the software industry is that maintenance jobs usually get passed to junior programmers who (a) don't know enough to do them properly, and (b) more relevantly, don't have the power to do maintenance properly.  Actually improving the code would require clout in the form of (a) asking people to drop what they're doing and document code they wrote years ago, (b) removing bad functionality from APIs, and (c) having the option of saying, ""we need to rewrite this entirely"" without risking one's job. The junior developers who get the maintenance projects never have that kind of political power, so the result is that the ""maintenance"" doesn't achieve lasting code health improvement.<p>The trick, and very few companies have figured this out, is to create a ""maintenance engineer"" career track, pay it 30% more so that it's desirable and people have to be turned away from it, and delegate legacy maintenance tasks to people who actually have the relevant skills and can actually (imagine this) improve these legacy modules instead of ""maintaining"" them indefinitely. The most important thing is to make sure these engineers actually have enough power/clout to do their jobs properly. Which means the maintenance work should go to people who actually have proven skill and can be trusted, not those who draw last.",1316662725

For example, Alex Russell has been opining recently about the way DOM interfaces are awkwardly adapted to JavaScript due to the committee's insistence on targetting IDL. That's why the W3C could never have invented jQuery.<p>I've been trying to duplicate native scrolling in iOS recently and I'm getting killed by details that the specifications don't cover and WebKit authors don't document. For example, tons of trial and error uncovered the fact that CSS keyframes animations are unusable for elements wider than 1024 pixels, due likely to OpenGL issues on iOS. If the W3C and WebKit had any clue how developers would actually use the stuff they design, they would have made this fact clear by at least providing a way to query the optimal texture size used under the covers.<p>Over and over you find little examples like this which demonstrate that the web's ""leadership"" is completely disconnected from reality on the ground.",1316662183

Like... what if your school ALREADY has a system and you need to live with it?  What if graphs aren't necessary, or even helpful?  I get graphs that show where my kids grades on a standardized test compare to the scores of other kids in their cohort.  These graphs are both trivial to make, and essentially useless at conveying information not contained in the raw numbers.<p>Also, it's CRITICAL to understand the difference between USERS and CUSTOMERS.  If you sell something into schools, the SCHOOL BOARD is your CUSTOMER.  The teachers are your USERS.  You'd better make sure you can sell to the CUSTOMERS.<p>If you think about it, this explains why most school software is so astoundingly horrible:  the CUSTOMERS don't ever have to use it!<p>My hat's off to anyone who wants to sell to this market --- I sure don't have the courage or masochism for it.",1316662146

The reason early computers and radios shipped with manuals and lists of replacement parts is because the technology was young, and things broke.

They have no interest or use for a repair manual with their Macbook Pro.<p>It is much the same as with the juvenille stages of any technology. Automobiles were once notoriously unreliable; old British cars were said to require work every weekend to keep running. Next, American cars had 5-digit odometers, because cars didn't last beyond 100,000 miles. Today, cars routinely go 200,000 miles or more.
