2968419,comment,2968068,2968368,2,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"It depends. I found myself in that situation and just started doing the job, but this requires your boss' approval, since it will take time away from coding and cost money. To do this, you have to have a current gap in product management (as opposed to PMs making bad decisions). This was my path into product management.<p>If you can't get your boss' approval or there is existing product management, you can try sitting down informally with them. Explain your concerns, but be tactful (this part is hard for many engineers who are completely data driven). You have to be careful not to get people defensive. Go in with an attitude of ""I see this as suboptimal, teach me why I'm wrong"" instead of ""You're an idiot, you should be doing this thing instead"". Make sure you are being objective, though. I've had engineers fight me on what ""should"" be done because they were only looking at technology instead of the whole business.<p>If neither of those work, you are probably going to get frustrated quickly. Few things did more damage to my team's morale than feeling like they were working on something useless.",1315371531

Jessica suggested that the answer was ""No"".<p>It seems that product managers are not required when a company is relatively small, and a co-founder has the bulk of his/her time to dedicate to product development. In such a case, a team need be made up of only engineers and designers.<p>Even when teams are larger, new-ish web application frameworks like Rails make deployment incredibly easy/fast and all of the ""strategic thinking"" that a PM might ordinarily contribute is done with live product. In these situations, all of the activities listed in Joseph's blog post - focus, vision, avoiding frankensteinism, customer-centricity - could be handled by a product designer or product-minded engineer.<p>Are product managers a thing of the past?

Lots of scripts which are of the form ""move these files around, run this command on the files, mangle the output, send it to this command to summarize, send to another command to pretty-print"" can be long in line count, but are really well-done in shell.  Basically, operation sequencing, and/or line-by-line file processing.<p>Shell makes it easy to ensure tempfiles are deleted, to catch signals, to automatically check error status of each and every command.<p>As you note, sometimes shell is ""contraindicated"" (as they say in medicine).

What I am against is outsourcing based on the simplistic math that you can get ""3 for the price of 1"" in Bangalore. When we give Bangaloreans(?) work based simply on price and not on their core competencies (and how the outsourced team will work with the rest of the company), then outsourcing won't work.<p>I feel that outsourcing should be done where it makes most sense. For example: if there's any work that needs to be done for the Indian (or South Asian) market, then by all means it makes sense to do it in Bangalore! Or if we have a team of engineers in Bangalore that are rockstars in Android development, then give them Android work!<p>Basically: outsource work to Bangalore if you know that it's the best place to do the work; not just because they're cheaper!

(Ratio of Scala projects that succeeded divided by total Scala projects.)<p>Pollak wants the average doofus Java developer (""COTM"" as he terms them) not to use Scala so that Scala's win rate stays high, even if Scala's absolute number of wins remains low.<p>But having a multitude of doofus developers leads precisely to things that Scala kind of lacks right now, like quality IDE support, idiomatic libraries for every possible use case, and so on.  Without the <i>hoi</i> <i>polloi</i>, why spend a massive number of man years developing IDE support that can efficiently parse incorrect source code in the language as correctly as possible?  Why write idiomatic payment processor code?<p>Similarly, focusing on only the best developers has arguably led languages like Haskell and Lisp to be great languages for learning language constructs and new ways to think, but poor day-to-day languages.  (Though I do recognize that Clojure is gaining ground, etc.)<p>In short, is Pollak right?  Is win rate so critical to adoption of a new language that Scala should kick out the COTM programmers?

Kiln was brand-new at the time, and was a big part of the demo, so I thankfully had an excuse to do the European DevDays stops to answer questions and do demos.<p>And it...well, it starts awesome, if you do it right: you get to see a bunch of stuff you've never seen before, you get to fly first-class if you're lucky, and you meet a bunch of brilliant people.  And I think Joel really likes speaking; if you feel comfortable talking in front of a crowd, it's awesome to see all those people wanting to hear what you have to say.  So in that sense, doing a pile of small DevDays is absolutely wonderful, in my opinion.<p>But then there's dealing with the fact that almost no venue was properly set up properly.  That supplies we badly needed didn't ever quite manage to get where they needed to be in a timely manner (or, in the case of Europe, clear customs at all).  That a major prop we had was going to have to be driven around London in a truck by yours truly.  That we had to have SSDs FedEx'd at tremendous cost because the laptops couldn't comfortably run VMware properly, and that sometimes, it didn't really matter anyway, because something would go wrong with the projector, and you'd end up being forced to use large televisions instead.  Or a speaker would cancel and be replaced at the last second by someone else, or the WiFi would just not be there even though it was absolutely required for someone's demo, or half a dozen other things.  And that's just the stuff that goes wrong <i>at the time</i>; you're leaving out all the stuff that had to be planned beforehand.<p>This wore on me, and I only had just a few stops.  And Joel (and I) did it two years in a row: DevDays first, and the Fog Creek World Tour second.  I <i>have</i> to imagine it wore on him, and I think that might go a long way toward explaining why he tried to consolidate the conferences.<p>But Joel does love travel, and I think DevDays were absolutely wonderful conferences, so that may have absolutely nothing to do with it.  I think it may just be as simple as what he wrote in the post: that they tried to make it bigger and more conference-like...which in turn, made it Not Really DevDays, at which point it was competing with things like OSCON and Open Source Bridge.
