Market-share is entirely irrelevant. What constitutes the definition (the reason the term even exists: what is meant to describe) is not how ""big"" a company is, but the _exclusivity_ (as in: is anyone else allowed to ENTER that sector of the market). And using the words ""effective monopoly"" or ""in practice/real world"" doesn't work as a permission to misuse the term, either. In fact, it does the opposite. Actual real-world ""effective"" monopolies would be: An entity holding a patent for some invention, the State having exclusive control of force, etc, etc.<p>Some company being ""the only company who is currently doing X"" is not a monopoly, as long as anyone else can enter the market.<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monopoly</a><p>BTW many of us developers are totally against the evil ""effective monopoly"" (see what I did there :P) that this not-so-pretty JavaScript language has in the world of web development, so the idea of more options doesn't sound bad at all.<p>Because last time I checked, there was no axiomatic law embedded in the fabric of the universe which stated that ""Every desired improvement and/or business endeavor in the realm of browser scripting should be expressed in the form of a proposal for a next version of JavaScript, over at <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org</a>, or else the oh-so-heavenly multilateral dimension of the interweb net will fragment and spiral down eventually collapsing into a black hole made of kittens""<p>Dart is probably going to suck, though (and Java-stained ideas polluting its design will probably be the cause).

Do you know you have a job for at least 12-18 months?  If so, I'm not seeing the significant risk that warrants a significant equity bump.

Also, what does the angel financing look like...if it's convert capped or even better for you, the Yuri convert/uncapped, you don't have that much to worry about pre-A vs. Post A dilution.<p>The dirty secret is startups are a home run only game.

If your goal is to build a system that supports loyalty programs for lots of restaurants, say so.  If that's the case, you probably don't want to build out specific features for this client alone.  Possible sources of revenue could be:<p>1) targeted adds - your app can either serve ads / push notifications to users (if you want to get fancy, you can use a geo-fencing tool to trigger offers).  Everyone wants another point of contact with their users and they'll pay to get it.<p>2) License them the code and allow them to re-release it as a branded app...think of your current product as a white label.  You can keep your app going and allow them to market their white labelled version and acquire their own users.

It is an age old economic strategy, but as far as I know it has never really worked before (from what I remember from economics textbooks). It would only work for a very short time. Say you hoard rice this year and sell only a little rice at exorbitant prices. Peasants the world over would increase their rice production, so next year there would be a lot more rice, plus your warehouses are already stocked to the ceiling with rice from last year. The prices will now be low - either you sell your rice for cheap, or you throw it into the river. In both cases, the attempt was not really worth it.<p>If I'm understanding you correctly, a similar argument was made in 2007 - it's actually really expensive to hoard millions of barrels of oil (which is what was assumed if people were speculating), it wouldn't be easy to hide and nobody had really found any evidence of it. I think Paul Krugman made this argument.<p>Then the bubble went POP pretty spectacularly. I think Krugman eventually admitted he was wrong there.<p>Hoarding wasn't necessary as the price increases from the futures market were transmitted to the actual market for oil (since most oil is bought on futures anyway, very little is bought at spot price) and the speculators weren't actually taking delivery of the oil they were just rolling the contracts forward. I assume a similar dynamic is in play for wheat right now.",1316049176

Touch isn't perfect for everything, and I use the mouse plenty, but it's nice to have both.
