As long as there is a buffer, sure, why would UDP lose packets on localhost?<p>In order to not block your program, you'll have to do it like one always has with non-blocking sockets: have a buffer and poll for the ""write-able"" event.<p>Unix sockets would involve less overhead and provide more security if you only send to localhost.

It achieves the <i>effect</i> of having randomly permuted the input sequence, but it does not <i>actually</i> perform input sequence permutation.<p>> Can you give me an example of that, then?<p>Any tree with nodes that store the number of descendents (weight-balanced search trees, for instance) take Omega(lg n) for finger updates. See also ""Heterogeneous Decomposition of Degree-Balanced Search Trees and Its Applications"" by Shan Leung (""Maverick"") Woo, section 1.1.4 and ""Robust balancing in B-trees"" by Scott Huddleston and Kurt Mehlhorn. They both mention that the original flavors of B-tree have sequences of k insertion and deletion operations where the update costs alone are omega(k).<p><a href=""http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2009/CMU-CS-09-133.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2009/CMU-CS-09-13...</a><p><a href=""http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/Huddleston-Mehlhorn-RobustBalancing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mehlhorn/ftp/Huddleston-Mehlhorn-...</a><p>Another example is repeated insertion and then deletion of a single element in a full binary tree viewed as an AVL tree.

The problem with that thinking is that Netflix then loses the leverage that being able to say that they'll just offer a disc offers them.<p>I'm worried that the studios are like the barbarians at the gates of the Roman/Netflix empire, and that the dark ages and feudalism are looming.

An independent contractor returning after a few months of break?  Absolutely true.  I also saw this.<p>But a US law?  You're right, it may not be a real law.  However, when the legal department comes down and says that contractors cannot stay longer than X months because of a previous lawsuit at a company, I'm going to rightly assume that they don't want to break a law.  And the way you said ""if you are a business walking up to the line of the law"", I'd guess that you agree that there is some sort of law that may be broken if companies aren't careful.<p>I was merely pointing out the real problems that companies face by employing contractors, instead of giving a blanket ""Untruth!"" statement.",1316585007
