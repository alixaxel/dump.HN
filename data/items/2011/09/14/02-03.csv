Normally while commuting on the train or in the evenings, but still...<p>Pet projects are a good proxy for determining whether a developer can actually, you know, develop. Much better than asking trivial algorithm questions or getting someone to figure out a puzzle. They're also good fodder for interviews:<p>* ""Why did you go with this architecture/data structure/library instead of Y?""<p>* ""What's the next step in your roadmap?""<p>* ""Why would I use this?"" / ""Why did you start it?"" / ""What's different about this and project Y?"".<p>My fallback is to get them to provide a code sample ""that they're proud of"", which is not quite as good, but still indicative that they're still thinking about their craft. Hiring based purely on an in-person interview and a CV is incredibly risky - I've seen people who can talk a pretty good line, but write really obnoxious, poorly structured code.<p>Perhaps think of it this way: A critical part of any developer's job is figuring out what tech is coming in the next couple of years, or which is available now and not being used, pushing the envelope of what's possible. Hence why the OP says ""When you tell me that your only projects outside of work are 5+ years old, that is a bad indication...""",1315969114

The length of movie is limited to five seconds; however, the concept of 5Seconds is to establish communication between users by short videos. The system allows users to easily Take, Edit, Add Effects and Watch movies on their iPhone.<p>With 5Seconds, users can make cool videos that is like the last scene of the movie, share those movies on Facebook, Twitter, and 5Seconds Portal, make communication with emotions by adding end credit message, enjoy 5Seconds movies without hassles of registration or any other sign up, and manage movies easily on Album tab, sending 5Seconds contents and events on the application, Shinnosuke Tone, CEO of Miew Inc. said.<p>5Seconds is a similar idea to that of numerous Silicon Valley related companies but instead of photo sharing with added expressions; it uses 5-second video plus the stylish effects with the ability to share on Twitter and Facebook. The time limit of 5 seconds is based on the assumption that most people are not interested in watching personal video for more than 10 seconds, similar to the concept of 140 characters for Twitter.<p>Users can share their 5-second videos to broadcast events such as trips, parties, sport activities, or simple birthday calls to facebook, personal video logs, various scenes where you can take 5 seconds video, and text messages by end credit function.<p>5seconds is currently available in English and is only available on iPhones; however, by year end, it will be able to support Android devices and aims to get 300 million users. 5seconds developers are now also thinking incorporating pre-written messages, quotes, and poems to preloaded videos that will match users emotion.<p>About Miew Inc.<p>Miew Inc is a subsidiary of  Samurai Incubate Inc., established in March 2011 to develop social video service software for smartphones. 5Seconds is the service which user can add effect to the video captured by smartphones and share to Facebook and Twitter.<p>To know more of 5Seconds features, please visit http://www.miew.co.jp or email info@miew.co.jp.

So all together, it literally means ""[when you are] thirsty, [you] can be happy.""

Suprise works here because of the burst of publicity and the ease of purchase.  This approach is based on limited supply and tries to maximize dollars per unit.<p>Microsoft's Windows platform makes money chiefly by selling OS licenses to hardware companies like Dell.  Every month these companies write 8+ digit checks to Microsoft. The multi-year roadmaps involved make surprise a disadvantage.  This approach seeks to maximize $100 licenses.<p>Sony's Playstation platform makes money chiefly by taking a cut from other developers.  Sony convinces someone like EA to develop for their system and makes $5 every time one of us buys an EA game for $50.  The development lead time involved means the announcement has to be at least a year in advance.<p>Amazon's Kindle platform also makes money chiefly by taxing the ecosystem (in this case e-books).  However the lead time to produce an e-book is minimal and so surprise again works.<p>Nintendo puts another twist it -- they make money chiefly by selling blockbuster first party titles on their own platform.<p>Google makes money chiefly by selling ads.

My idea further involved charging the first X merchants only a low flat fee and then at a later point start charging a low % from every transaction.  This % would be based on how many deals actually got used at the business.<p>I wrote about this idea in two earlier HN posts:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2966649\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2978078<p>Today was our first time going to local Washington DC area to spread the word about our venture. This being our first  venture, we now realize that what we did today we should have done a month ago. Anyways, we went from business to business searching for an owner or manager however, at most locations we only founds staff that could only give us a business card. Luckily, we went to one place where the owner was there and told us that what we are doing is already being offered by Scoutmob. It is really bad from our side that we did not know anything about Scoutmob, even though now we know that it was been out for almost 2 years and has secured up to 1.5M in funding. We don't know how much they are charging to the merchant but what we know is that they let users 'get' the deal for free. They pay the merchant directly. Furthermore, this user told gave us the reality of the situation that we don't have services that other deal sites offer. For example, writing great summaries, organizing free events (to create user base), etc. etc. We don't have any of this since we have no funding.<p>I'll be writing a detailed post about our experiences but I'm really disappointed in myself for being a every day visitor to HN and not knowing about Scoutmob. It was only been covered once on HN with one point post: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2813331<p>When we thought our idea was not taken we were skeptical whether it would work but now seeing it in action we realize that it is doable and marketable.<p>We've hit a roadblock and are at a point where we are thinking of changing our business model or completely switching the domain.<p>Would you continue on?",1315968210

Don't think for a second that the Bing brand wasn't overthought on every level. I can guarantee that they considered the Chinese localization before launch. Bing has enough problems gaining market share in markets where Bing has a vaguely positive sound to it.<p>For bona fides, I worked on many projects where we developed localized Chinese names for new and existing global brands. We charged through the nose for this. The numbers you are looking for end in six zeros. This was a couple years ago when China was even more of a black box than it is now and there was a sense of herd panic about getting in. License to print money. Dumb, dumb, dumb.<p>Yes, you should worry about the transliteration, but if you are a western based company and want to move into the chinese market, you have much much much bigger concerns, namely getting shut out by any given joint venture partner that you shack up with, with onerous ""technology sharing"" terms which results in your company getting pillaged and left on the side of the (market) road. Or watch as your market is crowded out by a home grown tech-alike (supported by the chinese government).<p>And this stuff is way overthought most of the time. Coke isn't exactly a positive association on any level (drug, sounds like a bit like slang for other unmentionables, coal).

We make a range of desktop applications including launchers, productivity apps, media apps, games, etc.<p>Because all of these apps are based on a game engine, we get the complex and hard to test bugs that games get (texture cache corruption, null pointers in the scene tree, etc.). There's much more serialization and pressure than with pure games (but still not as much as with enterprise applications) because we're dealing with transactions with 3rd party services, or because a screw up could corrupt a user's whole music collection, or because users don't expect their music player to crash every 4 hours.<p>The game engine adds a huge amount of extra variability to our applications; we have to not only watch out for obscure bugs in our custom script code (which the engine silently tries/fails to execute anyway), but also in the (C/C++ based) game engine it is driving. The upside to using an engine with a simple scripting language is the shorter development times to get things off the ground and the high-performance/shiny visuals, but I feel it costs us much more down the line in terms of stability and extensibility.",1315967491

It might take a little time, but it's easily transferable to any other job applications, and you might even find something interesting to add to your cover letter.<p>I'd treat that at least as well as a pet project, and possibly more so.",1315965747
