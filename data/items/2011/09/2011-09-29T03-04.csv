This argument is similar to ""I don't need water when I'm not thirsty"".  Hardly compelling.<p>>  administrating you servers is something that hardly takes up any time<p>Sure if your servers never get any traffic, or you never scale.<p>> It took me a day's work to configure an EC2 instance, including a deployment workflow with Capistrano (for the first time ever). That server is still running just fine, with no further maintenance.<p>Right, it took me less than a minute to do that with heroku, and with less dependencies (on capistrano).  When I decide my app needs an extension written in node, that is another minute on deployment for me, and another day for you.  I'd gladly compete on those terms :)<p>> And if small deployments is not Heroku's strength, than what is? If you've got a successful app that needs special infrastructure care and you can't afford a good developer/sysadmin to take care of it, then you're doing it wrong.<p>This is just your highly opinionated view of things.  Who ever said anything about 'special infrastructure'... Heroku deal in commodity infrastructure (that's the point).  You also never successfully made the point that small deployments are not their strength.",1317268347

3051055,comment,3050603,3050803,9,0,justlearning,,,"another perspective as someone who frequented edison(indian food - oak tree road!) and lived near by - there's a swarm of small bodyshops, who pay bit more than market rate.My  experience is that this ""market rate"" as per stats is what newcomers get for the first couple of years. (these newcomers are typically not well todo back home.)As these 'new' H1 hires gain market experience, they either negotiate or move on to some other small bodyshop. The big corps like Oracle don't pay as much for similar roles. As the o.p rightly discovered, most commute to NYC (go to edison station at 7.30am). (I don't know if this may have lead few banks to move their dev/it operations to NJ:) ). I know of some companies that didn't pay med insurance for more than 2 years. Few years ago, a top guy of a similar bodyshop was sent to prison for 'buy a green card' scheme he employed using employment immigration loop holes. Every year there are few companies that are in news for the wrong reasons. From what I saw, the non-passionate-just-work-for-pay guy who has worked in the US jumps to start a bodyshop after he has gotten his GC(greencard). It's very lucrative and luring on paper (you get n number of guys working on several clients and you make x over each guy - think 'pimping') I hope it has changed in the recent years.<p>But this is changing. As more Indians are aware of better opportunities back home (and with the next gen Indian being more affluent than earlier generation), lot of them stay back. It's only the crude who go on and take the bait from the companies.<p>fwiw, adding to yummyfajitas- it's not only the social separation of state/ethinicity; there's also an abstract eliteness that goes with bank-dev and non-bank - doesn't matter if you are with akamai in piscataway(neighbouring edison). :)",1317268191

It's similar to those ""rich"" people who are demanding to pay higher taxes. That's a nonsense argument because they can donate to the US Treasury just as a dev could donate to the TextMate guy. I am tired of people suggesting to other people how to spend everyone else's money. If you want to pay more -- do it yourself.<p>For the rest of us, I'll pay what I'm required and donate if I feel so inclined. I'd personally rather donate to the Tiny Wings guy simply because paying $60 for a text editor is fairly steep, if you aren't getting the version 2 update for free. And Tiny Wings has better music. Logic Studio is only $299, compared to a text editor's $60 and Xcode is free. The amount of coding that went into Logic is light years beyond TextMate, but Apple knows that if they charged $1000 for it (a fair price based on feature set, they'd lose more revenue than charging $299.) I'm not a business school guy, but I do know a thing or two about demand elasticity. Try charging $4.99 for an app in the App Store and charge $1.99 -- you'll make more money at $1.99, unless it's some highly niche product; TextMate is far from highly niche. It's ubiquitous.<p>I have paid for TextMate and have no problems doing so, but I'll be damned if some jackass suggests that we should pay more. That's a business decision to be made by the TextMate dev, not some user who likely has very little experience in selling software to the public. No offense to anyone, but based on the posting, it appears that the author has little understanding of demand curves, not to mention contractual agreements.",1317266543
