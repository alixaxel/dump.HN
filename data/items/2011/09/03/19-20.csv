2957984,comment,2957212,2957438,2,0,neilho,,,"Some good points here. As I mentioned in the article, focusing on the benefits is 'virtually' holy writ. B2B selling and selling to specialists is a bit of an exception because for this market, features are important. For the trade buyer, being in the industry themselves, features can be important because they automatically make the link to the benefits due to their expert knowledge. However, trade buyers are generally price and speed conscious and so your copy would need to focus on how you can get them the goods quickly and cheaply - the correct benefits for this market.<p>High performance car experts (and experts in any field) are another interesting market. They too can make the link between features and benefits that bit more easily than the non-expert. However, doesn't having a car packed with high-end features satisfy their need to show-off their knowledge and spending potential to their friends (feelings of pride)? It is less features over benefits in this case but more features as being synonymous with benefits (and there's always that old cliche about the husband who is irritated because his wife won't accept his chosen car because it isn't available in pink!) Nhebb is right - it all does depend on the target market but tptacek is equally right - you have to focus on the correct benefits.<p>And as for a good copywriting course - the AWAI course is highly recommended by many top copywriters.

2957975,comment,2957658,2957658,1,0,ansy,,,"I don't think a touch based eInk Kindle is coming this year. I predict Amazon is going to try to use the same Android-based OS from the Kindle Tablet for the touch based eInk Kindle. Amazon will need to completely abandon the existing Kindle OS and remake the device from the ground up to add touch and other capabilities.<p>This should push out the development schedule considerably compared to past releases which were already long. The Kindle 2 came out 15 months after the first Kindle. And the Kindle 3 came out 18 monts after the Kindle 2. If history is any indication I'd be surprised if the Kindle 4 came out before Q1 2012 and frankly I think Q3 is more realistic.<p>It's possible the new Kindle will use Mirasol. But if it does, even Q3 might be agressive. Mirasol's production capacity is nowhere near enough to meet the demand for a Kindle device and it takes a while to build up the parts inventory even for less exotic components. I kind of think Mirasol isn't going to work because it won't be able to keep up with competing technologies by the time it's production ready just like PixelQi. A black and white eInk display just seems much more likely.",1315079174

Yet for practical purposes, a week ago there was no supernova there. Today a supernova is there.<p>It may help you to look at it like this: a supernova is NOT the star exploding, it is the observation of the star exploding. In one sense, this is wrong, but in another it is really the only freaking thing a supernova can be. Therefore since it wasn't a supernova until humanity saw it being a supernova, it is currently happening.<p>Further, the article only says the supernova is brightening, and that the telescope saw the star early in its explosion a few hours ago. From the reference point of observability, no claim is made that something 21million light years away is being watched now, just the effects of it are being watched right now.<p>Relax and go watch the show.",1315079166

Paypal accounting gets incredibly complicated, but basically, if A agrees to buy B's widget on eBay for $100 with $10 of eBay fees, eBay gets the $10 from B's credit card and, a short period later, A pays B directly through a subsidiary which Very Carefully (TM) never puts the $100 on eBay's balance sheet or under their direct control.  eBay doesn't call it revenue because <i>eBay can't spend that money</i>.<p>Groupon <i>can spend that money</i>.<p>There are many businesses which make active use of money that is owed to other people prior to actually paying it.  Warren Buffets owns a lot of insurance companies.  A huge portion of his investment operations are funded by float: basically, you have to pay him premiums and then he gives them back to you when (statistically speaking) your house burns down some years later.  In the interim, it's his money, and if he manages float correctly it buys a company like e.g. Coca Cola on a continuous basis.<p>Or: take Bingo Card Creator as an example at the waaaaay opposite end of the scale.  Many of my sales come through Google ads.  It is basically economically equivalent to giving them 50% of the purchase price of 50% of my sales -- in fact, there is a Google pricing option which would make that exactly equivalent.  However, crucially, I do not pay Google contemporaneously with the sale: like Groupon, our contractual arrangement means I pay them quite a bit later.<p>Ads placed on September 4th turn into sales on, statistically, September 5th which turns into money in my bank account on roughly September 7th.  I get invoiced for the ads on approximately September 25th and then have until October 20th to pay my credit card prior to paying a penny of interest.<p>This means that I'm generally holding a couple of thousand of dollars of ""Google's money"" in my pockets at any given time.  (It goes up and down depending on what time of the year this is.  At the moment, it's a little under $1.5k off the top of my head.) Crucially, <i>I can spend it</i>.  I'd have to replace it prior to summer (when the float tends to evaporate, due to how my market works), but if I want to replace a laptop or pay for a plane ticket for a couple months without having to pay credit card interest rates or dip into savings, I can take the money I was going to pay to Chase to pay Google in October, and then instead pay Chase in October with the money I was going to pay them in November, and then... you get the general picture.",1315078663

However, I am still fairly sure, although not 100% certain, that homeless people, technically, cannot have a valid driver's license, cannot receive mail, and they cannot, legally, do other, assorted, connected things, such as: have a bank account, own Internet domains, hold a passport, vote, or travel (via Amtrak and Greyhound). There is a big difference between the lofty ideals of our federal constitution and the practical nature of daily reality. Cities and states regularly get away with lots of anti-constitutional behavior, particularly against the homeless, partly because that segment of the population isn't represented by powerful lobbyists.<p>I am homeless, and so, my original comment was not merely hypothetical. I live in Philadelphia, which is, according to Wikipedia, the fifth most-populous city in the United States. Texas sounds rather laid back, but that's not the way it is here. Every day, I feel as if I am ""an outlaw, flaunting convention and decency"" because not having what's considered a ""legal"" residence is generally seen as a major indicator of there being something seriously wrong with me. Lacking a fixed address should not effectively make me a criminal.<p>You mention MBE. I just went to their website, and the first thing that catches my attention is a news item [1] stating that I need to show ID to send a package, via UPS, from an MBE location, unless I already have a shipping label prepared from an existing UPS account. On a related note, this reminds me that FedEx here doesn't take cash. Anyway, there doesn't seem to be an MBE in Philadelphia, but other mailbox places that I have come across all require ID [2] and most require me to fill out a form [3] which tells the Post Office that the mailbox provider has my authorization to handle my mail. It is impossible for me to (honestly, legally, or however you want to put it) fill out that form. Also, even if I could, somehow, get a mailbox, it would create yet another red flag on my credit reports, because the credit agencies mark, as suspicious, any address which receives mail for many different people.<p>I've been removed from life's DNS. :(<p>ICANN you hear me?<p>[1] <a href=""http://mbe.com/ps/Pages/PhotoID.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mbe.com/ps/Pages/PhotoID.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://southstreetbusinesscenter.net/mailbox_rental"" rel=""nofollow"">http://southstreetbusinesscenter.net/mailbox_rental</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://virtualpostmail.com/ps/308/usps-form-1583-in-5-minutes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://virtualpostmail.com/ps/308/usps-form-1583-in-5-minute...</a>",1315076466
