Map/reduce is popular for limiting the scope of computations so they can execute in parallel with shared-nothing, which imposes very different roles on them. A mapper should be a pure function which takes a single input value (it can't rely on seeing more of the input than that) and produces a collection (not necessarily a list but some monad like that which the framework can join over) of values having an equivalence relation. A reducer should be a pure function which takes a collection of all values in one equivalence class (it can rely on seeing all of them from any mapper, but not any other values) and produces whatever (again, some collection monad so the framework can join over the collection-of-collections).",1317278880

It also means that a popular song will never stop being a source of income with a streaming service, as opposed to downloads where every user pays for the song only once.<p>About the privilege of selecting songs, according to the numbers in the article you pay 23 times (or maybe 12 times, it's a bit unclear) as much for being able to do so than you do if someone else selects the song for you.<p>Also, unless I'm mistaken it's the recoding's copyright owner - the label in most cases - that gets paid, and they in turn pay the artist.
