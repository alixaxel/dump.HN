If my performance gradually degraded year after year, I'd expect to be talked to about that, and fired if I didn't improve.<p><i>Besides, seniority is already reflected in the salary.</i><p>Sorta -- they base salaries on average where you live for a similar job + a little bit.  That's a different kind of seniority than the bonus depends on.<p>I question how ""fair"" a bonus structure really can be.  At my last company bonuses were entirely random, and weren't always fair: I received several bonuses (that I do believe I deserved), but there were many others who should have been recognized as well on different occasions who weren't.<p>The bonus here is sort of a macro performance level.  Everyone gets to share in the profits of the company when the company does well, and they share somewhat proportionally based on how long they've been with the company.  Assuming the company is doing a good job of making sure everyone is performing well and not allowing people to slack off, it's a reflection of your loyalty to the company.  And for a startup, it's also maybe a reflection of the amount of risk you took on (employee #1 took on loads, employee #75 took on much less) when you joined.<p>Then again, maybe I'm just jealous; I've never worked for a company with a profit-sharing plan, but would like to.  It feels much more equitable than the traditional stock-option route most companies go for.  Though the upside is that for stock options, you just need to stick around until they vest, while with profit sharing you need to stick around until the company is profitable, and you only get payouts while you're still there.  Pros and cons to everything, I guess.",1315876952
