On the face of it one might expect Jevons paradox[1] to take hold, but I guess a home is a pretty closed system and there aren't too many new places to use power. More gadgets, yes, but a person can only use so many gadgets at once.<p>I for one find myself wanting to install more subtle light now that my power bill is so low (almost completely 10W, 13W and 18W CFLs). I started wondering where I can get creative, such as putting 0.5, 1 or 2 watt under-the-cupboard lights to gently illuminate the kitchen counters. I already have some brass wall-mounted ""candles"" that use 0.5 watt bulbs; they are nice and subtle night lights, and leaving them on all year round would be less than 8 dollars a year.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox</a> (see especially <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox#Khazzoom-Brookes_postulate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox#Khazzoom-Brookes...</a>)",1315882708
2989755,comment,2989490,2989490,1,0,hackerblues,,,"I believe that a common problem for people who are proof reading documents is the brains tendency to complete patterns based on partial information. This causes a person to read not what is actually written but instead what they expect to read.<p>For example, if you had seen the cliched sentence ""The cat sat on the mat"" tens of times over your lifetime then you might tend to skim ahead and miss the mistake in ""The cat sat on the met.""<p>One approach to reduce this problem is to consciously direct your attention in such a way as to reduce your own expectations. Some common tactics include:<p>1. Take a break in between writing the text and editing it. The common advice for writing essays in school is to leave your draft shut up in a drawer for a few days before returning to it.<p>2. Examine each word in the text in a way which separates it from the context of the sentence it is written in. You could do this by physically pointing at each word with a finger/pen as you read it, or by reading the text backwards from the last word to the first.<p>The above might increase your ability to spot a spelling mistake but will do little to assist whole-sentence grammatical mistakes. My best advice for that task is to read the text out loud. I find it much easier to hear such a mistake than to see it.<p>For the problems with reading you might wish to do some research on ""active reading"". Reading with a question in mind can help you to properly concentrate on the material.<p>The question might relate to a specific piece of information, eg skimming through a tutorial to discover ""What arguments does the make_widget command take?""<p>The question could also be focused on the structure of the text, eg ""What is the main idea of this paragraph?"", ""How could I rewrite this complicated sentence in my own words?"", or ""How does the evidence introduced in this paragraph relate to the claim stated at the beginning of the chapter?""",1315882694

What this should really be is a mandatory convention.<p>Ultimately, I have no interest in making it easy for bad programmers to program.  This is Java's biggest problem -- it claims to help prevent bad code, which people want, but it doesn't actually do that.  Its ""bad code prevention features"" actually have the opposite effect; they makes writing good code an ordeal that requires great patience, skill, and tools.<p>The major problem with Java is that because code is so difficult to write, people are afraid to delete it.  Deleting code is the best possible thing a programmer can do, and Java discourages by causing programmers to value bad code.  That's what's terrible about it.<p>(One big problem I see in the programming field in general is that everyone tries to put their prototypes into production.  Then they wonder why their code is hard to maintain and it has a lot of bugs.  The answer: you didn't know enough about the problem you were trying to solve when you started, so now you have a mess.  Throw it away and start with complete understanding.  Then you'll be able to build your application correctly.

Hello, I'm here, and you're not deposing me, so drop the lawyer talk.<p>Also, try to pay attention to the historical correlation of market forces: XHR came in when Microsoft was a monopoly:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest#History_and_support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest#History_and_supp...</a><p>Even then, it was new and optional, and we cloned it into Mozilla (Opera cloned it too). It was pretty simple compared to anything like Dart or NaCl's Pepper APIs.<p>Ok, look where we are today: no monopoly power, but Google arguably acting like one. That won't lead to reverse-engineering without a much less balanced market.<p>First, the reverse-engineering costs of Dart are much higher than of XHR.<p>Second, the more balanced competition won't make any browser follow instead of lead. We could indeed end up with two problems (three, counting JS), as just happened with WebSQL and IndexedDB. Dart, and Microsoft's new language Phart, say. :-P<p>Glib ""shoot first, ask standards bodies later"" is a recipe for fragmentation and non-interoperation. Even if standards are written (years later, for XHR; never for VBScript and ActiveX and a great many examples you conveniently ignore), they don't offset the up front costs.<p>And here's the kicker: if you get your wish, there won't be one interoperable superior language ruling the roost until that later standardization step, if it even happens. If there's no monopoly or duopoly power structure, you'll just have the ""inferior"" language (JS) and spotty support for the ""superior"" one.<p>It seems to me that a lot of you ""bring on our new overlords"" boosters are unaware of how HTML5 came about.

Given what they have accomplished and their road to where they are today, you would think that they would spearhead such ventures, but when you have made your $$$$’s, it’s a comfortable place to be.<p>But let’s explore their observation that ""real, deep innovation is not taking place in today’s market"" (from techcrunch article; <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/max-levchin-and-peter-thiel-innovation-in-the-world-today-is-between-dire-straits-and-dead/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/12/max-levchin-and-peter-thiel...</a>).  This has some truth in it, especially when you consider that many tech startups in the last 5 years have been a ‘mish-mash’ of other companies from the past (do I really need more photosharing apps?)  Today’s startups are really not tackling world-changing problems - so my question is, ""Why?""  I came up with three general reasons: 1) people are not thinking outside the box - rather than coming up with a new security patch, why not ask yourself, ""why did we start using patches in the first place""; 2) Levchin touched upon it in the article, ""the overall risk-taking culture has declined"" - Nobel laureate, Barry Marshall ingested H. Pylori himself to prove that ulcers were caused by bacteria; we lack risk takers in tech; and finally (coming back full circle on this ‘hypocrisy’) 3) GREED.  Many startups focus on making $ and once they make their $$$, many (not all) do not put $ back into disruptive research - some put more $$ into other ‘mish-mash’ startups to make more $$$ (right, Levchin and Thiel?).  Compare a democratic country like the US - lots of innovationn.  And now compare China - not so much innovation, but they sure are making a lot of $$$ (solar panels, anyone?).  We’re good at putting a man on the moon, but that’s not going to make us $$$.  Today, it’s all about making $ and that’s what’s stifling innovation.",1315879713
