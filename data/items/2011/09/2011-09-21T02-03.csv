Surely it can't be that the diagram is abstract... Diagrams are by nature abstract.<p>IIRC, the key to <i>CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc.</i> (about credit card risk assessment over the internet) was in the precise wording of the claims - they didn't use the word ""internet"", even though that was how the invention was described. The thing is, the description in a patent is just ""one embodiment"" of the invention, and it is up to the claims to be clear about the actual scope of the invention. Claim too much and you're dead.<p>That's why most inventions have a series of dependent claims of decreasing scope - if the court finds one is too broad, the next one might be OK. A ridiculously broad first claim does no harm - provided you confine it later. From reading several patents, I've formed the impression that the first claim is often used as a sort of framework ""here's the basic idea"", and its wording is more to do with making it convenient to hang the other claims on than intrinsic merit.",1316573967

3020544,comment,3019351,3019715,10,0,mcantor,,,"You have a daily stand-up at 9:30, so even though you get in at 9, you don't bother starting anything because the stand-up will cut it short as soon as you get rolling.  The stand-up is supposed to be 10 minutes, tops, but regularly balloons into a half-hour behemoth.  You make your daily sojourn to Starbucks with the other developers and get back to your open work area at 10:15.  There's a business user waiting for you.  You develop internal tools and the brass is too cheap to employ a support staff, so <i>you</i> are level 1.  They're supposed to open a support ticket and assign it to you instead of walking over to your desk, but you've already sent them packing the same way three times this week, and  it looks like they're ready to cry, so you open a new browser window and ask what the problem is.  You end up having to pull in a sysadmin, and after an hour, the two of you determine that it's a problem with a third-party service, so you open a support ticket with <i>them</i> and tell the business user you'll keep them updated.<p>It's now 11:15.  The developers start lunch at around 11:30 - noon every day, so there's no reason to get started on anything now.  You get back from your hour lunch break at 12:45.  There's a meeting on your outlook calendar at 1 o' clock, but you read the description and decide to skip it since there are already enough developers on the docket to give enough input.  You're just gathering momentum at 1:05 when the Project Manager who organized the meeting appears at your desk, asking you to come to the meeting.<p>""I have a lot on my plate; the other two devs know enough about the system to keep the ball rolling.""<p>""Well,"" she counters, ""I really need everyone's input for this meeting.""  (Just like every other meeting.)<p>""There are 20 people on the invite list... if there are any problems, I'm sure I can just follow up with you after you send out the meeting minutes.""<p>""Look, I really need you here for this; this isn't a skippable meeting.""  (None of hers are.)  Finally you fold--you didn't take this job because you were a go-getter who knows how to tell people ""no"" repeatedly.  The meeting is scheduled for 1PM - 2PM, but (like most meetings at this company), it goes until 2:30.<p>You get back to your desk and there are a dozen new IMs and e-mails blinking on your screen.  You fantasize about just closing everything and working, but you've been here long enough to know that un-answered IMs and e-mails <i>will</i> result in people walking over to your desk, just like the jilted business user from this morning.  For a couple of months you managed to put your foot down, mark yourself as ""busy"" in Outlook for the afternoon, and tell people that you simply won't deal with any non-critical problem during that period, but hearing complaints about issue turnaround time come through your boss was too much of a drain.<p>You answer IMs, follow up on e-mails, flip through high-priority code reviews and take care of other necessary busywork for about an hour and a half.<p>At 4PM, you get started on your work.",1316573631

The SGI required this special graphics card from Number Nine, which ended up going bankrupt, thus ending driver availability.

If it isn't Java, I'm sure it's some flavor of .Net.<p>The point wasn't that Java = easy, so let's use Java, rather, that the entire mindset of the Enterprise is that THEY don't understand the craft at all.  They believe they can swap out developers as easily as they can swap out help desk workers (which also seems easy in theory, but isn't in practice -- a great help desk tech is worth their weight in gold.)<p>As their intent is to reduce IT workers to a commodity, I would also venture that it's harder to hire the truly talented (more often than not.)  The focus isn't on technical excellence, it's on baseline competence, ability to follow SDLC workflows and, basically, to develop <i>consistent</i> amounts of code so that scheduling is as repeatable a process as possible.<p>There are exceptions to everything, of course, but I'm speaking from my experience working in and consulting for Fortune 50 companies and Federal Government, where the behavior I described is possibly more prevalent than somewhere like Cisco or EMC (read: technology companies), but I stand behind the position as more the rule and less the exception.",1316573237

You could look into the ""leverage open source, sell training/consulting/more usable packages"" approach as done by companies like enthought (they work on scipy, and sell courses/etc).<p>I'm a big fan of the enthought approach, my biggest gripe about the matlab/mathematica approach is that I usually couldn't package/optimize/distribute my code. The exception to that is labview, but they're more hardware-centric.<p>In the semiconductor industry, I have watched another german company called plexim start in the past few years offering cross-platform mixed-signal tools. The other competitors seem pretty small and usually pursue turn-key consulting agreements instead of licensing underlying libraries so the end customer can make a more integrated experience.<p>Cliff Notes: perhaps see if you can find a market to sell distributable easy scientific APIs for you end customers so they can prototype/package/distribute things without too many headaches.",1316573148

You could make a book of parent survival tips and how-tos by asking their family and friends to answer the question, What do you know now that you wish you did before having kids?<p>Or, maybe youre heading to a wedding and are hunting for the perfect gift.  You could make a book for the new bride and groom that asks, Whats the secret to having a happy marriage? and fill the pages with answers from everyone invited to the wedding.<p>Or maybe you know a recent graduate that's getting ready to launch out into the world. You could make a book filled with advice and instructions for succeeding in life written by their family, friends, teachers and coaches.<p>Hopefully you're getting the idea. Our books make it easy to give the gift of experience and encouragement to someone you care about. Because life, after all, doesn't come with instructions.",1316573050

There are a lot of people with very negative views of corporations roaming around the internet<p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a> will cause them to view goodhearted actions in a negative light, and genuinely think they're right<p>3. Therefore an important goal of PR is to include falsification ammunition alongside announcements that are likely to be misunderstood<p>Less abstract breakdown:<p>It's pretty clear that most people would prefer a car that instead of just saying ""please find someone to fix my xyz"" says ""please find someone to fix my xyz, and fyi Foo Dealership will likely be the most convenient"" -- maybe my friends and I are just lazier than average, but that actually sounds great for me, and I could see several friends really appreciate not having to spend the time picking out a repair shop. This is especially true if they handle figuring out who is certified to do warranty covered repair work.<p>So GM likely thinks of this sort of application as a small to medium win: GM cars are somewhat less hassle to own, and maybe last a bit longer on average / get a higher average resell value because people are getting things repaired sooner rather than later.<p>However, because people will think ""oh, they're just doing it for the sale"" (which they are in this case, just not the one-shot-sale but instead the generations long brand building approach), GM should announce both at the same time, and include a few points that obviously invalidate the fly-by-night opinion -- Do they recommend places based on Yelp reviews + distance? Do they even take money from repair shops when recommending? Do they use wait times and the urgency of the repair as the primary criteria?<p>Basically if GM included some answers to questions like the above as ammunition, then when journalists / analysts / online message board readers get in to arguments about this question, GM is significantly less likely to come out looking evil.",1316570886

3020407,comment,3018073,3018073,6,0,danenania,,,"Something about this mindset is depressing to me. Obviously we all want to get shit done, and every company wants to hire people that get shit done, but this definition of 'get shit done' seems very narrow and robotic. The author seems to want to evaluate a programmer's efficiency the same way we evaluate the efficiency of an assembly line or a sorting algorithm.<p>The problem is that the smartest, most creative, and overall most productive people often don't think this way at all. Instead of slogging away obediently at a problem for six hours, they might dilly-dally on twitter for two hours before having a lateral insight that lets them solve the problem in 15 minutes. They might go to Thailand for the first 3 weeks of a 4 week project then, in a semi-sleepless 100 hour binge, produce a technical masterpiece with a beautiful UI and additional business-savvy features no one else could have thought of thrown in on the fly. Would it be better for your company if this person just sat at his or her desk and focused perfectly and coded 10 hours a day like a good little robot? Does it matter? The same qualities that make some people brilliant will tend to make them unable or unwilling to work like this. You can gripe about irresponsibility or lack of discipline, but they are indeed getting shit done, just not the same way you do. You can pass on them because they don't fit your mold if you like--a more open-minded company will quickly be there to capitalize on the value they offer.",1316570417
