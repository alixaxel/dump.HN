I was about 23 years old and found the experiences to be overwhelmingly positive. At the time (70's) the counter culture was well underway and there were many fellow travellers who would advise on the importance of the setting and also (sounds kinda corny now) that one should make the whole thing sacred and not treat it as just a buzz. Also there were many apocriphal stories of people who had gone on trips and hadn't come back.",1317376631

When you go with a proprietary developer platform like Visual Studio you are outsourcing a lot of little headaches to Microsoft whose job it becomes to make your life easier.  The problem is if Microsoft decides to drop their clue off in the weeds somewhere you have to either start writing pleading letters to Ballmer or make a huge jump to some other platform.

3056352,comment,3054509,3055753,3,0,barrkel,,,"You have overloaded play in a very specific way in your response; playing an instrument. I'd have preferred it if you'd chosen something else, because I think it introduces a third meaning for play (specific to instruments) apart from both the focused play like that of a child and something an adult pursues casually (which I doubt should be called play).<p>My hobby (as well as my only form of transport) is motorbikes. I do it for over an hour every day. I'm definitely getting better at it, because of an iterative process of analysis and experimentation. If I just looked at it as a means of transport, I wouldn't be so eager to stretch myself; I'd be content with getting from A to B in a safe and not very efficient manner.<p>It's completely different to programming, so in some ways it is relaxing; it's certainly highly enjoyable; but it is also simultaneously energizing and tiring. It uses a completely different part of my brain, and gets the adrenaline going.<p>I think if guitar-playing was my hobby, I'd be focused on improving and having an iterative experimentation / analysis cycle. But if guitar-playing was something I did to make music, perhaps to entertain other people, then the focus is elsewhere. It would no longer be play; it would merely be doing.<p>What I'm getting at is that play (my definition of it, at least) necessarily implies stretch goals, doing things that you have room to improve at, because without challenge it's boring. What makes it different from work is intrinsic motivation, and hence the lack of a need for application of will.<p>But you're right in another respect, this is all coming down to a disagreement over the use of words, rather than a disagreement in concepts etc. The start of the presentation just rubbed me the wrong way, and I've made far too much out of this small thing...",1317376371

Sure - a spaceship exploding and killing the crew is quite spectacular, but when you build a company like SpaceX, you build it with the knowledge that something like this <i>will</i> happen.<p>With every manned flight, you have the procedures in place for the catastrophic failure, and when it happens, you execute ""Plan Red"".
