For US people, that would consume most of your ""socially acceptable"" vacation time allotment during a calendar year.  That particular year, my 3 week vacation was scheduled for September and I get laid off in July, so yes, it <i>was</i> entirely bad.<p>At my next job there was an annual allotment of 3 weeks of vacation that accrued little by little every pay period.  I was able to ""borrow"" time from the next year so that I could take my already-booked vacation.  And, for the duration of that job, I maintained a negative vacation-time balance vowing to not get screwed again.<p>Unfortunately, whenever I hear of the ""fantastic unlimited vacation time benefit,"" I can only view it as a way for the CEO to milk an extra month of work out of employees before laying them off at no cost.",1315716880

More to that apology, a re-read of your comment leaves me wondering just what I was thinking. Alas, I'll continue with my thoughts; feel free to ignore them or consider them OT; I apologize.<p>My point might be summarized or expressed in a different way. I worked with .NET for the last 12 months and I can remember (just off the top of my head) 4 distinct issues that were trivial to fix but where not documented or described anywhere. They were weeks of work. On the other hand, I'm working with non-Microsoft tools and languages now, and I've had more than three of these scale of issues resolved in <i>literally</i> less than a minute in an IRC channel, and if not, in a tweet, or a forum post.<p>My joke is that if Google/Binging is not productive in a .NET technology/tool/etc, my next best hope is posting on a forum with ridiculously buggy forum-software, and waiting two weeks for a response. There have been more than one post about this phenomena on HN as well. To be clear, I don't necessarily think this is a ""Microsoft problem"", I'm just not sure why the tactics and resources available for more open or community-<i>based</i> projects are so vastly different than the .NET/Azure/Windows scene (again, in <i>my</i> experience).",1315716698

KDevelop features a world-class semantic framework that already provides it with top-of-the-line C++ support, but that's also proving to be up to the challenge of supporting a dynamic language decently - KDev-Python is certainly still fairly immature, but it already boasts semantic abilities that blow most of its commercial competitors out of the water, like collecting function argument types by the types of objects used at call sites, and tracking the types of list contents (Wing does the former to a degree, and Microsoft's Python tools for VS do the latter, but in both I've seen test cases fail that work well in KDevelop).<p>KDevelop also has a really nice 'semantic syntax highlighting' ability where the same thing (say, a variable) is shown in the same color through all control flow, which is already working well with the Python plugin.<p>A first beta of the plugin is supposed to be out soon.<p>(Disclaimer: I'm a KDE developer, but not involved directly with KDevelop.)",1315716575

Are you really suggesting someone doesn't value their time because they bought an Air over an X220 with a SSD? You understand that such an assertion is ridiculous, right?<p>Here's a ""point"" for you: given the economic concept of utility, are you shocked that someone would pass on an X220 + Vertex in favor of an Air and a month of groceries? How about the idea that the marginal benefit of a Vertex 3 over an Air may be tiny enough to some that they'll pass?<p>We haven't even discussed failure rates, which are anecdotally bad on older Vertexes; can you blame someone for choosing an Air, along with 3 years of service at any Apple Store?<p>Also, another ""point"" for you: I sincerely doubt you would've responded like that in person, so you should probably re-read HN's commenting rules and think twice next time.",1315716179
2983232,comment,2983109,2983208,2,0,latch,,,"<i>sigh</i>...seriously?<p>First, simple math. $20K > $10K. If you have 100 employees, and they donate $10 and you donate $10..that's $2K. If only you donate $10, that's $1K. In other words, if you are gonna ask this silly question, it should at least be ""why not just give $20K per employee"".<p>Secondly, Apple already donates to charities (google it). At what point does a company donate enough that people stop asking ""why don't they donate more?"" (especially keeping in mind that Apple's  priority is to its shareholders).<p>Thirdly, this is an opportunity for employees to donate money to a cause they believe in and have it essentially doubled. I'm not even sure how else to explain this, except to assume you've never donated money in your life before. For some people, this is a very personal thing (maybe their wife died of cancer)...they <i>want to donate</i> and this is just an little bit extra goodness. Having the company just write a cheque isn't even close to the same thing.<p>Finally, this makes donating (not just money either, but time and other services) a culture aspect of the company now. The impact of engaging and involving employees can be considerably more significant than just a cash lump sum payment.",1315716123

Ah well.<p>Why we know this isn't ""crap"".<p>Commitments are built around Vacation AND Vacations are built around commitments. It doesn't have to be an either/or proposition and here is why:<p>We apply Agile and the management aspect of our company uses Scrum. The teams are self-organizing. This even includes who is hired into the team and who is fired from the team. The team commits to an amount of work (it isn't forced on them by management).<p>This commitment process is very well defined in Scrum through the iteration planning meeting. If someone wants to take time off to go on vacation, then during the planning meeting (and hopefully they talked about it with their team members before), they let the team and product owner know at the start of the planning meeting (every team member, as Scrum requires, let's everyone know the number of hours they have available to commit directly to the current log).<p>In this case - Commitments are built around vacation.<p>On the other hand, the team has been given the authority and responsible of getting out potentially shippable product increments (a part of Scrum). The team, as a whole, has taken on this responsibility so, as a whole, must take that into consideration when taking time off.<p>In this case - Vacations are built around commitments.<p>Our approach to time-off and vacation aligns quite nicely with the Agile process and, in my opinion, is an other example of why Agile (and Scrum in this case) is such an amazing way to manage the production of software.",1315714684

Again, I'm sure most people would love to learn all about that if they could do so at no opportunity cost.

Virtually, all peaceful civil disobedience protests that we see all over the world from American Civil rights to the Tunisian revolution follow a template set up by Gandhi.
