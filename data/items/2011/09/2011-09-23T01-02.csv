3028550,comment,3026868,3027812,1,0,jcitme,,,"Yes. I consider myself a pretty average user for the last 5 or so years on Facebook. I don't have a lot of videos uploaded, but do have a lot of pictures. Facebook compresses those like crazy though, so maybe I have about a gigabyte of data. 
At any rate, given that their (as in the company) worth is estimated at more than 200x the people that have access to high speed internet in the world in dollars [1], I think they can probably keep my data, barring bit rot.<p>note: This assumes that people with dial up don't use Facebook. Probably a valid assumption, or at least that the amount of data a dial up user supplies would not make storage an issue.<p>Their user base is quickly reaching the point where it is limited to the human population of earth itself (This is an assumption, but they claim 800 active users, which while might be questionable {define ""active""} if the true value is around there, they cannot achieve exponential growth). Most people probably only load text, or highly compressed jpg photos. If they can simply turn a profit with a business model that can support the current state, they should be fine.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_broadband_Internet_users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_...</a>",1316743127

Binary compatibility between two programs doesn't say anything about how easy it would be to translate their designs into other languages (which is often a new way of thinking), or different standard libraries.  Many approaches are <i>possible</i>, few are worth the effort.<p>If Apple proposed a new language that didn't support message-passing syntax, and the only way to keep Cocoa dependencies working was with a pile of objc_msgSend() calls and other low-level wrappers, developers would just laugh at them.  A <i>single line</i> of Objective-C often contains 3 or 4 pairs of square brackets, and objc_msgSend()-ifying that alone would be a nightmare even in the short term and even with a code generator.<p>That's why I said, the new language has to follow the same calling conventions.  Fundamentally, whenever I see ""setFoo:x toBar:y withBaz:z"", I should be able to either <i>leave that alone</i> or do <i>very little</i> to that line of code.<p>Carbon-to-Cocoa was feasible because Objective-C is a superset of C (plus the libraries did share some things, like free casting between the CFStringRef and NSString* types).  Not only that, but there's a compiler for Objective-C++.  It was very easy to adopt.<p>So to follow the Carbon-to-Cocoa model, Apple needs a new language that's a superset <i>of Objective-C</i>.  And that's actually something I'd like to see.",1316742564

Remember, we already made it really easy to do that in step 1.<p>- I might even look into signing up bars to be listed on the site as carrying a particular beer/brewery when a user is near their location. In exchange they put up your flyer. Free promotion if the functionality is there.<p>I think there is definitely value here, but I would devote some serious time to improving UX before data entry.
