I believe what makes it worth is the execution, the effort of making an app running and selling.<p>I believe `Angry Birds` is a good example of it. It's success did not come from the idea at all. A simple game with a good execution and good marketing made it so popular.<p>Agreeing with the article; I just want to add that hearing people's ideas also put you into an awkward position. They give you responsibility of either not doing that application without that person's consent or sharing a revenue.<p>You usually don't need neither, because as a developer you're already putting more mental work on how to come up with better apps than some friend's mother of yours.<p>And hearing people like they invented the wheel all the time really is boring.",1315353461

2967762,comment,2967578,2967578,9,0,dkhenry,,,"So I think it is clear this was a defensive response to valid criticism. The initial ""Virginia"" post claimed that if you don't program Scala like he does then your doing it wrong and its too hard for you. He still makes the claim that Scala is too hard for most people and should be reserved for use by the talented and/or motivated developers.<p>My criticism of this was that you don't need to program like him to have a great Scala experience. You can still program in a OO manner and get plenty of benefit out of Scala. As you get more familiar with it you will pick up some nice features that it gives you that Java doesn't. Everyone comes at things at a different level and I think its quite pretentious to claim that most people aren't smart enough to use your tools and they need to stick with simpler tools. If you give someone the tools they will learn to use it. The real problem is when you need to be an expert to use the tools at all. thankfully Scala isn't like that you can jump in with a hour or two of instruction and write perfectly good Java++ code. then as you learn how to use the tool you will pick up the nuances of the language and really unlock its power.<p>I would say this post like the last overlooks some of the broader issue and really does the community a disservice.",1315353299

2967758,comment,2967578,2967578,13,0,runT1ME,,,"I think DPP has a fundamentally flawed argument:  He seems to be assuming that all those Java developers that fail to learn Scala are using Java <i>successfully</i>.<p>Sure, their projects may compile, they may even be deployed and used on a daily basis.  But are they maintainable?  Are they able to function when load increases?  Are there hidden race conditions that go unnoticed for years?  If a user inputs bad data will the application suddenly throw NPEs? Will moving to a different hardware platform with more cores expose a fatal deadlock?<p>Scala's ""weakness"" is not that it is harder than Java, it's that it exposes the difficulty and complications of software engineering to developers at an earlier point in the development cycle.<p>If your standard of success is compiling and deploying a product, than yes, I'll admit Scala makes it 'harder' than java.  However, if you define success as writing defect free, performant software, than I'd argue that Scala is actually easier than Java.",1315353235

2967756,comment,2964562,2967561,3,0,ellyagg,,,"Yes. The sections I feel expert on or had direct experience with beforehand were well done. For example, in the chapter on gaining muscle, I was thinking, ""I bet he doesn't know about the GOMAD diet."" On my hard-gainer frame and with my hard-gainer appetite I'd recently gained 20 lbs of lean mass in two weeks on it, which was sort of like gaining super powers given my history. Surprise, surprise, he covers it. When, in one paragraph, you learn about a diet that's more effective than steroids for bodies that haven't significantly tapped into their hypertrophy potential, you've made up the price of admission already.<p>Or, when he talks about the unique challenges facing women in body shaping, his thinking mirrored my own in some subtle ways that I'd never heard anyone else talk about before (possibly because it might seem sexist).<p>Given that, I tended to trust that the other material would at least be thought provoking. Basically, he's just really committed to self-improvement--which I know a lot of folks around here are--and looks anywhere to find tools and techniques to aid in his quest. There's an emphasis on science, but he's willing to try anything if research hasn't solved the problem yet.<p>It covers the right things and was fun.",1315353178
2967755,comment,2967622,2967744,7,0,gfodor,,,"I'm not so sure about this. The roots of a company run deeper than a product. The original goal of Yahoo! was similar in spirit to Google: help people make sense of the massive amount of information available on the web. They've of course gone in a wild array of directions since then, and I'm not sure they had as long a view of the web as Google did, but I'd be surprised if the founders don't have a good number of strong views they've held about how things should work online since the beginning.

Strangely enough ad-words are pretty cheap for tech speaker keywords so you could try an ad campaign targeting relative search terms.<p>Like anything else, marketing is the key here. View yourself as the product and think about the ways you would sell that product. A speaker web site would be in order, any video's you have of your engagements should go there.

College is expensive largely because it is essentially the policy of this country that everyone, especially women[1], ought to have college degrees. We've seen how student tuition rises along with student loan limits; we've seen how students tend to go to college somehow no matter how expensive tuition is, how much debt they're getting into, or how important the degree is.<p>In these terms, far from being contrary to the spirit of universities like MIT, this type of prostitution arrangement service is in keeping with the proclaimed importance of college education. I.e., going to college is considered so important that many female college students are now willing to prostitute themselves (something most of them would not ordinarily do) to make sure they can keep attending.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=611440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=611440</a>",1315351816

2967699,comment,2967036,2967036,23,0,grellas,,,"I once clerked for a federal judge who was part of the old-style ""hands off"" school of judging - let the parties fashion their own cases and let the court operate around the edges to make sure they stay in bounds. That style of judging had its advantages but it was horrible for case management. My judge wound up with nearly 400 active cases on his docket on average while judges who more actively managed their cases trended toward the low 200s. Litigants in any given case, then, might have a sense of having more control over their cases but the overall pattern was one of interminable delays as dockets and calendars got clogged with more and more situations where lawyers played out their antics without too much supervision.<p>Judge Alsup is of a different school. He is definitely ""hands on"" and handles cases in ways that put the parties under significant pressure to trim their marginal claims and defenses, to scale back on wild discovery forays, and to give serious consideration to getting to an expeditious trial (or settling) rather than potentially be steamrolled by the judge (for example, as he has impliedly threatened to do to Oracle, if it otherwise did not trim its wilder claims, by sending it packing while he stays the litigation pending patent reexaminations). One can agree or not with such a style and it can sometimes border on judicial abuse but it definitely leads to leaner dockets and calendars that are far less cluttered with marginal garbage than one would find on the docket of a more latitudinarian judge. A good (but strict and tough) judge will only play this out in areas where the judge has lawful discretion to make such calls because trying to force things that are plainly against the rules <i>is</i> abusive, leads to injustice, and makes for hack judging. When a judge is tough in the right sense, however, it is amazing to watch how this can trim the excesses of the adversary system and lead to better justice than would otherwise be the case if the parties were simply allowed to run wild.<p>The arm-twisting that is evident in the appointment of the court's own expert on damages is a direct message to both parties that they should refrain from going to wildly speculative extremes and focus on credible claims of damages only. Since there is Ninth Circuit authority for such an appointment, this is not overtly out-of-bounds for the judge to do but it is definitely aggressive and does pose a risk of prejudicing jurors if not properly handled. Reasonable minds can differ on this one but, in terms of case handling, this is one more in a series of examples of a judge suffering no nonsense in his courtroom and is at that level quite admirable.",1315351769

But not only is such an estimate difficult to make - many of the relevant variables are literally unknowable, and there are way more dimensions than two - but nobody would understand it anyway. People in general are bad at functions. That's why they struggle with elementary calculus.<p>If you can demonstrate to a company that you (but not your competitor) are reliably worth X plus five percent, they will pay you X. Unfortunately, there are few programmers on earth who can demonstrably, repeatably, and uniquely add $1.5 million per year to an organization. And we certainly don't have a <i>recipe</i> for scalably generating $1.5m per year per programmer. (If you do, for god's sake stop posting on HN and get moving. We'll all come work for you and be rich!)<p>Whereas what we do know is that we can basically stand around at a conference and enumerate lots and lots of likely ways to use a talented web developer to generate, say, $75k of value per year. We just don't have many talented web developers who are willing to work for less than that. So most of those relatively-low-value tasks go undone, or get done less efficiently, as web developers hold out for higher-value positions that pay $100k or $125k and that earn their employers much more than that.",1315351764

2967635,comment,2967333,2967493,20,0,danking00,,,"An exception is simply a change in control flow and, if I'm not mistaken, this can be modeled easily in a purely functional system. I imagine a real system like Scheme, Racket, etc. would use call/cc, but I can best explain this with Continuation Passing Style[1].<p>Suppose you have some function like:<p><pre><code>  (define (foo x y)\n    (+ (/ x y) 1))\n</code></pre>\nAnd you call it:<p><pre><code>  > (* (foo 4 2) 3)\n  9\n</code></pre>\nthe previous expression is equivalent to: ((4 / 2) + 1) * 3.<p>Now, suppose instead you call it with a bogus argument:<p><pre><code>  > (* (foo 4 0) 3)\n  Error: / expects the second argument to be non-zero!\n</code></pre>\nObviously, an error must be thrown because there is no reasonable answer to the quotient of 4/0.<p>Now, let me introduce CPS. To evaluate (+ (/ 4 2) 1) we must first evaluate (/ 4 2), then we can add 1 to the result. Written in a Scheme/Lisp language this looks like:<p><pre><code>  (let ((result (/ 4 2)))\n    (+ result 1))\n</code></pre>\nThe body of this let form is the ""continuation"" of (/ 4 2), which is a fancy way of saying it's what we should do next. One of the neat things about Scheme/Lisp is that we can write let expressions as function applications, like this:<p><pre><code>  ((lambda (result) (+ result 1)) (/ 4 2))\n</code></pre>\nSo now we have a function which represents what we should do when we're done with (/ 4 2).<p><pre><code>  k := (lambda (result) (+ result 1)) ; continuations are often called k\n</code></pre>\nNow we are ready to add real power. Let us modify our call to foo as follows:<p><pre><code>  ((lambda (result) (* result 3)) (foo 4 2))\n</code></pre>\nBut, why not let foo decide its <i>own</i> future by passing the continuation as an argument which foo can decide to use, <i>or</i> <i>not</i>!<p><pre><code>  (foo 4 2 (lambda (result) (* result 3)))\n</code></pre>\nNow, foo can say ""Hey, I'm all done, I'm gonna call my continuation and keep evaluating!"", or foo can say ""No way man, shit hit the fan, we cannot continue evaluating!""\nThis is how foo can be given that behavior:<p><pre><code>  (define (foo x y k)\n    (if (zero? y)\n        ""Uh-oh, you gave me a divisor of zero. I don't know what happens in black holes!""\n        (k (+ (/ x y) 1))) ; I'll divide, then add, then give the result to my continuation\n</code></pre>\nFurthermore, primitive operations like /, +, and * can be also be modified to accept continuations so the final program looks like:<p><pre><code>  (define (foo x y k)\n    (if (zero? y)\n        ""Uh-oh, you gave me a divisor of zero. I don't know what happens in black holes!""\n        (/ x y (lambda (quotient)\n                 (+ quotient 1 k)))))\n\n  > (foo 4 2 (lambda (result) (* result 3)))\n  9\n  > (foo 4 0 (lambda (result) (* result 3)))\n  ""Uh-oh, you gave me a divisor of zero. I don't know what happens in black holes!""\n</code></pre>\nI encourage you to experiment with turning simple arithmetic programs into CPS-style. It's really enlightening and let's you experiment with highly abnormal control flow (much more than just implementing exceptions). In Scheme, Racket, and languages like them, you can use call/cc and let/cc to have access to continuations without this laborious rewriting process. In fact, continuations are used to model the interactions of a web server written in Racket[2].<p>TL;DR:\nExceptions can be modeled in a completely functional way, and the manner in which you do this opens up a really cool world of control flow mucking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/more/index.html#(part._.Continuations)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pre.racket-lang.org/docs/html/more/index.html#(part._...</a><p>edit: added a TL;DR and a reference to Racket's example of applying continuations to web server interactions<p>edit2: formatting",1315350183

You already managed to build a device that uses the Hall effect to measure the amount of current your TV is pulling, so hooking up a photoresistor to an ohm meter and taping it to your TV while you turn the lights on and off should not be too difficult :)<p>Also, electrical tape is black and blocks light pretty well, so slather enough of that on there and you should be good :)  I guess <i>you</i> won't know whether or not your TV is on, in that case, but you can always add another LED that mimics the status of the TV's LED.<p>(According to Wikipedia, you can use an LED as a photodiode.  So you may not even have to buy anything to try this idea out! <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDs_as_Photodiode_Light_Sensors#LED_as_light_sensor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEDs_as_Photodiode_Light_Sensor...</a> )<p>(Also, a hacked VGA cable may help xrandr report the TV power status.  By default, VGA cables supply +5V to the DDC chip in the TV, so it can detect its presence even when off.  Since you don't want this to happen, perhaps clipping that pin off will prevent the DDC information from being queried until the TV is turned on.)",1315350092
