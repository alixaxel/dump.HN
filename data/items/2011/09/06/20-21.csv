I strongly believe that for any community to be successfull you always have to put user experience first and not being able to post for a few weeks is really not a good first impression. It's basically saying ""Thanks for joining the community, but we don't really want you anyway"".<p>I think the way we report spam by flagging submissions as spam is how it is meant to be, sure you do get the occasional spam but they never last long because people flag them. This also makes sure the community ""watches"" over the content and is more user friendly than just pissing off newcomers. I think a lot of people are lurkers and at one point they really want to submit something and it's at that moment that they create an account (you don't really need an account to lurk do you?) so if this rule would be applied it would really suck for those long time lurkers but new account guys.",1315342790

Lots of people not used to Git tend to see the index as an unnecessary extra step, but it's really what enables the good stuff.<p>In short, the index allows you to decide what goes in a single commit, regardless of the actual contents of a working directory. You can commit only a single line from a file if you want. If you learn how the index works and why it works like it does, understanding the rest becomes much easier.<p>You can also eg. resolve a conflict piece-by-piece by adding resolved parts to the index, diffing against the working directory, and then finally committing once the content of the index looks correct.<p>There are many tutorials and I'm not sure which one is the best but I think the book ""Pro Git"" does a good job at explaining the index among other things.

2967258,comment,2967010,2967010,4,0,retroafroman,,,"So, a framework to sell software? I don't think such a thing exists, and although there are SEO and social media spamming tools, I doubt those are what you want. If those are what you want, start searching. You will find them, and you will do nothing more than sell a few copies of your software and piss off countless people that are potential customers.<p>I'll assume your software solves a need for a set of people. I'll also assume that your software is well done, and people would be willing to pay for it, they just need to know about it. The basic idea behind internet marketing is that you need to find where this set of people hangs out online (spends their time), and then approach them. So let's say, for example, that the software you're attempting to sell helps solve a problem related to knitting. Your broadest target audience is knitters. Realistically, you are targeting people who knit, use the internet, and want to use their computer to make knitting better/easier/more social, etc. From this idea, you can begin finding where the knitters are, and how you are going to get to them. Are there popular knitting blogs? Is there a TechCrunch of the knitting world? Are all the knitters on a social networking site? Forums? Popular knitter Twitterers? If you made the software to scratch an itch, you'll likely know where these people are, because you're there, too.<p>Now, assuming you have an idea about where they are, how can you approach them? Post in the forum? Tag them in your tweets? Announce on IRC? Friend them on FB? Here is where a little digital savvy becomes very important and where I see many traditional marketers fail. Just like you would expect a socially awkward salesman to have a difficult time selling face to face, many 'internet awkward' people have a difficult time selling online. The important thing is to approach this community of potential customers in a way that is appropriate for that particular community. Because you do not mention where your product is aimed, I cannot give ideas about where you should go, or how to approach them.<p>Let's talk about a real example. There is a hacker who frequents here named pkrumins who runs a start up called browserling. Browserling appeals to web developers who need to test across different browsers. Whether he meant to or not, he has been doing very effective marketing by open sourcing code. This is so effective because he's contributing back to the community he's selling to. The same web developers who can use his open source contributions, can be his customers. This boost's his credibility with the people he's trying to sell to. A good door-to-door salesman dresses nice, keeps his hair neat, and is respectful and happy with the people he approaches. This works for him because the customer needs to see that he (and therefore his product) is respectable. Online, things are different. It doesn't matter what you're wearing, where you're sitting, or what you say about your past. This is because internet goers take everything with a grain of salt and realize that nothing we see online is guaranteed to be good as it seems (anyone who's tried online dating knows this especially well). Therefore, online, we need other signals of competence and helpfulness. Pkrumins pushed out good, competent code, which we can see and prove for ourselves. From that example, we can assume that the products he makes are similarly well done and as useful as he claims. Had he instead decided Adwords, a twitter account and some targeted FB ads would be the end of his marketing (which maybe he has, I don't know), none of those are likely to put him in such good graces as his open source contributions. By approaching good devs in a way that makes sense to them, he will succeed.<p>In the end, the main problem you need to figure out are the basics of marketing-who are you selling to and how are you going to approach them. A software framework for doing so isn't there because no two online groups work the same.<p>TL;DR You need to be one in mind with your customer so that you know how to approach them from a position of credibility and competence.",1315342495

I was in exactly this situation earlier in the summer, when my brother asked me, after taking MIT's intro to programming class using Python, ""What language should I learn next?"". When he asked me that, he wasn't looking for the best possible answer from the best engineers who are posting to Stack Overflow, he was asking his brother, who might be able to help him when he stumbles, since I would likely recommend languages I know. I also know that he's not a CS student, he's studying urban planning, so I could reply with that understanding, and say that he might not need to learn another language at all, but instead could branch out with Python to hack on stuff he didn't get to work on in his CS and GIS classes, like web programming or games.<p>So no, don't just point them at Google. Tell them YOUR story about how you learned to program, and tell them what YOU would do differently. Tell them to learn a language that you know, so you can help them. Or a language you want to learn, so you can learn with them. I know that teaching yourself via Google can be extremely gratifying, and I think it works great for some people, myself included. However it doesn't work for everyone, and sometimes it's nice to have a personal connection like this: ""I learned to program when X helped me  to do Y.""<p>edit<p>as I was writing this I was itching to reach for something I'd read before, and I remembered now that it was probably Norvig's ""Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"".

That is, there is a sharp spike after only a few years of working in industry. I won't argue that skill doesn't continue to increase with experience, but I think the difference between my skill in 9 years may be proportionally lower than the skill difference now and in, say, 2 years. However, employers generally seem to work on linear experience models, so if I start at $80k now, in 2 years I may get a simple cost of living + (hand-wavy) 10% salary increase, whereas if your assertion is correct I should probably be getting paid closer to the controlling market salary of >$120k.

I suppose it was intended to be an opinion piece, but it took prostitution to be wrong <i>a priori</i>, with no discussion or justification of this premise. Bandying about words like ‘exploitation’ is, frankly, cheap.

If anything, I'd say the author himself demonstrates ‘the dark side of an MIT brain’.<p>On a more general note, where are the articles discussing the long-term effect of prostitution on psychology?
