Even if it's initially a smash hit (however that might be defined), they'd want to see how it does over a longer time span.  A year would be the minimum time before anyone else would be making decisions based on that.<p>I also don't think it adds a lot of additional information that isn't already there.  They already have all the Starz content, which they'll likely be losing.  But content owners have a model they can see currently.  Adding a few additional animated films won't likely change much, and it will be at least 2 years before any meaningful results are out.<p>There's a much better chance that between now and 2 or 3 years down the road, that something else more significant takes place.  Netflix, upon losing the Starz streaming rights, could be out of business.  Individual studios could be doing streaming on their own, and finding success with that.",1317002128

3037310,comment,3037203,3037203,8,0,codeslinger,,,"""DSP"" is a term for an service that connects to multiple ad inventory sources (ad exchanges, ad networks, etc) and allows an advertiser to upload their creative media and targeting criteria once and then be able to buy on all the different inventory sources that the DSP integrates at once. The ""demand-side"" refers to the fact that DSPs (Invite Media, Turn, DataXu, etc) are used by advertisers to buy inventory, as opposed to the ""supply-side"", which are the publishers (web sites) or their representatives (ad networks, Rubicon, Pubmatic, etc) that have the inventory slots which the DSP is to fill. In display advertising, ""supply"" is code for people (they call it ""audience"") and ""demand"" is code for money.<p>All of this works via the magic of RTB (real-time bidding) APIs which certain ad exchanges and networks implement that allows a DSP to see and bid on each individual impression right before it is rendered in real-time. It works as follows:<p>* An end user loads a web page in his browser with an RTB-enabled ad tag on it<p>* Ad tag loads and calls back to its origin (e.g. Google AdX) for a creative to show<p>* The origin initiates a real-time auction with all of its partners (DSPs or Appnexus(+)) to find a creative to show<p>* The origin will send each partner a bid request containing such information as the origin IP address, geographical information, site on which the tag is placed, etc<p>* The partner searches its inventory for a matching creative(s)<p>* The partner picks one to bid on and chooses a bid price to offer<p>* It sends that back to the origin<p>* The origin chooses the winner of the auction and then:<p>* Sends the winning creative tag back to the publisher's ad tag to be shown<p>* Debits the winning partner's account by the amount bid (or something less, depending on the auction model)<p>* The ad loads in the browser and the end user is pissed off that he has yet to enable AdBlock<p>As for who offers RTB APIs, those are typically ad exchanges, SSPs (""supply-side platforms"", also known as ""yield optimizers"", e.g. Rubicon, Pubmatic, AdMeld) and some ad networks. The largest ad exchange, Yahoo! RightMedia, has yet to offer an RTB API yet, although they are purported to be working on it.<p>DSPs will typically use the information provided in the bid request to help aid the bidding decision but also they rely heavily on third-party data sources for extra information about the user and the publisher domain/URL in order to maximize the likelihood of offering a relevant ad for the cheapest price. Proximic, BlueKai, Exelate, Bizo, TARGUSInfo and many more offer specialized data streams for this purpose.<p>DSPs serve as aggregators of RTB-enabled inventory sources for advertisers so that they can buy across all of them without having to manage N sets of creatives, N sets of bids, N sets of targeting criteria, N relationships, etc. This allows advertisers to concentrate on the audience they want to reach and not where to find them. Having said that, the larger brand advertisers will typically use an ad agency and not deal with DSPs directly; the agency will use a DSP on their behalf and charge a markup for the service. This is typically called ""execution"" in the same vein as ""execution of trades"". DSPs are the algo traders of the online ad world.<p>(+) I mention Appnexus separately because they are not technically a DSP. While they do connect to the RTB APIs of many of the inventory sources and can serve as a DSP, they are a primarily a platform on which to create a DSP or some other real-time-enabled ad processing engine. Many of the DSPs out there are just whitelabeled Appnexus, in that they use Appnexus' bidder and UI for their ""DSP"". Appnexus also has exchange-like properties, e.g. they have inventory exclusive to themselves (i.e. what used to be called Microsoft AdECN) that is only available by integrating with them/using their platform.<p>(++) Full disclosure: I was Invite Media's first Chief Architect and I continue to work in the online ad business today.",1317000991
3037309,comment,3032233,3035937,1,0,xyzzyz,,,"<i>This insistence that if you want to learn W you must first spend N years learning X, Y, and Z is the kind of elitist bullshit that puts laymen off learning abstract math. If you can't explain a subject to someone outside the field, can't explain it without telling them to go spend a few years of study before they talk to you, then you simply do not understand your subject.</i><p>It's a very romantic, but totally untrue point of view. Sure, you can say that topology is a study of shape, algebra is a study of structure, algebraic topology is a study of shape using algebraic or combinatoric means, and homological algebra is, well, abstract nonsense without any connection to real life problems, notions and intuitions, but yeah.<p>Unfortunately, this does not give you any more insight into these subjects than say, describing solid-state physics as ""theory of rigid matter"" or neurobiology as ""theory of brain"". What's more, when you do s/abstract math/modern physics/ in the first sentence of the quotation, it sounds really silly: how can you, for instance, study solid-state physics, if you have no idea about electromagnetism, crystalography, or quantum mechanics? Sure, you can pick up a textbook on solid state physics and read it, but you won't understand anything without the background the author assumed you have. Seriously, if you think that you don't need to learn algebra or topology before algebraic topology, pick up a Hatcher's book[1], read first chapter as many times as you like, and, if you make it that far, which I seriously doubt, try to do any of the exercises at the end of it -- after reading first chapter, you're supposed to be able to do at least some, if not all of them. Mind you, Hatcher's book is considered to be a gentle one, and if you don't believe me, try May's lecture notes[2].<p>To sum up, most of the time you can explain laymen in vague terms what the field is about, more or less (but not always, as is the case with, for instance, homological algebra). However, you cannot explain what you actually do in these fields, because, well, your layman will just not speak language you'd need to use -- I have yet to hear how does one explain what is a derived functor to a layman, you seem to be interested in category theory, why don't you try?<p>I'm happy with the fact that world and science is not simple as you describe -- if it was, all the smart minds from ages past would have already discovered everything, maybe leaving only fruits at the very top of the tree. Now, they only picked the low hanging fruits, and I have a chance to continue their work by standing on their shoulders. Actually, most of them were already standing on the shoulders of other scientists, and because of that, you have to spend more years climbing.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf</a>

3037295,comment,3036745,3037162,42,0,krschultz,,,"First off, I would love to make this comment longer but I'm pressed for time. If you would like to, send me an email. My HN name @gmail.com.<p>I was born & raised on a boat so it is hard for completely put myself in your shoes (notably, I do not get sea sick, <i>no matter what</i>), but I personally think it is do-able. I have not done it yet, but I've sailed quite a bit and someday I want to start crossing oceans. Financially it isn't as bad as most people think. I actually think that the oppurtunity cost of quitting your job for a year or two is the biggest expense.<p>First off, you need to know how to sail at its most basic level. The cheapest way to learn is to get a dinghy (a Laser, maybe a Hobie 16 or Hobie 17 are all easy to find. Something decently high performance - you want to wipe out sometimes so that you learn.) You need a lot of time on the water and there is absolutely no substitute. You need to learn how to drive by the feel of the wind on your neck, and you need to learn which clouds are safe and which ones are going to wreck you.<p>Then you should step up to 30-40 foot keelboats. You probably don't want to buy one straight away. Learn on someone else's boat as crew for racing or deliveries. (a delivery is generally moving a couple hundred miles for the owner, i.e. the owner needs the boat moved from NYC to Maryland, but can't do it himself. He hires you to move it and pays all expenses. I've done this several times and it always seems to lead to the hairest situations because you are forced by the schedule to sail even if the weather doesn't cooperate. Generally you will be shorthanded 2-3 people which is good practice for offshore work)<p>So at this point you probably have been sailing for 3-5 years or so, know how to do everything on someone elses boat, and you need to buy your own boat. There is a lot of discussion on a fast boat vs a slow boat. A fast boat means you spend less time out there which is good mentally, but they are more physically demanding (bigger sails, crash through waves harder, get wetter, etc), but you can also avoid weather if you know a storm is coming. Faster boats break more often. A slow plodding boat can survive everything, but you can't avoid anything. Slow boats are cheaper.<p>You also need to figure out your route. Sailing non-stop around the world is one thing, but honestly that is kind of boring. I know 3 couples who have done it, and they made a point of stopping a lot along the way so it took about 3 years each. (1 couple stopped in New Zealand and taught school for a year, 1 couple was in Indonesia during the tsunamai on their boat in the harbor, and in the aftermath stayed for a year because they were doctors). The stops sound like more of the journey than the sailing honestly.<p>If I were to think of places to start, I'd subscribe to some sailing magazines. Cruising World comes to mind, there is also Sail, and Sailing. For websites, try Sailing Anarchy (rough crowd in the forums for sure, but there are some gems). You will definitely find them ridiculing people for what not to do on Sailing Anarchy.<p>Disclaimer: sailing is very dangerous. Way more dangerous than most people realize. I personally know 5 people that have been killed sailing in the last 4 years. It can happen in a lot of different ways. And I personally have been involved in some really close calls. Sinking boats, out of control boats, overturned boats. The fastest boat in the world (Rambler 100) just flipped and almost killed its crew off of Ireland. In the 70s the Fastnet race killed 50 people. The Volvo Ocean Race had a professional get killed in its last go-round. The ocean is no less forgiving now than it was in the 1700s. The Coast Guard can only reach so far, and when you are in the middle of the ocean you are absolutely alone.<p>As just one example, a few weeks ago we went out racing on a wednesday night (3 man high performance boat). It was a clear, calm night. Thunderstorms were rolling in, we saw them, we thought we could keep the sails up about 2 minutes longer than we should have. We knocked the boat over on it's side, the guy driving fell below and cut open his shin and was bleeding everywhere trying to  get back up, the boat had no driver, and the 2nd guy on the boat froze like a deer in the headlights. Our sails were dragging us down and the wind was up like crazy and the rain rolled in to the point where we no longer could see our competitors who were 75 feet away. I crawled up to the bow and cut down one of the sails and hand over handed the thing into the boat, and when we finally got it all sorted out and the rain cut back, we were still sailing at full speed and realized we were in the middle of a reef. We got out of the reef without sinking the boat and decided to just quit the race and go home. I think my adrenalin was still going 4 hours afterwards.<p>I flipped my race boat a couple years ago while teaching my girlfriend to sail and the keel broke. The boat started sinking, and she started getting hypothermia. Another guy who was out that day coaching jumped in the water in full clothes to help me get it back upright and took her in by powerboat while I sailed the sinking boat back to the crane to get it pulled out.<p>The point is, unlike other sports when shit hit the fan, there is no time out. You don't blow the whistle and talk about it. If there are rocks coming up and your boat is out of control - you are going to hit the rocks and sink. If the boat flips - you better hold your breath and start swimming and hope it comes back upright. If something snaps and the rig falls down, better start cutting before it punches a hole in the boat and sinks you. When things start going wrong you can feel really exposed out there, with little to no safety net, so you better be prepared.<p>Anyone can do it but you have to do your homework. You have to put in the practice and preparation.<p>edit: My god, I posted that before reading the article itself, I can't believe how close his story is to my experience. Aside from the 90 foot wave comment (90 foot waves simply are not common, hurricane irene was throwing legit 30-40 footers around but it's hard to believe much more than that), he is spot on. I've never put a word on it, but initiative is exactly right. That day I went out and I mentioned the 2nd crew had the deer in the headlights look, he had 10x the experience of me, owned a boat bigger than mine, but in that moment he was completely stuck and useless until we started yelling at him what to do. This is an amazing account of what it is actually like. Really not that much hyperbole (which believe me, sailors are prone to, but it really is like this).",1317000115
