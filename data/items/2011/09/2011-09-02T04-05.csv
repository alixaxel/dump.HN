2952969,comment,2947519,2952475,3,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""Isn't the premise of Faith itself unreasonable?</i>""<p>It's only in the past hundred years or so (with the rise of Christian Fundamentalism in the 1920s) that ""faith"" has been used to mean ""the opposite of reason"" or ""believing something without evidence"".  In ancient religious writings (particularly Christian and Jewish) and in most of religious history, ""faith"" means acting upon something you know from experience to be true, particularly in the face of adversity.  Far from being unreasonable, it can be thought of as the <i>triumph</i> of reason and experience over temporary emotion.  This also matches with the ordinary meaning of ""faith"" when used to describe something other than religion.<p>> <i>""western versions of Christianity don't normally allow people doctrinally to be hostile but isn't that attributable to outside influences?""</i><p>I would say the opposite -- most of the ""hostile"" versions of Christianity were/are such because of influences outside of scripture (for example, it became militant after being adopted as a state religion), and most of the shift away from hostility came about as a result of return to scripture (note the significant pacifist movements of the early 1500s, as the printing press was putting Bibles into peoples' hands.)<p>> <i>""do you consider WBC to be unreasonable?""</i><p><i>Everybody</i> considers WBC to be unreasonable.<p>More to the point, as I said in the parent, crazies <i>think</i> they're standing on solid ground, whether scientific or religious.  The question is not ""do they do this because of their faith"", but ""do they do this because of a <i>reasonable</i> understanding of Christian scripture?""  Neither WBC, nor the Ugandan LRA, nor parents who disown children, have <i>reasonable</i> basis in scripture.",1314939545

Erick Schonfeld, who has served as co-editor in New York, will become interim editor while AOL searches for a replacement for Mr. Arrington, the spokesman said. AOL purchased the site last year.<p>Mr. Arrington's new fund, called CrunchFund, closed Thursday with $20 million, according to people familiar with the matter. AOL leads the limited-partner group, which includes a long roster of venture firms that kicked in $1 million each: Austin Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Greylock Partners, Redpoint Ventures and Sequoia Capital.
Several individuals contributed money, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz; general partners at Benchmark Capital; angel investors Ron Conway and Kevin Rose; and Yuri Milner of Russian firm DST Global.<p>It isn't immediately clear what is the fate of AOL's venture-capital arm, AOL Ventures, which has made recent seed investments in start-ups such as spam-defense company Impermium and price-tracking service Shopobot.<p>Mr. Arrington's partner in the fund is Patrick Gallagher, who has been a partner at VantagePoint Capital Partners since 2008.<p>Mr. Arrington wasn't immediately available for comment. He posted a message on Twitter after news of the fund broke: ""slow news day.""<p>Mr. Arrington, a former lawyer who is known to be well connected in Silicon Valley, started TechCrunch in 2005. The site built up a following for its coverage of young tech companies.<p>Long an angel investor himself, Mr. Arrington announced on TechCrunch in 2009 that he would stop making investments in start-ups due to a perceived conflict as both publisher and investor. It's ""a weak point that competitors and disgruntled entrepreneurs use to attack our credibility,"" he wrote at the time.<p>But in April this year, after AOL acquired TechCrunch, Mr. Arrington announced he was investing in start-ups again, while also becoming a limited partner in venture funds Benchmark Capital and SoftTechVC.<p>Mr. Arrington has often said that transparency and full disclosure keep things above-board when his blog writes about companies he has some financial stake in.",1314939073

2952957,comment,2952683,2952749,8,0,tzs,,,"In many cases, falsified or inflated income on applications was done by the bank, not the applicant. The applicant provided the correct data, and the bank adjusted it to make sure a big mortgage would get approved. The banks were very eager to push mortgages.<p>The story of my mortgage is a good illustration of how ridiculous the banks were in approving mortgages:<p>I bought my first house in 2007, after almost 30 years of apartment living. I analyzed the crap out of my budget, and concluded that I could take up to a $300k loan tops. Any more would put in territory where my mortgage payments would be at a very risky level, and I'd have to be careful on spending to keep from falling behind.<p>I went to Countrywide to get pre-approved so I could go house hunting. My credit rating had normally hovered around 790 at the big three, but when they pulled my credit report it happened to have zoomed up to around 830 (I do not know why). They asked for two months worth of bank statements covering my regular bank account and my investments, and pay stubs for the last month.<p>Result? They would pre-approve up to $750k, and instead of an appraisal on any house I decided to buy they would just do some kind of online check of tax or insurance records.<p>WTF?<p>They are supposed to be professionals in this area. Yet they were willing to let me have a loan WAY beyond my means, and to trust my judgement as to the value of a house--based on the fact I've got a job, have managed to save a decent down payment, and my credit score is high (which doesn't show any financial sophistication--it just shows I have been able to pay my bill on time).<p>I laughed at the ridiculous amount they were willing to pre-approve, and told them $300k was a big enough pre-approval for me, and continued looking for houses in the range <i>I</i> determined I could afford. (I ended up borrowing $224k).",1314939055

The buyers of this paper, in turn, were only willing to pay when they knew they could bundle the obviously-sketchy loans into securities that allowed them to safely extract a 'clean' payment stream. And by 'safely' I mean they knew they could dump the toxic byproducts on buyers who could insure against (very likely) losses. This backstop position required the participation of an insurance firm (AIG) that was free from any legal requirement to hold collateral commensurate with their exposure to risk.<p>Everyone involved in this racket knew full well that the 'investment' operations they were running were fully enmeshed with the boring but vital infrastructure of everyday banking - paychecks, credit card processing, savings accounts, etc. In other words, they knew they had the country by the throat. So it's not that they were too big to fail - they were too important to fail. When the music inevitably stopped, there was never any doubt that taxpayers would get the shaft.<p>All this was possible because the firms involved have so much power in Washington that their lobbyists literally wrote the law, handing drafts to their former colleagues who working directly for the Senators and Congressmen in change of rubber-stamping these 'rules'.<p>Nothing in this - and I mean nothing - is even remotely consistent with victim-hood in any sense of the word. The fact that the banks are playing this card - which entails admitting that their lender verification and risk-management standards are utterly worthless - indicates that they feel perfectly safe in making what should be deeply incriminating remarks with absolutely no fear of sanction.",1314936377

Doubly awesome, ""too big to fail"" is  also counter to standard issue investing advice: diversify your portfolio.  ""Too big to fail"" really means ""poorly diversified portfolio"".<p>But #2 risks throwing out the baby with the bath water.  No doubt that some people prospered solely at the expense of the taxpayer, but it's also likely that some of the people who prospered were competent folks who were just at the right place at the right time.  Removing them, even if they did prosper,might remove the best folks to right the banks.",1314936361
