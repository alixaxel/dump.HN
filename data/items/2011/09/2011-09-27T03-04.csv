3041809,comment,3041675,3041675,2,0,byoung2,,,"<i>I find it extremely difficult to come up with a great or at least a good idea for a startup</i><p>The idea itself isn't the hard part.  I come up with dozens of ideas every week.  The hard part is turning that idea into a successful business.  That takes lots of hard work, sleepless nights, pounding pavements, fruitless sales calls and emails, the list goes on.  The old adage of finding a problem and solving it still applies.  Just today, one problem that presented itself that a startup could solve is:<p>Employee Scheduling.  My wife is a per diem float team nurse at the number 3 hospital in the United States.  When she wants to work, she calls in to an automated phone system, and records a series of messages after the beep to schedule herself (day shift, 12 hours, department, name, phone number, etc). Someone then listens to all of these messages, as well as messages from department heads looking to fill staffing needs.  This person in the staffing office then calls my wife at 4am to let her know where she should report (or if they don't have anything for her).  Tell me why that can't be a simple online/mobile app, with Twilio integration to send a text message, voicemail, or email confirmation?  The same app could be used to schedule appointments for nearly anything...dentists, hair salons, you name it.  You could beef it up by offering options such as realtime availability, payment processing, etc., to make it applicable to multiple industries.  And you could charge a monthly fee, or per appointment, you name it.<p>Of course to turn this into a startup, you'd have to build the backend, the app, and have a sales team to sign up businesses, but it could be a hit.",1317095956

Money, also, is finite. The more someone else has, the less everyone else has. It's impossible for everyone to be rich. In order for someone to win, many have to loose. And making products to sell and creating jobs to make those products were a free market's way of passing the money down from those who have it, to those who don't.

This can be said about almost any programming in general, but in OOP you can see bad abstractions very well.<p>The real problem of OOP is that most ""average"" programmers are bad at defining languages.

The way I read this is that HTML/CSS/JS could be replaced overtime, bit by bit in 50 years by something else. Flash could have done this, though I think their chance has passed them by. Just like Java Applets and Silverlight. Maybe Chrome will add an interpreter for CoffeeScript and in 10 years all new sites will use that instead of JS. Maybe Firefox will introduce something other than HTML to build a page in that works with CSS and JS better and in 15 years, everything new will be in that language.<p>It isn't that everything will be different, but the implementation of the web is less important than that openness of the web.

I have no knowledge of Zynga's current internal state - the following is entirely speculation.<p>=================================<p>There are many forces at work here that need to be brought to light.<p>* Macro Trend #1 - Facebook's web traffic is in decline[1].  These users are shifting to mobile as their primary consumption channel for Facebook.  No facebook app developer has presence on the mobile app.<p>* Macro Trend #2 - Zynga's game launches are smaller than ever.  For many reasons, it's getting harder to launch a 5M+ DAU game.<p>Zynga is responding to these trends in several ways.<p>*  Leverage their warchest[2] to make acquisitions.  This lets them launch a higher volume of games and help them get a foothold in mobile.  Zynga has made a LOT of acquisitions this year[3].<p>* Further monetize their existing base.  They've been pushing partner deals really hard recently, doing deals with Lady Gaga[4], Amex[5], and Capital One[6]<p>Zynga's games are more high quality than ever.  Gone are the days of ""fuck innovation"", two of Zynga's most recent releases are the best they've ever built.  The issue is that the market for FB games is in decline - the next big wave is mobile.  If Zynga can become a player by launching a hit or acquiring a large chunk of the space, they'll be doing better than ever.  But so far, Zynga's mobile releases have flopped.<p>TL;DR - Zynga's profits are a sign that they have doubled down on acquisitions to counter-balance a market shift from web to mobile.
