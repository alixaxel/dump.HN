3016076,comment,3015326,3015769,3,0,guygurari,,,"As pointed out by others, Dawkins does consider the evolutionary mechanisms behind evolution. In The God Delusion he offers additional possible mechanisms to the one you mention. But Dawkins' goal is not to understand the mechanism by which religion came about. Rather, it is to show people that religion is both wrong and harmful.<p>You see, even if you find the spot in the brain that causes people to believe in God (if such a thing exists), it will not convince anyone that there is no God. The believers will simply say that God put it there. If you want to convince, logically, that there is no God, you have to do so at a philosophical level like Dawkins does. Having said that, I think it that there are more effective ways to achieve this goal than to ram people with the truth head-on like Dawkins does.",1316487500

That is really depressing.<p>That is the one thing that consistently amazes me about entrepreneurs - no matter how silly, ridiculous, dull or otherwise negative opinion you may have of an idea/area - someone is probably doing something really impressive in the space.  I've done a lot of interviews with entrepreneurs and honestly, sometimes I read the quick description and go 'oh god, not another one of these <stereotype>.'  Sometimes, I am right, but there have been quite a few after doing my research have really impressed me.  Even if I think it will be boring, I am willing to give it a chance because I've learned I can't predict what will be impressive or not with any significant degree of certainty.",1316487485

That sounds like exactly the sort of superficially boring thing that turns out to be a reliable, profit-generating engine.  Like the story about the guy who started a website selling bowling balls.  Or a tax client of an ex, who was making millions annually selling hop-up engine parts.<p>I thought everything else was pretty spot on, attacking this guy for his business and for telling a non-technical guy to stay non-technical is...  weird.

Why not question whether stupid non-suffering cows are OK to kill? Or whether non-suffering humans are OK to kill and eat?<p>Even if you continue with your line, there are other ways you could argue it - if suffering is bad, then that doesn't mean eating animals is bad, you could tranquillise before killing and it would be OK. Or if you want to minimise suffering then wild animals aren't OK, and all animals should have a human managed lifespan from sedated birth to anaesthetised death followed by being eaten, and not-eating-animals but leaving them to die ""naturally"" is worse.<p>And there's room to step back and say suffering is a behaviour and thought pattern that's only of interest to the creature connected to that nervous system - otherwise of no interest, so why go for 'minimise suffering' at all? You could argue about methane emissions or water/other resource use, for why it's unethical to prioritise farming animals for food, or you could look at it as a social signalling - wanting to signal that we understand suffering and choose to avoid it or as a personal suffering (guilt) reduction aside from the animal suffering, or you could believe in a deity which punishes you after death for animal suffering you caused.<p>But however you look at it, you come back to: humans have to eat, so plants or animals have to be ethically OK to eat, and we don't want hurt selves or relatives and friends, so cannibalism can't be OK, but within that, whether extending compassion to animals is ""right"" or not, it's not objective - refusing to eat farm animals because the calculation on their methane emissions leading to global warming effects and future human suffering would be, but where the ethical line in farming living creatures for food is, is not. It's just arguable back and forth.<p><i>I eagerly await your finding that vegetables feel pain.</i><p>Even if they don't feel pain, they have a natural life, lifespan, life processes and reproduction which eating them stops.

Like most community developers, I supported the overwhelming majority of the changes that went into D7 when they where being discussed among the community. Now faced with the reality of D7, I see that some (maybe most) of these additions where a mistake.<p>Assuming Dries' keynote wasn't based on random numbers, Drupal had reached the ""1% of total websites"" threshold well before D7 was released. There was no choke point. Look at the following web server statistics <a href=""http://greatstatistics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greatstatistics.com/</a>\nMSSQL support doesn't service the majority of potential consumers of a CMS, just a small minority of potentially well-heeled clients that run Microsoft-based environments.<p>It's counter-intuitive but I've come to realize that sucking module functionality into core is stupid. Example: your choice of forum, aggregator, or blog. All crusty, useless modules that any serious implementation will either ignore, patch heavily with additional contributed modules, or just go with a fully contrib alternative. Why do these modules all suck? They've been stuck in core and thus cannot change. When a major release is planned everyone's busy focusing on the shiny new stuff to cram into core and modules like this are typically neglected. Why should the fields API be any different, given the track record of the last five years?<p>Also, you may not want to lose sight of the fact that it makes Drupal shops (you know, the little guys who are busily engaged with growing and maintaining Drupal's adoption base) look bad in front of clients when they've been on the receiving end of Acquia-sponsored D7 marketing blasts, meanwhile we're waving them off from migrating because core isn't stable and critical contrib modules are either unstable (RC$n or beta) or entirely non-existent in D7.<p>I know several contrib module developers that have thrown their hands up in disgust and gone on to work with other communities while new developers are struggling with the unprecedented complexity in D7.<p>I agree, the changes are big. Some of them are awesome (new menu structure, new AJAX api). Others range from obnoxious and/or useless (overlay) to actively harmful (see also core bug queue explosion). There was a large and VERY vocal contingent among the community that was calling for smallcore years before D7 shipped and a blind eye was turned by a vanishingly small yet disproportionately powerful minority, and now it's biting everyone who isn't vying to become a Microsoft Enterprise Partner in the ass.<p>And that is my take on the Drupal community as it stands currently. You don't have to agree with me but it would be a mistake on your part to assume I'm an outlier.",1316484642

This means that to the extent that anyone can be right or wrong about anything, Richard Dawkins is correct in his arguments. Maybe he isn't civil in the way he confronts people who disagree. Maybe he's ineffective in convincing them. Those are things that are important to you personally, but you're letting that distract you from the fact that what he's saying is <i>true</i>, which ought to be the only thing that matters.<p>In a way, I think this is a major way you and people who share your attitude towards Richard Dawkins miss what is perhaps the most poignant part of his message. His crassness is actually a rebellion against the passivity and political correctness that he feels constrains non-believers socially and politically. The crux of his message is a call to arms to those people, encouraging them to deny religion the automatic respect it has enjoyed for centuries.

He hung around and watched everything from his desk.  His desk is in a restricted zone behind security where no customers are ever allowed (I do believe it would be a federal law violation).  It was around 9am and all the kits were processed and he was going to go home.  A manger asked why he was not in proper work attire (sports coats / slacks or suit).
