Let's compare.  I just priced a Lenovo X220 with a 50% faster processor, twice the ram, twice the SSD size, larger, better screen - which are all minimum choices for this laptop, I can't choose any lower to match the Macbook - and I came out to $84 more than the Macbook.  Let's see, if I look at the other versions... I'd say the Macbook has about a $200-$300 price premium compared to the Lenovo.  The two laptops weigh almost exactly the same and are the same thickness at the thickest point, although the Lenovo doesn't have the pretty tapered edge.<p>The economy of scale advantage that he's talking about doesn't exist, or at least doesn't make it to the consumer (Apple may be keeping economy of scale profits, but that's not the point Gruber is trying to make).<p>Gruber is just utterly full of shit and I fail to see why his articles merit any discussion.

2980630,comment,2978109,2980298,4,0,Goladus,,,"> I think this is where a lot of Rubyists/Pythonistas get lost. Just because the languages hide ideas like ""interface"" and ""abstract base class"" doesn't mean that those concepts aren't useful.<p>I agree, somewhat.  The problem is that HtDC seems to spends so much time on vocabulary and describing how to <i>construct</i> classes that very little is left over for discussion of actual design.  Here's an excerpt:<p><i>This first section on classes suggests that the design of a class proceeds in
three steps:<p>1. Read the problem statement. Look for statements that mention or list the attributes of the objects in your problem space. This tells you how many fields you need for the class definition and what information they represent. </i><p>That is probably quite reasonable from a java-perspective.  But in Python the best answer might be to use the built-in data structures, define a bunch of functions to operate on that data, which are automatically encapsulated in a namespace based on the name of the file.  But it might not, sometimes you would want to define a class with explicit fields.<p>The question is, how do you know which technique to use?  This book doesn't seem to help with that.  We've jumped from a data-driven approach using scheme to a java-style object-oriented approach for no apparent reason and very little explanation of the benefits of this approach.<p>Even if the part about interfaces might help a bit with designing a Python module, in order to get that out of this book you're going to have to wade through a lot of other stuff.",1315622621

I don't assume that all economic inequality is the medieval type, where the rich are the winners of a zero sum game.</i><p>The problem I see with growing income inequality is not the ""inequality"" part, it's the ""growing"" one.<p>From a purely mathematical point of view, in any economic climate there's some level of income inequality that's going to be economically optimal for whatever it is that we want to optimize about our economy (some combination of jobs, happiness, wealth, or whatever).  This is trivially true, as zero income inequality is a really crappy situation by most realistic measures of economic health, as is ultimate income inequality (i.e. a small handful of people holding all the wealth).  In between those extremes there's <i>got</i> to be some optimal distribution of wealth.<p>But when I see a march towards higher levels of inequality, I'm left to wonder whether there are actually any forces in play that will keep us anywhere near that optimum, or if we're just seeing a runaway ""wealth begets wealth"" situation, as folks like Mandelbrot have suggested.  Sure, it <i>could</i> be the case that the changing technological climate means that the optimal level of inequality is going up, and we're actually keeping pace with that, but that's just a ""could be"", and I've never seen a particularly compelling argument that our economy should work more efficiently now at higher levels of income inequality than, say, twenty years ago.  An argument that increasing income inequality is inevitable, or even that it's fair, is <i>not</i> an argument that it's economically helpful.<p>I completely agree with your thesis that technology is a perfectly valid reason for the growing gaps, FWIW, it's a pretty unassailable argument.  But I don't agree that it's not cause for concern: we're sliding at an increasing pace down the slippery slope, and at the bottom is complete human level AI, where a vanishing percentage of humans have anything at all of value to offer to the economy.  Are you <i>really</i> comfortable with the wealth distribution that's going to result from such a thing?<p>Personally (and this is quite controversial, I admit), I think that we have to start taking that inevitable outcome to heart, and realizing that the next 50 years should be a period where we move a lot closer to a full welfare state, with full acceptance of the fact that more and more of us will be at the unemployed and useless end of the spectrum as time goes on.  Then again, an economy where humans are less useful than their machines, even as far as designing and running those machines, is a completely different world than we've ever considered before, so perhaps it's premature to even consider what that means...",1315621224

Only one possible syntax for the ternary operator. One obviously right way to organize classes and imports. A couple competing ways to declare types (Foo foo or foo:Foo), but perhaps we as a community could make a bold choice just this once? One obvious syntax for generics, and so on.<p>The lowest common denominator I have in mind looks almost exactly like early versions of Java, except with optional typing (""var""), some rudimentary generics and without checked exceptions.<p>There seems to be no good reason for new languages like Dash to embrace a different style.

2980578,comment,2979405,2980175,3,0,yummyfajitas,,,"<i>I don't see how that could be true. productivity gains have been experienced across all levels of the income scale so surely that growth is attributable to more than just the top 10%.</i><p>This statement betrays a misunderstanding of how productivity is defined. There is no macro-level measure of individual productivity, so it's simply not possible to determine which levels of the income scale experienced productivity growth.<p>Productivity is only measured, in the most granular cases, at the organizational level. The data available simply cannot determine which workers are more productive.<p>I'll give you an example. My startup involves a lot of categorization - we get a data feed full of poorly labelled fashion items, and we have a team of 6 girls categorizing them (item 1 -> ""Handbags"", item 2 -> ""Dresses"", etc). At the macro level, my organization recently increased categorizing productivity by 1000% (i.e., we categorize 10x more items than before).<p>This didn't happen because my girls suddenly started clicking 10x faster. This happened because I wrote a program which can parse item names (""Marc by Marc Jacobs sleeveless shift dress"" -> ""Dresses"") with about 90% accuracy [1].<p>Macroeconomic statistics have no way of knowing which worker to attribute this productivity gain to.<p>[1] Categorizing natural language is surprisingly hard - stuff like ""dress shoes"" and ""swimwear top"" confuses the matter tremendously. Some items also get names like ""Cherry Pie""...",1315620822
