The fact that Javascript is the only language you can realistically use to script the browser is a terrible limitation and legacy of bad technical decisions at Netscape more than a decade ago. I'm always surprised at the lack of concern about this.<p>While I do actually like Javascript a lot, I think we need to have more choices. When people point out Node as a benefit because ""you can use the same language on the client and the server"" I agree - but it misses the bigger problem in that, if you want to use the same language on the client and the server, you only have one real choice.",1315699077
2982827,comment,2982474,2982778,7,0,tsm,,,"I'm a vim user who started to really get into Lisp (and now ML for school). Emacs (especially with SLIME) is really the Right Thing for Lisp, so I started using it. I've definitely gotten to the point where `C-a C-k` is as well burned into my fingers as `dd` is...it's just that<p>a) `dd` seems like a more natural keybinding--both because I'd rather double-tap a home row button than involve three fingers and two hands, and because, if you do stop to think about it, `dd` makes sense--`d` means delete, and a double-tap usually makes something apply to a whole line. (Of course, `dd` / `C-a C-k` is just an example--this applies in general.)<p>b) There's more of a zen to vim. It's been discussed before, but it's worth repeating--vim commands form a language with nouns and verbs. `w` means word and `(` means sentence. Now you know two commands. `d` means delete, `y` means yank, and `c` means change. Now you know <i>8</i> commands--`w`, `dw`, `yw`, `cw`, `(`, `d(`, etc. And adding a few more ""nouns"" brings you up to several dozen with minimal effort. Emacs has no direct equivalent * .<p>So I like emacs for the ecosystem, I like it for the freakish integration it can achieve between a REPL and a source file...as they say, it's a great operating system--it just needs a good editor.<p>* - This is not quite true--emacs does try to do sane things with the use of `C` and `M`. `C-f` means ""forward one character"", and `M-f` means ""forward one word""--a ""bigger"" form of the same thing. In the same way, `C-d` deletes a character and `M-d` deletes a word. But now you want to delete a line? Time to learn something completely new.<p><i>Edited to make a lame effort to fix my formatting problems...thus the asterisks surrounded by a sea of whitespace.</i>",1315698961

2982825,comment,2982185,2982762,4,0,zohebv,,,"> I mean this inclination doesn't imply anything about what economic policy should be<p>Isn't it disingenuous to infer that this inclination should not imply anything about economic policy? I would arrive at the opposite conclusion. Economics are sentiment driven by a huge factor. Robert Shiller's work in behavioral economics and his book Irrational exuberance has established and popularized this idea. Krugman's discussion of the unsuitability of BitCoin as a currency rests largely on the peculiar nature of human sentiment and behavior. Large income gaps are perceived by most people as unfair irrespective of the contributions by the wealthy. No one thinks that Bill Gates/ Edison made a greater contribution to social progress than Einstein/Gandhi. I don't think the association of the net worth of an individual to the contribution that they have made to society is very strong. Economies rewards people largely on the basis of demand/supply with I believe is a weak proxy for social contributions.<p>Perhaps you want to draw an analogy to say gay marriage where the popular vote might end up denying gay rights, but I don't think a similar argument holds in the case of wealth distribution.",1315698830

The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.</i><p>Large corporations are still around and arguably more powerful than ever. Yet the difference in pay between the top executives and average workers in those corporations is one way the growing gap between the rich and the not-rich is illustrated and measured.<p><i>I remember the transition quite clearly. When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation. It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.

To a song he likes?<p>XLink is only useful if you don't care and are just displaying it to the user. Most of these APIs are supposed to be consumed by machines, hence they need to have more structured formats.

I think part of the problem with them is the need for an add-on interpreter in addition to the syntax interpreter.

I like my half-price, DRM-free (as they should be) O'Reilly and Packt pdfs. I highly recommend patronizing those and other DRM-free, device agnostic publishers.<p>I agree with all the familiar laments on the smell of the paper, the feel in your hands, the visual nature of the memory of locations in books, and I recognize the benefits of ebooks nonetheless.<p>Two things I'll miss very much are the trip to the bookstore, and my books calling out to me from my bookshelves and tables and floors and under-the-couches.<p>The article points out that publishers will miss the advertising gained by customers walking by a bookstore window, or browsing through the bookstore. I will miss being on that flip side. Yes of course, you can browse more ""efficiently"" online, but I don't go to a bookstore for efficiency, I go for the experience and the serendipity. Most of the time I don't know what book I'll come out of the store with; that almost never happens to me online.<p>I've tried browsing on Amazon, but I always seem to wake up after being put to sleep. There is no serendipity in online book browsing, there is only tracking down and killing something you already know you want. There is certainly no pleasure in it, whether you're browsing or buying.<p>There is a similar loss of serendipity while thumbing through an ebook, or I suppose you'd (ironically) call it paging through an ebook. I still, at my age, enjoy thumbing through the physical dictionary. Think about how boring a dictionary is. You already know the plot, you know how it ends, and yet you sit there on the couch delighting in consumer, continuator, dormouse, dornick, FIFO, hinge joint, Hispanolia, Zenobia and zero.<p>I have never thumbed through an edictionary, nor the online equivalent. I've tried, but come on. ebooks are just not built for pleasure, they're built for tasks, page 1 to page N.<p>I have collected around 20 ebooks on my laptop, free and paid. Some of them I'm (supposed to be) actively reading, but they still often sit there in their directory, powerless to call out to me and remind me to ""read me!"" On the other hand I have physical books sitting all around me, and I read them all, the ones not on the shelf (but some of them too), some of them more frequently than others, but they all get a chance to remind me that I have something to read. To get through an ebook not connected with an urgent task, I'd have to keep a ToDo list.<p>I'll almost certainly buy a dedicated reader one day, and I'll be happy not to have to schlep a dictionary, a novel and The Python Cookbook on to a plane or a bus.
