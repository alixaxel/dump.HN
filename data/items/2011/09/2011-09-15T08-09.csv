It's just something I've always wanted to do, wear a suit in everyday life. Just never had the need.<p>I've engaged and closed over $200k worth of investments for various projects I've worked on over the years, and it's never been an issue what attire I've worn to a meeting. I've even had several investors told me they liked that I wore a T-shirt and didn't wear a ""monkey suit"" to the meeting. ""Leave it to the people that have to,"" they told me. I suppose I can agree with that. :)",1316077168
2999394,comment,2999310,2999310,1,0,arkitaip,,,"I am looking for a platform to host python web apps and GAE was one of the obvious candidates. The main thing that puts me off GAE is not pricing or poor python support or the fact that you cannot use a relational database in a reasonably sane way. No, the main thing is that I simply don't trust Google enough to use GAE. What if they decide to ditch GAE because it's not profitable enough? How dedicated to GAE are they right now? Sure, they introduce new features but compare to the competition they seems incredibly slow.<p>I've also looked at Heroku and although they are still working on fully supporting Python, they seem much more trustworthy. Heroku's main and only business is their hosting platform, they can only neglect it at their peril. And because of this, the focus and speed at which they deliver their product is amazing compared to GAE.<p>I didn't even bother to try out GAE when it was ""free"" but I would probably pay to use Heroku once Python becomes a first-class citizen. That's how exited I'm about their product.",1316077165

2999387,comment,2999029,2999185,3,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"The problem with Flash is that it is a plugin, and not part of the browser. Being a plugin, flash has no real way of communicating with the browser (yes, an extension can, but a plugin is not an extension). So the browser leaves a space for the plugin, letting it do what it wants, and shares exclusive focus locks with the plugin. This means you are either in Flash's context, or the browser's context. So by design, flash can't do anything <i>but</i> grab all the keyboard commands.<p>Then we get to html5. This is a part of the browser. The browser can suspend execution, ensure gestures work before the program responds or any other kind of integration.<p>As for mouse vs touch screen, I would find a flash site designed for a mouse quite annoying to use with a touch screen. Mouse environments are designed with elements close together, so you don't need to drag your mouse far. You can also use 'hover' effects, where your mouse hovers over an element. This is opposed to a touch screen, where I can easily move my hand/finger across the screen and can't 'hover' over elements. A touch screen also requires bigger hit targets, as you have less accuracy than a mouse.",1316077000

IOS is an established system, with a healthy ecosystem of developers and apps. IPhone and iPad dominate the mobile market with ease. That won't change anytime soon. Besides, Apple had showed in the past that they can survive living as a Microsoft competitor.\nThey will do just fine.\nWho should be worried about Windows 8 is Google.\nAndroid tablets didn't set the world on fire, Chrome OS from the very beginning looks like a low-profile project. \nAnd here comes Windows 8 which offers the same thing as Chrome OS (cloud, HTML5/JS apps, etc.) and does that in a better fashion than Honeycomb. Plus, it will run Windows software. Apple users learned to live without Windows software, Google users - didn't.

I do and am, and always have - it's a sign of taking the other party seriously, to my mind. If it proves laughably formal (never has but I can imagine the environment where it would), removing both jacket and tie leaves a decent compromise almost anywhere.<p>On the other hand, I've known others (though surprisingly few) who couldn't look less comfortable and at home in a suit if you cut anatomically unfortunate holes in it and poured in itching powder.

Adobe got complacent, thought it was the king of the world.<p>Then Microsoft joined the RIA fray with Silverlight, battling for control of the web. Flash was everywhere, SL up-and-coming. It was meant to be a spectacular battle, but both companies were blind-sided by this little web standard thing which was about to crash the party...<p>Except that it didn't. The war didn't end because someone won, but because Steve Jobs said so. It was only an illusion that HTML5 renders the RIA plugins irrelevant. In reality, it was the emergence of native apps. First iPhone, then Android, iPad, and now even Windows/Metro. Who cares about rich cross-browser apps?<p>So instead of developing a rich application that runs on all platforms, you either use HTML5/Javascript (if your application is not as hard), or implement the same thing on 3 platforms with 3 different languages on using 3 different toolsets.

2999340,comment,2999247,2999247,8,0,socratic,,,"This seems interesting, but I'm wondering who the target customer is (both for PiCloud, and for this specific use case with REST publishing).<p>We're running on Heroku, where workers are expensive (at least, unless you scale them dynamically).  We looked at SimpleWorker, which is basically PiCloud for Ruby.  But latency for enqueue-ing a job was way too high, and not having access to database models and such made it inconvenient for that purpose.  (Long story short, we ended up with Resque like everyone else.)  Does PiCloud have the enqueue latency problem beat?  (Like under 100ms RTT?)<p>But these services don't make sense to me for big data or scientific computing either.  If you have tons of data, you're probably going to end up with something like MapReduce with some specialized HBase-like backend.  And most ""scientific computing"" I've seen seems to be either MATLAB (if performance is no issue at all) or custom C++ code linking to specific linear algebra libraries (if performance is important).  That said, I'm not an expert in either of these use cases, so maybe I'm wrong?  Maybe this is for mobile or to fix some brokenness in GAE?<p>Put another way, what is the use case where you (a) don't care about high enqueue latency, (b) don't care about running within your own infrastructure and with your own code (e.g., for database access), (c) want tons of compute cycles in Python without having to manage the infrastructure, but (d) don't want specific control over the actual infrastructure and data persistence?",1316075908
