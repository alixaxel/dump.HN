Quite to the contrary.

2972147,comment,2964543,2971745,1,0,acdha,,,"> > This is a lot harder than ret-conning sexism on the Internet\n> ""ret-conning""? Do you mean retroactive continuity? In what way does that apply to anything I wrote? Is that an accusation of sexism on the part of an argument that advocates the possibility of innate gender differences?<p>Evolutionary psychology is a useful thought exercise but it fails to produce many falsifiable hypotheses, mostly due to the combination of limited historical evidence and the inability to conduct experiments. What this means in practice is that you should be skeptical of claims that existing social customs exist because of biology in the absence of strong evidence that such biological differences exist, have the stated effect and are not explained by other means.<p>Any neuroscientist will tell you that there are differences between male and female brains (really, it's more accurately caused hormone levels which that simple gender binary doesn't accurately express); they will also tell you that there's insufficient understanding how these low-level differences affect higher level abilities (reading, logic, etc.). This doesn't mean that there aren't effects but rather that anyone who's trying to use this in support of traditional Western gender roles is significantly in advance of what the evidence supports.<p>> > This Disney history, not anthropology.\nI actually expected a response like this. I'm using ""males go hunting"" and ""females tend to the family at home"" imagery so it must be a cartoonish simplification, right?<p>The fact that the remainder of your paragraph went on to accept that your original argument was, in fact, over-simplified suggests that it was. Again, nobody is arguing that men tend to be stronger but that doesn't tell you much about daily life, what the average person ate or how their children were raised. Since there are many examples of cultural differences in all of these areas, I submit that this cannot be so broadly described.<p>> As does ""hundreds of thousands of years ago"". The two overlap. No change of time-frames.<p>I stand by my earlier observation that 100,000 and 10,000 are an order of magnitude apart. This is actually of some significance as we have <i>extremely</i> little information for human life 100,000 years ago and even 10,000 years is still paltry; by the time you get into areas where we have much information about daily life (how would we be able to tell if it were common for men and women to hunt and gather together 100k years ago?), particularly at a level sufficient to shed any light at all on division of labor, socialization is already a major factor confounding any biological arguments.<p>> Not that that has anything to do with the accusation that I ascribe purpose to evolution, of which you provided no evidence.<p>See the previous paragraph, where you repeated it again. You cannot simply look at something's existence and conclude that it has been specifically selected for. It's highly likely that some minor differences might simply be due to things like different hormone levels at various points which trigger different, worthwhile changes; similarly since human brains take years to develop it's also hard to separate out the effects of practice. Adults who grew up without exposure to written text have significant differences in their brain structure which are entirely social but brain imaging can't tell you why. Going back to the topic, there are e.g. studies finding early gender preferences for colors but none of them can say how much is innate and how much is learned.<p>Since this has dragged on far too long, I'm going to leave a final summary of my position:<p>1. Our understanding of how the brain works is still quite limited, particularly when it comes to complex behaviour.\n2. We have relatively little historical data beyond the last few thousand years, making general statements of any sort hard to support. We simply don't have the data.\n3. Because humans are such social animals and we don't do experiments on our young, it's extremely difficult to avoid confounds due to socialization. In particular, many questions are going to have problems determining causation.\n4. Scientific claims are held to a high standard: hard data, falsifiability, predictiveness, etc.<p>All of this means that attempts to explain complex behaviour in terms of innate biology are decades ahead of scientific support. It can be interesting to discuss and could possibly even motivate people to advance the science to answer some of these questions but it's premature to call any of it science.",1315442773

2972107,comment,2971723,2971948,24,0,sho_hn,,,"FWIW, during KDE's (one of the largest open source communities around, with about 2500 active developer accounts with direct write access to many millions of lines of code across dozens of products, and large numbers of external contributors) ongoing migration from SVN to Git, GitHub was never considered as an option because the community considers it unacceptable for an open source community to throw their weight behind a proprietary solution.<p>Instead we seriously considered the open source alternative Gitorious.org for a while, but ultimately were unable to come to an agreement with Shortcut AS with regard to a satisfactory hosting plan, and also had troubles making its ACL system work for our needs in some exploratory migrations to the platform.<p>Self-hosting the Gitorious software also fell out of the running fairly quickly due to the ACL problems and other concerns about the software's features and implementation; while KDE probably would have been able to put together a squad of coders to work on the software in its interest, Shortcut at the time had failed to get a dev community around Gitorious off the ground and was unacceptably slow at processing merge requests - meaning a fork might have become necessary, which is always an icky proposition not to mention a big burden on resources.<p>Ultimately we ended up banging together our own Git infrastructure out of several smaller components, some of which we wrote ourselves:<p>* To handle access controls as well as the developer-facing repo management knobs (personal server-side clones, personal scratch repos, access management for those, a trashcan for repos, the works) we chose gitolite, which was definitely the best choice we could have made. It's reliable, well-documented, fast and rich in features, and its principal developer Sitaram Chamarty has been an incredible aid to our efforts both with many hours of work spent coding additional features we needed and tons of advice. We did write a couple of add-ins to gitolite ourselves to provide some additional commands to developers, which we found pleasant to do.<p>* As web-based repository viewer we use an inhouse-modified version of Redmine. As with gitolite, we've found the Redmine crew to be easy to approach and get help from, and while we ran into some trouble with the scalability of its Git support, it proved easy enough to modify without requiring massive forking. Redmine's database of projects serves a vital role in the system in that the gitolite config is generated from Redmine's database (e.g user access roles), and we also generate a custom-format XML from it that is used by end-user clone/build tools, our translation infrastructure, LXR and many other bits and pieces that have a need to discover projects and repositories and their metadata (which can be modified by project managers in the Redmine web UI, e.g. setting description texts or translation branches).<p>* For review, we use ReviewBoard, continuing on from SVN. This is definitely the weak spot in our setup right now; ReviewBoard just doesn't support Git very well since it's designed to handle single patches rather than series of them and thus also can't track branches. We've been looking at Gerrit on and off to replace it, but so far can't really bring ourselves to commit to it since it's a fairly unwieldy beast.<p>* We wrote our own repository hooks in Python, which are in charge of things like sending out commit mails to mailing lists, CIA.vc, the bug tracker and people mentioned in commit messages behind special keywords, evaluating other keywords to close bug tickets or review requests, check for trivial errors (EOL style, license headers, that sort of thing), ref backups and a bunch of other tasks. Some of which run through asynchronous job queues as required to avoid blocking.<p>* We wrote our own mirroring system to provide several read-only git:// mirror servers behind a geo-ip DNS load balancer. The mirrors get updated whenever a push to the master happens.<p>* KDE has an LDAP-based single sign-on system in use at many of its web properties including Redmine and ReviewBoard, currently using an inhouse-modified (mostly expanded with our own modules) version of GOsa as web frontend. GOsa is also used to request developer privileges and manage the SSH keys for Git write access.<p>* There are a couple of other minor bits and pieces flying about, like a commits.kde.org/<repoid/<abbreviated or full sha1> web app written in Ruby+Sinatra that forwards to the Redmine page for the commit; those URLs pop up in various places, e.g. in a developer's terminal output after pushing, in mail headers, CIA.vc postings, etc.<p>KDE's migration to Git is still ongoing, with many large and actively developed codebases still remaining in SVN at this time, as well as the entire translation effort. To actually migrate things we use our own tool called svn2git which takes raw SVN repo data, an account conversion map (supplied as plain text generated from our LDAP) and a plain text file with regex-based rules as input and produces git repositories. Writing the necessary rules files is unfortunately a time-intensive task especially given some very complex project histories originally imported from CVS, but additional tools exist to partially auto-generate them by analyzing SVN history programmatically.<p>Here's a couple of links of interest:<p>* The developer-facing user manual for KDE's Git infra: <a href=""http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitKdeOrgManual"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.kde.org/Sysadmin/GitKdeOrgManual</a><p>* The initial posting of the sysadmin working group's plan for the above setup, and our evaluation of this stack vs. the Gitorious software (ODF of the latter is attached to the first reply): <a href=""http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-scm-interest/2010-June/001438.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-scm-interest/2010-June/001...</a><p>* The XML export from Redmine mentioned above: <a href=""https://projects.kde.org/kde_projects.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projects.kde.org/kde_projects.xml</a>",1315441593

2972079,comment,2971971,2972069,15,0,ig1,,,"Here you go:<p>Michael Stern Hart was born in Tacoma, Washington on March 8, 1947. He died on September 6, 2011 in his home in Urbana, Illinois, at the age of 64. His is survived by his mother, Alice, and brother, Bennett. Michael was an Eagle Scout (Urbana Troop 6 and Explorer Post 12), and served in the Army in Korea during the Vietnam era.<p>Hart was best known for his 1971 invention of electronic books, or eBooks. He founded Project Gutenberg, which is recognized as one of the earliest and longest-lasting online literary projects. He often told this story of how he had the idea for eBooks. He had been granted access to significant computing power at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. On July 4 1971, after being inspired by a free printed copy of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, he decided to type the text into a computer, and to transmit it to other users on the computer network. From this beginning, the digitization and distribution of literature was to be Hart's life's work, spanning over 40 years.<p>Hart was an ardent technologist and futurist. A lifetime tinkerer, he acquired hands-on expertise with the technologies of the day: radio, hi-fi stereo, video equipment, and of course computers. He constantly looked into the future, to anticipate technological advances. One of his favorite speculations was that someday, everyone would be able to have their own copy of the Project Gutenberg collection or whatever subset desired. This vision came true, thanks to the advent of large inexpensive computer disk drives, and to the ubiquity of portable mobile devices, such as cell phones.<p>Hart also predicted the enhancement of automatic translation, which would provide all of the world's literature in over a hundred languages. While this goal has not yet been reached, by the time of his death Project Gutenberg hosted eBooks in 60 different languages, and was frequently highlighted as one of the best Internet-based resources.<p>A lifetime intellectual, Hart was inspired by his parents, both professors at the University of Illinois, to seek truth and to question authority. One of his favorite recent quotes, credited to George Bernard Shaw, is characteristic of his approach to life:<p>""Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world.  Unreasonable\n people attempt to adapt the world to themselves.  All progress,\n therefore, depends on unreasonable people.""\nMichael prided himself on being unreasonable, and only in the later years of life did he mellow sufficiently to occasionally refrain from debate. Yet, his passion for life, and all the things in it, never abated.<p>Frugal to a fault, Michael glided through life with many possessions and friends, but very few expenses. He used home remedies rather than seeing doctors. He fixed his own house and car. He built many computers, stereos, and other gear, often from discarded components.<p>Michael S. Hart left a major mark on the world. The invention of eBooks was not simply a technological innovation or precursor to the modern information environment. A more correct understanding is that eBooks are an efficient and effective way of unlimited free distribution of literature. Access to eBooks can thus provide opportunity for increased literacy. Literacy, the ideas contained in literature, creates opportunity.<p>In July 2011, Michael wrote these words, which summarize his goals and his lasting legacy: One thing about eBooks that most people haven't thought much is that eBooks are the very first thing that we're all able to have as much as we want other than air. Think about that for a moment and you realize we are in the right job."" He had this advice for those seeking to make literature available to all people, especially children:<p>""Learning is its own reward.  Nothing I can\n say is better than that.""\nMichael is remembered as a dear friend, who sacrificed personal luxury to fight for literacy, and for preservation of public domain rights and resources, towards the greater good.<p>This obituary is granted to the public domain by its author, Dr. Gregory B. Newby.",1315440928
