And lots of philosophers believe that normativity, what is wrong and right, is an important part of language. But it appears to be something dynamic, language changes over time, yet I can't change language by pretending dog means cat today.\nSo prescriptivism is wrong in the sense that you can't claim to have the sole authority on something. But descriptivism is vacuous, in that it doesn't explain the pervasive tendency for people to consider things to lie on continuum of wrong and right.",1316912315

Ooh, ooh, and TI-BASIC.  It seemed to my naive like languages were done.  I'd written a language of my own, and looking at it now, the changes I'd made look so shallow nowadays...<p>SICP changed that.  SICP didn't talk about classes/objects by introducing the syntax, it gave a problem where polymorphism was a perfect solution, and built up an object system from scratch.  SICP didn't talk about mutation as just something you do --- SICP discussed how it solved a specific problem.  Not claiming that SICP is the be-all end-all of textbooks; but if you're motivated and already know how to program, it is an a brilliant excursion into the fundamentals of programming.  In any case, after SICP I realized that language theory is a branch of computer science itself; a branch I soon fell in love with.<p>There's a continuation to this story --- the summer after high school, I wrote a compiler and started reading lambda the ultimate.  Learned type theory, started writing Haskell and Common Lisp, and quickly produced several dozen interpreters...

Past research has primarily examined the isolated effects of having either power or status, but we propose that power and status interact to affect interpersonal behavior. Based on the notions that a) low-status is threatening and aversive and b) power frees people to act on their internal states and feelings, we hypothesized that power without status fosters demeaning behaviors toward others. To test this idea, we orthogonally manipulated both power and status and gave participants the chance to select activities for their partners to perform. As predicted, individuals in high-power/low-status roles chose more demeaning activities for their partners (e.g., bark like a dog, say I am filthy) than did those in any other combination of power and status roles. We discuss how these results clarify, challenge, and advance the existing power and status literatures.",1316911071

Using machine learning for handwriting recognition is a pretty obvious ""innovation"" to anyone with a little background in AI who has thought about the problem at all.

The field is moving so fast right now that people are thinking of new ideas all the time; we don't need patents to encourage that.<p>There are some non-obvious algorithms that are worthy of patenting (that is, if algorithms were actually patentable).

3034694,comment,3033226,3033620,4,0,rayiner,,,"So the economic idea behind a patent is to prevent a free-rider problem. Say I spend years and tons of my money inventing the telephone. I finally make it work, then sell it on the market. Without the patent system, someone can buy my product, reverse engineer it, and release a knock-off at a vastly lower price than me because he doesn't have to recoup all of my R&D investment. If this happens all the time, then we have a market failure, where nobody has an incentive to engage in research-intensive invention where the end result can be easily copied.<p>This is really the only economically sensible basis for patent law. Unfortunately it tends to get clouded in lots of other fuzzy ideas, like protecting ideas and incentivizing innovation.<p>So to give an example of something I think is a legitimate software patent: consider a hypothetical solution to the hidden node problem in the context of white space devices and wireless microphones: <a href=""http://www.shure.com/idc/groups/public/@gms_gmi_web/documents/webcontent/us_pro_pr_ws_atk.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shure.com/idc/groups/public/@gms_gmi_web/document...</a><p>Basically, say you have a transmitter T and a receiver R, and a whitespace device W. W listens to the spectrum and opportunistically uses whatever radio channels it hears as free. T transmits on a fixed frequency to R, and R receives without transmitting. There are situations where because of geography, R can hear T, but W cannot hear T. So W detects T/R's frequency as free, tries to use it, and interferes with R. This is the problem that Microsoft's white space devices ran into with unlicensed wireless microphones in the FCC tests.<p>What algorithms could you put in a whitespace device (or a network of whitespace devices) to alleviate this problem? This is not really something that a programmer of average competence would find obvious. Indeed, so far nobody has a good solution to the problem, despite quite a bit of research. However, when somebody does come up with a good algorithm, it will be fairly easy for other manufacturers to copy it. Even if it's not, unless it can be protected by a patent, whoever discovers it will have a huge incentive to keep it secret, which means people can't work on improving it.<p>I think this is a pretty good case for allowing patenting of the algorithm within the specific context of a whitespace device (which is basically what the current law is supposed to be). You have a situation where solving a problem requires quite a bit of investment. You can't really do research on this without buying a bunch of whitespace devices and wireless mics and doing a bunch of testing in different conditions). At the same time, because the end result would be easy to copy, nobody really has the incentive to work on it, especially not smaller research labs which might be able to solve the problem but certainly wouldn't have the manufacturing muscle to build and sell their own whitespace devices.<p>The reason so many software patents sound ridiculous is because they don't really require any innovation. They're simply an attempt to take obvious ideas and keep other people from using them. As a rough rule of thumb, for a patent to make sense, it should take way more effort to come up with the algorithm than it does to implement it. If it doesn't then there isn't really any free rider problem.",1316910801

You need content on those pages - reviews and ratings (scrape Amazon, maybe, or product catalogues).<p>In other words, to make some cash out of this (and the five gajillion other sites you could set up in other niche verticals), you have to content spam the holy hell out of the Internet.

I got a chuckle from one thing: <i>besides the nearest RV park being 43 miles away</i> (I believe I know exactly the one you're referring to), it's also about 12 miles of country road driving, and it's no picnic in rush hour.<p>I hadn't thought at all about back taxes. That's an interesting point and one that I think could be overcome, but I'm not a lawyer.<p><i>why have none of the people selling these properties gone to the trouble to get the rates fixed and adjusted for past taxes</i><p>I believe I can take a stab at this. The SEV is not able to be corrected until after the home is purchased and the state assessment is done. When I bought my first home, my father referred to it as the ""surprise envelope"" (as in, ""You may already have won the Publisher's Clearing House!""). The back taxes situation is something you can research and can insure against (though, I'm willing to bet it's far more costly in the city limits).  But I think you summed it up the best. Who would want to go through this trouble? You did the research and drew the conclusion that it wasn't worth it. Once you have to bring a lawyer in, unless they're doing so for charitable reasons (and I know a few that do just this), it's not worth the money. Even free, it's not worth the time fighting the assessment/treasury.<p><i>Detroit has its charms but nothing to make up for the brokenness of the city</i><p>Yes.

3034649,comment,3033027,3033027,10,0,rbranson,,,"<i>sigh</i> I wish I could get excited about MRI releases. It's one of the most disappointing parts of using Ruby for my daily grind. The sluggish pace of innovation is sometimes demoralizing. Until 1.9.2, released a year after 1.9.1, and 4 years after 1.9.0, the 1.9 branch was too unstable for production use. Why were 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 GA releases again? The GC also still sucks, so the performance improvements from 1.9 are mostly nullified in real world applications.<p>Sometimes I wish the work on alternative implementations would be devoted to effort on MRI, but I understand this is a much more complex issue than it appears on the surface. It seems like all of the developers interested in real change in MRI that have the skills to make that change have hopped on to more interesting alternative implementations or left Ruby altogether.<p>While I've put JRuby in production for some smaller, non-Rails codebases that used JVM libraries, I've tried to run some non-trivial Rails applications on JRuby and it's just too slow for development work. Load time on code seems to be an order of magnitude slower, which is real time that adds up over a day worth of work to be something significant, so I'm back to REE. Rubinius is cool and they've come an amazingly long way, but personally I think the project suffers from what I'm going to call ""sufficiently smart compiler"" syndrome. After 5 years of work, they're still not even close to JRuby or MRI performance on real-world applications.<p>I've spent hours and hours understanding the technical and human reasons why all of these problems exist, but unfortunately the reality of shipping things trumps.<p>I guess that's why I've got this Clojure book in front of me.",1316909007
