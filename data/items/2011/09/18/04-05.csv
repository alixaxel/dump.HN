I understand he is point: make the markets fail-safe and idiot-proof and there won't be a need for government to keep reassuring us that everything is fine. And that's precisely what I'm disagreeing about. I'm saying that is not how markets work. Things HAVE to have risk, things HAVE to go up and down. Government HAS to step up every now and then to reassure me that everything will be ok. Even if you remove all possibility of corruption and theft from both the markets and the government, I will still need the government to assure me because of the uncertainties and unknowns in any market-driven economy.",1316321896

Some other data points that would give Google this information are Google Maps on my Android phone.  With explicit permission to read and report my coarse (network-based) and fine (GPS) location, it would be able to read any WiFi access point in range of my phone and link that with my exact GPS location and report that to Google.  I leave this enabled at all times for Google Latitude.  I would imagine that anyone with a smartphone and Google Maps who came near enough to your house could have reported your access point and GPS location to Google.

If the two realistic options are your code dropping off the face of the earth because it's never published, or it being put in a place where someone might find it useful and run with it, the latter is far more beneficial to society.<p>If you're concerned about your personal reputation (which in my experience tends to be the case) then consider you're likely better off as a prolific coder than a sparse one, and if anything we should be pushing the industry towards more open exchange of code so as to reduce loss & waste.",1316319184

When I left Apple in \n  1993, we had reached $8.3 billion in revenue, Macintosh \n  was the No. 1 selling PC hardware product in the world, \n  Apple was the most profitable PC hardware company in the \n  world and we had $2 billion of cash.\n</code></pre>\nThat is an interesting point in defense of his tenure there.
