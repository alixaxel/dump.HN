Simplicity will fall naturally out of the process of refining derivatives markets. Insurance is a derivative. Options are derivatives. Common Stock is actually arguably a derivative as well.

A tax affecting the lower end of the rich puts a barrier to entry into the ranks of the megarich. Lowering the cost of real estate, airplanes and businesses for him.<p>Can't we all just have a flat consumption tax and be done with it? 10% would benefit everyone (in particular retirees and savers), increase actual collections and be simpler to administrate (you get to fire a bunch of government employees). Increased revenue, reduced complexity, favouring savings. That sounds like a win to me.<p>In particular Alexander Hamilton wrote in the federalist papers about how these sorts of taxes were harder to raise to confiscatory levels. which 35% certainly is.",1316318145

Confidence in this instance is just trust that your assets won't suddenly become worthless or your standard of living won't drop drastically overnight. It is a GOOD thing that I have the choice to have or not have confidence in the Government. It means (a) I am not expected to have blind faith and (b) I have the right to assess the level of risk involved in trading and conduct my economic activities accordingly. I absolutely need the Government to restore consumer confidence in the housing market before I buy a new house.

With a revenue model so heavily dependent on pageviews, they need to keep their users engaged and on the site... and that doesn't appear to be the case over the long term.

3009421,comment,3009350,3009350,6,0,byoung2,,,"The html5 geolocation API allows your browser to share your location using the most accurate source available.  On a smartphone, this is the GPS antenna (when it's on), cell tower triangulation, or WiFi geolocation.  The WiFi location works because you can register your location on sites such as Skyhook, and Google collects this data when they drive the street view cars around.  On a desktop or laptop, this is usually WiFi or IP address (keep in mind you don't have to actually join the network, just be in range of one, so it could be a neighbor's).  With IP addresses, you can very accurately determine the country, and a general region, since IP blocks are usually assigned to ISP's, so if you are a cable customer, you can be traced to the nearest hop from your house, which will be about a 50-100 mile radius in most of the US.  For a more accurate position, here's where the privacy concerns come in.  There are companies like MaxMind that gather data on individual IP addresses.  In their words:<p><i>MaxMind partners with various websites where users are asked to enter some form of geographical location information. The IP address and location data are forwarded to MaxMind after all personally identifiable information have been scrubbed to protect privacy concerns. MaxMind then runs millions of these IP location pairs through a series of algorithms and programs that identify, extract, and extrapolate relevant associations between IP address and geographical information.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maxmind.com/app/ip-location-explained</a><p>So think about that the next time you fill out a form online.  When you put in your billing address, they are collecting your physical location and tying it to your IP address.  Even if they aren't getting full address to IP lists, they could at least calculate that certain ranges apply to certain streets.",1316317588

If someone else is asking for your money that is too good to be true, you lost that remaining 5%.<p>4)  It is theoretically possible that someone found this once in a million (billion?) possibility and just can't find money for it.

If no Wi-Fi access points are in range, or your computer doesn't have Wi-Fi, it may resort to using your computer's IP address to get an approximate location.
