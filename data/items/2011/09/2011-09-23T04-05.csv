3028880,comment,3028272,3028810,3,0,sophacles,,,"You know the phrase ""throw the book at him"" and the idea of justice are not identical right? ""Throwing the book"" is about finding and (over)zealously prosecuting (with much fanfare) for every possible offense, no matter how loosely associated to the actions that offense may be. Justice is about fairly metting out punishment and consequences for actions.  The very act of throwing the book at one person for a wrong and ignoring the wrongs of another is antithetical to justice. This was my point.<p>I never said Recursion was right in his actions, nor did I say he should not be punished. In fact, I'm pretty sure I lost a lot of respect for lulzsec over this one, when they stopped focusing on those they claimed were the problem and caused ""collateral damage"", and think there should be consequences for that.<p>Further, whether you agree with the message or not, this type of loud targeting of everyone that doesn't belong to the club, while not mentioning the faults of the big players, is what lulzsec was claiming to be fighting against. Throwing the book puts a certain amount of weight into those statements, no? Simply arresting and prosecuting without all the hoopla and moving on would seem far more effective if you were really against all the ""hippy tech youth crap"".<p>NOTE: cut it with the absurd name calling. This is not grade-school, if you don't like my position state your disagreements.",1316753906

On the other hand, when it comes to enterprise contracts, stability matters a lot more.<p>I have at least some first-hand evidence to this fact. $DAYJOB is currently at a large enterprise service provider. We are currently buying HP switches like crazy, and I don't expect that to change. I've also been privy to some aspects of the sales process. We can go through the sales song and dance forever and ever, going deeper and deeper in to technical and business details. However, when the prospect asks about company stability, size, and governance, this always signifies they are about to ask for a formal contract.<p>In other words, for big, enterprise customers, stability matters. It's impossible to tell what sort of effect this will have on HP. Maybe none. But these sorts of subtle changes to reputation have a funny trajectory of their own, independent of the instantaneous news cycle. I wouldn't be surprised if IBM et al. started using the shake-up to their advantage during the sales process. We very well might see some of the after-effects in the next six months.<p>The way HP handles this transition will be critical.

Bring your group to the Boiler Room for a unique and rewarding adventure.<p>If you have eight or more people and you schedule with us at least 48 hours ahead of time, you qualify for our specialgroup rates.

Whether it's a birthday party, a youth group, a school group, your work colleagues, or just a bunch of friends, you're sure to have a good time. Teamwork, communication, trust, strategy, problem solving, challenge and most of all FUN. Climbing is a highly interactive and social activity that helps people of all ages build confidence in themselves and others in their group.<p>If the participants in your group are age 14 or older, they're eligible to take our Basic Safety Training Lesson. We'll teach them how to tie the safety knots, how to manage the safety ropes (called ""belaying""), and basic climbing technique.<p>If the participants in your group are younger than 14, we ask that you bring at least one adult (or person over the age of 14) for every 4 climbers in your group. We'll teach the adults proper safety and belaying technique: how to tie the knots and manage the safety ropes.

It should automatically show you all the breweries in a certain range. Do you mean that you had to increase the range, and didn't like the refresh - and that instead of refreshing I should do it via ajax?<p>Users can actually add beers, breweries. Since you're the second person to mention that, clearly I need to make it more obvious and easier. I did focus on adding California and New York first, they are very complete. Now I'm thinking I need to focus on my local area, and physically go to the breweries to get their help promoting the site, as you mentioned.<p>Great feedback. Up until now I have been focusing on data entry, but I do see the need for UX improvement.<p>I've actually done a couple of Stumble Upon campaigns, they're at least as targeted as Facebook ads, and very cheap.
