Are you using the same password as your email account? Do you use a third party email account? Do you have a 'forgot my password' feature? Here's an attack vector: I get read access to your gmail account, then I use the 'forgot my password' feature to change your password and I have then rooted your site.<p>From the web application & OS level everything is fine. No-one has compromised anything, the web application has performed exactly as required, since the admin user has just logged in normally.<p>There's also social engineering attacks, could I get you to open a certain webpage that I control?

This usage of inflation has become obsolete with the end of the gold standard.<p>Inflation is by definition a rise in price levels, usually measured by the CPI (whose definition is sometimes subject to debate, but no measure of price levels is perfect; the important thing is to choose one that's reasonable and then stick to it).<p>Inflation, i.e. a rise in price levels, can then <i>cause</i> an increase of money supply measures, as producing firms take on larger amounts of credit to finance their operations, and this leads to a (rather weak, and only valid over the long run) <i>correlation</i> of inflation and growth of money supply. There are also tertiary effects that can cause both inflation and growth of money supply (such as excessive government deficits). But it's important not to confuse those things.",1315558598

2977418,comment,2976044,2977161,2,0,vorg,,,"> I think there was an attempt by early humans to make words have as less syllables as possible to simplify communication<p>There doesn't seem to be any common-accepted definition of what a word is, especially across difference languages. See \nMartin Haspelmath's 2010 paper at www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/staff/haspelmath/pdf/WordSegmentation2010.pdf His abstract:<p>'''The general distinction between morphology and syntax is widely taken for granted, but it crucially depends on the notion of a cross-linguistically valid concept of ""(morphosyntactic) word"". I show that there are no good criteria for defining such a concept. I examine ten criteria in some detail (potential pauses, free occurrence, mobility, uninterruptibility, non-selectivity, non-coordinatability, anaphoric islandhood, nonextractability, morphophonological isiosyncrasies, and deviations from biuniqueness), and I show that none of them is necessary and sufficient on its own, and no combination of them gives a definition of ""word"" that accords with linguists' orthographic practice. ""Word"" can be defined as a language-specific concept, but this is not relevant to the general question pursued here. ""Word"" can be defined as a fuzzy concept, but this is theoretically meaningful if the continuum between affixes and words, or words and phrases, shows some clustering, for which there is no systematic evidence at present. Thus, I conclude that we do not currently have a good basis for dividing the domain of morphosyntax into ""morphology"" and ""syntax"", and that linguists should be very careful with cross-linguistic claims that make crucial reference to a cross-linguistic ""word"" notion.'''",1315558425

The problem is actually that the above poster cannot hear them.<p>This idea, that tones are not important, is an extremely widespread misconception, and as I see it, relates to three factors:<p>1) the general poor quality of western Mandarin education, which allows foreigners to get by without properly learning tones because teachers are too nice to say anything about it,<p>2) The idea that Mandarin and English are massively and irreconcilably different has led to general ignorance about the language, which in turn leads to amateur-level hacks becoming ""experts"" by merely knowing more than the absolute minimum about the language, and<p>3) general politeness shown to foreigners in large Chinese tourist destinations.<p>Once you get beyond novelty party Chinese, you realize that to be properly understood it is absolutely imperative that your tones are correct. Or, barring that, that you make an effort.

The only data they have are the lengths of the translations (in syllables) and how long it took to read them.  The ""information density"" is just a fancy way to report the former, and they only reveal the latter through the rates.  It seems they simply observed that 1. translations differ in length but 2. are read in about the same amount of time.  Alas, talk of ""information density"" had me hopeful they applied a protocol like Shannon's to the spoken domain.<p><a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Shannon1950.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Shannon1950.pdf</a>",1315556254

What gets me is that, in my opinion, most people think that learning to code starts with coding.<p>Really, I think the most difficult aspect of programming is taking the real world process, as you see it in your head, and turning it into an automated process using a programming language and all of the ""best known practices"" that have come about over some 30 to 40 years.<p>I suggest you look into Behavior Driven Development (BDD). BDD forces you to look at the why and even forces you to run through the ""does it even make sense to make this"".<p>You have the chance to describe the Behavior of your program in something that looks almost like English (you should also use mockups of how you want your program to run using pen/paper or something like balsamiq mockups).<p>Then, you start writing the minimal amount of code to make the program do what you described using BDD (Gherkin).<p>This will allow you to focus on learning a few aspects of programming you need to make that one behavior work.<p>I also wrote a book on programming that focuses on the ""why"" (I was able to keep the number of lines of code down to like 10 if I recall). If we can exchange emails in some way, I'll let you have a copy. (edit: doh, I just saw you email above so I'll send you a link).",1315555947

Oregon has (nearly) a flat income tax at 9%, while California has a progressive income tax topping out around 9.5%.  The CA income tax advantage shrinks as you make more money.<p>On the other hand, if you don't make a lot of money, then you probably have a lower savings rate.  If your savings rate is low, then a large portion of your income is subject to the 7-9% sales tax.<p>It'd be interesting to draw a surface map.  On the two horizontal axis put income and savings rate, and make the height the difference between the total effective California tax and Oregon tax.  I'd do this now, but I need to sleep instead.<p>Additionally, one should compare CA's Prop 13 with OR's Measure 47.  Both limit the rate at which a houses assessed value can grow, but Prop 13 allows for discontinuities of assessed value when a house is bought, while Measure 47 doesn't.  As a result, new home owners in OR pay much lower property taxes than new home owners in CA.  (By new home owner, I mean someone who newly owns a house, not someone who owns a new house.  Measure 47 favors old houses.)",1315555259
