There is a line somewhere in between facebook knowing only what I explicitly post, and it knowing absolutely everything about me that users will not accept.  Seeing that we're only accelerating towards the ""knowing everything about me"" side with no sign of braking scares me.  Whether that's where you're at now doesn't matter all that much to me.  I've seen no sign that this isn't where you're headed, and I don't want to be a part of it when you get there.",1316962726

The GOF book is much maligned\nI think because people insist on taking each pattern\ncompletely literally down to the last detail. GOF's\npattern (GOF didn't create it but they discuss it on page 4, I thought I was crazy until I just checked just now) is specifically ""MVC, and because we only know\nabout C++^H^H^H Smalltalk graphical libraries and not very much about\nstateless HTTP systems yet in 1993, the model notifies\nthe view of changes too, how else would it work ?"" IMHO.\nIt's an implementation detail, it's not the essence of\nthe pattern.<p>So if a JS framework is now doing MVC that includes the\nconcept of ""model notifies the view"", sure call it\n""classical MVC"" or ""model-notify-view-controller"" (MNVC).\nShrugs.",1316962424

E.g., Siemens Step 7. That is standard IT hacking. Not a ""problem"".<p>Second, you must be able to exploit the installation. Let me explain a bit more.<p>In software terms, what you are given to work with is a list of hex values denoting inputs, and then a list of hex values denoting outputs.<p>So - without knowledge - what you will see is <i>conceptually</i> like this:<p><pre><code>    READ 0x1\n\n    READ 0x2\n\n    IF 0x1 + 0x2 > 314159 THEN\n\n      WRITE 0xA, 100\n\n    ENDIF\n</code></pre>\nWhat do those numbers mean? There's no context until you know what those read/write registers are plugged into. And those could be different for each installation.<p>The second part isn't always brought out in the Stuxnet discussions. Part of the search for understanding for Stuxnet was decoding how the registers mapped to the installation.<p>For the interested reader, I refer you to the Symantec white paper. It is of quite high quality and good technical detail. The SCADASEC mailing list contains useful discussion by people involved in the industry, and they really bring out the differences between SCADA security and IT security. And for the really interested reader, I recommend reading up on PLC programming and digging up protocol standards for MODBUS and DNP3.",1316962124

AT&T was then, in effect, the world’s largest copper mine. Fortunately, this fact was not widely known in the investment community. Had it been known, some corporate raider might have bought AT&T, terminated all telephone service in the United States, ripped out all the wire, and sold the wire to a copper refiner to get a quick\npayback.</i>",1316960276

I now realize it was because of confusing naming.<p>For people who are familiar with the MVC pattern for desktop UI's, I think it is confusing to use the same name for web frameworks which follow a different architecture. On the other hand, for people without this background, for whom MVC means ""like rails"", it is probably more confusing to introduce a new name for the same.",1316960264

They are the ones implementing zombie cookies using the 10 or so methods of storage and the ones that directly sell your information to even seedier companies. I used to work for one so I know what goes on. This will always be a dance between smart developers usurping tracking efforts and smart developers coming up with new tracking methods.<p>I really don't understand the extreme sentiment that your info via cookies is the worst form of privacy breach there is. Why would you not be more concerned with the companies that charge $.50 per call to access an API that can fetch information on anyone that fills out a form (""Oh I never knew my neighbor only makes $48k a year"")? I guarantee you these companies know more about you than Google, Twitter and Facebook (unless you post every thought ever, of course). Case in point, they knew my coworker's wife at the time was 4 months pregnant. Unless you can derive such information from searches (doubtful and completely not worth the effort) then this information obviously came from elsewhere.

NextStep/Cocoa followed the MVC pattern closely without having this ability for a long time.
