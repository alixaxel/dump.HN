2948284,comment,2945185,2947408,2,0,runningdogx,,,"It's not just about steady state memory footprint.  It's about the whole stack, how apache and mod_php and mysql (if you use it) interact.<p>Excessive traffic means a spike in simultaneously served connections, which means a spike in apache threads (assuming worker MPM, iirc there's 1 process per 25 threads by default).  With the mod_php model, the per-thread php memory usage can be very expensive when you have dozens or hundreds of apache threads serving requests.  A spike in running php instances leads to a spike in mysql connections for a typical web app.  If you haven't tuned mysql carefully, which most typical environments have not, mysql memory usage will also skyrocket.<p>Then for the coup de grace you get stupid apps which think it's perfectly fine to issue long-running queries occasionally (occasionally meaning something like .1% to a few percent of page loads).  When that happens, if you're using myisam tables which were the default with mysql < 5.5 (and which therefore dominate deployments, even if ""everyone knows"" you're supposed to be using innodb), then those infrequent long-running queries block the mysql thread queue, leading to an often catastrophically severe mysql thread backlog.  Since php threads are issuing those queries, the apache+mod_php threads stack up as well, and they do not use trivial amounts of memory.<p>The result is that you have to severely over-engineer the machine with excess memory if you want to survive large traffic spikes.  If you don't, you can easily hit swap which will kill your site temporarily, or worse, run out of swap too and have the oomkiller kill something... either your webserver or mysql.<p>The benefit to fastcgi is it takes the memory allocation of php out of apache's hands, so every new apache thread is more limited in how much bloat it adds to the system.  With a limited pool of fastcgi processes, you can also limit the number of db connections which further improves the worst-case memory usage scenario.<p>The advantage of in-apache-process php is that it serves php faster when there are few parallel requests, but it's on the order of single-digit milliseconds difference (the extra overhead of sending requests through a fastcgi socket), which is dwarfed by network rtt times even if none of the above pathologies rear their heads.<p>The apache+mod_php model is to do php processing for all active connections in parallel.  The fastcgi model is to do php processing for at most x connections where x is the php fastcgi pool size, leaving all other requests to wait for an open slot.  It may intuitively seem like the fastcgi model is going to be slower because some requests have to wait for a fastcgi process to become free, but if you think about average php request time it's going to be better for high parallelism, because the limiting factors are cpu and i/o.  The apache model ends up using ridiculous amounts of resources just so no php request has to wait to begin getting processed by php.  The high contention particularly for i/o created by apache and mysql when they have large numbers of threads is what makes the fastcgi model superior.",1314840419

In GAE, the instance is the process.  If the process is idle waiting for IO, you are still being charged.  Spinning up more processes mean more instances running and more are charged.<p>In that sense, GAE's $0.08 per process-instance-hour is quite expensive compared to AWS's $0.085 per machine-instance-hour.
