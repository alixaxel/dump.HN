In my opinion plain text transmission of data is essential for the web, which would allow things like Google to keep working regardless of the ""language"" being used, whether it be HTML or Markdown, etc.<p>Having thought about it more, I think the real issue here is standards. All these other problems are a function of that in my opinion. The problem with standard stagnation and lack of competitiveness, whether it be missing features or hardware access, is not a coincidence in my opinion. This isn't some rut we are currently in that if we work hard enough we'll get out of. Instead, I think that the structurally process itself is predisposed to it. 5 years from now, the web will just have a new set of technologies that its behind native on. In other words, the way things are headed, the web can never be cutting edge. And sure, there will always be things that work well on the web, but I would personally like a cutting edge web.<p>Additionally, I'd like to add that as I stated in the article, I have discussed these thoughts with Joe on more than one occasion, and even had him look this over beforehand to make sure I wasn't putting words in his mouth. I don't think I was apologizing for Joe, I just think this is a really complex situation where the same analysis can take different shapes.",1316733737

Starting with <i>fault tolerance, speed, unit testing, code abstraction, etc.</i> is starting at the wrong point. 90% of performance problems are at the database level.<p>What's most likely wrong with performance in a webapp:<p><pre><code>  1. No/bad indexes/missing foreign keys on your db
  2. Stupid joins
  3. You're doing stupidly complicated things in an ORM
  4. You're doing complicated things in the DB instead of loading a large chunk into memory and doing calculations or aggregations in code. Simple DB queries are a lot faster than you think they are. Complicated ones are a lot longer than you think they'll be. There are weird gotchas in DBs like using a function in a where or select clause will cause a massive performance hit.
  5. You're not caching into memory or something like memcached things that changes infrequently but are queried regularly. Memcached is actually overkill most of the time. Actually think about how much memory storing X would take compared to how much memory your machine has. Be surprised at how insignificant it is these days.
  6. 1-5 are especially true if you're using Mysql - It's great and all, but all the other big DBs piss all over it for out of the box performance. You have to give it some love. I expect some dissent here. They're wrong. MS SQL is a shit ton better at handling a poorly designed db/db queries out of the box than mysql. I can't stress this enough.

We'll have to see how this plays out in terms of what copyright and contractual terms were breached. But if this were a case of a writer working on this memoir with him, and the writer deciding that Assange was whitewashing important events in his career, then this would be the kind of ""leak"" that would seemingly fall under the kind that Wikileaks feels morally compelled to make.<p>Assange is not merely a private figure any more. The content that would make up his autobiography is of large political importance, given his significant accomplishments.<p>That said, if it turns out the writer ran with the memoir to turn it into a seedy tale of Assange's personal characteristics, then I completely empathize with him.
