2960867,comment,2960687,2960687,12,0,tokenadult,,,"Upvoted because the issue is important and there are intelligent people to discuss the issue here. I regret that the article's key factual statement is ""Testing does not motivate engagement, passion, creativity and innovative thinking,"" without any evidence to back that up. There is no suggestion in the article where to look around the world to find an example of a school system with differing practices that motivate engagement, passion, creativity and innovative thinking. There is a huge research base on science education (it is considered an important national priority in many different countries) all around the world, but the submitted article doesn't discuss what good practice looks like.<p>The TIMSS study is another international study to look at for information about science education in various countries. Most studies of education policy suffer from the same defect of not having a truly experimental design:<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that is, most of those studies don't have random assignment of students to treatment and control groups, but rather look for correlations between academic performance and other observations, with nothing in the study design being able to give assurance of causation.<p>Science textbooks used in the United States have long been very lousy,<p><a href=""http://www.textbookleague.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.textbookleague.org/</a><p>and as I have had a chance to see science textbooks from other countries, particularly Taiwan, China, and Russia, I hazard the guess that improving textbooks in the United States would help more learners learn science more successfully. General improvement of teaching technique along the lines discussed in another current HN thread<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2960085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2960085</a><p>would probably also be helpful, but the policy incentives needed to improve teacher performance are not easy to come by in the United States.<p>After edit: To answer a question asked in another comment below the submitted article, scientific illiteracy is an important public policy issue because scientific illiteracy in a democratic republic results in voters voting for stupid policies because they don't understand science. The reason to know science isn't just to get a job, but to be a more thoughtful citizen and voter.",1315187915

It's more errors that have to be dealt with, and causes confusion and in an earlier project, abandoned carts, or increase in phone calls to 800 numbers to talk to someone to place an order.<p>Can I say it was <i>specifically</i> that?  No, but I did see higher than anticipated abandonment rates after wrong CC numbers/types were chosen.<p>But... hey... ""that's not our site"" and ""our users are different"".

2960861,comment,2960714,2960714,2,0,cletus,,,"At the same time there is a definite ""education bubble"" going on, somewhat counterintuitively, with the spiraling cost of education [1].<p>The reasons for this seem to be complex, including the availability of student loans, the increasing importance of college rankings allowing higher ranked institutions to raise prices, losing money on athletics [2], arbitrary requirements and/or incentives for college degrees where none are technically required and so on.<p>While we've pushed the notion that education is its own reward and colleges don't necessarily exist to teach you anything useful in the real world, it's becoming increasingly clear that prospective students are going to have to make their choice of whether to go to college and what degree to get from an economic standpoint, at least in part.<p>One of the problems seem to be that for many professions colleges have a captive market where you can't practice in whatever field you've trained for without an internship or similar. In some fields demand greatly exceeds supply causing some internships to be sold [3].<p>To quote Kent Brockman [4], ""Scott, things aren't as happy as they used to be down here at the unemployment office. Joblessness is no longer just for Philosophy majors - useful people are starting to feel the pinch.""<p>You also have (particularly left-wing) governments who treat college attendance as some kind of political goal, which is crazy. Having access to a college education is not the same thing as giving everyone a college education (whether they will benefit from it or not).<p>The biggest problem I think is that most of the jobs of future don't exist yet [5]. It's unclear if, in the future, the population will be fully employed. I can't find a link but I do remember reading one economist's bleak prediction that in the future, with increasing automation, only 20% of the population will be required to produce the world's ""stuff"", the other 80% being much like the ship inhabitants in Wall-E.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://lifeinc.today.com/_news/2011/08/11/7349127-good-graph-friday-whats-rising-faster-than-health-care-college-costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifeinc.today.com/_news/2011/08/11/7349127-good-graph...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/college-athletics-losing-money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/college-athletics-losing-mo...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.michigandaily.com/content/selling-internships-highest-bidder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michigandaily.com/content/selling-internships-hig...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003026/quotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003026/quotes</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2006/05/20/jobs-future-work_cx_hc_06work_0523jobs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/2006/05/20/jobs-future-work_cx_hc_06wo...</a>",1315187806

I get that its very difficult, nobody ever said its easy to algorithmically guess review spam.<p>But they clearly don't want users to see unfiltered reviews.  A tiny gray link below all 40 reviews, then a captcha (or two or three) and then a slow user experience before you can see the filtered reviews is lame.<p>I agree with you about the showing other reviews of the same subject, that would be neat.  I guess if I were Yelp, I would try harder at standing up for their algorithms and show more data about why they work and why we are better off having their amazing algorithms.<p>I had an experience a year or so ago with a friend who started a moving service in SF.  A couple of months after he started the business, he noticed he received a review on Yelp from some dude that said during a moving job, the guy took a smoke break and peed all over the sofa he was moving.  Not only was the story ridiculously false but my buddy had no idea who the reviewer was.  The review did however NOT get filtered, even after he responded to the review and contacted Yelp.  And he was stuck with this crazy review at the top of his profile.  This went on for months and it really damaged his credibility, meanwhile he would have positive reviews from legitimate customers who would naturally have a newer profile or whatever and the reviews would get filtered.

However, I have NO IDEA how much to charge for specific services. Right now I'm trying to help a magazine put their content online and store user comments... Simple stuff like that. Can I bill my general services at something like $30/hour? How about the graphic design component, would that cost more or less?<p>Another example. Say I am building a mobile phone app (Android) for a client. Again, I have no idea how to price these... Before I've just gone for a fixed rate for the whole project to be completed, but that's never worked out to more than like $20/hour, which I feel is pretty low.<p>So I could use some general advice with how to price my services, and maybe get some ideas what others are doing.

What kind of periodic interval can you recommend that would be generally applicable, how should the deadlock handler react in such a situation etc. periodic detection will make the deadlock handler harder to write.<p>> Java's Date/Time classes have a broken design<p>They might be.

The slide deck is an obviously random hodge podge collection of disconnected scraps. It is a waste of time to go read through it.

To Yelp, someone who signs up for an account and writes one positive review is the exact same thing as a script written to create bots that go off and write one positive review. They're both identical. And the bots' behavior can change to write more reviews to prevent looking like a bot. Business reputations take time, so when Yelp's algorithm sees ""this business has been around since 1975, and 100% of its positive reviews just came in over the past 10 months, where 100% of its reviews were previously negative before that"", that should be a red flag.
