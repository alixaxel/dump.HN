You learn small nuances in how better musicians play while also getting in some good ear training. Works much better for me than getting sheet music and interpreting it in my own (amateur) way. It certainly works better at correcting little problems than most teachers can.<p>Sound editors like audacity can slow down sections and then do pitch shifting to make it sound like a slow version of the original. It's very difficult to use those features to make a good recording (it usually sounds at least a little weird), but for doing quick and dirty analysis of a song that will be thrown out within a few minutes, it's fantastic and easy.<p>I've used this method a few times over the years and wish I had time to do it more. Now that this article made the connection to learning a new language, I can actually see myself learning a new language, which has always seemed like it would take too much time. Obsessing over sound clips in Audacity seems totally normal to me, though.",1315245542

The bar has been raised significantly since say a century ago. What worked a century ago is insufficient now; there aren't any jobs for the illiterate anymore.<p>2. I think teachers used to optimize a different function than they do now. Currently, they try to minimize the number of fails; the curriculum is designed to allow say 90% to pass, so teachers direct their attention at the 20%-30% range of students. With fewer repercussions on the absolute number of fails, teachers used to sort-of optimize for maximal average improvement. That meant that they would help all kids, and take pride both in getting the less bright to pass exams, and in getting bright kids to rise above themselves.<p>#2 is pure opinion, but I do not think it is completely besides the truth.",1315245389

2962892,comment,2962057,2962785,2,0,luu,,,"What's your definition of modern? The latest and greatest ARM processor (Cortex-A9) has a penalty for shifting. Their shifts are a bit strange, because any alu op can shift one of the operands. For standard alu ops, shifting by an immediate costs one extra cycle, and shifting by a register costs two extra cycles. Mov, i.e, a pure shift, only costs an extra cycle in the register case, but it’s still more expensive than, say, an add.<p>I haven't done any Itanium assembly since McKinley (Itanium 2), but their shifts had 3 extra cycles of latency. Making a fast shifter has only become a harder problem since then, because the ratio of wire:gate delay has grown; they could have a single cycle shifter in the current implementation, but it would cost them even more than it did back then.<p>x86 is unique among modern architectures because it has so much legacy baggage. Shifts are only fast on x86 because when Intel implanted slow shifts on the P4, it killed performance in a lot of apps that were compiled with compilers that were accustomed to having fast shifts, so that they would substitute shifts for multiplies whenever possible.",1315245377

But that's not intrinsic to the SSL trust model.<p>We are zero lines of code away from a key-continuity trust model where no CA's are required for vigilant and technically qualified users. Some people call this ""TOFU"".<p>We are zero lines of code away from a cert-pinning model that uses installed based of millions of people to detect bogus certs, regardless of whether Verisign has complied with some government order to sign them.<p>We are tens --- literally tens --- of lines of code away from a model that cordons off parts of the CN space to specific CAs or notary servers. Don't want Thawte to have a say in whether a cert belongs to EFF.ORG? Don't want to have to depend on key continuity or cert pinning to enforce that? This level of sophistication is almost but not quite a UI feature away from completion.<p><i>None</i> of these ideas are trivially implemented with DNSSEC. The entire design of DNSSEC militates against some of them.<p>Meanwhile: DNSSEC does not exist. Applications are not ready for DNSSEC. Many of them will require new revisions to function properly in a post-DNSSEC world. DNSSEC the way people-who-hate-CA's conceive of DNSSEC requires every user to run a full caching resolver on their desktop. How many people in Iran do that today? Having never been deployed ""in the large"", nobody knows whether DNSSEC even works.<p>By any reckoning, we are far more lines of code away from a working DNSSEC trust model than we are from <i>any</i> reasonable improvement to the HTTPS/TLS trust model, which is far more adaptable than DNSSEC (the SSL/TLS PKI has no other dependencies other than SSL/TLS trust, unlike DNSSEC, which also has to make the whole Internet work).<p>So I'm asking you again: why would you rather deploy DNSSEC than fix HTTPS/TLS?<p>Please don't say ""because I don't trust all the CAs in my browser configuration"" again.",1315245200

Greatly. A good example is the book: ""Transaction Processing"" by Jim Gray. It was published in 1993, and it is still relevant. Also NO Big Name in the Agile Community has endorse it. But I would recommend everybody to at least read the introduction.<p>""Java is dead"" - Yeah right, just like C++ is dead as well. Of course writing Ruby will make you a great software developer (sarcasm). There is nothing new in Ruby/Python/Scala/Clojure.. they are just a different mesh of features from other languages, just like Java. And Ruby will be dead soon, just like Java. Use the least mature language know to mankind(sarcasm).<p>Now this one is interesting: ""Be a craftsman and a professional, not an engineer"". Ok so Developers are artists right? Well, I'm sorry to say that artists don't really follow an established process. At least not the Great artists. They create their own. Additionally, the comparison between an artist an a doctor is like saying: ""Find the middle ground and that's where you need to be."" Let me tell you that middle ground is called engineering.<p>""Never fall into the trap of thinking for yourself"" - WOW. So you need to be an artist, a professional, read only books from 10 years ago but find ALL the solutions in such books... and never think for yourself. If you are wrong you will learn from your mistakes and that will make you a better software developer.<p>This article should be called: ""How to be a noob in 13 steps."" I am really afraid to go on.<p>My recommendation for software developers out there, on what has worked for me on on 14 years is:<p>1. Read and Read a lot. Don't put a cap on what you read. In fact Read everything if possible. There are solutions found in the 1960s that have been forgotten that could be useful today.<p>2. Practice all you can and Experiment with new ideas and solutions. Computer science is filled with interesting problems and solutions, try to find different solutions to proposed ones. Be creative, be an artist, but also learn from your mistakes.<p>3. Be a multi-language programmer. Doesn't matter what languages you learn, every language has a different way of thinking and might help you in whatever program you create later. I would recommend learning Common Lisp, but that is  up to you, using lisp won't help you be a better programmer, but understanding will.<p>4. Read Code from other people. Go to Github and just read through code, understand the style, the structure and the purpose. Practice by finding ways to improve people's code.<p>5. Experiment with Software Development Methodologies. Take what you need from each one and tried to integrate it. Experiment with it. Current established methodologies worked for their founder, but think about the fact that most methodologies (just like languages) are just a mesh of ideas from other methodologies. Create your own. Make it Work.<p>6. Follow Kent Becks Advice to handling complexiity: ""Make it work. Make it Right. Make it fast"".<p>I guess I could continue on writing, but the ideas are simple: Read Books, Practice Coding, Learn multiple programming languages, Read Code and Experiment with Soiftware Development Metodologies.",1315243578

First, it could copy the file, and second, it could move the file. The default on Windows (and OS X, IIRC) is to copy when the source and target are two different drives, and move if it's the same drive. This is likely to produce the correct result, but it wiil not always do so. If you want one and get the other, you will be unhappy with the result.<p>If you have learned cut/copy/paste in an application, then you will know the difference between cut and copy, and this will help you achieve the correct result right away. I presume this is the reason for them traditionally promoting cut/copy/paste over drag and drop.<p>Second, drag and drop is not discoverable. Items on the a toolbar or ribbon are trivially discoverable, but new and unskilled users may not even realize that drag and drop is an option.<p>This is the advantage of a ribbon populated with commands. Not only are the commands preferred by infrequent explorer users (cut/copy/paste) easily accessible to them, but new users have the even more easily understood option of choosing ""move to"" or ""copy to"".

One is about making something naturally usable, and the other is about making an emotional connection.  They are completely different goals applied to products.<p>Coke's iconic bottle is not about affordance (though it does have good affordances) it is about signally fun, enjoyment, summer, etc.  Coke has literally spent billions over decades to embed that emotional reaction in the American public.<p><a href=""http://www.hnl.bcm.tmc.edu/cache/The%20Pepsi-Coke%20challenge%20and%20wine%20tasting.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hnl.bcm.tmc.edu/cache/The%20Pepsi-Coke%20challeng...</a><p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_45/b4107089295954.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_45/b41070892...</a><p>Pour pepsi in a coke bottle and it 'tastes' better ...literally your brain reacts differently when examined with an MRI when you know you are drinking Coke.<p>Apple's goal is to provoke the same emotional reaction with respect to their design language, and has also spent (billions?) doing so in commercials, actions and design choices over the last decade plus.<p>No one is immune to this.  I have a Mini Cooper.  I love it.  But it is a direct example of favoring emotion over affordance. As a specific example: There is a bank of identical dip switches just below the radio.  They look cool, and fit with Mini's design language.  They however have Negative affordance.  The switches all feel the same ... ""Am I opening a lock?  Rolling down a window?  Or turning on/off Dynamic Stability Control?""  I don't know ... hopefully it isn't they dynamic stability control.<p>And everything effects emotional connection.  Mini's introduction of an SUV!?!   My emotional connection to my own Mini is watered down by the company attempting to expand beyond the core idea providing that emotional connection.  Is that rational? ... no.  But it is real.  My Mini still drives like a go kart, I haven't fallen out of love with it, but the existence of a Mini SUV does make me less likely to make excuses for its real failings.<p>Favoring design language over affordance is the reason for the gut reaction people have when they complain that this has poor design.  It is based on an emotional reaction, not on whether it works.  Whether it works is entirely besides the point.<p>If you design for emotional connection people look past actual usability problems.  They may even make up fanciful explanations of why it is better (in the face of evidence) because they like it and want it to be better anyway.  When you buy something to signal something about yourself there is an emotional need to defend it.<p>Obviously affordance vs design is not entirely an either or proposition.  It is best to have both.  Sadly emotional reactions are influenced by extremes.  Sacrificing usability to provide the signal of usability can be a successful strategy.  Sacrificing the signal of usability to provide usability is a much more difficult proposition.",1315242474
