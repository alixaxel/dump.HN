It seems similar to SMS and e-mail. The concept is something that will last forever, but eventually, someone is going to create an open standard that allows for people to submit ""tweets"" (or whatever the equivalent will be) from anywhere to anyone on any platform. Imagine a podcast style system. Get live updates on any device, subscribe to users from iTunes/GMAIL/etc.<p>It'll happen, sooner or later. (Probably sooner now).<p>To explain my idea better, think of internet messaging systems. People use AIM, ICQ, Pidgin, etc. You can communicate with users on other platforms using different software.

2977161,comment,2976044,2976044,1,0,EREFUNDO,,,"Actually English has very few syllables compared to Filipino or Spanish. Nearly a third of the words are one syllable and  most of the multiple syllable words have either Latin, French, or Greek origin. I think there was an attempt by early humans to make words have as less syllables as possible to simplify communication. Then as our thoughts became more complex they either changed the tone of the syllable (as in Chinese) or added prefixes and suffixes to alter the meaning of the root word. Those language families that decided to add prefixes and suffixes became known as ""inflectional"" languages. Those that remained mono-syllabic have a variety of tones per syllable.",1315551102

And all I needed from it was the fact that we are switching from first to invent from first to file(IMHO the rest was partisan fluff trying to positively frame the legislation)and the fact is that this will allow the Nathan Myhrvold's and Lodsys trolls of the world to file a tsunami of vague conceptual patents with no intent of using them to create products. They will wait for a real innovator to ""infringe"" on them and then seek damages. I absolutely guarantee that if and or when this bill is signed into law that there will be entire departments of tech corporations that will do nothing but think up ideas, patent them and wait. As I have said, first to invent was the single biggest stop gap keeping the small, independent inventor in the game. As an example, do you really think that Robert Kearns[1] could have possibly fought Ford Motor CO without first to invent? First to invent is what has set America aside and now that it's effectively destroyed I genuinely believe that the small, independent inventor(the backbone of american innovation from Eli Whitney, to Larry and Sergei) will be put out of business. And that will negatively impact American innovation. Downvote me if you must, but I speak the truth.

It's like all the solar-powered cars... a cute idea, but no one ever (ever) buys a car for fuel efficiency.  You buy a car to travel, to carry things.  So the solar cars are cute, but they fail at everything a car is supposed to do.  You can't possibly improve on something unless you start by implementing <i>the thing</i>.",1315548212

So, even if they ""traveled through the same towers and pipes"" (they don't, a detail more expanded on by mdasen in his comment), it wouldn't make sense to charge the same for them as they have different cost requirements (although it might be somewhat more equal than it is now; in particular, text messages, which occupy valuable and limited control channel space, would likely become cheaper).",1315548084
