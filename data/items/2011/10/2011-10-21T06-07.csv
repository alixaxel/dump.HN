Is memory a big enough storage for my needs?<p>For instance for Lamer News you can store many millions of news and comments in 1 GB. So it makes perfectly sense for this application. For other applications you want a mixed solution where fast meta-data is stored on Redis and larger documents on disk in some other database.

Its trying to be good, it has potential, but its not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesnt have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

3138734,comment,3138132,3138621,7,0,temphn,,,"In theory, sure, a disinterested regulator would ensure that the cost of polluting was higher than the cost of not polluting. (Another solution to this problem is via property right enforcement, by the owners of the nearby polluted properties that share airspace/water table with the polluter).<p>But in practice the EPA is hardly a disinterested party when it comes to publishing studies on its own cost effectiveness. It exists to increase its budget and scope, just like all other agencies, but has no check on its behavior. Its officials are not elected, cannot be fired, and are effectively invisible to the public. Moreover, opposition to EPA malfeasance/corruption is often caricatured as opposition to clean air and clean water itself.<p>As an example of regulatory pathology, consider that the EPA is giving grants and instruction manuals to NGOs, telling them how to sue the agency into expanding its powers.<p>m.yahoo.com/w/news_america/epa-funds-greens-sue-221700941.html?orig_host_hdr=news.yahoo.com&.intl=us&.lang=en-us<p><pre><code>  The EPA even tacitly encourages such suits, going so  
  far as to pay for and promote a ""Citizen's Guide"" that, 
  among other things, explains how to sue the agency 
  under ""citizen suit"" provisions in environmental laws. 
  The guide's author  the Environmental Law Institute  
  has received $9.9 million in EPA grants over the past   
  decade.

  And, to top it off, critics say the EPA often ends up 
  paying the groups' legal fees under the Equal Access to 
  Justice Act. 

  What's going on? ""The EPA isn't harmed by these suits,"" 
  said Jeffrey Holmstead, who was an EPA official during 
  the Bush administration. ""Often the suits involve things 
  the EPA wants to do anyway. By inviting a lawsuit and 
  then signing a consent decree, the agency gets legal   
  cover from political heat.""
</code></pre>
Most people have never read an expose on the EPA; they think of them as the ""good guys"" who protect us from the evil polluters. What's funny is that we can see through this kind of logic when the normal police invoke it to justify any action in the pursuit of common criminals, but not when the environmental police do so -- and the EPA <i>is</i> most certainly a branch of the police, with the power to raid, fine, and seize property.",1319179450

Well, that's a given because creators are quite stubborn people. But creators listen to other capable creators, for which they have enough respect to just trust without much questioning.<p>You will always struggle to get creators to do what you want, unless you are a creator yourself that can get shit done. For software engineering, it does not matter that you're brilliant in so many other ways if you are not capable of doing the job yourself (and you mentioned that you can code a little, but I don't think that's enough).<p>Look for example at Linus Tolvards (since he was on the author's list). He said so himself that he doesn't do much coding these days and his main talent is to get other people to work for him. But he can start stuff like nobody else, his knowledge is unparalleled and when he talks people listen.<p>About Steve Jobs, it is relevant because he's kind of a role model. But Steve Jobs is also a product of the right circumstances. You cannot be like Steve Jobs without having Wozniak as your best friend (this works both ways, Wozniak also benefited greatly from his friendship with Steve Jobs).",1319179157

If you feel yourself getting bothered by the rain, just remind yourself that the rain cleans out the air and produces the greenest, freshest natural beauty that you can find on the West coast. Hands down - better summer climate than anywhere. If you're doing a startup, do you really leave your computer anyways? Just save it for when the weather's nice. I don't know why Seattle doesn't have as large of a startup scene. It's got a huge tech scene, no doubt, and it has every ingredient in the mix to foster a large startup community (smarts, companies, UW, coffee, good beer). Most of all, it seems more business friendly. In particular - the economic climate seems more startup friendly. You could get a really decent place to rent for 800 dollars a month. The transportation has gotten much better with the underground train/bus tunnel. About seven days a week there's almost always a killer happy hour where you could eat gourmet food for under ten dollars - much better than the food I've had in the Bay Area. Also, there's no state income tax. If you're looking to buy a house, I believe that all things considered, your house purchase dollars go five times further in the Seattle area. - And you're just an hour and a half flight away from the South Bay. It seems you could live there and be very frugal, and spend your credit card miles commuting to the bay area once every other week - and still come out ahead. 
I haven't been back there in a year, but I hear the startup community is getting even stronger. I hope it does well as a startup hub.",1319178943

For payments that vary in amount, most major banks allow you to add a payee once, then whenever you know the amount/date a payment will be due, you can schedule it. Ideal?

He does not use any software which is sold and lives like a hermit in the world of tech, with so fanatic ideals that he is completely incompatible with today's world.<p>Secondly, labor conditions at FoxConn factories are often pointed out as Apple's crimes -- but it is foolish to do so. Foxconn is the largest electronics manufacturer in the world, and a LOT of top tech brands in the world outsource their manufacturing to them. Apple makes them most money though -- I am not sure how Foxconn conditions are caused by Apple.<p>Thirdly, about charity, he donated privately. And he had a RED product campaign for iPods which donated a large amount of money to Africa for AIDS. And he has left his wealth of 7 billion here, his wife spent a lot of time doing charity, I am sure she will use almost all of it in charity...<p>Fourthly, backdating options was a common practice followed at a lot of companies -- this has nothing to do with Steve Jobs -- in fact he was found to be innocent in this (he knew about it, but he likely thought of it as an accounting issue: he was no accounting expert -- its not like he requested for this to be done).<p>Regarding Amelio -- really? Can you point to any authentic source for reference? I am not sure he made Apple a 3 billion stock pile when Apple had a multi-billion dollar loss the year before Steve Jobs joined. And you are trying to make it sound like Steve Jobs was a hitler who kicked off Amelio who should have been the CEO of Apple. Are you nuts?<p>One more -- you mention Apple ""stole"" the developers from C&G, a MP3 software firm. Please can you describe more what you meant -- I never knew one could ""steal"" developers....  Apple had hired 4 of their key employees --- by making them an offer which they could have declined obviously but they didn't, because they wanted to join Apple -- i am not sure how this means anything. Lot of things like this happen in the industry, for example, Juniper frequently hires a bunch of developers from Cisco's team for a product, when they want to start a new similar product.<p>Overall - I obviously agree Steve was not a ""polite"" person -- he used to talk harshly and make aggressive moves business wise. But he did all of it for passion of making something that will change the market upside down. And he did that, multiple times. With innovative ideas. Who could have started a retail store chain in 2001 for an electronics company? And made it successful today when all retail is failing...<p>All his achievements are known to everybody. He was a person that had failings like everybody else, but he pursued his passion with such a vigor, that he made a massive impact on everything he did. He moved industries forward, with a sudden, immense push, multiple times.",1319176867
