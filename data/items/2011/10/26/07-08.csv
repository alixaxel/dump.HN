3157589,comment,3154446,3154446,2,0,danielk015,,,"As a third party executive recruiter, I definitely have to agree with many of the comments and frustrations that have been expressed. Unfortunately, at best the perception of recruiters is that they are a necessary evil sometimes in getting access to job opportunities. No recruiter is perfect and even the best retained ones do some cold calling during the week to establish relationships. However, I do agree the approach should not based on gimmicks and sales tricks, but have the intent to establish good rapport with those that are contacted.<p>But at the end of the day, a recruiter that is in tune with the market, cold calling should really make up less than 20% of their ""deal"" flow.  Great hires are made through referrals, and great recruiters gets constant networking referrals to keep their pipelines full and their days busy. If the recruiter is doing their job, either they are getting warm leads from their networks when jobs are broadcasted, or their networks is referring strong talent to them.<p>Like a lawyer or accountant that desires to create a reputable brand in a particular marketplace, recruiters needs to see themselves as resources within this marketplace and not view recruiting as purely a transactional game.  From my experience, just because I don't collect a fee does not make a relationship unsuccessful.  Providing great customer service and building strong relationships will usually evolve into mutually beneficial interactions in subsequent years.",1319615997

Folding, sliding, with keyboard and without, slates, anything.  The smartphone revolution destroyed that.

That would mean that 1M / (24*3) = 13,888 users are active (on average) at any time.  Which means that they must each be generating db events at a rate of about 3.6 events / sec / user, which is ludicrous (at the very least, these should probably be somehow combined so that each client only hits the db once in a while, preferably in response to a user action).<p>And in reality, the average play session is probably quite a bit shorter than 20 minutes, which means the event rate is even higher per active user.  What the hell are they doing that is causing so much database traffic?<p>Is the game actually doing something a lot more sophisticated than I would assume it is based on the looks of it (to be fair, I've never played it), or is the client-side design just really that messed up?  I mean, it's cool that they can handle that much traffic, and all, and the server guys should be proud, but IMO they should really be able to do better on the client-side to prevent this level of scaling from being necessary...",1319614258

Of course fire is often confused with arrogance too :) But I thought I'd clarify anyways since I wasn't so clear at first:<p>Making a bunch of money trading was not at all what it was about for me. That was only a validating result. In truth I was deeply passionate about trading, lived and breathed it, and did it for its own sake. I quit my job and moved half way across the world to chase my dream of becoming a trader. I left my family and friends and lived 2 years without income to do it. All that fueled me was the fire of my passion for the activity. The same fire that an athlete or musician feels for their art. Those guys may not change the world, but the fire is nonetheless the same fire.<p>Did my trading change the world? no. But it did change ME through a journey of self-discovery where I had to reach to the depth of my soul to survive and succeed in an endeavor where 95% fail. But I also did have a yearning to change the world in some way. And that's why I ultimately gave up trading and started a new tech company who's goal is to bring transparency to the retail trading and investing industry and thereby improve it as a whole.<p>It's the same fire that fuels this new desire as the one that fueled the seemingly less noble desire of making money trading. But ultimately, if it hadn't been for that previous pursuit and all the self-growth I experienced through it, I wouldn't be trying to change the world now.",1319614146

There is no German, Dutch or French bank that does that and I doubt Spanish, Italian or Swiss banks do it. Sure, if I overdraft, I pay (serious) interest over the amount overdrawn for as long as I am overdrawn, but you aren't hit with any fine at all.<p>In fact, I have arranged that I actually can't overdraft. Automatic bills just bounce when I'm underfunded. That's between me and the companies whose bills bounced.",1319613316
