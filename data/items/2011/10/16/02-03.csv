Both of those would put a chill on sales.<p>Also, is iCloud secure enough for sensitive military charts? Maybe it is, but even so, explaining that to buyer is going to be a problem.<p>If Apple insists on this course of action, the eventual solution is probably vector maps. But a good vector mapping API doesn't exist for developers, doesn't work for many maps that only exist as rasters, and will take much R&D to make into a reasonable reality. In the meantime, I would hope that Apple chooses to unbreak the hundreds of popular mapping apps they broke last week.<p>If Apple insists on getting rid of the old behavior of the Caches folder, they need to deprecate it over the course of a year or so. None of us even figured out this would happen until after iOS5 went live, despite extensive testing from many devs. How this went live is beyond me.",1318733839

Your resume needs to be scannable so individuals can quickly assess whether you are worth exploring further. Think of the resume as getting your foot in the door. You don't want them to know everything about you, but they should get a good idea of your highlights and best moments. You'll have a lot of opportunity to elaborate further during your follow-up interview.<p>Personally, I'm not a fan of the way Linkedin lays out your experience. I understand what a great tool it can be and that many people use it. But for presenting an online resume for myself, I've been using StackOverflow Careers. Take a look at how I've laid out my resume there. (<a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mikegreenberg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mikegreenberg</a>) Note how I bring attention to the important parts with appropriate formatting, give very short descriptions which demonstrate action (begin with verbs!), show metrics where possible to show how I improved the company I worked for, and tried to identify the best ways I could be beneficial to them.<p>I can see the lacking degree working against you in some respects, but I really don't feel this is going to prevent you from getting a job if you're qualified to perform it. But I'm also not saying jobs will land in your lap. You need to compensate for that ""hole"" in your resume with a significant showing of your own. A portfolio, if you will. Do side projects whenever possible. (I know this can be difficult with a family.

Had to force quit several times before I succeeded in registering.<p>Tried the wizard selecting technology news but when the ticker started, it was filled with stuff from Fox News and other stuff that is irritating more than informing.<p>What I was looking for, and hoping for, was a simple ticker for sites that I am interested in, such as this site, slashdot, NYtimes and WSJ technology SECTIONS, etc.<p>Even when I deleted my playlist, stories from 'The Beast' flowed across the screen.  In sum, I had no sense that I was in control of your application.  I could see myself using such a feed--if it did what I wanted--while relaxing, but in it's current form.....<p>Best of luck with this!  I do hope you persevere.  I'd suggest completely rethinking how the USER can drive this thing.<p>...and you might want to add a direct download for those of us who don't always want to log into apple's app store just to try something like this.  Almost quit at that point.",1318730782

3116323,comment,3115163,3115163,1,0,sandroyong,,,"Bruce Schneier was a great proponent of cryptography.  In he lat 90's, he touted encryption as the end-all of security measures.  Since then, he has backed off his claim.  (He later went on and continues to be a proponent of legislative laws for proper surveillance and forcing companies to be more security compliant).  So, even Bruce doesn't think encryption is a good idea.<p>Excerpt from a 1998 essay, ""Security Pitfalls in Cryptography"" that sums it all up:<p>""Strong cryptography is very powerful when it is done right, but it is not a panacea. Focusing on the cryptographic algorithms while ignoring other aspects of security is like defending your house not by building a fence around it, but by putting an immense stake into the ground and hoping that the adversary runs right into it. Smart attackers will just go around the algorithms.""",1318730512

I think copyright has lots of problems - but people not paying for anything isn't one of them.<p>My frustration is that the people who don't like the old structure won't allow a new structure to monetize itself. The greatest thing that could have come about out of the shell of the music industry was a way to pay artists directly. Pirate Bay could put that system in place tomorrow if they cared to. But it hasn't happened and won't happen if people don't actually pay.<p>The app store and iTunes are the closest we've got to that. But it doesn't make any difference that devs are independent - people crack their stuff and seed torrents all the same.<p>So there is another better model that could have existed. But it is 'disappeared'.<p>There could also be respect for the individual's right to mind their own creation.\nBut that is also disappeared.<p>Truth is the anonymous mob of the internet is another sort of unaccountable and unelected government.
