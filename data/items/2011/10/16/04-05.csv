3116584,comment,3116495,3116495,27,0,gmichnikov,,,"Perhaps ""they did not understand the idea of 'merit pay'"" because many of the teachers in Finland are of a different breed than many of the people who end up teaching in the US:<p>""McKinsey's work with school systems in more than 50 countries suggests this is an important gap in the U.S. debate, because the world's top performing school systems--Singapore, Finland, South Korea--make a different choice. They recruit, develop and retain what this report will call 'top third+' students as one of their central education strategies, and they've acheived extraordinary results. These systems recruit 100% of their teacher corops from the top third of the academic cohort, and then screen for other important qualities as well. In the U.S., by contrast, 23% of new teachers come from the top third, and just 14% in high poverty schools, which find it especially difficult to attract and retain talented teachers. It is remarkably large difference in approach, and in results."" [1]<p>Taking this into account, it's silly to argue that since they have tenure, too, tenure isn't the problem here. They already have the right people teaching. We need to fire many of the people who are currently teaching.<p>Also, the U.S. spends a higher percent of GDP on education, so blaming spending seems odd. [2]<p>Finally, I'm really sick of the way Diane Ravitch constantly slams Teach For America. The U.S. needs better people teaching. TFA makes some of those people think about teaching. It's getting teaching in the same ballpark of prestige as consulting, banking, law school, medical school, etc for students coming out of top colleges. Nothing else comes close to doing that on the same scale. Even if it is true that TFA teachers aren't noticeably better in years 1-2 than a typical experienced teacher (and I don't believe that is the case), it's still a great program.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/Closing_the_talent_gap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/Closing_talent_gap_appendix.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education...</a>",1318741136

My concern was just being clear on just what the heck VCs do.<p>VCs are welcome to do what they want.  While I have very little respect for all but a tiny fraction of VCs, I am not angry at any of them although I believe that here PG was not accurate.<p>VCs and my business are close to mutually irrelevant.<p>From all I can tell, my business is doing well, but, yes, I will be happier when I am getting $300 K+ a month in revenue.<p>""Crossfire"", what VCs do in general or nearly always, etc. are getting to be nearly irrelevant for everyone:  Just a short look at the finances of a VC and see that VCs need 'home runs'.  All the rest is low grade work or just a waste of time, effort, and money.  But there are only a few 'home runs' each decade in all IT VC in the US.  So, 99 44/100% of what VCs 'do' is irrelevant, for all concerned.  In particular, what is 'usual' is irrelevant.  And for the VCs, 'patterns' are irrelevant.<p>The major failing of VCs is that they do not have effective criteria to select the 100 - (99 44/100) of interest, or even the candidates.  So, about all they can do is follow the herd of the 'usual', draw their 2%, and hope a home run comes out of the blue.  That's the key reason on average they are not making much if any money.<p>That lack of effective criteria is in wildly strong contrast with essentially everything in serious applications of science, in engineering, and in technology outside of VCs.<p>My criteria that get me to invest my effort are nothing like those of the VCs, usual or otherwise.  On this point, I'm standing on solid ground, and the VCs are standing in a swamp.<p>It looks like Darwin will have the last word.",1318741028

I find it especially interesting in this case, where the person is limited in what they can bring and still cares about something like makeup.<p>Anyway, I thought some people might have something interesting to say on HN (where people's views aren't as aligned with mainstream media due to their forward-thinking disruptive mindsets) ... but it seems like it was taken as an attack.<p>I'm not trying to debate, I just find it strange.",1318738791

3116517,comment,3111479,3111722,1,0,mikegreenberg,,,"You are attempting to create an authority on a programmer's reputation/clout. A good way to spread this, and a feature I'd like to see, would be a simple API that gets the key stats (maybe not all) from your service. Maybe something that could generate a badge the programmer could include on their site. You're doing the work of pulling in data from SO, Github, Bitbucket, but don't offer much back to the user (aside from some self-affirmations that they can only access on your site). Exposing this data for others to use in interesting ways might be a good way to generate the authority you're attempting to create. (Not to mention the instant social-proof of programmers advertising their generated score on other sites.)<p>That said, I don't personally find that these services give very accurate depictions of a user's value. An arbitrary score means little without a control or reference point. (What would Linus Torvalds score?) Further, services like these typically rely on some secret-sauce to generate their numbers... and obfuscating this process lends itself to further skepticism of that value of your score. This is not an attack on your product specifically. I feel this equally about Klout, which I've ranted about elsewhere.<p>The problem services like yours should attempt to solve (IMHO) is indicating what qualities your score represents. This needs to be as clear and simple as possible. The best utility your service could offer will be in the following use case: A stranger, who is completely unaware of your scoring system, requests and consumes a report you generated for a user quickly; and to walk away with a strong sense of how that programmer relates to the metrics they care most about. Agreed, this is no small feat. But it's what services like BBB, Consumer Reports, and the like have spent years establishing their authority and clarifying their signals.<p>Hope this was food for thought. (Take it with a grain of salt. What the hell do I know anyway.)",1318738668
