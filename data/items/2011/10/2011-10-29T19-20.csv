If you want to be told many stories about how this can work, go to an open source software conference.</i><p>I believe this is <i>possible</i>, but if your goal is to do novel scientific research and publish the results, it's exceptionally <i>uncommon</i>. I rely on all sorts of statistical and machine-learning techniques developed by other people, for example. It's relatively common to set up shop as an independent data-mining consultant, and you can fairly easily pay the bills that way. So you might think that they've produced some of the results I rely on. But the way the economics work out, independent consultants rarely spend much time on basic research. The actual techniques and advances, as a result, come almost <i>exclusively</i> from researchers in academia and industrial research labs.<p>In fact, I can't actually think of any influential advances in machine learning from the past few decades developed by independent researchers. Heck, looking through the R packages I use, even the software seems to come mainly from a mixture of universities and places like Rand (biggest surprise in this mini-inventory: lots of stuff from Merck, who I wouldn't have expected to be open-source-friendly).<p>Nonetheless, that's actually my medium-term goal, so I hope you're right. ;-)",1319918079

Easy to do.<p>Tracking package dependencies is more difficult, and I usually did this manually with some help with some specialized scripts.<p>Plus side is you can avoid dependencies you don't like and add functionality where you need it. You can make a developers heaven this way. Usually the only way I do serious Linux development is with an LFS-based system. When I use distros I usually spend a lot of time creating a specialized environment and the time saving in using a distro is sort of nullified.<p>Bad side is obviously if you want to upgrade a vital dependency you'd have to upgrade all forward dependencies also. Not so difficult if you have it scripted, but <i>errors</i> are hard to handle. Of course, an LFSer would usually know how to install different versions of packages and have them co-exist.

Thus if you had a skulking permit that authorizes you to steal and kill, you legally could commit what was a crime. [...]<p>[1]: I had to paraphrase because I don't own a copy. I had to look it up in the library a while ago, and the definition stuck with me.</i><p>I do own a copy and it says no such thing, or even anything like it. I find this memory highly dubious, because permits are given for administrative matters, violation of which can incur a fee or a fine or a requirement of specific performance, but which most certainly cannot land you in jail or result in criminal liability. Historically the word derives from the French <i>per mitter le droit</i> which means 'for passing the right' [to a piece of real estate].<p>The phrase 'real estate' itself derives from French meaning 'royal estate'; back when all land was legally owned by the aristocracy, long-term renewable land rents were issued, some of which specified the acceptable use of the land - hence the word 'landlord.' In many places in Europe it's still common to buy a house but have to pay a (nominal) rent to someone who owns the underlying land, although this is nowadays a private individual or land investment company rather than an aristocrat. Real estate transactions in the US typically involve both the land and the buildings on it, but not always. Even back in the early days of the US state governments often retained some rights over the land granted or sold, such as the right to 'royalties' on mineral extraction.<p>I think you may have mis-remembered what you read, but Black's Law Dictionary has been through 9 editions. If you can remember when this was or anything else related to the research, I would be interested in looking it up at the university law library. As it is, I think you're mistaken. If one wanted to give permission for an activity that is normally criminal (possession of drugs by a medical researcher, say), one would seek <i>immunity</i>.",1319917772

If it's not documented, you have to try to figure it out from the function body, which is often non-trivial. This is why you'll typically see what amounts informal type annotations in the comments of functions of mature code.<p>Despite all this, many people feel that the flexibility of not having to specify types is a net-win.<p>C++ ""auto"" adds some of the convenience, but at a much lower cost in readibility, since when you see something like<p><pre><code>  auto x = foo.gimmeBar();
</code></pre>
you can find out the type of x immediately just by looking at the definition of gimmeBar() (with IDE support, this could even be zero-effort (i.e., it could show a little grey popup bubble with the deduced type); even with something old-fashioned like emacs+ctags, it's just a hop-skip-and-a-jump away).<p><pre><code>  *
</code></pre>
By the way, regarding ownership-semantics, it's true they could be a massive PITA pre-C++11, and (sort of analogously to the what-are-the-types-in-a-dynamic-language situation) you'd often have to fall back to relying on comments to know what was going on. If they're weren't comments and you were getting back a raw pointer, well...that could be rough.<p>This is a problem that can be fixed with library support (for smart pointers) and disciplined coding -- i.e., using the smart pointers. For a good example of this working really well in practice, see Objective-C.<p>C++11 helps because it gives us built-in library support, and will hopefully provide the community motivation for the convention/discipline of actually using the libs.<p>(This pointer-ownership stuff is pretty much orthogonal to auto, though, IMO.)",1319914968
