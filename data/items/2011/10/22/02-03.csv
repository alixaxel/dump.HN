I like that it is a different approach and all, but when I have something to sell I'm not going to wait until the right  ""theme"" comes along. If I have a guitar that I want to sell now I shouldn't have to wait until a music theme comes along.<p>Maybe I am missing something and I would love some direction if anyone can provide it, but it seems like the whole idea is to provide a platform to sell the junk you have lying around in a fast and convenient manner. Waiting until music day to sell my Strat doesn't sound very convenient.<p>No disrespect to the founders or anything, I'm just a little confused. I love this concept of selling your junk quickly with automated price suggestions, that is brilliant. I'm just lost on the theme angle.",1319252254

And while I have not looked it up or done any calculations, I suspect that if you integrate over total exposure (watts/m^2) to microwave radiation per unit time on your head, for the average person, the sun will come out on top over the mobile. Especially those near the equator. And since you can't hold all variables as equal we can likely usually find two people where phone + sun is equal but phone or sun exposure for the other person is more.

However, risks may depend on power and frequency of the radiation (while it is true that ionizing radiation causes cancer, one can't rule out cancer effects at other, non-ionizong frequencies through unknown mechanisms). If it can be shown the sun puts out much less mobile-phone like radiation than your phone, then the conparison is not really valid.  Put another way, the question is, ""will I be exposed to more mobile-phone like radiation (1.8 Ghz) from a five minute call, or from standing in the sun for five minutes?""  I tried to use a blackbody model of the sun to answer this, but I failed.<p>There's also effects of the heat given off by the phone heating your head, but I ignore that.",1319249772

Your example is one of these - standardization is related to commodification.<p>I suspect also that user-facing apps are easier to keep improving, because the user is right there, and always has more needs that could be served (e.g. <i>text editors will evolve til they can read mail; those that can't will be replaced by those that can</i>).
