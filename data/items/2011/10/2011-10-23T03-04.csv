See the disconnect?<p>Except for that, college years seem to be the most formative years of one's life. I wouldn't be into startups if I didn't come do post-secondary.

The difficultly of tracking failed start-ups has been discussed, but has anyone studied that failure rate? Seems there's a paucity of coverage in popular press, even if any actual sources exist.

But that doesn't imply we need to discard education whole-sale.
