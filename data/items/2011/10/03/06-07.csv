3065344,comment,3064728,3064728,3,0,tikhonj,,,"This seems to reflect my experience perfectly--I think the only reason I get some things done is because I don't want to do other, ostensibly more important things.<p>I think this habit has a couple of interesting results for me:\n- The amount of stress I feel--and the amount of time I spend ""working""--does not go up linearly with workload. I am doing roughly twice as much (in terms of course credit and part-time work) as I was last year, and my classes are harder, but I feel maybe 1.3 times as much stress and still have an effectively similar amount of leisure time.\n- I am much more efficient than I would have been otherwise. There are two reasons for this: I give myself less time to do things but still finish them and I sometimes procrastinate by learning my tools (keyboard shortcuts, emacs-fu...) and by automating things I do regularly (writing bash scripts or emacs extensions).<p>Ultimately I do not view my procrastination as nearly as big a problem as others make it out to be. I think I'm happier and more efficient for it; I suspect that I would actually have accomplished less had I not procrastinated all these years.<p>Of course, this is probably just a result of confirmation bias (I like procrastinating, I think it helps me so I only see the cases where it does) but I don't really care--it works for me.",1317625091

3065339,comment,3064952,3065098,10,0,zohebv,,,"Node is an asynchronous programming framework bundled with a largely async library. If you have 40 cores on your system, you would presumably run 40 instances of node for a CPU intensive webserver(using multinode etc). So the event handler won't get stuck as long as there are available cores.<p>What about a single core system? Well I guess a threaded/multi-process solution would time slice the fibonacci requests between two threads so that both requests are served in 10 seconds, instead of one request in 5 seconds and the next one in 10 seconds like the node.js solution. Does not sound much better.<p>If you have done any kind of systems programming, you would know that availability of asynchronous I/O is a life saver, and can simplify your locking model greatly. 90% of the issues you face when building such systems is that some module deep inside grabbed a lock and issued a blocking I/O request and now the rest of the system is bottle necked behind it. Node.js is basically trying to eliminate the possibility of the existence of such a module. This complicates the issue of I/O calls, but simplifies locking in the sense that you don't really need all those locks in your system. In node.js of course there are no locks. The complexity moves from reasoning about locks to reasoning about correctly handling I/O calls and responses. IMO, this is the correct place to move the complexity to, because locks are simply an abstraction the programmer built. When debugging the system, we have to deal with - ""How to get rid of this monolithic lock"", when the real problem is - ""This IO is taking too long we shouldn't be blocking on it"". An async programming framework tackles this problem head on.<p>If you use Python/Perl you will never really know the number of instances of the process to run, Too many and you time slice requests, slow down all of them, increase your queueing buffers instead of just dropping the extra requests. Too few processes and you start dropping requests that you could have served. With a framework like node.js the number of instances you want is equal to the number of cores on the server.<p>Of course node.js can be an inappropriate solution for a wide variety of reasons, but I could not find anything really relevant regarding that in your post.
