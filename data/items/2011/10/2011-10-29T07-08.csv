3171463,comment,3168411,3170629,1,0,slowpoke,,,">In this sense, ""Just works"" relates to restrictions on users.<p>No. Still attacking a symptom. Standard compliance solves the same problem, without having to lock down the system. If programmers are unable or unwilling to conform to standards, then this is again not the fault of the system[1]. Give up on arguing that there is any sort of causation between ""locked"" and ""just works"". It's wrong.<p>[1] Actually, in this case it's the fault of the system. The lock places a false sense of security on programmers, which is pretty dangerous.",1319874985

3171404,comment,3169678,3170916,2,0,saurik,,,"I am not claiming a performance improvement, or the lack of having to mess with garbage collection tuning settings. In fact, I have explicitly stated the opposite: that by moving to C++ you do not lose the ability to do global tuning, or even the ability to use a garbage collector to do it.<p>Nor even is the parent of the post I responded to (as you might then say ""well, I am arguing that, and you can't have both""): you easily can have both, as all that these people actually end up doing is brick allocating blocks of objects (either by using C# structs, such as the Stack Overflow articles we've been seeing recently, or doing a poor man's ""column store"", splitting the fields into arrays, which then causes cache performance issues).<p>So, as that parent post's parent pointed out, if you are going to go through hell to do that, you may as well do so in C++, as it will be a million times easier (even doing this for their existing managed objects in Managed C++ would have been easier, and it is unfortunate that they didn't evaluate that).<p>Therefore, with that performance and tuning argument totally removed from the rest of the conversation, I am focussing instead on the irritatingly strong statement ""That's a substantial thing to give up, IMO.""--a statement I very explicitly pulled away from the unrelated argument in the previous paragraph of the comment--which does not seem at all warranted given the situation, or the facts of these languages.<p>I mean, the entire premise of this argument is flawed... there are very few systems that actually /are/ type safe, and yet people seem to like using them. We don't even need to go to silly examples like Haskell's unsafePerformIO keyword: C#, a very similar language and one that has been being talked about a lot with respect to GC performance on HN recently (the Stack Overflow article), is quite clearly not type safe, as it allows you to type cast pointers using the ""unsafe"" keyword.<p>Of course, you don't have to like people using the ""unsafe"" keyword, and you can enforce that people on your team not use it; but then that's the real issue: if you are allowed to use the entire specified system, as opposed to restricting yourself to ""the known safe subset"", then almost no systems of note are actually type safe, partly because users wouldn't stand for it.<p>With this understanding, we can now go further: Java?... /not type safe/ (sun.misc.Unsafe, as used in the ConcurrentLinkedQueue from earlier in this thread; or more simply, JNI, which people, including myself, use to do all sorts of craziness, even going as far as the JVM itself by backpatching its code at runtime... and I'm not kidding: I actually do that).<p>Therefore, that anyone is even arguing some hard line that Java is type safe, C++ is not, that the definition is clear, that I'm ignorant for supposedly not understanding that definition (despite spending years researching programming languages and virtual machines in academia, and having implemented multiple), and that this type safety ""is a substantial thing to give up"", is ludicrous.",1319872123

Put a backpack on and you can walk into any building at any university in the United States any time you want.  Backpacks are a lot cheaper than working in academia.   You can lead the life of the mind in industry, too  and enjoy less politics and better pay.  You can even get published in journals, if that floats your boat.  (After youve escaped the mind-warping miasma of academia, you might rightfully question whether Published In A Journal is really personally or societally significant as opposed to close approximations like Wrote A Blog Post And Showed It To Smart People.)<p>The degree of arrogance in this article is astounding. I've worked at Google, Microsoft, and IBM, and the work I've found <i>most</i> satisfying is in grad school.<p>To each his own. If you let something like this guide your life decisions, you have much bigger issues to deal with than finding a so-called ""README.txt for your career as a young engineer"".",1319872033

""Getting to the startup level"" is not so simple a concept as ""either you get there or you don't."" People arrive at this destination with widely varying amounts of skill, preparation, connections, and credentials. Not all entrepreneurs are equally attractive.<p>So wh-uws' point makes a lot of sense. If it seems that disadvantaged-group-X is having more trouble securing funding than other groups, it doesn't necessarily mean investors are to blame. It could very easily be the case that X is running into issues earlier in life that, generally, make it much harder for its members to become great entrepreneurs. When trying to answer the question, ""Why do so few females run funded tech companies?"", it might make sense to take a few steps back and ask, ""Why do so few females study computer science"", or hell, ""Why do girls play with dolls while boys play with legos?""",1319871995
