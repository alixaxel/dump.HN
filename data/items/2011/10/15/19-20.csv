You didn't mention much about http caching, which I think is probably as important as the other things you mentioned; Not only does it improve performance for the user, but it also reduces load on your server and it enables you to put up an edge side cache for extra performance.<p>As for the problems mentioned with the load balancer - You could have simply provisioned a new instance and installed your own load balancer. There's dedicated packages like haproxy, but you could also just put up nginx or lighthttpd. This machine can later double as your edge cache (Squid).<p>Btw. 1.5s to <i>render</i> the front page?

You are regurgitating a political ideology that is, quite frankly, nonsense. You focus on demand, when it is irrelevant to this discussion, and your argument presumes that ""advising people to save is bad"" because ""if everyone saved there would be no demand"".<p>Obviously, when people run their lives prudently, they don't eliminate all spending (and thus all demand is not eliminated).  Obviously, consumers are not the only source of demand in an economy.  And obviously you can't really defend your point and that is why you spend your time characterizing others -- and in fact your ""economic"" argument is really just disparaging a savings plan with a fallacious -- but oft repeated by political hacks-- story.<p>So, of course, I was dismissive.

Turns out we humans are kinda useless for tests like these. Past a few megapixels this stuff really doesn't matter because things like focus, lenses, and lighting are so much more important than resolution. The photos are ""sharp"" enough and none of these phones support mounting lenses or lights on anything. So its kind of arbitrary.

I just need to plug into your LAN.<p>>why isn't the POTS network encrypted?<p>Because I can't pick up the receiver and listen to my neighbor's calls. That's exactly how ethernet doesn't work. I hear all, even on switched networks with a simple tool. Wireless? Even worse, it's the equivalent of using a non-switched hub. I'll even toss in that POTS should be encrypted point to point, but if you would have attempted it before Phil Zimmerman trail-blazed strong encryption for us commoners, you would most likely have ended up in a federal prison if you used non-trivial encryption.<p>So, to address the original question:<p>1. Encryption really was expensive in 1996 or so, but in the age of multicores, its questionable if there's a real cost now.<p>2. Performance hit. SSL handshake is long and annoying. We could use a replacement here.<p>3. Legacy. The hackers who slapped together networks and the various protocols we use weren't interested or couldn't properly secure this stuff. Thus the legacy of spam, plaintext everything, etc. Retro fitting security is hard. Its good if its there from the start like GSM.<p>4. Standards are hard to change. Imagine telling all the browser makers and open source projects that we should all switch to something that won't add to the bottom lines/download rate/market penetration, but instead cost them time and complexity as well as add server load.  Google can't get anyone to care about SPDY.  Who is going to re-architect this stuff? We're essentially living in a world convcieved in the 70s, implemented in the 80s, and made popular in the 90s.<p>The easy answer is to stop allowing non-encrypted wifi. I'd love to see the wifi consortium just default to a random key for non-authenticated guests in whatever the newest version of wifi will be.  It'll be transparent to the end user and probably stop all these local attacks. It won't help you past the gateway, but right now between the client and the gateway is the problem area. Heck, why not make all networking gear do this, even on wired networks? We have the processing power.",1318706806

They have a terrific iOS instructor and a broad library of professionally-produced videos on this, and their cost is $25/month.<p>There's plenty of room to compete (and I wouldn't suggest that you attempt to compete on price, since video-only learning becomes commoditized quickly), but if you're going to be competitive you will have to convey some sort of value other than ""learn how to code in iOS with our video!!1!""",1318705454

For them to be fun, you have to pay, and I'm guessing this is actually a specific goal in these companies. Any feature that is brought up to be introduced has all the fun elements methodically shunted into the pay-zone.",1318705365

They are calling it the 'inverse square root', but thats just them abusing terminology, which people do all the time, rightly or wrongly.<p>But you weren't wrong to be initially confused by this abuse of terminology, and it doesn't have anything to do with your native language not being English.",1318705281
