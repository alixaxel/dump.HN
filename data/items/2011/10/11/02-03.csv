3096855,comment,3095336,3095853,3,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well... that's a really bad way to characterize the case.<p>First off, this is not a ""law"" in the sense most people think of; it wasn't passed by Congress and signed by the President. Rather, it's a directive issued by a federal agency, which has powers granted by Congress to issue directives and -- when deemed necessary for security purposes -- to keep the exact details of those directives from being disclosed.<p>There's nothing particularly new in that, by the way; governments, even governments of countries which would by any standard be considered ""free"", have long exercised the power to enforce security-related policies without disclosing the details of those policies to the public at large.<p>Second, Gilmore's case specifically ran into trouble because A) he was informed multiple times, as all air passengers are, of policies regarding ID and B) he was also informed that a process exists for flying without presenting ID, and voluntarily chose not to use that process (this is what really sunk his case).<p>Third, even if there were no government-issued policies specifically requiring passengers to present ID, there are multiple agencies who would have the power to deny licenses to any airline which did not have -- as a condition of the contract between passenger and airline, represented by the ticket -- a requirement of presenting ID to check in. And, frankly, I don't think anyone would try to argue that down if it happened; such policies already exist and are widely accepted with respect to age-restricted products like alcohol.",1318301341

3096850,comment,3095508,3096283,5,0,calebmpeterson,,,"Certainly.<p>First, the actor model need not imply a separate thread/process for each actor.  It's quite possible and in fact common (in Scala's built-in actor library and various Java actor libraries) to run a very large 100k pool of actors in a pool of well under 100 threads. [1]  So, the typical notion of having a single UI thread can mesh quite well with actors (just have the UI event loop pump each actor's event loop during idle).<p>Second, since actors process messages - which are conceptually the same as events - an actor has messages pushed to it by widget(s) upon user interaction.  (If this sounds identical to the observer pattern, it's because it is).  There's nothing interesting about this step other than the ""an event is a message"" concept.<p>Third, and this is the really neat part, actors often involve some concept of blocking on a receive() call - which is an inversion of control from the observer pattern.  That is to say an observer/listener is invoked by the UI framework when an event occurs, but an actor, which conceptually has its own message/event loop, can consume events at will.  Thus the inversion of control.<p>So your classic listener looks like this:<p><pre><code>  // Added via $(""#foo"").click() or some such...\n  function onClick(e) {\n    // do something ... any state must be stored external to this callback\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBut an actor looks like this:<p><pre><code>  // The event loop is started up and pumps indefinitely...\n  function loop() {\n    // any state is local\n    while (running) {\n      switch (receive()) {\n        case ....\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe event loop in an actor can easily turn into a very tight and explicit state machine. [2]  My event loop here is pretty boring, but consider, if after receiving event A, you explicitly block on receive for event B.<p>I posted [2] a while back and there was a decent discussion at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2972581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2972581</a>.  The section 5 of [2] really describe the idea neatly.<p>Hope that helps.  Please let me know where I left things fuzzy.<p>1.

I mostly learned how to heal my gut from an autism list (I have two ASD sons and gut issues are really common in ASD kids).  The CF community knows rather little about how to do that.  People with CF are still human and our bodies still mostly work like that of other humans.  One channel in the cell is defective and this makes a few things go very, very wrong.  Some of the issues found in the CF community seem fairly common to citizens of 1st world countries generally, but are just taken to real extremes.  For example, acidosis is a major issue with CF, one largely overlooked by doctors.  Addressing that issue did quite a lot for me.  From what I gather, the modern American diet is generally too acid and many of the health issues we have are likely made worse by widespread acidosis, though probably generally milder than what people with CF go through.  One issue that seems likely impacted by acidosis is diabetes.  People with CF are at high risk for ""CF related diabetes"" and diabetes is rather common in the US.<p>I've had quite a long day.

What's wonderful about Stripe is that there is no ""minimum"" service charge. If you don't do a lot of transactions, you don't pay a lot of fees. That makes it very low risk to spin up a service and give it a little time to see if it works. When I've talked to people with day jobs about their SaaS side-projects, it's common to hear people aiming for ""an extra $500 a month."" That's a respectable goal for a side-project, considering that sort of money could trim most people's mortgages by a decade or more, but it makes Braintree (developer friendly as they are) a huge expense.

They stopped doing that long before they even moved off of PowerPC chips in 2006.<p>Thinking there's anything remotely nefarious here is very closely akin to arguing that any breaking of backwards compatibility is evil.
