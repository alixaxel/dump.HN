If you run the Teacher's Union Pension Fund with $10B, you can't just trust your internal team or one or two large advisors. You want to get as much information as possible about all the sectors of the economy, locally and globally. So instead of hiring 1000 people to do the research for you, you pay 10-20 different companies to access their newsletters, briefs, and suggestions, each of which is written by an analyst. If 75% of analysts say ""Buy APPL"" while 5% say ""Sell APPL"", rest being neutral, you can get an idea of what the general market sentiment is.<p>To put it simply, instead of asking Gruber what he thinks of Apple management, you ask HN, Slashdot, and Ars readers.

Below's a link to a forum where I posted about it along with a link to an actual .ext I created.  But you can see from that forum thread that somebody has reported that McAfee has falsely reported it as being a virus.  I list the steps I took to create the .exe, the last being to run OCRA (One Click Ruby Installer).  The problem might be something done within that, but I think there is a larger problems: anti-virus software does this to <i>many</i> small developers of .exe's  So on the other extreme, perhaps a class action lawsuit is in order?  Just sayin.  Aforementioned forum post (containing link to .exe) is at: http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?150123-Windows-Desktop-App-using-Ruby-(instead-of-AIR)  The .exe runs on Windows only",1318187023
