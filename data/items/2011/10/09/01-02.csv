3089357,story,,,2,4,Principia,"Work full-time or grad school before startup?",,"	I just started grad school in Physics a month ago, but I have recently considered quitting since I have gained an interest in the entrepreneur/startup world.<p>I have read a few of Paul Graham's essays, and I think starting a startup would suit me well because I am willing to take the risks involved in it and work the long hours as opposed to working in a cubicle. The main problems at the moment are that I have poor programming skills (To give you an idea of my current skill level, the most recent concept I learned in C++ was Vectors a few months ago.) and that I have no friends that are interested in programming or in a startup. So finding a co-founder would be a problem. But I have been considering joining a club on campus with other grad students that are interested in forming a startup<p>I am thinking I may actually like the business aspect of running the startup as opposed to the hacking side, even though I'm rather introverted and wouldn't make a great salesman. I want to make the decisions and have the vision for the startup's future. When I was in high school/college, I was obsessed with this one hobby I had, and I really enjoyed the business aspect of it also. If it weren't a rather childish hobby, I would probably want to form a startup based on that.<p>But in the meantime, should I start getting better at hacking? Should I try working through O'Reilly's book? To learn the necessary programming and startup details, would I be better off staying the school at the moment (to try to network with others interested in a startup) or quitting asap to get a programming job at a non-startup with the intention to leave to form a startup?<p>Also, if I should just work at a startup first, before starting my own startup, what job can I possibly get? My programming skills aren't good enough for what they're looking for.<p>PG once said it should take 6-12 months to learn to hack well. Given my previous (but near minimal) experience with C++, would it still really only take 6 months?<p>PG also mentioned that those who try a startup, but fail, can easily get hired by another company. Do you guys think this is true?",1318123437
