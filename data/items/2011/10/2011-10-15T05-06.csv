Sexist in that if Charlie Rose asked exactly the same questions with his Charlie Rose manner, you wouldn't be as upset, and ageist in that the interviewer was clearly quite young. Woz is a lifelong teacher, and is as dedicated to supporting young people learn as anyone, and you're here shitting on their work. She's not Oprah yet, because she's not 40 yet.<p>My hunch is that you are all objecting, in part, to the fact that a <i>woman</i> is interjecting and according to our cultural norms, women aren't supposed to do that. If a man was doing it, you'd care less. It's a hunch based on 30 years of listening to people, and I'm hopeful you or someone will take this suggestion seriously, although if history is any guide you'll interpret this as a personal attack, go into defense mode and deny any wrongdoing.

  You are clearly on the treadmill. Yeah if you want to buy a new car every X years, and get a mortgage for an overpriced house you are not going to be able to live this lifestyle. You will probably have the lifestyle most enjoy. Maxed out credit cards, no savings, that big oh-shit moment in your mid-fifty's when you realize you've nothing saved for retirement...<p>Not to burst your bubble, but his health plan is pretty good. I have a very similar one. It's shocked me too that you can get a good plan if you are willing to take a very high deductible..<p>And ironically if I took my deductible each year I didn't need it and burned it (or gave it to charity) I'd almost break even on my low-deductible 'old plan'. When I left employment the Cobra for my plan (2 people) was 980/month. I now have a HSA-style plan that's $170/mo. It has a ~5K-per-person deductible (x2 for two people). 100% coverage after the deductible is met. I'd about break even each year if we both simultaneously came down with cancer. But since we're healthy I get to pocket the 10K or so I save each year.<p>Most cities you can get by without a car. I prefer it, actually, it is a lot less stress than driving and a lot healthier. But, yeah, if you are like the folks who got a 'great deal' on a house in Stockton in 2007 and are now commuting from there to Santa Clara, I guess bikes are out of the question. It's all about live-near-where-you-work (or vice versa).<p>The author states he's got a $100K in savings - That's a lot more safety net than your average American.

Take the legendarily bad Vision 500T that many cameramen would use even on critical bluescreen/greenscreen shots it had no place in.<p>* For IMAX, going digital has the added benefit of losing weight.  IMAX reels can only go about 90 seconds at a time.  That'll also help high speed.  Filming 500-1000 fps will tear through a 35mm reel in about 5 seconds.

3114098,comment,3111133,3112424,3,0,pak,,,"OK, I get your point, but transcribing e.e. cummings poems is kind of a corner case for voice recognition, no?<p>What Siri is going to test is whether the 80/20 rule applies to a voice recognition based personal assistant.  By constraining it to assistant-type tasks, and with what seems to be the most intelligent design we've seen yet, it has a better shot of achieving it than anything else out there.  Previous entrants have been tripped up by the lack of a decent UX, failure to integrate with other data sources, or any number of shortcomings in the long chain from microphone to software back to speaker.  Apple is the first company to have such precise control over every component in that chain.  (For instance, I wouldn't be surprised if part of the reason Siri is 4S-only is because hardware has been added for smarter noise or echo cancellation, or other subtle design changes.)  And the fact that it can learn from the internet, and presumably submit its training data back to the cloud, means that maybe it will eventually be able to handle not just 80%, but 90% or 99% of total inputs.",1318655023

Someone can play well enough to entertain drunk friends with one year of half-assed practice. To play on a stage, it's way more time of serious practice. It'll hurt, sometimes it'll take days to see improvements. Rehearse and constant practice are the key factors to thrive. If you're lacking patience, get a tutor. He will help you build momentum.
The same 'process' is valid for other moments you may be lacking patience. Get a friend you trust or a psychologist (they help well-adjusted people too), tell them about your projects, and every time you're losing patience, call them and tell them, and listen to them. They should reassure your progress, and help you get back on track.",1318654805
