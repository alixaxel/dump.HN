3176729,comment,3175780,3175780,6,0,alexhaefner,,,"I read about whether or not to start a startup on hacker news often.  In these discussions there's always the 'startups fail', 'billion dollar company'.  I can say 2 things about these two things.<p>For myself, failure is quite okay.  I spent the entire weekend at a hackathon where I failed to have anything to demo. My teammate and i were the only ones there to fail to have a demo.  I had had success at other hackathons so this hurt.  Ultimately it doesn't scare me though, as I'll explain later.<p>And on the billion dollar company, I have to say I can't relate.  My friend and I come from middle class (blue collar working town middle class) families, so we've never had much money and we don't really chase it.<p>So for us, it's not about the money, it's always been about building great things that we want for ourselves.  And with each failure and each success, we learn more, and what we make becomes better and better from our learning.  I like the idea of failure because it's only ever made the things that I make better, and helped me to be sure that I am doing what I love. Ultimately every time I ready one of these articles, and I realize that I embrace failure as an opportunity, and see money as a distraction, i feel more right with myself that we should indeed be starting a startup.<p>Disclaimer: I am a student who has no idea what I'm talking about.",1320047960

I won't be able to ""prove"" it as I have no insider access to Google executives.<p>1. They probably created it like one of the many products they did without a profit purpose at the beginning. Even with search, they didn't know where to head before a few years.<p>2. Right. I was just trying to explain why there could be rumors. They are closing a lot of services that aren't key to their business, though. I can understand that from a financial point of view very well. They may also want to consolidate the brand, and making it easier to grasp for non-geeks. All valuable goals.<p>3. ""Conspiracy theory"" is a big word. Think again about it. Companies try to move markets to their products, sometime using offensive methods. Remember Google suspended whole accounts (including Gmail, Gdocs) because users used pseudonyms on Google Plus. They're definitely serious about G+. But I won't search literacy on that topic for you. The world out here is competitive and brutal, that's all.<p>EDIT - Reformatted blank lines",1320047580

Speaking as someone about to graduate in CS, having started with C, a simple assembly language (LC-3), and later focusing on C++, I've found picking up new languages fairly easy with the stronger understanding of what's going on underneath. Obviously I'll never know what it's like learning higher level languages first, but I'm definitely happy with the path my school uses.<p>For example, learning manual memory management and instilling habits around needing to worry about this made learning Java and C# a breeze.

Considering that most people learn math before they learn programming, immutable data might even be an easier concept to grasp for a complete newbie than imperative programming with mutable data is.<p>You might think immutability is advanced but that's most likely because you learned to program with mutable things initially.<p>As an aside, I agree that Clojure's stack traces are pretty bad, but there are tools that improve the mess quite a bit, eg. clj-stacktrace.

3176686,comment,3175780,3176272,2,0,colonelxc,,,"I agree with you, though I think that a big reason they haven't done that is that the streamers who use justin.tv the most don't actually demand that feature (though they probably wouldn't mind it either).<p>I don't have any hard stats, but I think that a majority of justin.tv's traffic is gaming related.  In my observations, a single gamer can produce hours of content a day, most days of a week.  For these types of streamers, it is more of the exception than the rule that someone will go back to watch the stream.<p>In the case that there is an interesting game that people want to link to or whatnot, they do end up passing around crazy urls and mentioning time offsets.  If it is a really popular thing, someone will rip it off of the site and post it to youtube.<p>One commonality that I see (at least for the partnered streamers) is that in between games, they will run a commercial (they have the ability to choose when commercials happen).  That would be a natural point to split the video on justin.tv's side, and then you could at least directly link to a particular game.  Giving the ability for streamers to title a video after it is completed would help discoverability as well.",1320046270

Partly because they and their cohorts did so well, we don't have much more to do in the basic computer development that underlies the ever-changing cornucopia of protocols and applications that are the current focus of programmers. New algorithms will continue to develop, particularly thanks to the growth of multiprocessing and especially heterogeneous processors. New operating system constructs will be needed in those environments too. But most of the field has moved away from basic computer science toward various applications that deal directly with real-world activities.""<p>That last line prevents me from tarrying with C as much as I think I should, in the real world.  I've ready my K&R, done a number of its exercises, read some other books by the same publisher, but I keep coming to Perl for all my real world work.  I guess I work at too high of a level for C to really come into my sphere.",1320045153

3176642,comment,3174856,3176616,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"Ah, I was actually thinking about art and literature, not math and science. Perhaps I'm wrong (and no disrespect to artists who genuinely know their process and value hard work), but I've felt for a while that art/literature are assumed to be fields of endeavor where you can get to the point of being called a creative genius without doing all the work required for being called such in math/science and without having to detach yourself socially. I've simply seen too many bright young people take that path without quite knowing where it leads (I myself almost took it).<p>Regarding math and science, I do observe that academic pursuit in those fields is undervalued in social terms (in my opinion at least). Being a logical person, I conclude that it must be due to the law of supply and demand and, and that the supply (the number of average-quality science grad students) outweighs the demand. Now you can disagree with me all you want, but a lot of middle-of-the-road grad schools I've seen are depressing places filled with kids who have no idea what to do with their lives (if they did, they probably would not be in grad school at this day and age). They would probably be much better off working for a company yet seventy percent of them can't get a U.S. visa. Now most American students in their turn aren't that interested in spending six years of their young lives in classes and labs filled with people who speak mostly Mandarin, for example, so they don't go into STEM fields either.<p>I really think that the practice of U.S. graduate schools to make money off foreign students without offering them visas that allow for U.S. employment is something downright awful. Either give the graduates U.S. employment/visas or don't let them into the country in the first place. I'm leaning towards the first option.<p>It's all supply and demand. More people joining a particular field does not mean higher prestige to people who are already there -- often it's quite the opposite.",1320044636
