However, focusing on these sorts of issues seems like exactly the wrong way to go about it.<p>I understand that people overwhelmingly tend towards the extremes of rating scales.  But who cares?  There's so much noise anyway.<p>Here's what I want: (1) include (all) films and television series and (2) include top 1000 lists for as many niche categories as possible (foreign films about relationships, teen comedy, and so on).<p>I don't even care if it is personalized, because the personalization is always horrible.  (I've tried Netflix, Jinni and others and they're all terrible.)  Just having the average for the movie is actually amazingly accurate on many measures (within 10--20%).<p>Is there something like this?  The closest I've gotten so far is finding a good IMDB user list or two.",1317956333

The public itself - in the form of a dynamic and multi-polar civil society and <i>not</i> a single formal institution - is an appropriate counterbalance.<p>The catch is that this isn't really possible if the entire system of government is organized on democratic principles - we currently have too much democratic process to achieve appropriately democratic outcomes.<p>Tweaking the balance between various co-equal government institutions is a good way to limit the capabilities of the overall system without having to rely on any permanent external force to restrain it.  If we returned to dealing with social problems via judicial means on a case-by-case basis, instead of giving legislative and executive authority a priori top-down control over everything, we'd be much better off.",1317956256

I had a Nexus One prior to that, and its 3.7"" screen likewise felt fine.<p>I'd be willing to bet that the iPhone's original screen size was dictated more by battery concerns than the average mobile thumb length of tea drinkers in the midwest or whatever crazy metric people want to use. Bigger screens use exponentially more energy. Once that size was decided, Apple's basically stuck with it, since iPhone apps use absolute layouts and are designed for a 3:2 screen. You can't just scale the app to the new aspect ratio without stretching assets (squares become rectangles, circles become ellipses), and iPhone apps are designed against a specific aspect ratio.<p>Increasing a 3:2 screen to 4.3"" would make the screen 2.4"" wide; the iPhone's screen is currently 1.9"" wide, and the Sensation/SGS II have 2.1"" wide screens, by comparison.

3082396,comment,3082196,3082196,8,0,jerrya,,,"Having used Swype, Flex T9, and Dragon Natural Speaking, this buyout bothers me.<p>And that's because while Swype really seems to get what customer support is all about, Nuance itself is still into customer support circa 1998.   Email support with automated wizards. A terrible ""knowledge base"".  Seemingly no phone support. No forums. No wiki.<p>It's honestly shocking how terrible and corporate focused Nuance's customer support is, given the nature of many of the customers of Dragon Naturally Speaking.<p>I wish the folks at Swype the best, once I started using it, I became unable to use tap tap touchscreen keyboards.<p>On the other hand, I do find a comment from a Verizon salesman I was speaking to interesting. And it matches my own experience.  Really fast typers or texters want a physical keyboard.  The problem I have with Swype is that after Swyping a sentence or two, I have to look at what is being input because salad cookies wrong easily diction mumble bad. Elephant.<p>I picked up Flex T9 because I got an Android tablet not supported by Swype, and Flex T9 is very good at swyping.  But it is not nearly as good as Swype and it is basically impossible to talk to Nuance about the problems.  And unlike Swype, there have been no updates.<p>So this could be a terrific marriage, especially if Siri technology trickles into Swype and Nuance pulls its head out of its butt and figures out what customer support is circa 2012.<p>But boy, their support website is so awful, it's hard to imagine.",1317954042
