It's just a speaker and a microphone'. Of course, there had already been inroads into making your phone much more than a phone, just as set-top boxes and other connected devices have added capabilities to your television.<p>I don't think we'll see a 'rebirth' of television so much as we'll see television joining mobile, tablets and computers in the middle.<p>Really, the revolution of the phone was making it more like a computer, but more portable. The revolution of the television I suspect will be the same, but less portable. Just like the portability of the phone expanded the things we used our phones for, a less portable large screen product could expose similar capabilities.",1319338545

</code></pre>
Emails from the general public to regulators that cc reporters (especially reporters who have quoted Mr. Appelsmith before) actually carry a lot of weight.<p>This is because American regulators intimidate the businesses they are regulating into silence. They have complete power over whether or not your products are approved, and criticizing them will piss them off and ensure that they sit on your application (at a minimum) or start finding various kinds of violations that they can cite you for.<p>That is, unless Mr. Appelsmith feels that the public and/or the press can (a) identify him by name and (b) do not support his actions. This is one of the vanishingly few scenarios in which a civil servant can actually lose their job, so they really hop to it[1].<p>During the whole process while you are waiting for approval you have zero revenue, and so it looks to all the world like you are just a loser and a whiner. In the biotech space this is why a lot of companies nowadays debut in Europe, so that they can say with some justification ""well, we have a legit product but the FDA is holding it up"". And because the threat of zero revenue for an arbitrarily long period of time means you might not make payroll, it's very unusual for someone to fight the power like Mr. Greenspan is doing. And he really could only do it as a one man software company without any employees that he needs to feed.<p>In a less sympathetic sector like oil or pharmaceuticals, or even just a slightly larger company of 100 employees, he loses the sympathy associated with a one man operation. At that point the regulators just go to the press and get them to write a story on what a terrible company this is for practicing without a license. Thereby justifying further regulation.<p>Basically, someone needs to stand up for what is right rather than just retreating. Mr. Greenspan is a pain in the ass in the same way the Don't Touch My Junk guy was. Everyone else tolerates these sorts of step by step encroachments on liberty till there is none left.<p>[1] Though afterwards they will hate FaceCash for all eternity and look to trip it up whenever possible, but Mr. Greenspan has no other cards to play at this point.",1319338034

While their driving probably isn't the worst of any country, the cars are horrifically unsafe and traffic patterns are erratic at best. I think what it comes down to is that seeing a kid get run over isn't especially surprising to anyone, and since the kid was already almost certainly dead or about to die no one really cared. I don't think it's just an issue of the liability.<p>A good analogy would be in NYC the reason they built the high line was that in the 1820s literally at least a dozen kids were getting run over by the train every single week. No one cared because everyone was poor and life was cheap, and a good day was one where the local neighborhood gang didn't try to douse you in gasoline and light you on fire for entertainment.",1319337707

  O perpetual recurrence of determined seasons,
  O world of spring and autumn, birth and dying!
  The endless cycle of idea and action,
  Endless invention, endless experiment,
  Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness;
  Knowledge of speech, but not of silence;
  Knowledge of words, and ignorance of The Word.
  All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance,
  All our ignorance brings us nearer to death,
  But nearness to death no nearer to God.
  Where is the Life we have lost in living?
  Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
  Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
  The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries
  Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.

In your typical ServiceLayer style app, most of the calls are just direct passthroughs to the domain model.<p>Frankly, the controller layer is a sufficient service layer for many complex applications, as it handles different clients and request types. There is often foolishness in putting too much of that logic in a single controller method, but it is wrong to suggest that adding the overhead of the service layer pattern in place of referencing the domain model from the controller fixes this (putting it in lib certainly makes a bit more sense).<p>The example given in the article is a bit of a horror show.  It's probably not a service layer. I am sure a bit is left out, but it's going to convoluted lengths to avoid putting anything in the domain model.  Dynamically extending individual instances of employee to add a pay_date method? Creating a new instance of the service on each request- when it could be done with static methods?<p>Sadly, it doesn't make sense to model your whole domain twice. Let's see what the employee service used to list, add, update, and remove employees is like.

But this is not something we ever do in practice where I work - code on servers gets there only by being checked out of SVN.<p>I personally find it incredibly irritating when I see people who've split a function call over a couple of lines just to try and meet this criterion, e.g.:<p><pre><code>  def __init__(self, first, second, third,

Reporters will strip away all context and ask: ""why is an unlicensed payment processor allowed to do business in the State of California""?<p>Especially when prompted by the press or their friends, regulators can spring into action out of nowhere and levy a host of civil and criminal penalties, up to but not limited to pulling your product from the market and freezing your assets so you can't meet payroll.<p>So, in short, you don't want to screw around with regulators under this administration. They treat businesses a LOT more harshly than college students. Indeed, no less an authority than Peter Thiel himself has commented that it might be impossible to clone Paypal today as the bridge seems to have been pulled up behind them:<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20114584-281/talking-tech-with-peter-thiel-investor-and-philanthropist-q-a/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20114584-281/talking-tech-...</a><p><pre><code>  CNET: I wrote a retrospective piece for CNET recently 
  about how significant the post-9/11 regulatory shift was, 
  especially when it comes to privacy. 

  Thiel: It's not exactly clear to me whether Paypal could 
  be built as a business today. That may be too strong.... 
  As a startup, these kinds of regulations are much more 
  onerous. Paypal was able to be built at a time that was 
  pre-9/11 on a regulatory basis. Post-9/11 it would be much 
  more difficult to build. It makes the franchise more 
  valuable. I think no competitors will ever be built.</code></pre>",1319335232
