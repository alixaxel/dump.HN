3142738,comment,3140787,3142362,1,0,flazzarino,,,"There exists a non-intuitive asymmetry in the nature of  systems like multi-core. Do four 10mph car crashes do the same damage as one 40mph crash? If it can be properly coordinated. If you can coordinate it, how much does the coordination cost? At worst you only have the power of one 10mph crash, often at best too.<p>Programming for multi-core can a hard problem but the problem doesn't always lie in our abilities, many times it's computationally impossible.<p>To play games and video is a must right? We want the most from our battery right? A fact of the situation is that high power activities are many times mutually exclusive from low power activities right? So what is awful, inelegant or stupid about the design? The asymmetry? There is asymmetry of the interaction? Should you cary around a dumb-phone, a gameboy, and a video player? Maybe more elegant, but it sure is more awful.<p>P.S. Don't talk about FP son ;)",1319255945

Python supports (limited) lambdas and some higher-order functions, but it really feels like the language tries to steer you away from too much functional programming.<p>The best time to learn about different paradigms is right when you're starting out; if you basically only learn how to program imperatively, you're liable to start believing that that's the only way to go. I know because this happened to me (I was self-taught and learned a different set of languages, but it had the same effect); ultimately it took me longer to come to and start using functional programming properly than it would have had I learned about it at the very beginning.",1319255917

But I had spent a lot of time programming before I started it, so I'm not sure if it really is the best text for CS 101, where some students maybe have never written a line of code. Peter Norvig's review sort of sums up this regarding SICP: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8</a><p>I've never been involved in teaching CS or programming, and while I really do think SICP should be required reading for all CS students (and for all programmers) just because it's so good, I respect that teaching is very challenging, and fitting it all into a single semester might be tough. There are some very smart and experienced people who have spent a lot of time thinking about this (see ""The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum""), and I hesitate to put SICP on a pedestal where it can't be touched.<p>As I said, hopefully some (or many!) of the students taking this class at Berkley will be curious about the original book and will seek it out on their own.",1319255801

 Let me be a bit blunt and tell you a few things.<p>1. You had parents to move back with to cater for your Lodging and Boarding
2. I dunno what you are doing as your career after quitting your job
3. You are in America, where getting gigs is no biggie
4. You <i>ARE</i> an idiot for being depressed and contemplating suicide.<p>I had to make a similar decision myself, I am in a remote town, in a country where getting gigs is really difficult, I have mortgages to pay and lifestyle to manage (my lifestyle was quite lavish since I had a <i>high</i> paying job) I do not have my parents here with me to move back into, though a lot of people I know have suggested that I do and move back to a different country where living is cheaper. To add to that, I have had to take medications etc for my stress levels and am still consulting a couple of doctors. However, what surprises me is WHY <i>SUICIDE</i>, I mean if that is what I wanted, then my High Paying job was doing a good job of taking my life away.<p>If your friends tell you what an idiot you are, remember they are <i>NOT</i> really your friends, they want to feel better by comparing themselves to you and probably were jealous of your pay.<p>I have managed over a year and a half on my own, believe me this is not easy... However, now things have started to pick up, I am being approached by people and they want me to provide my services to them (mainly development)<p>I used the time that I had to learn, skill and re-skill myself, I was used to being a Manager, getting people to do things, i did mainly all the high level stuff, but now I am back to being a code monkey, nothing wrong with it, other than the fact that I cannot focus on that, but since my skills are good, I can manage to catch up in terms of deadlines, etc<p>The other piece of information that you have not posted is how old are you? That will also determine, what you call a HIGH Paying job. Let me say that I have given up a 100K type job and gone through hell, and hope that the journey is nearly over.<p>For anyone that is contemplating, you need to know a few things,<p>1. Do not quit your job on the pretext that you <i>might</i> just make it lucky
2. Have a plan, I did not have the luxury of a plan, had to do it for health reasons and other personal reasons.
3. Build contacts, spread the word about your work, it will take a year or two before you get to see results, the Economy is <i>slow</i> it is not just you or your luck
4. At every stage project professionalism, meet people and discuss your services as if you are a flourishing business, this will instill confidence in you and also keep your mind off <i>depression</i> and feelings of being a loser. After all the <i>ONLY</i> person that can really call you a loser is <i>YOU</i> what any body else says does not matter...<p>If it helps, take up something in the meanwhile that could be anything that gets you going, I felt that I needed to <i>not</i> take up such temp employment and went on hard with self development instead.<p>Hope you can take something from this and work towards something positive and make it...<p>I have been a victim of office politics and went through the same...<p>Tim, Vic",1319253040
