The difficulties of Haskell are not arbitrary. Nor are they related to the difficulty of understanding the machine at a low level. In fact, Haskell insulates you from all that; it's easily the highest level language in common use.<p>It's that Haskell insists on program correctness. You have to consider the entire range of values that any function could ever process. And due to its purity, Haskell applies a razor to your thought process, cutting out all unjustified or implicit assumptions.<p>Luckily it also gives you tools of unparalleled flexibility when it comes to creating abstractions. Creating a new abstraction (like the composition of two functions) isn't just <i>as easy as</i> function application, that's how you <i>do</i> function application in Haskell.

3124784,comment,3123507,3123971,1,0,netcan,,,"Good points and I agree that Groupon seems to get jumped on for unjustified reasons. I don't believe that they would have ever gotten so many customers if it was such a bad deal for businesses. 40% ""failed experiment"" rate in advertising is not bad. For them it's a one off cost. For the ones that do get value it's an ongoing advertising channel. Eventually most customers will be repeat customers.<p>What I don't see is how Groupon would hold on to a market like this. Where are the barriers? There's no reason n+1 Groupon sites couldn't exist. I also see no real need for Groupon to be big. If there is to be a leader in each market(city), why should Groupon be outcompeting local Tokyo, Paris or Tel Aviv Groupon clones? Groupon has its brand and experience and other little advantages, but nothing that outclasses whatever advantages the small competitors could plausibly bring to the table.<p>If someone told me this idea before Groupon, I'd think it was good, especially if they had demonstrated that businesses will bite, which Groupon has. It's a great idea for a business with value for businesses and customers. I really don't get the Groupon hate. I just don't see this as a winner take all market where a head start guarantees much.

I couldn't understand at first, but then it became obvious. 99% of the posts are striped from any real content, they are irrelevant single words, offenses, f</i><i>ked up puctures, funny pictures, etc. But then, in 1% of the comments lies the real value of 4chan.</i><p>I couldn't agree more. I've long since lost the ability to get offended by pretty much anything 4chan could throw at me, so I must be pretty biased at this point. My view, however, is that the trolling and gore are in essence just a filter for potential audiences. In the early days, not rarely would there be threads up posting gore with the explicit goal of getting rid of newbies. (The actual vocabulary associated with these subjects on 4chan is rather more crude and graphic, and I will not denigrate this discussion with voicing it aloud.)<p>By getting past the filter, ie. being able to scan boards and threads for relevant content and not getting too offended on the way, you will have proven to the collective consciousness your ability to partake in discussions of taboo matters and doing so with a certain degree of objectivity and an open mind. That's the point after which actual discussion can happen. Combined with anonymity and volatility of content, this quality makes /b/ not only a cesspool of humanity but a place where entirely new kinds of conversations can take place and new ideas be entertained.<p>To understand the essence of moot's argument of prismatic identity, I find a certain underlying understanding of the scene where he's coming from is also necessary.

What will an engineer/recruiter need to see to (a) understand what your skills are, (b)  trust you -- indirect: credentials, direct: validate promise via github, (c) take action on this and give you an awesome job.<p>On the web site design:<p>* Before scrolling down I know nothing about you. When hitting the site immediately you need something to engage with me. The first screen is mostly vacant of anything helpful.<p>* Github is mentioned in your introduction yet it is not in the mostly irrelevant list of services that you can be found on. Given that it's very important why not?<p>* 'Hire Miles' isn't obviously an email link. Perhaps you could put a small email symbol on it? The menu is also not obviously a menu. Read up on 'affordances' and you can improve the user experience with this knowledge. :)<p>* It would be a nice touch if you slide down (animation) to the anchor links as some other websites do.<p>* Dark red on tartan? Some of the typography is a bit off.<p>* Might be nice to link to the github for the website from the website or mention that it's written in node.js. Maybe only interesting for geeks but I get the feeling that this will be your market since other recruiters just expect normal resumes. :)",1318936241
