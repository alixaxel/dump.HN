I'm a gamedev (worked at a couple studios now) and I've wanted to integrate Lisp into gameplay for years. I even got a Franz CL evaluation. The discovery of GOAL/Crash Bandicoot further motivated my efforts.<p>Ultimately nothing came out of it; Lua and Python are just so much easier to integrate into a realtime C++ simulation (video game) and are nearly as effective. However, I became a better programmer for life. Discovering GOAL enabled me to think like ""if Naughty Dog could do it, then so could I"", which sparked me along a path of learning that profoundly impacted my sense of programming aesthetics and quality.

3152621,comment,3152103,3152103,2,0,neoveller,,,"After reading and responding to the comments, I want to add an overall, more clear message:<p>The argument is that without rigid identity on the web, anonymity and pen names could not really take off and receive audience. Many individuals' first encounter with the Internet and any web communities is with Facebook, and this is because these people would not feel comfortable starting out on a place like Reddit for 4chan. For this reason, rigid identity is a necessary foundation for the usefulness of pen names and anonymity. Moot's argument that pen names are the way to go is flawed insofar as it undermines the ""necessary evil"" of rigid identity, which is a natural, socially evolved stepping stone for anonymity's value.<p>Without people going online and possessing monuments to themselves (facebook profiles) in a way they feel comfortable and secure in, anything posted online (including content under pen names) is in aggregate less valuable. Rigid identity is a necessary characteristic of social media content which can result in inexperienced web users taking the plunge to explore the rest of the less-rigid web.",1319511310

The basic problem here is that Netflix is selling a total fantasy product that does not pay the rights holders enough money. Look at the math -- $8/month for unlimited access? How does that possibly work when your cable bill is $80/month, a DVD/BR costs $15-$30, and a movie ticket costs $10-15? HBO, which shows more recent movies, is about $20/month by itself. Just to offer competitive prices to the rights holders I suspect Netlix would have to charge between $50-$75/month.<p>I'm generally all for government regulation as needed but this seems absurd. Why would any film company produce movies anymore? People (un)happily pay a lot more for the content today in other mediums.

Then they won't be annoying, they'll be fellow safe road users.<p>Similarly, we need to educate drivers in treating cyclists respectfully.  Don't tolerate running stop signs; that's illegal.  But you must tolerate cyclists that are taking the entire right lane because they think they need it for their safety.  Look behind you, change to the left lane, and overtake on the left.   Don't be annoyed, because this is how roads work.  There is going to be traffic and some of it is going to be slower than you.  That's why there are multiple lanes.

3152447,comment,3149320,3152370,2,0,jrockway,,,"For those of you not from Chicago, Chicago has created an experimental bike lane on a downtown street.  They put some reflective poles in the middle of the side of the road where cars park, then designated everything from those poles to the curb a bike lane.  Cars now park to the left of bicycles and to the right of cars, creating an interesting setup.  There is no risk of being ""doored"" now, but traffic coming out of side streets can't see bikes in the bike lanes.  They've compensated for this with tons and tons of paint on the road and lots of signs.<p>I have ridden the Kinzie one in both directions.  I usually need to turn left at Clinton or Des Plaines, and this is now very difficult, as it's tough to move from the poled-in area to the real traffic lane at speed.  To turn at Clinton, I have to cut over traffic right after the bridge.  To turn at Des Plaines, the lane change is simpler because the poles are gone,  but that giant hill makes turning left there very difficult.  I like to get over to the left well before the intersection so that I don't miss the turn due to too much traffic, but the poles force me to stay in the bike lane longer than I might want to during heavy traffic.  (OK, there is never any traffic on Kinzie, so this is not a real problem.)<p>The stop signs along the route are very difficult for everyone, because nobody knows how to react to this weird lane thing that exists nowhere else on earth.  Should cars yield to bikes?  Should bikes yield to cars?  There are some signs put up that try to tell you what to do, but I've read them a million times and can't remember what they say.<p>Kinzie is such a lightly-used street that I don't understand how these dividers help make the road safer.  That big hill at the 5-way intersection is the only thing non-ideal about Kinzie, and of course that's never going to be fixed.  Some reflective poles in the middle of the road don't do it for me.<p>While this doesn't excite me, there are changes that would.  Parked cars could be removed from the side of the road, leaving enough room for cyclists and cars to truly share the right lane.  (No need for bike lane markings; the extra room is just as good and much cheaper to create.)  Speed limits could be lowered from 30 to 25, so that, with training, bikes and cars could actually be going to same speed.  This means that traffic light timings would be just as good for bikes as for cars, meaning that there would be no travel time advantage for cars.<p>I doubt this will happen, so as a substitute, how about giving people speeding tickets in Chicago?  I've never seen anyone get one, and I've seen people getting off the freeway and continuing to drive 75 on the surface streets.  75 on a city street?  Come on.",1319508010
