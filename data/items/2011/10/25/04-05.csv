And does it appear to have the potential to be economically competitive?<p>First, however, residential usage does not peak after dark.  Peaks occur on sunny hot days when A/C usage is maximum.  And since in the US the electric grid already exists and no one is proposing dismantling it, that simplifies the problem.<p>Ten years in the future, iPad-level power consumption will rule for computing machinery at home (iPad == 2.5 watts).  LED lights will be common.  Solar panels will be the cheapest form of electricity, if current trends hold.  Even on a cloudy day, solar PV generates significant power, so about the night?<p>Batteries, either connecting a city's worth of hybrid cars, dedicated battery packs, pumped water storage, compressed air storage, are all options.  Others are to run natural gas generators at night, or wind or hydro or geothermal, all grid connected.  None of these are particularly difficult to imagine, and combined with efficient lighting and other expected improvements in efficiency could easily be expected to cover residential night time load.",1319518426

However, the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining a tracking system will cancel out some, or possibly all of the gain. How much so is not clear.<p>In this case, a 4500Wp fixed angle installation, which appears to be available for around $12,000 not including installation or installation brackets generates 4364kWh per year in Seattle, saving the homeowner $279.30 in annual electric costs given the alleged 6.4/kwH rate in Seattle (which seems very low to me). This is equivalent to a 2.3% return on the investment, with, unlike in savings, the principal is non-recoverable and expires after 25 years as the panels reach their end of life.<p>The numbers are better for other cities true. The DOE calculator gives 5491 kWh/yr for a 4500Wp fixed angle installation in Hawaii, with 18.1 cent electricity. Over a year, the electricity value is $993.87, an 8.2% annual return, but again, with the principle not returned and the investment expiring after 25 years.",1319516809

Watt peak is a normalized output rating for a panel under some conditions and doesn't actually mean it's producing that in a given condition. He has numbers that a brand new 1 watt-peak panel gives 5.3 watts a day of power in a certain location with a certain configuration. He has a 4500Watt peak installation. So he multiplies the 4500 watt peak by the watts per day per watt-peak. The watt-peaks cancel out, giving watts per day. Multiplying further by days per month gives the average watts per month (average per year) for the 4500Wp installation in the given location. Basically, it's correct, but one has to understand that the W, typically called Watts, in the panel rating is not Watts, but a  normalized Watt-peak rating of the panel. It is worth noting that solar salesmen will often intentionally confuse the two, leading homeowners to believe that their new installation has much higher capacity than it actually does.",1319516486

Shimla is also an important administrative centre. It has been variously described as the Indian Capua, Mount Olympus and the Abode of the Little Tin Gods. It was the summer capital during British era and thus has historical legacy protected in its original form. Shimla derived its name from Goddess 'Shyamla' and was also known by the name of Simla in the earlier years. There are also several places to see around Shimla.Few places of tourist interest offered by Shimla tourism are The Mall, Gaiety theatre, Ridge, Christ church, Jakhoo hill, Jakhoo temple, summer hill, Prospect hill, Tara Devi temple, Sankat Mochan temple, Shimla state museum, Indian instate of advanced study, St Michael's Cathedral, Chadwick Falls, Botanical garden, kali Bari temple and many more . Shimla also serves as a convenient base for variety of adventure sports such as Skiing, Trekking, Ice Skating, River Rafting, Camping, Rock Climbing, Fishing and Golfng, Mountaineering and so on.All in all, Shimla is a paradise for honeymooners, families and even a group of friends who want a weekend break from one of the nearby cities.",1319516385
