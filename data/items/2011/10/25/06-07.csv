This is a nice bit of low hanging fruit for a segway into smarter home technology, something we've been promised for ages but which has consistently failed to deliver IMHO. Add in the green factor and I think this has the potential to be a pretty damn good business with plenty of room for future product growth.",1319525968

Solar could easily produce about 90% of power for some regions (remember, electricity is a valuable export commodity) and other methods will take up the load at night. That is where we are going and that is what the article is about. Once the price gets down low enough solar will become the first choice and other choices will just support it, much like coal or natural gas is that choice at the moment.

I studied her and figured out all the responses to various stimuli, created models and developed strategies. Then when I had my second I discovered I knew nothing.

You can add capacity and use storage, but you'll never be able to make it competitive as you do so, because your efficiency drops as you do.  You can be passionate about solar, but you can't ignore the facts.<p>>Hydroelectric power provides a huge amount of baseload for some regions already.<p>Agreed. Hydro is a fantastic power source and should be expanded because it brings water supplies and electricity, two of the building blocks of civilisation.

What is the cost they use? For industries with steep learning curves, the right strategy would be to use expected future cost as the basis for business decisions, rather than the trailing average (realized) cost, in order to build the market and more quickly progress on the learning curve.<p>If that's illegal (it's often used in instances I mentioned above), then I feel like progress in industries with steep learning curves will be slower, because companies will be more timid, causing the market to grow less quickly.<p>What is everyone's opinions here?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/234291/20111019/solarworld-solar-panels-cells-china-antidumping-subsidies-lawsuit-complaint.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/234291/20111019/solarworld-s...</a>",1319522400
