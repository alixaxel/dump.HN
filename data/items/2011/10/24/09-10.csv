I learned to code has a hobby when I was a kid and then took a CS degree. During the CS degree I was indoctrinated out of ""bad habits"" that I developed as a self-taught programmer. One of these bad habits was being terse. I took my degree during the golden age of createFactoryOfServerProcessGenerators() type things. Now, with more experience and wisdom, I realize I was right all along. A development environment that comfortably fits in your brain makes programming more effective and fun. And maybe I'm too idealistic, but I strongly believe the two are related.",1319450377

Isn't that the manifesto of ""hacking""...that there is no one way to do something? We all see countless articles on here ""How to do this, How to do that"". The fact is, all of these rules are just frameworks and how you implement them is up to you as a person.

I dropped out for personal reasons (I went properly metalist for a while, bipolar before it was trendy to be, and was medically signed-off) though luckily I'd made an impression on a local company the year before and got a part-time job with them while I sorted myself out (one day a week at first, then two, and so on until I ended up there full time) and I'm still there now.<p>It isn't dropping <i>out</i> that is important. It is where you drop <i>in</i> to, or push your way into, afterwards. Just dropping out is not an answer to anything. Dropping out to pursue a thought-out and potentially ground-breaking idea (or just a dream: it can be about personal growth more than career building or world changing) often is.<p>Most drop-outs make nothing of themselves and we shouldn't be encouraging it as a way forward (though I firmly believe that many people would be more successful building their career without University (the system is against me on this one!) but again dropping out isn't the answer on its own here: don't go, or if you go and find you've made the wrong decision have somewhere to move on to planned before you make another big decision that might be equally wrong). I was lucky. Mid-/long-term (short term was a slowish start, the first 6 months at least mainly spent ""fixing"" myself) I dropped into a better position then some of my friends graduated into and have built a healthy career. Many aren't so lucky, or are just perpetual drop-outs. Some are following an idea or dream and a few of those are destined to be game changers, but only a few.",1319448497

I recently bought one with 13"" thinking it would be my best computer ever. Well, hardware/power-wise it is incredibly fast! But I found out some things that make it almost unbearable.<p>There are only three ways to interact with a laptop and I believe it fails deeply in two of them.<p>The trackpad is very much ok, probably the best one I ever tried. But the keyboard... While the design looks amazing, keys are really thin and feel cheap. As soon as I turned the laptop on and needed to enter my Apple ID, the first time I pressed the Alt key it just came out! This hasn't happened yet to any other key on this laptop but I used to have an iMac with a similar keyboard and three keys stopped working. You can feel the fragility of the keys by putting one finger on the top of the key and another on the bottom, and then press them alternatively: the key bounces like a boat. While I can't say it's the worst keyboard I ever had (because I owned an iMac), I never had such problem with any other laptop or external keyboard. I could also talk about the really small size of the arrow keys. I miss them all the time. And the return key is also much smaller than every other keyboard I have tried before.<p>The other way to interact with the laptop (more like it interacting with me) is the screen. I was crazy about having a really good definition screen and it is. But operating systems are not made for resolutions like that so it all ends up with really really small text everywhere and zooming all the time because you will mostly never get into a text properly sized for a screen like this. If you use Windows you can set the DPI to whatever you want but webpages text will still be incredibly small.<p>So I have a hard time typing and reading on it.
