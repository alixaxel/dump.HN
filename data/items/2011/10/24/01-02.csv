Your approach is to hide the information and hope for the best.<p><i>But that is something kids grow into</i><p>No, it is not.  Reasoning is a skill, and an understanding of human psychological impulses and drives is something that should be part of a child's upbringing.  This can and should start as soon as the child's old enough to read or watch TV.<p><i>Oh, and, really, you think you can tell me I've made terrible mistakes as a parent when you know nothing about me but a few sentences you've read on the Internet? You feel good about that?</i><p>Sure.  Your kids are eventually going to be voting on what information adults can and cannot have access to, and it sounds like you're not preparing them to make decisions I'd agree with.

It also requires unusual attitude recovery, a drill where you cover your eyes and the instructor puts the plane at a cockeyed angle and you have to recover using only instruments.  You must successfully perform these maneuvers in order to pass your FAA checkride.<p>Basically in order to get your PPL you have to not just be able to turn a 180 on instruments, but demonstrate some level of precision in other maneuvers...so I think that while the study demands six hours, the FAA has determined that the job can be done in three.<p>As to your questions for me: I'm not instrument rated.  I've taken about two hours of instruction on instruments beyond the required 3.0, most of that time was on the flight were I got my high performance endorsement...in a Bonanza, coincidentally.  I'm confident I could do an instrument-only 180 in the Piper Cherokee I fly most frequently because I've recently done instrument work in a more challenging aircraft.  A month from now with no further instrument work I'd be significantly less confident.<p>Hands off the yoke?

The problem now is that banks can reliably depend on being rescued every decade or so.  In the 70's it was loans to SA dictators, in the 80's it was the savings and loan crisis. the it was devaluation of the ruble which took out Long Term Capital Management, then the current mess of housing mortgages and derivatives.
