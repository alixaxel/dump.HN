3173514,comment,3172260,3172818,2,0,tomp,,,"The solution to this problem is not to make arrays covariant, but to correctly specify the type signature of MakeJuice:<p>MakeJuice :: Basket<`a> -> void where `a <: Fruit<p>That is, of course, only if MakeJuice does not modify the array. In general, I think that often the biggest mistake is variance annotation of types. Instead, <i>functions</i> should have (in)variance annotation on every parameter and on the return value. Then, a function that only reads from an array would be covariant in the type of array elements, a function that only writes would be contravariant, and a function that does both would be invariant. No need to artificially limit the usecases of arrays.",1319943443

People would look at Intellectual Ventures in a really positive light if it was actually doing lots of research, and sold access to its patents and charge for consulting.  This would be a really interesting way to do things, and would actually be outsourcing research and providing a convenient way for companies in different areas to share patents.  However, they are instead buying up patents and using shell companies to sue companies that have been operating for years and show no evidence of willful infringement.  Another strike against them is their patents, they seem to love method patents which are way too broad and taking advantage of an overly generous patent office.<p>The tragedy of the patent dilemma is that it could be solved by just reforming the patent office, and making some slight adjustments.",1319942980

3173501,comment,3173037,3173478,5,0,pak,,,"Exactly.  I think the statement ""Linux users are power users,"" which is the premise underlying most of the OP, is too narrow-minded.  The whole spirit of GNU/Linux is that anybody who wants to use it, can do so without restriction--power user, developer, third-world student, hacker, artist.  That ethos is primary to any claim that Linux has to follow Unix philosophies or any particular UI guidelines.  And it is exactly what has spawned and continues to nurture a healthy diversity of distros.  Just because Ubuntu has gone in one direction means very little for Linux as a whole; some would argue that their direction is an important one, and time will tell.  Certainly the work that Canonical does on usability and basics like driver support will be available for other distros to cherry pick as appropriate.  The blunt answer to the OP is ""if Canonical no longer serves your needs, just install one of the hundreds of other distros.""",1319942975

Utility computing and grid computing has got nothing to do with google's search engine.<p>Internet search is in absolutely no way even remotely a ""natural monopoly"". I could set up my own search engine with a few bucks investment just like Larry and Sergey did plus nowadays storage is even cheaper.<p>> <i>so it is most efficient to have a central distributor</i><p>So in case of Google it is a ""good"" monopoly because it will save costs???? Are you out of your mind? I don't pay for a google search like I pay for my kWh and google does not provide any public infrastructure. They feed off the internet and feed off on my data and make money that way. They are a company, not a utility.<p>> <i>You also mentioned ""all the flak they are getting,"" could you provide specifics?</i><p>Well for starters, look at all the ""Apple=Nazi"" bullshit and blind hatred this guy wrote: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=jhuni"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=jhuni</a><p>> <i>DRM</i><p>There is no DRM on my iMac or in my iTunes songs.

I am in control of everything that is going on on my PC here and I can also install lots of other OSs if I want that.<p>> <i>evil things like restricting users with DRM</i><p>Well, you really must be smarter than everyone else because with a good 100 million iPhones sold, you would think MOST customers would have quickly dumped them as soon as they hit all those horrible road blocks you are seeing... but no, iphones keep selling and a lot of people enjoy using them. So they must have gotten something right for just that target audience.<p>You need to learn to accept that obviously apple does not care about some bean-foil deflector beanie defender of all developers who sees them as the worst kind of Naziscum. So needless to say, they won't be making any products for you whether you like it or not. There is nothing more to this discussion than that.<p>> <i>Could you show me what alternatives you are referring to</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_music_stores"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_music_stor...</a><p>You need to plug the RIAA with your DRM hatred because they are (were) making those terms.<p>> <i>PyMusique</i><p>Someone illegally reverse engineered a tool to hack around the RIAA-dictated DRM protection and you are wondering that apple plugged (had to plug) that hole?

You must really think you are so much smarter than everyone around you because you obviously believe you are in a position to question all those millions worldwide who decided to buy an apple product.<p>Back before apple could sell a single home-PC, there was pretty much only x86 and microsoft for pretty much all PCs. To this day GNU/Linux has obviously utterly failed to make it to the average user's desktop at large so people were stuck with Windows. At least apple could grab a few of those percents and bring a little bit of competition to that huge market.

Linux is at less than 3% total where they always were. This is no tyranny, this is not forcing nobody to use apple. You make it look like they own 99% of everything. Completely ridiculous and wrong.<p>If anything you should be thankful that at least there is a LITTLE bit of competition for M$ but you are probably much too ignorant, stuck up and also too young to remember the dark ages when there was nothing but M$ for most computer users.<p>> <i>You blame me of being a ""fandroid""</i><p>I blame you for mindlessly repeating retarded, false propaganda and for not seeing things for what they are. Apple has small market shares in everything they do. And I blame you for continuously thinking you know better than all those people who consciously decided to switch to Apple products and find that they like it.<p>> <i>Yet you a clearly a huge fan of Apple</i><p>I am pretty much fluent on all windows, unix, linux and mac system as well as more exotic ones like Be. I really do not care much what I am using as long as it works reliably and comfortably enough. I have seen M$ go from horrible DOS to WinDOS to Vista and 7 and I have seen Atari and Commodore and I have seen Linux and BSD go from flipping every single kernel switch before compiling it myself to dragonfly and ubuntu and whatnot... and I have seen apple from their first little black and white interface to their very first ""sexy"" products to their switch to Intel and I have seen the iPod help them rise in popularity, then the popular macs and finally the iPhone and iPad. Trust me, I been around the block and I belong to no single camp. I ""hate"" companies like Microsoft, SAP and Oracle - real actual major players and true monopolists that make atrociously bad software. Not comparatively little fish like Apple.<p>Back in the day apple used to be so far ahead of x86 PCs it was ridiculous. Now they are Intels just the same. I am no apple fanboy, I like some of their stuff and they have made my life easier. But the one thing where I give Apple real credit is that they were the only ones to successfully bring actual competition to the PC market, even at just 10%. They were the only ones to date to give M$ a run for their money and make M$ finally look retarded, old and horrible. And they have CREATED the modern smartphone and tablet market, things that did not exist before. Finally all those average PC users have a real choice available and there is at least SOME competition which can only benefit all of us. So if you really hate big corps then you should shit on M$ and on google and thank the wolfram alphas and DDGs and also Apple in this world because they were the only ones who could stand up against a real monopoly.<p>And you know why Linux on the desktop failed to deliver this much needed competition? Because open source and free software is sadly full of ADHD attention whores and people who think they know it oh-so-much-better than the users and they will go to great length shitting on anyone who is just a little bit more successful than they are - which is exactly how I see you. All that choice and possibilities are great for us geeks, so is OS and FSF, but the average user doesn't care about gnome vs kde vs xfce and they don't care about compiling kernels or being able to browse the code. (Even you haven't!!!) They actually have a life that is NOT the computer and they just want to send an email and talk to their family at home, send them pictures and read something interesting online... and that is what apple has obviously delivered, otherwise they wouldn't have the success they currently have.<p>So it doesn't matter what PG or whoever says, apple's success has proven them all wrong and I can only say I am thankful for the bit of competition and a few neat gadgets that apple delivered.<p>You are just a troll.",1319942156
