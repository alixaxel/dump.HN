But like any hobby it will get old eventually, so it doesn't surprise me so many are abandoned.<p>The blogs that seem to be successful over the long run are either news-aggregation type affairs, where it's mostly just links with a pithy joke or two thrown in, or they're single subject blogs with multiple people sharing the load.

3101154,story,,,20,4,dotmatrix,"The Untold Story of Chegg PT 1",,"My name is Ousama Haffar and I was one of the early guys at Chegg.<p>While Chegg isn't a Zynga or a Facebook story that attracts the oohs and ahhs of Silicon Valley, I would love to share a bit with you about what I learned about entrepreneurship and being scrappy during my time at Chegg as founding member of the team from 2006-2010 and how we went from $0 to over $100M in revenue.<p>Chegg originally start its life as a college classified site that attracted 60,000 students across the country to buy and sell your everyday college type items; t-shirts, mini fridges, old beat up Pontiacs, etc.  Our team was about 5-7 people, mostly engineers and I focused mostly on product, marketing and whatever odd jobs that needed a hand.<p>In our early days we attracted a couple hundred thousand visitors to our website each month, mostly buy building a campus marketing team and doing your traditional marketing. We would give away pizzas, flyer in dorms work with student organizations to create swap meets at the end of the semester and even created a textbook exchange.<p>Well, back in 2006 the name of the game in Sillicon Valley was user generated content and eyeballs. We dreamed of building this vibrant and massive classifieds business that could be monetized by advertising in each vertical in the already $200BN college market. In reality, we hit the same problem most marketplaces hit, the good ole' 80-20 rule.  Users seemed to love browsing the site but never felt like posting items for sale. And as a result we hit a growth ceiling.  Well, back in 06 and 07 with Facebook's popularity storming off and sites like Youtube changing the world, most web startups felt most strongly about generating users, and well when your user growth hits a wall...you're in trouble.  So we did what any startup with a million bucks in the bank looking for quick fix to growth problems would do, Marketing Promotions.<p>So, me being the marketing/product guy thought hmmm...what would college students want that would make them tell all their friends and magically grow our user numbers overnight? In 2007 that answer was the hottest item on the market, the Nintendo Wii. So with a couple thousand bucks in hand and a skill for finding sellers of the hottest gift on the planet we went to work and secured a supply of 6 Wiis.  Here comes the kicker, we planed a promotion to sell them for the insanely low price of $99 on our wonderful classifieds website and promote it using Deals of America, Fat Wallet and sending an email to our user base.<p>What happened was predictable, but nevertheless exciting. A fresh line of oxygen and the beginning of my misery.  Within an hour after launching our promotion the website came to a standstill, our server couldn't handle the traffic and our best case scenario turned into a nightmare.  Meanwhile, some college hackers thought it would be fun to hit our site with a D.O.S and as soon as we were up and attracting hundreds of thousands of users  we were down and scrambling to get it back up and running.  The pure exhilaration of seeing an idea become an instant hit to turning away tens of thousands of users was just a taste of the the roller coaster of emotions I would experience over the next 3 years at Chegg.<p>We finally got the site back up and running and within seconds the Wiis sold out. We thought to ourselves wow, our ""Hatch of the day"" as we called the promotion was a mega hit and it's time for us to start repeating it day in and day out.  With a $50,000 budget I went to Frys, scowered amazon and found the most popular college items of the day and loaded a back room with marketing inventory for our daily deal sales.  Within the week the website seemed like a vibrantly growing community, the word was quickly spreading and our story to investors seemed bright and optimistic, the day was saved thanks to the Hatch of the Day, or was it...<p>Part 1 of 6",1318384269

3101152,comment,3101087,3101087,5,0,51Cards,,,"Right off this comment gave me pause in the review:<p>""Its kind of incredible when you think about it. Competing phone-makers have had more than a year (a lot more considering the leaked photos of the iPhone 4 prior to its release) to best this design, and yet no one really has. As frustrating as it is to say this, no other phone on the market comes close to this level of craftsmanship, materials, or considered design.""<p>This is a very personally subjective statement.  To me the phone's design is a brick with rounded corners, I was rather disappointed when it launched.  I've never really thought there was a lot of 'design' to the iPhone 4.  I agree it's clean but really, is there much to 'best' design wise?  I personally find it ergonomically uncomfortable and awkward.<p>Interesting he then follows with: ""The iPhone 4S may not be the most resilient phone in the world (Ive broken two original iPhone 4s in accidental drops), but it probably is the most beautiful.""<p>Perhaps other phone designers haven't copied it because glass front and back and an exposed antenna aren't things that they might want to copy?  The fact that the reviewer has broken two only adds to that.<p>I'm sure everyone thinks differently on this subject but that's exactly my point... that a comment like this really doesn't belong in what should be a generally objective review.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  The rest of the review I thought was well done though.<p>Edit, and yes, I fully expect the Karma hit for criticizing a design aspect of an Apple product. :)  Just my 2c.",1318384228

3101090,comment,3099875,3100641,2,0,kposehn,,,"Hi Matt, thanks for chiming on on this thread.<p>From your reply, I understand that your primary issue is indeed with scaling any manner of support issues. As I understand it, the current thinking at Google is to seek automated solutions over technical to reduce costs and improve issue volume handling. With that in mind, is there a system of triggers that can flag issues for manual review or intervention instead of being handled completely automatically?<p>I think the majority of issues that have people up in arms aren't really that big, but there are the exceptions. Instead of monitoring G+/Twitter/etc., there could instead be a series of internal checks that look for particular criteria:<p>1. Age of campaign/ad - was it super old and not really applicable or not even running much budget? It may be worth a lighter hand than a complete ban because it isn't indicative of a trend or pattern on the part of the advertiser.<p>2. Amount of impressions/clicks/spend over time - what is the overall severity based on actual impact? Are users actively clicking on the ad, returning to the site and continuing to use it? As each click and therefore organic link is logged, it would be good to cross reference them and go ""well, this site raises flags but has high return-user rates and decent sentiment in organic results""<p>3. Traffic vs. Content ratio - does the site have fairly thin content that still gets dramatic numbers of users? Tying in with #2, it basically can help tell if a site is offering something thin on content but highly unique and/or valuable. If people are using it, they may be on to something that the QS algorithm misses.<p>The one thing I'd love to see is just a little bit more of a verbose notification or warning for the people that get hit. While many only have themselves to blame, many want to make sure they stay on the right side and any chance they have to do so is of great benefit. Then again, it is also important to not give to much information to the black-hatters that just make use of it to get even better at gaming the system.<p>These are just thoughts, but it has long been on my mind considering the metric ass-ton I've run through AdWords for myself and clients over the years. Hope this helps spark a few ideas :)",1318382528
