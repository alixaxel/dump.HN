(I'm not trying to ignore your comment, there are just many things that I don't feel relate very much to mine. Plus, I've always been pretty bad at reading comprehension :))<p>So yeah, I'm not sure how this is a red herring. The point is that we take a lot of things for granted and even if each layer of how it gets to work the way it does makes sense, there's always a leap of faith to accept it will work at high speed/volume/scale.<p>It might sound extremely naive but another way I look at it is that it's intriguing to see that all of this has been built by human beings. The same kind of beings that make silly mistakes, forget to buy milk, enjoy Jersey Shore Sure it's built upon centuries of previous results and research, but it still ends up coming from one guy's brain at some point. There's such a gap between the mundane things we do (i.e. mainly the things for our survival) and all the technology and science<p>For the electronic-related examples, that means we've been able to ride the speed of light extremely well, while also building components on a microscopic scale.

3118803,story,,,10,20,mikeatl,"Need Feedback on Google Panda Hit Site - Out of Ideas",,"Hi everyone. First time poster, long time reader but I could really use some honest feedback from knowledgeable people and forums just don't cut it. I have a 3 year old niche hobby site (http://goo.gl/aNwGy) that has become well established as a top 2 or 3 resource within my industry. We have more unique, expert curated content written on a daily basis then any other site in our industry, and are the only site in our niche that is syndicated through Google News. I've put a lot of money into hiring experts to write high quality content and have never engaged in any black hat SEO practices.  Up until late February of this year this practice had paid off and was reflected in the steady Google search traffic growth we'd enjoyed throughout our first 2 1/2 years.<p>Then Panda hit and we dropped from about 3,000 unique visitors per day down to about 2,000 per day. Another month later we dropped to 1,400 visitors per day. I removed what little thin content I could find and kept on the best I could.<p>I purchased two competing sites and merged them into my main site, adding several more expert authors, a podcast, and a well known forum in the process. Thanks to this my core domain's Google search traffic slowly but surely returned. As of last week it was back up to about 2,500 unique visitors per day.  Then the latest ""Minor"" Panda tweak on Oct 13th/14th hit late last week and my traffic dropped back down to 1700 visitors per day. Even before that happened I was being outranked by vastly inferior sites all across the board thanks to most all the large retailers within my niche having the budget to purchase large amounts of links.<p>So here's the deal, I'm just at a loss as to what to do now. I've tried to be as objective as I possibly can but it just doesn't make any sense. I literally have the best overall content in my industry. My writing staff include legitimate experts, including a former MLB All-Star, a Hall of Fame recognized Author, and a lot of lesser known, but very knowledgeable (and well known within my industry) college educated bloggers and enthusiasts. But I'm getting beaten by thin ecommerce sites who have insane amounts of paid links, various exact match domain cookie cutter sites, and lesser information sites which again engage heavily in link buying.<p>This seems completely counter to what Google was trying to achieve with the Panda update. I've done tons of reading on the specifics of the update since being hit in February and have hired several SEO experts to give me feedback on my own analysis as well as to perform their own research. We've made some small changes here and there and optimized the speed of the site. Everyone has confirmed that I have the best link profile - its legitimately natural and features links from all the top industry authority sites as well as many mainstream media outlets and everything in between. However somehow I continue to get my ass kicked by 1 dimensional sites which have nothing but paid and reciprocal links, and have no unique content that adds value for visitors. So there's only so much we've been able to change.<p>Am I really an unintended casualty of the Panda Algorithm (and its subsequent updates)? Or am I blind to one or more serious issues that make this ongoing Google ass kicking justifiable and well deserved? Either way any advice on what to do next would be sincerely appreciated. I'm a young guy with two kids and depend on my online business to pay the bills.<p>Thanks guys...<p>I just find it hard to believe that the right answer here is to cut my content budget out and go and use it to buy links everywhere - but that is exactly what Google has rewarding within my niche since late February.",1318813011

It's exactly how I feel.<p>I'm about to graduate, and other than the risk factor I don't see the advantage of working at a large company over a smaller one or starting your own. I can understand how lack of business experience and egregious student loan debt can keep a recent grad from taking fewer risks, but this would be the time to do it.

I must admit it is starting to grow on me.<p>When I first used Gnome 3 (back when it was first released) I hated it; it was buggy and the whole concept of gnome-shell seemed flawed.  Now its seems many of the bugs have been worked out and the usability improvements of gnome-shell is starting to show.  Gnome 3 is still far from perfect and there are still A LOT of things missing that I had grown to rely on from classic Gnome (like being able to arrange my panels) but Gnome 3 seems to be progressing and I have high hopes for its future.<p>I am less hopeful for the future of Unity frankly because it has so many bad ideas built in to it.

In a world with less python, there's so much pain involved on a regular basis setting up software like ROOT, switching between libraries of FFTs or plot libraries, installing Octave or Matlab to work nice with some bash script and dealing with OS discrepancies in getting someone else's code to run.

There's a general feeling (which I've experienced in many of my interactions with non-scientific Python programmers) that the folks working on pure Python don't really ""get"" the scientific Python community. We would all understand each other better if the PyPy folks or the Python core developers spent a year, say, working at Enthought on scientific Python consulting projects or working on a core project that uses NumPy/SciPy like scikit-learn, matplotlib, statsmodels, theano, pandas, or many, many others. A small annoyance but having a matrix multiplication infix operator would actually be a huge help but the idea has met a great deal of resistance from core Python as being ""too domain specific"". It strikes me as very short-sighted as I think Python is well-poised to make waves in the data analysis, statistics, and high performance computing ecosystem. Having used Python to build large systems for financial applications, I am acutely aware of how Python is being used in that industry and some of the ways that it needs to adapt to be more relevant. So bravo, Travis, for speaking up!<p>Also, his point that Cython (<a href=""http://cython.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cython.org</a>) tends to be ignored in the broader discussion about performance computing in Python is especially flagrant when you consider how it's revolutionized the way that scipythonistas (myself included) speed up their code over the last 2-3 years.",1318810594
