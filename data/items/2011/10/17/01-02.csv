3118914,comment,3118125,3118125,3,0,mrinterweb,,,"Personally, I really prefer Unity to classic Gnome. Unity is the best desktop experience I have had. I've been using it since 11.04 out. Unity had some rough edges when it was first released, but a lot of that has been ironed out. I really like the direction Unity is going. I feel that it uses space in a more intelligent way. I am very glad that Canonical has taken the initiative to build a better desktop environment. Many people don't like change, and I feel that is the category that many of the people criticizing Unity fall into. I do agree that Unity is not as easily customizable as I would expect, but again, I enjoy most of the decisions that comprise Unity.",1318816692

However, this slideshow was not effective at communicating anything to me. At some point during the second half of this ""presentation"" each slide seemed to have some vague phrase or sentence that was followed by 3-5 screenshots with no explanation of what the relationship was to the context the screenshot was given in -- I started to wonder if substituting those screenshots with random ones would have any impact on the value of the presentation.<p>If anything, I think the awful slideshow ""player"" UI on this website did a better job at explaining the lack of ""invisible design"" than the slideshow did. I spent almost a minute trying to find a play button, because from the look of the UI I was expecting a movie.

The mentality seems to be that developers should also focus as admins/ops.  Surely nothing will go wrong on a weekend after a developer has already put in an 80 hour week, right?<p>From my experience, sys admins are important.  If you are doing anything of scale, knowledge on how to setup, tweak, and debug systems is critical.  It is helpful if the admins can stretch a bit into the app layer, just as it is helpful for developers to be able to stretch a bit into the systems layer, problems come up and knowledge of the parts helps.<p>As an engineer that can also setup systems for scale, I know my limits and really appreciate help from and learning things from good sysadmins.",1318816304

You then find out that they have been interviewing, your loyalty is shaken and you know that the employer can fire you within the trial period which makes the feeling worst.<p>New applicants will not know that the position was filled and get formally rejected if they are not significantly better than you.

Like when I include a library, on some level I'm assuming it will really function the way the API suggests. But I don't have to take that on faith; I can read through the code, and see what it's actually doing. The code itself is an abstraction of something else, but if I take the time, I can eventually reduce it to an understanding of what's happening on a transistor level. I can't see what's happening in the CPU, but I can understand it.<p>I can't hold the whole model of my code at a transistor level in my head, but that's the power of abstraction. I understand what's happening on each level on some scale, I understand how the levels interface with each other, so ipso facto I <i>do</i> understand the system as a whole. If it doesn't behave the way I expect, I can use that knowledge figure out why, whether it's because I made the wrong call or because there's a wire disconnected on my motherboard.

Companies that routinely take advantage of their employees don't stick around forever.

Ron Conway commands great personal loyalty.  (And goes the extra yard for his firms)  Many of the legends of Silicon Valley are mentors to large groups of people.  Not everyone acts selfishly.

I said of myself that I am a php developer because I actively use it on a weekly basis and it helps me make a fair amount of money on the side while others argue about which is worse between php and the devil. I also use quite a few other languages, mainly at my job.<p>> Why not just be a ""developer"" who uses the right tool for the job?<p>That's exactly what I do, and there are a few cases where php is the right tool. When someone tries to use php in other situations and complains that it sucks at it, it just shows how poorly he chose his tool.<p>> And your feeling won't get hurt when people point out how horrible php is<p>Where have you read anything like that ? My feeling aren't hurt at all, I'm just saying his remark is stupid, plain and simple. File uploading in php is no more (or no less) of a threat than in other languages, you just have to know what you are doing, that's what I posted about, not some ""php is horrible"" that you imagined reading.<p>> When you learn other languages, you will find out that you have to know something well to truly hate it properly.<p>That is exactly my point that you missed, given his remark on file uploading (the only thing he mentioned and that I commented on), he doesn't know php well. Thus he should abstain from trying to take a shot at it in a product description page, especially since - given php popularity - a lot of his potential users are using it.",1318814312
