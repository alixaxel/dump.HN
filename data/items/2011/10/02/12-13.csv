AdFree requires root access, but the rest don't.<p><pre><code>  AdFree        - Blocks advertising domains in /etc/hosts\n  AutoGuard     - Video/audio records my car journeys in case I get in an accident\n  BackTrack     - Tells you the direction and distance to a location you previously\n                  saved, without using Internet access.\n  K-9 Mail      - Superb IMAP client. Much better than the stock app\n  APG           - PGP app, which integrates with K-9 Mail\n  Kik Messenger - Like Blackberrys BBM, but works on Android/iPhone/Windows phone\n  TextSecure    - Adds public key crypto to SMS storage, and also to transmission\n                  if both ends are using it.\n  Prey          - Will allow me to track my phone if it gets nicked.\n  RedPhone      - Encrypted phone calls</code></pre>",1317560340

I've read a few of Ted's posts, and while he's smart and a good communicator, he is extremely narrow minded. I'm sure he has his own way of doing stuff, and can implement like a machine using his own narrow toolset, great. No-one can learn to use every tool, and some can just be a giant time-sink (<i>cough</i> Google AppEngine). But that doesn't mean that everyone who uses a different toolset is a complete tool.<p>One minute, he's ripping into Tornado, because it's under-engineered. Then he thinks Twisted is over-engineered. Next, Node.js is crap, because it doesn't do things <i>his</i> way. Then there's NoSQL, which he hates, because it's not MySQL. No idea what he thinks of PostGres, he probably thinks it's got too many features.<p>Point 1: A Scalability Disaster Waiting to Happen. No, node.js is not a scalability disaster, and even if it is, doesn't Ted advise developers not to worry about scalability as they are only going to get ~3 long-term users in the first year?<p>Point 2: Node Punishes Developers Because it Disobeys the Unix. Um, you can put it behind nginx, and that buys you a lot of ""separation of concerns"". Honestly, he mostly seems to be insulting node.js programmers, suggesting that they <i>don't</i> bother to create full production systems - quote ""let's be honest with ourselves here, if you're a Node developer, you are probably serving the application directly from Node, running in a screen session under your account."" This seems to be really the core of his concerns - Node is easy for one guy to setup a working website. Isn't that a good thing?<p>Point 3: It's Fucking JavaScript. Which I guess is good if you are a JS expert.<p>He swings between two extremes - everyone using simpler tools than him is a retard who needs to man up and learn to program, and everyone using more dangerous tools should stop beating their chest and actually implement (premature optimization, guys!) In the case of node.js, he seems to believe both points, which I suspect is because he just doesn't like the toolset.",1317558656

Each of us needs to assess how best to spend our time in order to maximize our results, both in quantity and quality. If people think that spending fifty percent of their time writing tests maximizes their resultsokay for them. Im sure thats not true for meId rather spend that time thinking about my problem. Im certain that, for me, this produces better solutions, with fewer defects, than any other use of my time. A bad design with a complete test suite is still a bad design.<p>He said something on the similar lines about development on CLR:<p>Fogus: Clojure was once in parallel development on both the JVM and the CLR, why did you eventually decide to focus in on the former? Hickey: I got tired of doing everything twice, and wanted instead to do twice as much.<p>His explanation on both fronts boil down to he doesn't find it(TDD and CLR/JVM parallel development) a worthy investment of time, given there are only so many hours in a day.<p>I don't understand why TDD advocates get all worked up when someone says TDD doesn't work from them. Well, if TDD is silver bullet of software development, they should be delighted that the ignorant singletons fail to see it and they have an edge over the fools.<p>These reactions remind of this:<p>You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in.

When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.  Robert M.

3062651,comment,3062490,3062490,16,0,vsl2,,,"Given the past experience with the 2004 tax holiday (little economic investment effect), the current proposal should be rejected.  And to allow another tax holiday only sets the expectations that additional ones can be lobbyed for in the future, meaning these companies will again hoard foreign profits offshore in hopes of repeating this request again and again and thereby depriving the government of timely tax revenue.<p>This is a quite blatant attempt by these companies to game the tax system for their own (not public) benefit.  As others have stated, these companies obviously held the foreign profits abroad hoping to have/create this type of lower tax opportunity to bring back those profits.<p>However, I don't blame these corporations for trying this - corporations' jobs are to make and keep as much money as possible, mostly in response to shareholders' desires for greatest economic returns.  Anyone who owns stock in Apple and Google is a part of the reason for this attempt.  If this tactic works, the market value of Apple and Google will increase and isn't that what essentially all shareholders want?  Frankly, if these companies voluntarily paid all taxes without trying to find ways to minimize them, most shareholders will be furious at management.<p>Government, through its various corporate/tax laws, sets the limitations on what is permissible and not for corporations, and it hopefully tries to do it in the way that maximizes overall public benefit (balance regulation against enough corporate freedom to incentivize economic growth).  The problem I see is that special interest groups have disproportionate power through buying influence.  In order to prevent recurring instances of this same situations, the government should firmly show that it will not grant tax holidays now or in the future (then maybe companies will bring foreign profits back right away to the US, thereby paying taxes on time and maybe hopefully spurring economic investment).<p>My Conclusion: Companies (at least public companies) aren't wrong to try to maximize their value in every way within the controlled environment created by governments.  The government should act in the way to incentive corporate actions in the best interests of the public (whether it be more tax dollars or economic growth or another objective).   Just say no to the tax holiday.",1317557330
