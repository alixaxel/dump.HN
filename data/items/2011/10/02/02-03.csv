3061886,comment,3061731,3061794,4,0,blendergasket,,,"I think of this like horsetails in my Mom's garden. My mom's garden is shot through with horsetails, but it's really all one horsetail connected by a single, massive rhizome. If you pull up one horsetail stem it won't do a thing to the horsetail as a whole. If you pull up 100 horsetail branches the horsetail might be slightly weakened, but it'll come back. These things've been around since the time of the dinosaurs. If she wants a garden without horsetails she'll have to get a backhoe and uproot the whole thing, then plant a new garden. The horsetails will come back eventually, then she'll have to do it again, but for a little while she'll have a nice clean garden.<p>There is a fundamental sickness in the system. A giant, rhizomic structure of venality and corruption that has undercut and basically replaced the system I, as an American, have been raised to believe is the proper form of government, with a government where all activity is dictated by power wielding corporate interests. Greed has become the dominant ideology; all branches of government and the media have become subsumed by it. A just and functional society is not and will never be an emergent property of a greed-based system.",1317524116

If we replace ""South American gold mine"" with ""the release of the iPhone"" or ""the creation of Google"" perhaps my point is clearer - i.e. the creation of value should have economic impacts. Even in a fiat currency situation, the discovery of a massive South American gold mine would have an economic impact as someone now has access to more valuable resources than they did previously.<p>Now, if the currency was based on a commodity that has no value, then maybe your argument makes some sense, but precious metals were chosen specifically because they are valued irrespective of their role in currency.

The 2008 investigation concluded that ""there [were] no indications of oil & gas related impacts to [Markham's] water well."" It was also concluded that the water well of Weld County landowner Renee McClure, also featured in the film, contained naturally occurring biogenic methane not related to oil and gas activity in the area.[11] On the other hand, Dr. Anthony Ingraffea, the D. C. Baum Professor of Engineering at Cornell University, whose research has involved fracture mechanics for more than 30 years, has said that drilling and hydraulic fracturing can liberate biogenic natural gas into a fresh water aquifer. Thus, just because gas is biogenic does not necessarily indicate that it reached a well by natural means. [12]<p>""The COGCC concluded that a well belonging to Weld County landowner Aimee Ellsworth, also featured in the film, contained thermogenic methane that was attributable to oil and gas activity in the area. The report states that Mrs. Ellsworth and an operator in the area had reached a settlement in that case.[9]<p>Note that ""oil and gas activity"" doesn't imply fracking wells.",1317522774

If you're saying that yes, the dividend treatment may save them on taxes (or at least be no worse) than other approaches, we agree.<p>For employees who might have to exercise vested nonqualified options to collect the dividend, other ordinary income taxes may apply... but shares that were early enough could still be in a dividend-is-more-than-all-exercise-and-tax-costs situation, again making the participation a riskless no-brainer... in fact helping them set an earlier start date for future capital-gains calculations.<p>If they're not in the no-brainer situation, they'd have to decide whether the dividend and early-holding-period-start was worth the cost/risk of converting to actual equity. That's a matter of tax law and risk-affinity... any dilemmas created by having a new range of possible choices aren't a knock against the offer of a dividend.",1317522616
