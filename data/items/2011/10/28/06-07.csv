You occasionally see a thoughtful comment expressing an unpopular sentiment get downvoted, but not often and usually not for long.<p>For groupthink to be a serious threat, it's not simply enough to have the top-rated posts express a given view, you also have to have contrarian views be buried.  I don't think that a group of people that pg would be likely to pick would  a) upvote all the same things, or b) downvote posts they disagree with.  As the supervoter bit would be passed to people who voted in generally the same way as a reasonable number of the superusers, it would be unlikely that people who downvoted out of disagreement would get the bit.  Further, I think there's a wide enough range of views amongst the people pg would likely select to minimize the likelihood of a single viewpoint gaining dominance.<p>There's enough contrarianism built into the basic personality of most HNers that I think we'd be fine.",1319784168

Maybe the false positive rate is quite high but it's difficult to say until Brian Krebs publishes some details on how the list was generated.<p>From the Team Cymru page:<p><i>A recent blog post appeared to draw the unsubstantiated conclusion that more than 760 organizations were compromised with some of the same resources used to hit RSA earlier this year. Team Cymru was one of the organizations named in the posting.<p>We have no evidence of compromise related to incidents at RSA or anywhere else. The source of the report, and those who revealed and posted it, didn't take the time to contact us, or to share incident details with us. Thus we are unable to investigate further. We hope that those who gathered this data will responsibly disclose it to the potential victims.<p>Please note that without more details on the methodology used to determine the list of organizations, and a scientific review of the same, it's not safe to assume that an entry on the list means either ""victim"" or ""false positive"".

Maybe that's because he really only ever ran the one company, and so never really became personally acquainted with its other uses. Certainly though among his fiscal peers though? So that's strange...<p>Wealth is inextricably tied to power. Everyone knows this, or has heard it, but I guess many often don't reason about what it means? Gates seems to be saying that there isn't a big difference between being worth 60 million and being worth 60 billion, because hamburgers taste the same, after all. That's all well and good if wealth is all about buying things, which it basically is for about 99,999 out of 100,000 people at least, but for that one person it definitely isn't. Someone worth 60 billion is at least 1000x more powerful and has 1000x greater impact in how he goes about wielding his power than the person worth 60 million. He is in many respects equivalent to 1000 people worth 60 million each, doing their thing, and perhaps more so since he can more easily strive toward a purpose or calling in a way that 1000 people couldn't, with committees and whatever else. So he's completely wrong about that (although he's the billionaire and I'm certainly not, so perhaps I should just defer to his judgment :-)<p>Which sort of brings up the other thing he said, which is that absolute poverty relative to historical values is decreasing, especially in the developing world at the moment, and that there are a few very rich and well-connected individuals isn't such a problem, to the extent that they don't corrupt the political system. But of course they <i>do</i> corrupt the political system. The entire problem with massively unequal distribution of wealth isn't that you get to live in a nice house on the water while for whatever reason someone else has to live in a one-room flat.

3167238,comment,3165299,3165918,4,0,kb101,,,"With all due respect, ""worth more separate"" is a destructive business philosophy.  Unless your line of business is buying up other companies, building up value, and spinning them off.<p>Be that as it may, the differences between IBM and HP are stark in this instance.  I-B-M: it stands for International Business Machines.  Services to industry are their roots, and those roots run deep.  Whether in the form of census punchcards in the 1890s, or ballistics calculations for the military, or the creation of the SABRE booking system, or the creation of relational databases... the list goes on and on and on, but the point is that IBM has never strayed from its roots.  It is a business services company.<p>Upon hitting a rough patch in the early nineties, IBM took radical steps to revive its profits; one of these steps was the introduction and promotion of the business-oriented Thinkpad brand, which was a huge success and helped bring the firm back to health.  But that did not make IBM into a PC company any more than the success of the XBox makes Microsoft a gaming company.<p>After nurturing the brand and working gradually over time with a Chinese supplier to offshore production, the last step (at that point almost a formality) was taken and the brand ""Thinkpad"" was transitioned to Lenovo ownership.  IBM continues to be a company providing services to government and industry, as it has since its founding.<p>HP, on the other hand, is a company whose roots are in technical instrumentation and excellence in test equipment.  Over time, this resulted in innovations such as the HP 9100A, the familiar tried-and-true HP calculator line, its superb printers, and so on... all outgrowths of HP's core roots in engineering and instrumentation.<p>The spinoff of Agilent was like HP cutting off its right arm.  To add insult to injury, the company was forced to digest the Compaq acquisition at the same time.  Still, the core mission of creating excellent electronic machines survived and HP is in a dominant position when it comes to providing reliable hardware in the form of computers, servers, printers from laserjets to industrial presses, networking, etc.<p><i>With that as a basis</i>, the move into consulting services and enterprise software makes sense, but a move as unforgivably idiotic as removing the PC business would cut the very legs out from under the business, regardless of what some P/E number on a spreadsheet says.  Why would an enterprise come to HP for consulting when it cannot provide a package of desktops, servers, and software?  That is HP's mission as it is configured now, with Agilent gone its separate way.  It makes sense to push aggressively into new territory, but not to destroy the foundation of the business at the same time.<p>Apotheker brought no innovative thinking to HP; he merely sought to remake the company in his image and transform it into the SAP that not even SAP would let him create.  Whether or not that vision, taken in the abstract, is one worth pursuing is debatable to begin with-- but hacking HP into bits to force it to fit that vision is madness, and the plummeting stock price that you seem to measure value by reflected the market's view of this insanity.<p>Why is there any need to ""bleed heavily""?  The PC division is the foundation of the entire edifice.  It may not be sexy and it may not fit your metrics-based notion of company value, but it holds up the business and it is <i>number 1 in the world</i> and <i>profitable</i>.  That is a strength to leverage, not a ""drag"".<p>HP is finally in a position to do exactly what Meg Whitman said it needs to do today: focus on excellence. <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d6a4b220-00d8-11e1-930b-00144feabdc0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d6a4b220-00d8-11e1-930b-00144feabd...</a>",1319782951

The first is that anyone remains unconvinced that vinyl has <i>any redeeming technical aspects whatsoever,</i> other than the touchy-feely emotional stuff, and self-deception.<p>The second is that the music you referenced is so unashamedly <i>digital,</i> that the notion of purchasing it on a vinyl record is like buying a copy of Angry Birds printed on tree bark.<p>A 256 kbps AAC file (as sold by iTunes) is so very nearly transparent, only a small fraction of 1 percent of people would be able to identify the vanishingly minute differences. The difference is so small, it would be comprehensively outweighed by <i>meaningful</i> factors such as your choice of speakers, the shape of your room, and the presence of any ambient noise.<p>Whereas vinyl has crackle (unless you're playing a pristine copy in a dust-free environment), clicks, pops, rumble, wow distortion, and intentionally limited dynamic and tonal range. Fidelity progressively reduces as you move to the inner grooves, and high frequencies are literally scratched away as the stylus scrapes past -- every time you play a vinyl, it will sound poorer than the last. You can mitigate some of these problems, but generally at great effort or expense.<p>Of course, to make that music <i>useful</i>, you'll need to rip it back into your computer. You'd have to be <i>mentally ill</i> to believe that a [Lossless > AAC-256 > Lossless] conversion is more detrimental than [Lossless > equalisation > analogue mastering > lathe cutting > vinyl stamping > stylus scraping > pre-amplification > ADC > Lossless].",1319782324
