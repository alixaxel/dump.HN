It's critical that any web designer knows enough about HTML/CSS to know the limitations of the medium and what they can design but not necessarily enough to code it.<p>I think ideally, both the designer and frontend developer should be capable of slicing up a PSD. I'm a frontend developer, and I prefer to do that myself so I can save things in the optimal sizes and filetypes for my workflow. If the designer does it, they will be creating slices based on their opinion of how the website should be coded.<p>I don't think the responsibility for JavaScript is a gray area at all, it falls on the developer. It becomes a gray area when you remove one of the pieces of the  puzzle, the frontend developer.<p>I also don't think your photographer analogy is fair. A photographers job can be defined as a person who takes photos. A designers job is most often defined as someone who creates designs.<p>It sounds like you're more of a backend developer, wanting to use a designer as a designer and frontend developer.

At any rate, what they describe is very interesting: that blast injury leads to disruption of cell-cell adhesion.[1] If so, perhaps the disruption of integrins is the key lesion. The second paper shows that there could also be a biological basis for the post-blast vasospasm, too.[2]<p>We know that cell-cell adhesion molecules are part of larger complexes that are hugely important in cellular processes from promoting inflammation to cancer suppression (or, in its disregulation, metastasis <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial-mesenchymal_transition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial-mesenchymal_transiti...</a> ).<p>If the hypothesis--that blast injury has an important biological component--is true, then we're dealing with a biological basis for neurological disease after blast, instead of just a purely mechanical basis for disease. Unlike purely mechanical disruption, the biological part of the injury is potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention; and that's just what they've trialed with their ROCK inhibitor. I believe that's from paper #1.<p>This same inhibitor appears to ameliorate the blast-related sequelae on the cerebral vascular system as well, which I believe is from paper #2.<p>This is my interpretation based on the Gazette article, but I haven't yet read the papers themselves.<p>1.

The <i>appellation d'origine contrle</i> is not an indicator of quality, but a sort of family (both in taste and location of production, and named after the regional location, because it has a critical influence on flavor) which gets assessed by professionals so you can identify wines without actually opening the bottle. If I'm at the store and I see a Haut-Mdoc, I have some high probability of liking it more compared to a Mdoc, because I like tannic wines, and Haut-Mdoc show more of a bias towards tannin. That does not mean that one is of higher standard (and there are some Haut-Mdoc which actually taste like crap).<p>What might create a link with quality is that some flavors are quite strong and can take time to get used to, combined with subtle tones, and may require some technique to appreciate. You start with very raw, basic wines, then you grow up an ability to appreciate the more subtle ones, like you would go from appreciating child paintings and grow on to like Matisse.<p>Then there is each one's unique taste: there are some very tasteful Sauterne wines, but I absolutely loathe sweet wines, so I can't for the life of me come anywhere near drinking them.",1320006477

An ordinary genius is a fellow that you and I would be just as good as, if we were only many times better. There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is different with the magicians. They are, to use mathematical jargon, in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents and purposes incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely dark. They seldom, if ever, have students because they cannot be emulated and it must be terribly frustrating for a brilliant young mind to cope with the mysterious ways in which the magicians mind works. Richard Feynman is a magician of the highest caliber.</i>",1320005747

I'll post again when we rewrite it later today.<p>We've had customers and revenue since day 0, and since we're three technical cofounders, we have largely (and, I now see, mistakenly) focused on building our platform as quickly and thoroughly as possible, to the expense of everything else.  Our plan was purely serial:  focus on the tech first, then build an image and a brand[1] later.<p>The whole reason we applied to YC was to learn how to better communicate what we do.  A YC S11 founder made it clear to me that YC could help us to fix our communication problems before they became problems, and only then did I apply.  He said YC could help us learn how to communicate to three audiences:  investors, the press, and customers.  I give us a F, F, and C- for those respective audiences.  We will get to A, A, A.<p>[1]: Frankly, we're not even happy with the name ""Schmetrics"", now that we know how hard it is for people to pronounce and spell.",1320004897
