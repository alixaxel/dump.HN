When I see a project hosted on SourceForge I only click the link with a heavy sigh.<p>Why do I ""hate"" SourceForge? It's because they got complacent, and because they never changed. It was like SourceForge was more important than you and you better not forget it. How many clicks was it to do something as simple as set up a new project? How many forms and emails do you need to fill out or reply to? How annoying was the distribution model, or how ugly was a project page? All these things were important but nobody cared.<p>That Github was able to turn around block and report so quickly is evidence that they get it, they're listening, and they aren't afraid to hustle and do what's right. Nothing is hard on Github. It is as easy as it should be. I gladly spend money on Github every month. Sourceforge couldn't pay me to use it.",1307152753

2618647,comment,2618316,2618611,8,0,barrkel,,,"See now, the IOI problem sets do emphasize algorithmic thinking - I think they're marginally better than Project Euler problems - but again, it's very low-level stuff. It must be, in order to have a handful of problems that can be tackled in a couple of hours or so.<p>I happen to believe that taste in crafting of program structure and selection of appropriate abstractions is more important than algorithmic acuity for most modern programming. Computational geometry, graph theoretical manipulations, dynamic programming and so on certainly have their uses, but they are usually a small core of something and not reimplemented often. Maintainable programs are a bigger issue IMO; and an excess of focus on the finer details of computational algorithms doesn't necessarily solve that issue.<p>I rather think it can hamper the goal. Really efficient algorithms often ""break the rules"", exploiting commonalities or attributes that cross abstraction boundaries. Take an ultra-simple example: finding the index of a (possibly missing) element in an unsorted array with a linear search. The fastest in-order sequential algorithm is to add the element being searched for to the end of the array, and then iterate through the array and halt when the element is found. This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done over a more simple search because it removes the need for a termination condition test (index in array less than length of array) on the search loop. But it also breaks other things; it won't work in the presence of threads, and it's surprising that a search operation is not a read-only operation. Adding may need a memory reallocation; if the array is large and the growth algorithm is geometric (which it should be), then it could very surprisingly cause an OOM. Sure, you can get around this by pre-allocating the required slot, and detecting multiple threads etc., but now you've made things more complicated and harder to maintain in the search for the most efficient algorithm. The goal of efficiency can cause more assumptions to be made or pre-conditions required, and for these assumptions / pre-conditions to leak across abstraction boundaries, ultimately making maintenance changes have multiplicative rather than additive complexity costs.<p>So I think it's fine to target big-O algorithmic costs when it makes sense and doesn't contort the software architecture too much, but applying an excess of problem insight can work against better architecture. Premature optimization, as tautologically as ever, is premature.<p>(I write as someone self-taught who competed in IOI etc. The problems sets were fun, but I wasn't under any illusions that I was learning a whole lot. Using recursion and branch pruning to solve combinatorial search problems is a distraction when you're better off looking at the bigger picture, dare I say it, the business picture.)",1307151861

2618645,comment,2617268,2617268,1,0,gliese1337,,,"As seems to be common, I had my first exposure to programming through BASIC, looking at programs I got from my older sister's friends or copied out of old magazines. My 7-year-old mind didn't quite grok the difference between psuedo-code and real code, though (for which I blame the BASIC language).\nThen LEGO started selling the RCX; finding LEGO's graphical programming environment overly constricting, I learned NQC, which lead to real C and a little bit of FORTH to program robots. That path eventually exposed to the basics of neural networks and some other basic ML systems.\nThen I got frustrated with not being able to make my parents' Windows desktop do cool things like my robots could, so I discovered Webmonkey (rest in peace) and taught myself JavaScript and Perl over a couple of weekends, and started writing all kinds of silly DHTML games and scientific command line calculators and file compressors / encrypters.\nA couple of years after that, I got on my middle school robotics team, and continued writing C code for microprocessors.\nThen I tested out of introductory CS in high school, passed the AP test without taking the class, and went on to Computer Architecture, Intro to AI, and Computational Physics, and serving as an assistant student administrator in the high school CS lab.<p>And that's probably far enough past getting started to make a good ending point.",1307151772

If there is a big disparity between the two, they are untrustworthy, even if they aren't intentionally deceiving you. I find it useful to remember that people who are lying to themselves about something cannot tell me the actual truth, not because they are intentionally deceiving me but because stating the truth to me would make it impossible to keep lying to themselves. I also look for patterns rather than specific instances.  I mean, if someone makes a miss-statement, he may not be lying.  He may be tired, distracted, mis-informed, etc.  So I don't read too much into a single incident.  I am big on giving people the benefit of the doubt.  I used to think I am ""forgiving"", but I have concluded that is not entirely accurate.  It is more accurate to say I am slow to judge, but once I have arrived at a definitely negative view of someone, I am a very hard sell.<p>I concluded years ago that ""Forgiveness is a gift.  Trust is earned.""  Abusive, untrustworthy people are very, very big on claiming you should ""forgive and forget"" and not hold some transgression against them.  Such people should not be trusted any farther than you can pick them up and throw them.  Decent human beings who made an honest mistake typically are fine with making it right and don't expect you to simply give them a pass.  Some folks are simply young and have not yet made a definitive choice as to which camp they belong to.  I generally give such individuals a chance to prove themselves if I can, even sometimes in the face of behavior I wouldn't likely tolerate from someone older.",1307150730
