I wouldn't suggest storing data that may be requested or written to by more than one client at once with a method such as this, either. I wouldn't try to use it like a C array or anything. One file per user or more makes sense. I've also used stuff like this for system admin scripts.<p>Something like<p><pre><code>   user_id=int(request.GET['id'])\n   data_type=int(request.GET['id'])\n   json_file=""{0}-{1}-chart_data.json"".format(user_id,data_type)\n   #get the file, decode, etc.\n</code></pre>\nIt's a quick and dirty caching method that has good persistence, of course, is relatively performant under low loads and easy to understand.<p>Thanks, I'll check out the MySQL thing, but I'm not actually intending to build my own database.",1308808776

If you don't have supercaps on your drives, you <i>will</i> lose data in a power loss situation, even with a battery-backed RAID controller. That data loss could take the form of anything from silent corruption of a table or index, to unrecoverable filesystem loss. (Briefly, the drive's controller uses the on-board cache to accumulate writes into erase-block sized chunks before flushing to the NAND media. If you disable the on-board cache, performance drops through the floor — USB thumb drives look fast by comparison — and you shave at least an order of magnitude off the drive's lifetime.)<p>At present, it looks like the best choice is the forthcoming Intel 710 series drives, but if you need an SSD <i>now</i>, their 320 series, the Sandforce controller based drives with supercaps (like the OCZ Vertex Pro models, though I wouldn't touch those with a competitor's database), or a FusionIO card are the only remotely safe options.",1308807777

For me, it's cooking. Actually, I'm worse than sorta-kinda OK, but I try sometimes. So, I try to keep in mind just how much it would infuriate me if, every single time I went into the cupboard and pulled out a frying pan, the frying pan came with an entirely new set of instructions versus the last time I used it.<p>People who have used computers for long enough have developed a skill that they don't even realize they have: they can glance at a screen and take in everything on the screen, and sort out what's important and what's pertinent and what's relevant and what's not, on a subconscious level.<p>For infrequent computer users -- by far the bulk of our market -- that skill doesn't exist.

No, they <i>want</i> security updates. They <i>love</i> security updates -- when security updates <i>only</i> fix bugs, patch holes, and don't cause any other problems or incompatibilities whatsoever.<p>No, the problem is that Google & Firefox's release engineers don't distinguish between UI and behavioral updates, and security updates, and then think that software updates are a matter of sophistication -- and not simply a matter of serious annoyance for a very large number of people.<p>I argue these points frequently. It almost always fails to have an impact on the person I'm talking to, even though I'm merely communicating with the voice of many very frustrated computer users.
