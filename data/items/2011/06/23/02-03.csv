2686464,comment,2682712,2685143,2,0,troutwine,,,"Consider that Haskell does its compilation step once; the types and their parameters are discarded and machine code is generated up front. (More correctly, LLVM IR is generated and combined with the Run Time System into a binary.) In Scala, and Java before it, compilation happens during program execution: you cannot discard types because the compilation step is never over. Ordersky's previous work on Pizza ensured that, however, that type parameters _were_ lost; rather than modify the JVM to support generics it proved to be more expedient with regard to backward compatibility just to strip them out. Pre-generics binary code could co-exist with post-generics because they compiled down to the same bytecode. Hence the complaint that in Java Array[Int] and Array[String] generates two special purpose, 'parameterized' Array structures in memory. Mostly the Java compiler can be clever and produce relatively only what is needed during execution, but the PermGem exception happens because, well, it's a hack.<p>Now, consider the difficulty of Scala wherein it's possible to represent a compound type. Erasure ensures that only the first parameter in the chain is generated in the type-erasure step, destroying the meaning of the union. There are kludgy ways around this--wrapping, bundling up manifests--but in the end the JVM does not allow the transmission of necessary information efficiently. Manifests serve the purpose of maintaining parameter information at runtime, but do so at the expense of code cache space and stress system resources. PermGem exceptions are much more common, in my experience, when doing Scala work as compared to Java.<p>The shorter answer to your question is the JIT nature of Java combined with a byte-code designed not to maintain the information needed to generate all possibilities of machine code on demand. LLVM IR maintains such information for Haskell--when targeting machine code directly I believe this is achieved by static polymorphic compilation, but I could be wrong; Stack Overflow time?--and the CLR does the same for C# and friends. It's a JVM problem entirely. The JVM promises to perform any and all compilation but is unable to accept all the information needed to do so effectively.",1308797965

I graduated college one year ago and have been working for a large consulting firm since graduation. The firm I work for has extremely strict Intellectual Property portions of my contract and it discourages me from building things on the side. My one regret in college was not spending more time building cool things (websites, mobile apps, games, etc) and playing with the latest ""greatest"" tech.<p>I also agree with your goal of working for yourself and making less money than working for a large firm. I am hoping to work for a start-up/start my own business eventually, but I have student loans to pay off so I went with a high salaried job right out of college to pay them off quickly.",1308797812

2686452,comment,2683996,2684763,1,0,kposehn,,,"Ok, addressing a few points here :)<p>1. Floating inspectors: Inspectors in general are getting better and I definitely prefer when it is well integrated into the view without interrupting my flow. They have a good start; further work is needed (not sure what though)<p>2. I think even tabs are a mistake now. We learned a lot from iOS about how to well integrate multiple views into a seamless interface. Tabs are kind of unnecessary imho now; we need something better.<p>3. Full screen isn't what I think the best aspect is - we do want to be able to view different apps at the same time. Case in point: \n- I have this chrome tab open on the right hand side of my iMac monitor\n- 3 terminal windows on the left hand side\n- My vc pitch in PPT on my second monitor's right hand\n- My PPC ad management software open on the second monitor's left side.<p>Restricting to one screen for an app isn't the right way I think, but an in-between method is. Funnily enough, I think Windows 8 almost nailed it.<p>As for in-app file management: YES. iCloud, Dropbox and a myriad of other systems all working together have such potential.

As I said, with a graph database and Gremlin, you can do it in 2 lines.<p>For something on PageRank's scale, a custom datastore based on matrices and their multiplication makes business sense. Or MapReduce over a distributed key-value store (note that these are both OLAP approaches).<p>Still. SQL's a bit verbose, but these days we have recursive queries. For Oracle users, I'm talking about CONNECT BY. If I find myself running the social graph every minute, I develop an ETL package that periodically moves data from my write-bound system to my read-bound system with a more query-friendly schema. Depending on how you look on it, relational systems invented ""eventual consistency"".<p>More to the point, boring old database greybeards have learnt that OLTP and OLAP are very different use cases. The 3/4/5NF of the OLTP database will be very different from the star schema of the OLAP database.<p>There's really not much about NoSQL that hasn't already been done, under a different name, by the relational crowd.<p><i>I still think there is a place for NoSQL</i>.

In August, certain features would be available to only ""premium"" members, who would pay a monthly fee.<p>The response:  ""You guys should really try to build traffic up for the next year - maybe two - and once you have that large audience, then charge for it.""<p>I suppose that is conventional wisdom among many tech companies but the thought occurred to me....if I were starting a restaurant, would I be asked to give away free food for a year until people decided it was good enough to pay for?  What if I open a T-shirt store?  Give them away until the designs get popular, then charge for them?<p>The toughest thing about building a business online is dealing with this mentality that everything has to be free.  How to get past this?  A related question is:  how to best present this cost to visitors and customers in a fashion that allows them to fully understand what they're getting?  Anyone care to point out great examples out there of other sites that are successfully communicating their value proposition?<p>Mainly just posting here to avoid finding a therapist - the overall mentality has me pulling my hair out.",1308794925

JSON comes out as an acyclic object graph in javascript, so what it still needs to be walked to actually do something with the data.<p>The difference between walking JSON and XML is simply the syntax of the parser library your are using.<p>The problem with XML is it has things that don't map directly to most OO languages, like node order matters, and attributes and elements are similar but different things, and mixed content.<p>So JSON is nice simply because it's close the the OO style everyone is used to today, and is in fact a subset of one of those languages.<p>IMO either way we need to settle on a way to interchange structured data, and agree on data types, but I would prefer some binary format, text encoding all this data such a waste of space/time.",1308794908

If you never spent at least half an hour playing with a language such as python or ruby, you will probably never know what is it that makes programmers all warm and fussy about their languages.

If BankSimple just pooled all of everyone's money into a single--say--Chase Cash Rewards Checking and kept ledgers in their system keeping track of your slice of the pie, only the first $250k of that pooled account would be insured.<p>So clearly BankSimple has worked this out with the underlying institution to create individual accounts for you. That seems like it has to be true, the only other alternative would be some deal cut with the FDIC which is not probable IMO.<p>But I think the original guy in this thread is wrong, too, because what BS can do, despite you having an individual account in your name at their backend provider, is ensure on your behalf that said account never goes negative. That is, abstract overdrafts within their Tier by extending you a line of credit -- deposited into your backend account. This is exactly what they're doing if I understand correctly.<p>Not to mention, if you're BankSimple and you go to Chase and you say ""What kind of deal can you give us on APY and fees? I can bring you 900,000 accounts with $4.5Bn in deposits to your bank?""<p>Banks start fawning over you once you have $20k in an account with them. If you're ever fortunate enough to have $100k you start to get serious banking attention. $4.5 billion dollars is an enormous amount of capitalization -- even for huge banks like BofA and JPMC.",1308794473
