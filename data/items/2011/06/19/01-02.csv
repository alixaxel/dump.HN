Like most wealthy individuals, he has investments across numerous asset classes. Many of those asset classes (equities, commodities, etc.) are heavily impacted by the Fed's policies. Needless to say, this individual is far more likely to feel comfortable pouring some money into a new VC fund he has been pitched when his other investments are doing well courtesy of Helicopter Ben's printing press.<p>Without willing investors, VC firms can't raise new funds and certainly, had there not been a massive pumping of cheap money into the global economy from the central banks, many of the massive VC funds, more than a few of which are being used to buy up shares in companies like Facebook and Zynga, would not exist.",1308448773

It still seems to me that there must be some rational justification for the excess construction, even if it is a misconceived idea.

I've used __builtin_ia32_psadbw128 in GCC myself. It compiles directly to PSADW instructions. Perhaps you confused what I was talking about with GCC's auto-vectorization?</i><p>Those aren't gcc vectors, those are intrinsics.  Vectors use something like this:<p><pre><code>    typedef uint32_t v4si __attribute__((vector_size (16)));\n    v4si v16 = {v,v,v,v};\n</code></pre>\n__builtin functions that act on __m128 values are <i>separate</i> from ""GCC vector instructions"".",1308445535

In May, Gunicorn had 12 mailing list messages, where uWsgi had 191. uWsgi has a twitter with 225 followers, where Gunicorn has none. #gunicorn@freenode has 32 users, but #nginx@freenode seems to have a lot of uWsgi users.<p>Also, the author mentions nothing about installing the Nginx PPA for ubuntu. If you use the default repo on Lucid (as suggested by the author), you will end up with a very old version of Nginx that doesn't even natively support wsgi.",1308445475
