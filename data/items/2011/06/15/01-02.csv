2655653,comment,2654063,2654063,2,0,jonnytran,,,"It's funny to see this b/c I've been a user of Mixpanel almost from the beginning and built my own stream. I honestly don't know if they allow this now, but back then you couldn't export your data. So as a believer in making data-driven decisions, it simply made sense to save off every single Mixpanel event before sending it over to them.<p>Customers would call on the phone saying I'm looking at X, and it was kind of hard to figure out exactly where they were on the site by their verbal description. Where they'd come from (if they were referred from Google AdWords, they might have different expectations than from somewhere else). We'd have to awkwardly ask callers for the product ID number, or stuff like that.<p>To help with customer service, I built a real-time AJAX stream of all our Mixpanel events. (Which was easy since we were saving them anyway.) I found this to be essential for customer service and learning about our users in general. Sure it may seem creepy when you first learn about this, but honestly, what developer doesn't tail their server logs just for fun? With the right intention, it can be a seamless way to be extremely helpful to users. With a real-time stream, you're just suddenly more helpful to people who need it.<p>By anecdotal evidence, we have found that letting people know you were following them is not a good idea, b/c you may cause them to feel creeped out. But the truth is, it's more likely than not that this is already happening (to you, right now, on this very site). We would never deny it, but we tend to just not bring it up / volunteer the fact. A real-time stream just gives visibility into the data that's always been there.<p>What was great about having our own stream was that we can pull in any user account data that's helpful. In other words, once a user logs in, you can display any relevant user account info in the stream. How long has a user been shopping? How many products has he/she looked at? Is he/she a return user? Has he purchased before? You can essentially link your real-time stream with your customer relationship management, aka CRM. If you choose, you can reach out to them in real-time on the site, either triggering an event on their next page load, or popping up something like one of those embedded chats.",1308102913

""Push this button. If it's blank, execute push button for all surrounding buttons."" Yet because the word ""recursion"" is primed with ""hard"" in the minds of undergrad students, some of them shut down on the word and don't attempt to figure out the problem. Instead they remember ""recursion is hard, we'll cover that later"".<p>Assuming subproblems are solved is a more sophisticated way of thinking about some recursive algorithms, like sorting.
