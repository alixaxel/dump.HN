""Son,"" the father said, ""we will need to change directions, the great water is blocking our path."" ""Father,"" the son said, ""it's not a problem. I brought a bucket. I'll just scoop the water up and move it behind us.""</i><p>You can be forgiven for believing that programmers intentionally obfuscate the craft with the intent of protecting their economic turf. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Yours is the belief of an absolute beginner naively lacking any historical context for the craft he is learning.<p>In truth, the analysis of language is one of the great problems of science. It is one with which the smartest minds, those that have studied math well beyond calculus 2, have struggled and continue to struggle to solve. The ease with which all humans attain the language ability hides the complexities inherent within. However, attempt to teach language to a person beyond the age of eight or so who has never learned to speak, and you will discover that it is literally impossible.<p>Your call for a simpler programming language is one that has been made by anyone who has ever called themself a programmer. As a matter of fact, the history of programming languages can almost be described as the history of trying to make programming accessible to the masses. (Fortran was programming for non-programmers. C was a non-assembly-language language. Object-oriented programming, as in Objective-C, is an attempt at simplification. Python and other scripting languages, is another step up.)<p>In this context, you can take your blog post as your first step into ""true"" programming. (As much respect as I have for those who work with CSS and HTML to make websites work, they are to programming what pamphlets and road signage are to novels and research papers.) It is a perfectly reasonable request, yet one that has proven to be impossible so far.<p>Alan Turing, one of the fathers of computer science, described what is known as ""the Turing Test,"" which is essentially: the ability of a program/computer/robot to convince a human being (via concersation) that it is also human. Fully passing this is one of the holy grails of computer science.<p>Please don't be mad at the rest of us for not solving it yet. Kurzweil has a long bet that humanity will finally achieve this by 2029. At least until then, all humans, including yourself, will have to work to be understood by computers.",1308016672

The joke at the MS Dev Conference at the time was that everybody in the room just had their salary drop 20%.<p>Perhaps the only reason a shift in Win app development tooling isn't such a big deal today is simply that MS does not have the clout that they did back then. Windows 8? Seriously, it's many years off before anybody (including MS) going to try to make a profit on a shrinkwrapped app that doesn't run on Windows XP.<p>But there are nevertheless a great many developers who've hitched their wagon to MS as a career path. They're understandably antsy as they watch all the hot demand go for iPhone/Android/tablet development. This would explain a lot of the angst I think.",1308016623

Where it got nasty was when people couldn't afford the performance hit of mutexes (or imagined they couldn't take the performance hit, or just wanted to be ninjas) and tried to write safe code without mutexes by reasoning about how execution might get interleaved.  C++ didn't provide as many guarantees about the ordering of side effects as a reasonable person would guess, so that typically didn't work.<p>Wise people threw up their hands and said, ""I'm not a ninja, so I'll just use mutexes and coarse-grained locking, nothing tricky, and see if it's fast enough,"" and they were mostly fine.  I think that's what most wise people will continue to do, and the people who will get the most use of out the new standard will be people who have very special performance requirements or who write high-performance concurrent libraries (such as container libraries) for mere mortals to use.",1308015615
2651478,comment,2648074,2648657,3,0,marshray,,,"I agree with you about their ridiculous amounts of API churn. I think it happens for (IMHO) two main reasons:<p>1. MS wanted to keep Windows APIs growing quickly to keep anyone from making a compatible platform. I can't imagine how many $B a year it costs to maintain that. This is probably less of a goal than it used to be, as the baseline Windows install is now so many GB that it's an impediment for the nimble VMs and ultra-portable clients that are the future.<p>2. MS seems to pitch to (and staff from) a young audience, folks in school and moving to the workplace as application software developers. This crowd has a natural turnover period of only a few years.<p>But one thing they really are quite good at is supporting stuff for a long time. You can today build an app with .Net framework 2.0 with VS 2005 and it will install and run about as well as it ever did. For native code compatibility typically goes all the way back to Win95 apps. When old apps don't work it's usually a result of unambiguous security or stability improvements made to the OS.

Over time, it's occurred to me that what I'm truly looking for is someone who will take the plunge with many different ideas and really go after things. We're coming up with new concepts on a weekly basis, but have no engineer to gut check against or even build basic models to test out.<p>What I am hoping to find is someone who can be the ultimate partner, OWNING the technical development while working with me to outline & pursue the business opportunities.<p>So here's some more about me:<p>--I think I'm really capable when it comes to identifying opportunities. I believe I have a knack for envisioning innovative products and how they can be delivered to users in a valuable & profitable way.<p>--I am extremely passionate and hard-working. Simply put, I will work as hard as anyone to pursue something I believe in.<p>--I know what I'm not: an engineer. I have some design skill and think I have a strong feel for quality user experience and product development, but I'm not looking for someone to do all my dirty work. I want a partner, in the truest sense of the word. Someone who I can brainstorm ideas with, and then together we can go running with them. Someone who will own the development from vision to code, while we work together to analyze the markets & business angles. We both should exploit our strengths.<p>--I live in SF and am really only looking for someone in the Bay area<p>--I'm a pretty good guy to be around and extremely extremely loyal<p>--I currently work for a top tech company (starts with G and has an OO in it) and have a pretty strong set of people & business skills.

He's been doing this every 6 to 12 months since Rails 0.13 (at least). Here are some of the bigger disruptions:<p>- Rails 1.2: Rewrite all your controllers to use the new REST model. (This was annoying, but the results looked a lot better.)<p>- Rails 2.0: Change from "";"" to ""/"" in standard resource routes, and rewrite controllers to use respond_to.<p>- Rails 3.0: Deal with bundler, ActiveModel, Arel, a total overhaul of ActionMailer, etc., etc.<p>By historical standards, the asset pipeline is a medium-sized change, and certainly much smaller than the Rails 3.0 changes. And unlike the Rails 3.0 changes, you can turn it off in about 2 minutes.<p>Personally, I rather liked most of these new features at the time: They addressed my day-to-day pain, they made my code cleaner, and they helped me keep in sync with other programmers.

Sometimes it's hard to see a guiding core philosophy other than the fact they want to be on the shiny edge.  It's nice that they aren't stuck with bad design decisions forever but when you go in for an upgrade and you depend on some unpopular plugins, you can bet on pain and even performance problems.<p>A major issue with some parts of the community is that some programmers think that being rubyists automatically makes them elegant programmers even if they don't have a clue about proper algorithms and that's probably why others call them ""hipsters"". The general disregard for improving performance, inherited from Ruby, is also something endemic from a while back.  Sure programmer time is important but how many successful companies have started with Rails only to end up with a patchwork of Java, Scala, C++, etc. after lots of downtime and growing pains.<p>Getting your app into production is also another pain point with the all the dirty tricks you need to master, not to mention an array of lackluster choices be it nginx, passenger, unicorn, rvm, REE, bundler, etc.<p>So with that background, I think the author's gripes are understandable but it really doesn't touch on the undercurrent of discontent surrounding the current ecosystem.",1308014098
