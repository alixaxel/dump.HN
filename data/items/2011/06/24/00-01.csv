2690529,comment,2690297,2690474,46,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""Some cops are crooked so screw them all?""</i><p>Not all cops are crooked - but the Blue Code of Silence puts the culpability for the crooked cops' crimes squarely on the police force as a whole. If the police forces of the US even showed <i>some</i> inclination of willingness to police the actions of their own, then we wouldn't have most of these problems.<p>Here in Seattle we've had an unprovoked shooting of a homeless man, to which the officer involved was allowed to resign gracefully, despite all parties agreeing that the was no provocation nor justification. Another officer body-slammed an innocent man (without warning, provocation, or identifying himself) into a wall so hard he is now in a vegetative state. This man <i>remains on the force</i>. Similarly, another officer was caught on store surveillance taking his rage out on a teenager in a convenience store, stomping on his face, after a failed drug bust next door. That officer remains on the force also.<p>Not all cops do these things, but they are all guilty of covering up these acts and ensuring that, even if they do get out to the public, that no real consequences occur for the officers involved.<p>I will have zero trust for any police force until they have proven their ability and willingness to police <i>themselves</i>.<p>> <i>""Try to find a case of word vs. word (no other evidence) and the man was found not guilty.

2690527,comment,2687950,2688369,1,0,gallerytungsten,,,"re: ""This concept of the ""moral right of the artist"" is the kind of incredibly vague legalese...""<p>No, it's not ""incredibly vague."" Rather, it's pretty clear:<p>What constitutes infringement of moral rights?<p>VARA grants two rights to authors of visual works: the right of attribution, and the right of integrity. The right of attribution allows an author to prevent misattribution of a work, and to require that the authorship of the work not be disclosed (i.e. remain anonymous). The right of integrity bars intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of a work if that distortion is likely to harm the author's reputation, and prevents the destruction of any work of recognized stature. Therefore, if I paint moustaches on a painting by a famous painter such as Roy Lichtenstein or Frank Stella, I will have violated the artist's moral rights under VARA. If I paint moustaches on an Andy Warhol painting on the other hand, I will not have violated Warhol's VARA rights, because VARA protection ends with the death of the author.<p>Source: <a href=""http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/moralprimer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property/library/moralprimer.ht...</a><p>You may say that ""pixelizing"" the photo caused no harm; the photographer obviously had a different opinion; to wit, that his ""right of integrity"" was harmed.

It seems inevitable under the capitalist system that increasing automation in all fields will widen the wealth gap considerably, as the most productive people become many times (perhaps many orders of magnitude) as productive as the least. The difference between someone who performs a task and someone who can program many cheap machines to do the same thing will grow much, much wider as machines become cheaper to buy and operate.

I haven't been working on it in quite a while so I really don't speak for the current team.<p>First off, I'm super proud of these guys finishing off this work. It was a long time coming.<p>As for why we chose XMPP over SIP: The team had made the choice to base the core IM product on XMPP before I joined.  That decision was based on the ease of implementation and interoperability.  XMPP for IM is much simpler than SIP/SIMPLE.  The easiest answer here is that it was the most logical fit to the product we had built at the time.<p>My personal opinion of SIP is based on a 6 year old snapshot of the technology.  Things have undoubtedly changed in the meantime.  Based on that snapshot, I wasn't a fan at the time.<p>- It is an amazingly complex and confusing technology.  It is worth noting that SIP is the longest IETF RFC out there.  Meanwhile, the core XMPP spec is easy to understand and implement.  It is also an IETF standard. Extensions are well modularized and documented.<p>- The security is hacked on after the fact and, at the time, was unevenly implemented. In basic SIP, one unauthenticated UDP packet makes a phone ring.  XMPP security is based on TLS and DNS and is a required part of the core.<p>- Federation was a patchy mess and showed SIP's telecom roots.  You pretty much had to get the lawyers involved to do anything.  Federation in XMPP is a DNS SRV lookup.<p>The world has moved forward since then so hopefully this provides some context for the decision at the time.",1308874985

There are so many things possible that aren't being done! Heck, even some useful things that <i>are</i> being done aren't very wide-spread.<p>Here is one simple example. Most apps today have tons of keyboard shortcuts. How about showing a list of possible shortcuts when I press Ctrl? I press Ctrl, the list appears. If I press Ctrl + A, the window is filtered down to show only shortcuts starting with A. When a shortcut is completed or when Ctr is released, the window disappears. Simple, yet it would enable people to learn shortcuts without disrupting their workflow. The list can contain a shortcut for permanently disabling this functionality, so anyone who doesn't like it could instantly get rid of it. Isn't this ""natural""?",1308874711

The one thing missing is key-value observing between my DOM elements and my data. I was hoping the jQuery datalink API would have matured, but the scope of the API is limited and the implementation is somewhat confusing to me.<p>So I decided to start writing one that initially assumes Backbone (since it has events built in). Since Backbone's controllers aren't traditional controllers, I linked the DOM element via the View to the Model the View represents. There are quite a few assumptions being made in the implementation and lots of room for improvement in the API, names of things, and performance.<p>If you clone the repo, you can just open index.html since I pre-built the JS for the time being.

You can't expect the user to remember the gestures and be able to operate the device no matter how intuitive you make it. Primarily, because gestures are not universal. They are cultural, and even geographical. For example, think of the ""come here"" gesture. Comparing ""come here"" between the Japanese and English version and you have to very different motions.
