2605852,story,,,2,2,FiddlerClamp,"Offer HN: Technical/Marcomm Writing",,"Hi:
Im a marketing and technical writer with experience writing user manuals, online help, Web site copy, press releases, proposals FAQs, and other written material.
My Offer HN is to help you out with your marketing and/or technical writing (within limits). Ill write from scratch or take your existing work and make it better. Im happy to provide you with up to five hours of my work (not including admin time), and if its a juicy project that I fall in love with, even more.
Why me: Ive worked as a marketing writer since 1995 and a technical writer since 1999. Im all about clear, simple, and straightforward writing that engages the reader -- and marketing writing that sells. My writing is in your voice, meeting your needs, and speaking to your audience.
Why Im doing it: 1) To update my portfolio with more recent work, 2) to get to know more folks in the startup scene, and 3) To find contract or perm. work down the line (heck, Im honest). I miss being part of the IT crowd.
Any limits? 
Whats the catch? I work for an investment firm that requires me to disclose any other companies Im working for. I would have to let them know Im working for you. The second catch is that I want to use the work for my portfolio, so I have to be able to point to your company or site and say that I worked on the copy/writing for it. Lastly, if you like it, write me a nice paragraph of thanks that I can use on my site.
What next? Take a look at my web site at http://www.jonathanacohen.com, or drop me a line at jonathanacohen@gmail.com.",1306899599

2605821,comment,2602920,2603778,4,0,T-R,,,"""The"" is very much a sticking point for native speakers of languages that don't have a similar construct; i.e. a Spanish speaker wouldn't likely have trouble with it, but a Japanese or Korean speaker more likely would.<p>The issue is 'a' vs 'the' vs nothing:<p><pre><code>    he went to the school
    he went to a school
    he went to school
</code></pre>
All have very different meanings - ""the"" is effectively an adjective describing the specificity of the noun. The first describes a specific school, the second describes some not-yet-defined school, the third describes an abstract concept.<p>'Chocolate' is another example of this, where the issue extends to the use of words like 'some', 'how many', and 'how much' (countable vs. uncountable quantities). Even if a person understands these concepts, it's still difficult to propagate it through a sentence so that everything type-checks (subject-verb agreement, etc), especially if you're coming from a language that doesn't have this kind of redundancy. It gets even harder with hypotheticals, where sometimes one might switch between both singular/plural and non-specific/specific mid sentence, all while English lacks gender-neutral singular third-person pronouns.<p>On top of this there are cases where the use of one over the other really just comes down to philosophy (whether native speakers of a language consider something distinct, concrete, or countable, or not). Similar issues come up with prepositions - which preposition goes with which verb differs even when describing the same concept in two very similar languages. (Best example I can think of at the moment is that in Japanese, people say ""I bought it to her"" instead of ""I bought it for her""; I know English<->Spanish has similar issues, but my Spanish is rusty)",1306898726
