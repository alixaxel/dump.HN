2614960,comment,2614779,2614850,3,0,ugh,,,"One plausible scenario is that you have to upload all your non-iTMS while your iTMS music can be streamed right from the start. Well, thats at least the minimal required scenario to make this service attractive when compared to Googles and Amazons services. Apple gets extra points if you can immediately stream all the music in your library  no matter its source  if it is also available in the iTMS. (That would, by the way, also save them space and bandwidth and make it possible for them to be pretty competitive.)<p>My guess is that its either unlimited or has a pretty high limit. Googles service is currently capped at 20,000 songs, Amazons free service has space merely for a few thousand songs (5GB or 20GB if you purchase an album from Amazon MP3).<p>Paying $30/year (after buying an album and getting the 20GB bump) gets you altogether 50GB of Amazon Cloud Drive space. That would be my minimum expectation for Apples service, too. (I would still be disappointed. 50GB still fit my current music library  but for how long?) A 20,000 song limit (thats about 160GB assuming 3:30 long 256kBit/s AAC files) would be more reasonable and at least be much cheaper than Amazons service (if you go with Amazon, 100GB cost you $80, 200GB cost you $180).<p>Its also possible that those $25 include some or all services that are currently part of MobileMe (iDisk, email, calendar and other syncing, ).<p>Its currently free and requires an invitation but might be no more after it is out of beta. Comparisons with Google Music are at this point in time moot.<p>Apple wouldnt actually need all that space and the associated bandwidth. First of all, not all people have 160GB music collections. Also, all music bought from the iTMS (and maybe all music available on the iTMS depending how the service will work in the end) doesnt have to be uploaded and only one copy of it has to be saved. I have 20GB of music bought in the iTMS and 20GB of ripped music, I would only need 20GB of space.",1307069210

There would be almost no indication to the public until it were too late if Mt.

There's not necessarily protection for his transferees if it turns out that he, willingly or not, was engaging in money laundering.<p>One additional thing that bothers me about the Bitcoin ""community"" at present is that they are engaged in an active and deceptive attempt to sanitize their public image. For example, in a Gawker story about drugs, Jeff Garzik, a core developer, inaccurately commented that Bitcoin could not be used to purchase anything anonymously. He surely knows that it wouldn't be difficult to do so; he appears simply to have been underplaying a regulatory risk that the currency faces in order to get part of the public on his side.<p>Bitcoin == marketing.

For starters, its not an open standard, its an executable program (or plugin).  It isn't a standard left up to be implemented by whoever is interested, its controlled by the one and only master implementation by Adobe.  A lot of websites like to depend on Flash in some way or the other, be it for ads, video, or some functionality, and more often than not it makes the experience unpleasant.<p>On the other hand HTML5 is an open standard and thats all it is.  Its basically an agreement of what the technology takes as input, and puts out as output.  If you want to implement the technology, by all means, go ahead.  If group A implements it better than group B, then people have the choice of using the group A technology.  Group B will then have to improve their implementation if they are interested in staying competitive, and we all win.  That to me is key, the option of using a standard, implemented by different people to make it strive, not a binary distributed and leaving you up to the whim of the company behind it.<p>FYI:  You spoke of windows and Mac OS X, but didn't mention Linux (probably because you haven't tried it, the same way I haven't tried it in Mac OS X.)  Flash absolutely blows in Linux as well.  I'm not talking just on the gnash and open source flash players, I mean the Adobe closed source build.
