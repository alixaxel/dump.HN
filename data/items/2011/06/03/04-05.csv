2615205,comment,2614797,2615146,3,0,joshu,,,"Ok, I'll take a shot at this.<p>Let's work in one dimension rather than two dimensions. It's easy enough to extend later.<p>You know that a any signal is the sum of a (potentially infinite) number of sine waves. For example, a square wave is the sum of ever higher-frequency (but smaller-amplitude) sine waves.<p>The higher frequencies are necessary to get the sharp edges.<p>If you strip the high frequencies, the sharp edges dissapear, leaving only the larger motions of the lower-frequency (yet bigger amplitude) waves.<p>So the low frequencies are the hill, and the high frequencies are the grass.<p>Does that make sense?<p>Edit: Here's an image: <a href=""http://cnx.org/content/m0041/latest/fourier4.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cnx.org/content/m0041/latest/fourier4.png</a>",1307077151

2615196,comment,2614797,2615086,1,0,cdavid,,,"Yes, but his remarks suggests that hamming distance is not very nice for pictures after his transformation (d(i1, i2) == 5 -> small, d(i1, i2) == 10 -> big). As I am not familiar with image signals, I don't know if this can be somehow mitigated with other techniques. Of course, the only way to be sure would be to actually test it, but I would not bet much on it.<p>Another issue I forgot to mention is that each ""point"" (image ) is a k-dimensional vector. Organizing those so that to easily retrieve points which are close to each other quickly becomes intractable. Conventional techniques like kd-trees quickly break down when k is above a few units, because of the curse of dimensionality. This introduces a ""non-linearity"" in your distance which makes comparing points in a k-dimension space quite different than in 2/3 dimension spaces.",1307076866

Nothing seems to explain the sudden takeoff of the last 45,000 years--the conversion of just another rare predatory ape into a planet dominator with rapidly progressing technologies. Once ""progress"" started to produce new tools, different ways of life and burgeoning populations, it accelerated all over the world, culminating in agriculture, cities, literacy and all the rest. Yet all the ingredients of human success--tool making, big brains, culture, fire, even language--seem to have been in place half a million years before and nothing happened.<p>The answer lies in a new idea, borrowed from economics, known as collective intelligence: the notion that what determines the inventiveness and rate of cultural change of a population is the amount of interaction between individuals.

Remember, the vast majority of gamers only know hackers as one of two things: people who take over websites, and people who cheat in video games.  GeoHot being a ""PS3 hacker"" would likely naturally have led these people to assume the latter, and the combination of general ignorance of the issue and an emotionally charged reaction to cheaters likely enabled that rumour to spread virally.

2615142,comment,2611841,2611841,5,0,vivekl,,,"Hats off to the Xen developers like Jeremy Fitzhardinge and others that persevered despite what was quite stiff resistance from the Linux community initially! Just to clarify, the major stumbling block was the Dom0 - Xen's privileged domain which has normally been a fairly heavily customized Linux kernel. A number of the DomU/guest components were already in the mainline for a while. Then the core Dom0 components went in around 2.6.37. And now all the PV backend drivers etc. are now in as well, paving the way for a vanilla Linux kernel to be a fully functional dom0 under Xen.<p>Having watched the back-and-forth between the Xen and Linux community over this inclusion business a bit, I feel the delay has actually been worth it in hindsight. Linux's pvops abstraction is clean and impartial. With this Linux has support for at least 3 virtualization technologies out of the box: KVM, Xen, and lguest. Also, a lot of the jagged edges in the Xen dom0 patches have been smoothed in this process.<p>This is also great news for private and public Xen-based deployments as well as companies such as Oracle, Suse and others that built their own virtualization platforms on top of Xen. Trying to get supported, well-tested drivers for new hardware working with Xen has often been a major pain point and required significant engineering resources. This was a major reason why Ubuntu switched to KVM officially (Red Hat led the charge here but that was mostly because they bought Qumranet - the company that built KVM). With this Xen is significantly more maintainable and I expect to see at least some of the distros to re-include xen as a virtualization option fairly soon!",1307074958

The failure is of the Web Standards - I may be slightly off base but till this date HTML5 can't do half of what Flash is capable of doing. The only other alternative is Silverlight - not exactly better as it is less open and ubiquitous than Flash is.<p>[ On Linux : Using since '96 - But recently gave up on Linux as the Desktop. The latest I tried Flash on Fedora, it was screwed up because Flash gets memcpy wrong - overlapping - and some jerks decided to be uptight about it and fixed memcpy to break Flash. They may have their reasons and justifications but I no longer want to deal with that stuff anymore. Still contribute non-trivial patches to the kernel and manage a bunch of RHEL boxes - so still do Linux but just not on the Desktop.]",1307074705

There are no objective measures or well-trusted authorities which can be used to ensure that any given developer or any given piece of software meets a certain degree of competence or quality. Only the subjective judgment of fellow alchemists can reliably gauge the quality of another alchemist, and then often only with a rather lot of effort.
