There are two questions that merchants should be asking when they are trying to decide whether or not to run a Groupon:<p>1. ""Will I make money on this offer even after the discount and after Groupon takes their cut?"" The answer here is NO for a large majority of merchants, which should lead to question...<p>2. ""Will I attract enough new customers from this deal to account for the lost revenue of operating the deal at a loss?"" The answer here for most merchants is ""I have no frickin' clue"".<p>Since almost no small business operates at 60-80% margins - the deal discount for most deals plus Groupon's cut is somewhere around this amount - its highly unlikely that the answer to the first question is ""yes"" for a significant portion of Groupon's merchants. As a result, its my opinion that the eventual success or failure of Groupon is highly depending on whether or not they can do two things:<p>1. Prove that the answer to the second question is ""yes""\n2.

Of course, Amazon is buying customers, just as all companies do. Some companies do it by dumping money into advertising, some by offering discounts. Amazon does both. The only important question is whether Amazon is spending too much on those customers, and the answer seems pretty clearly to be no. In its latest quarter, Amazon added 3.8 million new customers, and spent an average of $19 to acquire them. When you consider that better than 60 percent of Amazon's sales come from repeat customers--which implies that they're loyal--and that the average customer spent $116 in 1999 (10 percent more than in 1998), $19 seems like something of a bargain.",1307145811
