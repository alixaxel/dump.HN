It also help that I have actually connected all projects in need of help with someone who have offered to help.<p>Next step is to write about all the things I have learned from it. I am working on the website (got people to help me there in the spirit of WH)<p>What I have learned is 3 things.<p>1. Create as little friction for sign-up as possible. Be concise. Be personal. Be honest. The majority of my signups read the FAQ.<p>2. Think about social very broadly. For instance with WH I am sending out a mail with the projects structured, curated etc. Instead of people having to go to the website all the time, they receive a mail with the projects. So right now I am not depending on traffic. I am depending on making sure that everyone who have a project get offered help. (100% success rate so far). If it works by mail it will work by other means too.<p>3. Create boundaries for what your site is about. WeekendHacker is for very small projects. It might expand later on but now we are keeping it simple and exploring how far that will take us.<p>Hope this helps. I will make a bigger post about it all and then numbers next week.",1307361179

Tell me how many people you need to make it happen."" ...  And when I told them, they failed to get those people on time and still demanded on the deadline.

It's such a stupid, meaningless, USA PATRIOT Act-esque piece of fluffy propaganda.  Not every criminal is a terrorist.  Nor every airline passenger, but I won't even get into that.<p>Now, that's not to say that some of these groups wouldn't do those things if they could.  I can see a significant proportion of Anonymous deciding to take out the NYSE in retaliation for some bill or other, if they had the capability.  Still, that's not terrorism, just crime.",1307358880
