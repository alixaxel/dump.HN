2648576,comment,2647928,2647934,6,0,jdietrich,,,"Electronics recycling splits into two halves. One is the 'recycling' of old but saleable equipment, mainly old cellphones and computers. These generally end up on eBay, or shipped out to Africa to be sold on. I suppose if you're too lazy or rich to sell your electronics yourself, this is perfectly harmless.<p>The other half is the actual recycling of broken or obsolete equipment that is valuable only as scrap. The processing of this waste is arguably the biggest environmental disaster happening anywhere in the world. This waste is shipped out to places like Guiyu and Lagos, where it is sorted by hand. PCBs will be burned on open fires to remove the solder mask, then dipped in acid to extract the gold and copper. Wire insulation is burned off and plastic housings incinerated in the street. Toner dust is blown into the air. Anything which will not burn and has no scrap value is dumped in fields. In Guiyu, levels of lead, mercury and cadmium in the water course are hundreds of times the safe limit. Drinking water is brought in by tanker.<p>Regardless of how careful a recycler is, they have no ability to control how equipment is resold. A bundle of waste might change hands half a dozen times before finally becoming scrap metal. I'd much rather see old equipment end up in EPA-regulated landfill than be ""recycled"".",1307958975

Partly, there's a worry that it mainly rewards how much knowledge you have coming <i>into</i> college: if the CS-101 course is really hardcore, the people who pass it are those who learned a lot about computer science on their own in high school. But if the university is supposed to provide an education program that can teach CS to people who <i>don't</i> already know it, that isn't quite what you want.<p>It also tends to work directly against universities' recruiting goals: they're spending all this effort to try to convince ""non-traditional"" CS majors (i.e. people who weren't already high-school computer enthusiasts) that it's an interesting and useful field to study, in which case you don't want to immediately kick them out in the first semester for not already being proficient enough.",1307957331

Running through the whole string you can build up the log probability of the whole string: log p(x) = \sum_n log p(x_n | x_<n). Comparing the log probabilities under different models gives you a language classifier. For a first stab at the one-class problem, compare the log probability to what the model typically assigns to strings it randomly generates.<p>For more on information theory, modelling and inference you might like:

Much like git, darcs provides for full hunk edition (splitting hunks into sub-hunks, and removing or changing sections of hunks before recording them).<p>* Mercurial provides this function through the (built-in) `record` extension. It currently gives no way to split or edit hunks, only to record or ignore them. The crecord third-party extension has these features (and/but a more complex, curses-based, UI)<p>* `-p` is actually a subset of the much more complex `-i`/`--interactive`, which is a special staging-manipulation sub-shell.<p>Note however that this is a powerfully dangerous tool, as it lets you commit untested revisions (then again, so does file-selection at commit, which has been available since SVN).

Then, people were looking for ridesharing, free rooms, news, etc. under the hashtag #ashtag. Not as severe as an earthquake, but a similar mechanism blocking twitter's utility.<p>Then the problem wasn't spam, but #ashtag retweet avalanches from some well-followed celebrities.

I'm pretty sure Justin Bieber said something too, so that was it for #ashtag.<p>This would probably have been easier to deal with than spam, because people weren't actively trying to game them. Twitter just needed to aggregate some information and make it blockable, e.g. ""don't show me (re-)tweets with this text anymore"".

Aren't there pretty strict laws about cooking prepared food for others? I thought restaurants and even those street vendors are supposed to be checked out...<p>Just wondering if you have checked this potential issue out...or maybe I'm misunderstanding the idea.",1307955946

They're fanning the flames themselves<p>It doesn't really affect me, but I can understand why a lot of developers would be anxious.<p>They don't want to use a clearly inferior technology and quite frankly a crappy language like JS.",1307955922

The corporate IT shops are not immune from the demands that these expectations create.<p>For example, a significant proportion of them are now having to work out how to support Apple's devices for corporate network access, email, document sharing and delivering apps for internal users and consumers, and all because corporate executives are also consumers.",1307955763

How much easier work can you get than that?<p>If you charge per project then you can free yourself from the hourly game.  In some cases a healthy project fee can look more appealing than an hourly rate even if you know that you could do the project for half the cost of the per project fee if you were to charge hourly.  Hourly makes people nervous.<p>Sometimes hour rates are meaningless.  If the developer is horribly slow, dishonest or incompetent then even ""cheap"" becomes expensive.  What good does saving money on a developer do if your business is losing wads of money because the developer is taking far longer than expected to complete your project?<p>I think it all comes down to giving the client the warm and fuzzies, delivering in a reasonable timeframe and doing so with decent quality.  It's also about being able to sell yourself.  These aren't always the qualities of a technician.  You also have to be a business person.",1307955658
