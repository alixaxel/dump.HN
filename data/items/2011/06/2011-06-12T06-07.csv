And then do something about the why.<p>Frankly, listening to people like Hammerbacher (who is almost certainly now rich from fb) or Alex the twitter dude who started bank simple (who essentially admitted he got rich from Twitter, see discussion surrounding his claim Conway threatened him) now whine about other engineers trying to get theirs <i>just like Hammerbacher and Alex did</i> is bullshit.

A more experienced friend of mine suggested that this could be due to using nvidia binary graphics drivers, so I tried out the open source ones, but the tearing and delays got worse, and occasionally an entire window would be mangled for no apparent reason.  He also suggested that it could be due to XRandR, but I noticed no change when I stopped using it (other than that my displays were no longer vertical), so now I'm using the binary drivers and XRandR again.<p>After upgrading from Ubuntu 10.04 to 11.04, I was unable to use my onboard NIC at all.  I thought that it had been bricked, so I put another in, but eventually someone I knew experienced the same problem and was able to fix it by temporarily removing the battery from his motherboard.  Apparently the drivers that ship with 11.04 like to put your network card into an unusable state until you physically mess with the machine.  You could just be careful not use them and download the working drivers, but you might need a NIC for that...<p>On OSX, Spaces has a bug that causes windows to randomly rearrange themselves on the Z-axis when switching spaces.  It also has a bug that causes your keyboard to stop working completely.  The first time I encountered the second bug I had to reboot my computer because I couldn't kill Spaces without using my keyboard, but I have since put Activity Monitor in my dock just in case I need to do that.  Fullscreen games on OSX (Starcraft II or Heroes of Newerth, for example) run a reasonably high chance of never giving up exclusive mode, even after dying, so your machine will become mostly inoperable after playing the game a lot of the time.  There's also no reasonable way to run these games in fullscreen non-exclusive mode (the most useful configuration on other OSes), so you can't quickly switch between the game and Skype/screencasting software/IRC.<p>...And I hardly think I need to tell anyone here what sucks about Windows.",1307861006

This is not only a loss of money for sellers and manufacturers, but also ends up being really bad PR.<p>G/L distros like gNewsense or Trisquel (both of which run Linux-libre) would run and sell really well at Best Buy if the video cards, wifi adapters, etc. they would come with worked out of the box. Yet God forbid you use some other [wifi adapter, insert other unsupported device] that doesn't have the right firmware! (Of course, this also applies to regular G/L albeit much less so.) Most 'average Joes' don't care about things like FLOSS unless it works and doesn't require a lot of work to setup and use constantly.<p>That's not to mention running Windows programs that don't have a FLOSS alternative.<p>My point is this: G/L won't become immensely popular without the major compatibility issues being fixed and it becoming a default install on a whole major line of computers. Compatibility won't be fixed until the vendors of the devices or programs see a significant profit intake from releasing the firmware/whatever and do so. Default installation won't happen until some major hardware company comes along and sells G/L only.<p>TL;DR: G/L needs major support to become commercially popular.",1307860384
2645850,comment,2645329,2645786,5,0,cookiecaper,,,">Getting your phone to work as a modem is not a problem that most people have.<p>I'm just going to address this point right here. Almost <i>all</i> normal people I know would really appreciate being able to get internet in any variety of locales where they'd otherwise have to wrangle with stupid WiFi login screens and money portals or where even crappy commercial WiFi is unavailable (park?). The thing is that most people just don't even consider that it is or should be possible.<p>If the ""normal person"" is incidentally using Ubuntu and Cyanogenmod, all we have to do is plug the phone in via USB, turn on tethering on the phone, click ""HTC Android Phone"" on ""the two computers on the screen"" (nm-applet), and that's that.<p>This is extremely handy in a lot of cases. Today, for instance, I tethered my phone and used it to browse for a few hours because Comcast was choking to death on my new modem and I had to wait for a ""backend engineer"" to process the ticket the customer service people created. Do you think that having a redundant net connection with just your phone and a USB cord is valuable, even to ""normal people""? I sure do.<p>As to the rest of your post, you can generalize anything you want into a niche. I could say, ""You know, 'normal people' only use their computers for Facebook, they definitely aren't trying to plug them into projectors"". The reality is that plugging in a projector <i>should</i> work on Ubuntu and often does. As you noted, Windows is not perfect in this regard either; Ubuntu works excellently for a large number of people. Is that OK with you?<p>Saying that Ubuntu can never take off because you have to manually specify projector output is quite far-fetched. Should I say that Windows will never take off because you usually have to install software to use your peripherals when on Linux they are almost always supported immediately upon plug in?<p>Here's the real answer: desktop Linux will come around when it gets a company like Apple behind it, just as embedded Linux came around as TiVO, Google, Boxee, etc., put their weight behind it.<p>Microsoft sells relatively few copies of Windows directly to consumers; almost all consumers receive Windows pre-installed on the computer that they purchased at major retailer X. The manufacturers integrate the OS and the hardware, ship it out, and sell the whole thing as a single product called a ""PC"". When Linux gets someone that does this on a major, Dell-like scale, we'll see Linux on the desktop. It's well past good enough; really, these things don't take all that much. The biggest obstacles are social: ""Why doesn't this greeting card creation program I just bought for $60 work on my 'UBUNTOX'?""",1307860367
