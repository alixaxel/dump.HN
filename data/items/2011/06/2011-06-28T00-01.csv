You can't kill a person (or make CP) because it infringes upon a certain set of ""natural rights"" which are supposed to be universal and self evident.""</i><p>Governments kill people <i>all the time</i>, and do so quite legally.<p>Some governments do it more than others.  But, as far as the US government is concerned, it happens to have the one of the world's largest contingent of hired killers.  And they spend more money than all of the rest of the world combined to train them to kill and to facilitate killing and on giving them the means to do so.<p>And this doesn't even begin to cover the vast array of other people and situations in which killing is not only permitted, but considered a duty -- from police killing a some suspect trying to get away or resisting arrest to your average homeowner killing an intruder in their home, etc..<p>So when you talk about ""laws against killing"", you're really talking about ""laws against certain kinds of killing in certain kinds of situations"" and also ""laws that specifically allow or even require killing in certain situations"".<p>While most societies do have laws against ""murder"", what that usually boils down to is ""certain kinds of illegal killing"".  Precisely what qualifies as ""illegal killing"" and what in which situations killing is allowed or even encouraged varies from society to society and certainly from individual to individual (take pacifists and believers in non-violence vs soldiers for example).",1309222725

2703566,story,,,6,10,JGailor,"Strange reason for being turned down. Any other good ones?",,"This is a pretty weird one, as I've been programming for a while and haven't heard it yet. I have been interviewing w/ a local Bay Area startup that I was introduced to via a friends recommendation. It's a bit of a strange situation as I had just spent the past year working as a co-founder on a startup, and I made it clear that there was a strong chance that I would be applying to a startup incubator over the winter to work on a problem that I find frustrating and would love to see solved, so it might not be a long-term thing. They were understanding, so we met, and after a few good face-to-face meetings we had talked about a reasonable short-term engagement.  At this point I usually ask the other side to think it over a bit and send me an email with an offer to start really coalescing the process, and to open up some space for any questions that might not occur during an interview.<p>After a few days, I got an email, and while it was very positive on my technical/engineering abilities, ultimately they thought I was ""too mature"" for the team and might not be a good fit.  I was somewhat disappointed, as I liked these guys and thought they had an idea that I could really dig deep into, but I can understand the need to make sure the team is clicking at close to optimal efficiency as possible.  I just have never had the ""too mature"" reason used before.  My thoughts at this point are that either:<p>A) They felt that was an easy way to say they weren't really interested.  Strange, but that's ok.<p>B) They were not happy with the potential for me to leave after a few months. Very legitimate, but there's always some flexibility and we could have talked some more about it and changed plans.<p>C) I just was too serious during the interview process, and didn't seem like I could work comfortably with the team. I think this is very possible, but usually when interviewing it seems hard to get too comfortable.  There's a lot of evaluation going on from both sides, and you want to put your best face forward.  For me that usually means trying to look capable and professional.<p>Anyway, I think they're a great company and will blow up in the next few years, but this just struck me as a strange one, so I thought I would cheer myself up and see if anyone else had any funny or weird stories about interviews.",1309221949

Here is some info from someone on the ground: Our main concern is that the Las Conchas fire is about 3 1/2 miles from Area G, the dumpsite that has been in operation since the late 1950s/early 1960s. There are 20,000 to 30,000 55-gallons drums of plutonium contaminated waste (containing solvents, chemicals and toxic materials) sitting in fabric tents above ground. These drums are destined for WIPP. We understand that LANL has been working since late last night to build a fire line in Water Canyon, between the fire and Area G. Over the last 26 hours the fire has grown from 0 acres to about 45,000 acres  about the size of the Cerro Grande fire in 2000.",1309221589
