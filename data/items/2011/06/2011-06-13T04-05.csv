2648171,comment,2647301,2647922,2,0,auganov,,,"Very good advice.
You could create great software just glueing code, no matter how dumb it sounds, most people are not too good at it and it's very very obvious.
Now there are situations where glueing might not be enough and they surely will occur. That's when you need an engineer to solve the problem, CS will help you become one.
The question is do you want to be one?<p>If you are more into Internet entrepreneurship studying something that is not CS could give you more advantage. 
Many great programmers never create any significant software for themselves, their knowledge is too confined to CS. These are people you might want to hire once you have your start-up, tell them what exactly you need your software to do and they will perform.<p>Go to Top Coder's website. All the top schools are in Asia and Eastern Europe. Actually a school from Poland, my country comes, in 3rd. Few years ago it was 1st. I would hear on TV how we have the best programmers in the world. But did they ever create anything significant? No.
Most of them now work for Google, MS or some other big corporation that needs people who can write very efficient algorithms fast. So while I could easily attend an university that generates those great programmers (even for free I think, not too sure) I never even thought about it.<p>Knowing the science behind paint does not make you a painter and you don't need it to become one.<p>I'm not in any way against CS, it's definitely very interesting to study and if you truly love programming then by all means go and study it. But beware of what CS is and what it's not.",1307940808

Often for this sort of job though, the people hiring will ask you algorithm and data structure questions.<p>The other path you can take is really studying graphic design for a bit to train your artistic eye - if you can make pretty nice looking websites, and code up the backend to make them do interesting stuff, you're in a great position to go freelance / solo and build an app on the side.<p>And lastly, a third path:  start writing a lot of javascript!

By default, none of the meta discussion would be visible, but a user could choose to view it.  It would be a place for discussing the discussion, explaining site guidelines, etc.  I think of it as sort of analogous to Wikipedia's discussion tab.<p>My idea here is that such a meta-chat view might help get crufty comments off the main view, as well as encourage more communication about <i>why</i> a comment is inappropriate.  Another idea might be to allow comments to be voted into the meta category, so they would be hidden from the main view but still visible to those who care.<p>Have any other communities tried this sort of thing?

To address your specific request, I am not bothered by the issues you raise because there are strategies to ameliorate them.  Security issues and corrupting memory largely come from unbounded data. C has <i>fantastic</i> tooling to profile and analyze applications.  Unlike Go, there is always something you can do to achieve your desired behavior.  YES there are warts and problems a-plenty, but they are well-known and there is a vast collection of people and articles about dealing with them.<p>I never meant to imply that C was more safe than Go.  Erlang is, which I meant to imply with the comment about immutable message passing concurrency.  Immutable message passing concurrency is amazingly safe and free from classes of errors that Go programmers still have to deal with (race conditions!)  In Go, the canonical style is to pass pointers through channels (and pass ownership along with it.)  Two goroutines can still mutate the same object out from under each other, leading to all of the potential issues you run into with multithreading in C.<p>The Go garbage collector sucks, currently (check out the recent mailing list threads with trivial applications that trip it up.) They know this and it is on the roadmap for development, but it isn't there yet; stopping the world to do your work (and taking a LONG time to do so in perverse cases) is not something I want to deal with.  When using a ""systems"" language, I want to have repeatable and knowable performance.<p>Using the unsafe package defeats all of the benefits of using Go while maintaining all of its shortcomings.  Additionally, there is great difficulty with incorporating existing C libraries (yes, cgo is an option but it does not work with gccgo and it is poorly documented -- for instance, how do you make the Go garbage collector aware of C struct lifetimes?) Even if you stay within the language,  you have to choose lightweight go-routines or optimized code generation (gc vs gccgo.)<p>Another irritating thing is that Go maps cannot have binary data as keys, only certain types (numbers and strings, basically.)  Discovering this was not easy, and the suggested answer is to coerce an array of bytes to a string (making a copy) for storage and every time the key should be accessed.<p>> If you looked at Go, it must have been from a very, very far away.<p>Just because I have come to different conclusions than you have, please do not assume my view lacks research or analysis.",1307937654
