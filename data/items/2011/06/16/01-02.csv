2659812,comment,2658818,2659359,12,0,bugsy,,,"You are absolutely correct, I should have phrased it better regarding the cheating. My observation was that the organized cheating groups were populated exclusively by asian students. These were the ones that were highly systematized and had repeatable means of obtaining mid terms and finals in advance of the test. I knew about them because as the highest scorer on most tests, I would routinely get invited to join them since I would be able to find the correct answer to the questions. I always declined. It's not true that all asians were members of these groups, and it's also true that white students cheated, but just not in such organized and efficient ways. One thing I discovered was that the existence of the organized groups was a cultural phenomenon. I learned that western style Lone Wolf models of accomplishment are considered inefficient ways to do things. Cooperating and sharing information with one's group is more desirable. Subterfuge, such as getting ahold of a test before the exam, is not considered dishonest at all. But copying from someone else's paper during the actual test is considered dishonest and not done at all. At my school these were nearly all immigrant students and first generation immigrants who had at least some personal upbringing with schools in China and Korea. (Japan I don't know about, I don't recall any Japanese immigrant students in my program.) Anyway the result would be that they would do better on tests than students who did no studying or reading or projects at all, but not as well as those of us who studied and didn't ""cheat"". For an engineering, sciences, or maths degree, I do believe you have to put in the time. It's not sufficient just to learn the ways that specific problems are worked out.<p>This is a really difficult thing to discuss because ""the cheaters were all asians"" sounds disparaging and is impossible to explain fully without elaborate explanation. Subtleties in particular are that it's not considered cheating by the students that do it, but rather is considered smart studying and efficient use of time. Because of this it doesn't indicate dishonesty. As a parallel, consider the industrialization of Japan and China, much of which has depended on copying western designs, industrial espionage, and then, in the long run, often making the process more efficient by taking in feedback from workers at all levels collaborating to improve the overall system (which is perhaps a strength they have that the west doesn't as much). Westerners first faced with these methods have sometimes exclaimed ""they are stealing our designs"" and ""they are cheating"", but in the east, copying things makes more sense than reinventing the wheel. However, there are advantages to reinventing the wheel, as one learns about things on a deeper level when inventing it from scratch or first principles rather than simply copying a preexisting method.",1308188974

Most business models I've seen around writing or contributing to open source software tend to be entirely service and support orientated - something I'm not interested in doing. Instead, the model I want to try is releasing software initially paid for proprietary, and then after a set amount of time (say 6-18 months, or when sales go below a threshold) release the code in its entirety under an open source license.<p>However, I'm unsure of this model for a few reasons. If potential customers are aware of this ""approaching open sourcing"", will there be a significant portion who'll just wait? If they are not aware of this event, would they feel ripped off or less hesitant to purchase any other software I write in the future?

Though I admit, I don't use the menubar from the keyboard as most of the time I just use the shortcuts that activate the menu item.<p>Don't believe me? You are partially right with the eventually remark however, not all applications allow or even try to have shortcuts for every menu option.

Are you managing/offering awesome people to provide the customer service or is it software that will help guide an existing company's support staff to be awesome? Perhaps a training program with some sort of systematic reminds of how to be awesome (could be interesting).<p><i>While You Were Out Notes</i><p>I know people use different hardware/software for communications but I don't see how there's any value here. Making voicemail accessible outside the office? If someone visits, do they need to know YOUR system for leaving a note or is someone in the office going to add it to this unnecessary system? There's a thing called email, and it works if you don't suck at it. Not convinced there's a pain/need here.<p><i>One Click Social Media Reports - My pick</i><p>Another area that is appealing to me, but I'd like to know more. List the kinds of things you'll be collecting. I do think there's data missing from other related services/tools.<p><i>Recurly for Dummies</i><p>Not to say there isn't a market/possibility to make money here, but doesn't Paypal offer subscriptions. Not everyone is accustomed to using/managing their subscriptions with Paypal but how will you make it any easier with your service?<p><i>Online Ticket Sales</i><p>Again, with limited information it's hard to see how you're going to approach this differently than Eventbrite. I think the opportunity here is the promotion aspect, but how you accomplish this is a mystery. I just feel a lot of people aren't aware of events in their area until it's too late. However, getting them to subscribe to your service to receive updates about events is going to be hard. You have to solve the relevancy/quality issue in addition to marketing to these people who don't search out for things on their own.

I think it has totally cracked this problem, and its model is the model I want to see everywhere for managing concurrency in a single process.<p>My problem is that I feel it's solving a problem I don't really have. I'm not making desktop software, so I just don't care about using a single machine's cores safely and efficiently. While you claim most software could benefit from managed state, my assumption is that the majority of people looking at Clojure today are thinking of it for server software. The issues there immediately spread beyond a single process, and suddenly all the magic of Clojure stops being relevant. To scale my app I'm using multiple processes across multiple machines, and while I'd love something similar to the Clojure model to apply there, it just doesn't.<p>I feel like Clojure has popped up at an unfortunate time when desktop apps are only just thinking seriously about concurrency, but server apps have already moved beyond the model that works within a single JVM. So I really don't know what its sweet-spot is.<p>All that said, I should repeat that I love the language and have found it an exceedingly productive way to work on the JVM.

2659754,comment,2658246,2658639,1,0,jonnytran,,,"You're not alone with regard to Ruby. I was lucky enough to start using Clojure pre-1.0 at work. I come from a background where I've done a lot of functional programming. With Clojure, it was a joy to finally use a Lisp with well-designed conventions that I could actually get things done with.<p>However, I've since moved on to Ruby and learned a lot about its metaprogramming features. This is purely my opinion, but I get the impression that a lot of people who are smart enough to get Lisp, functional programming, and metaprogramming dismiss Ruby as being yet another OO language too soon, before getting to know it. On the contrary, I've found that the more I learn about Ruby, the more it grows on me, and the more similarities I see it has with Lisp.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, the reason I use Ruby is kind of like the reason I use a Mac, or why I tend to use languages with dynamic typing. There's no one killer feature that I can point to over the competition. In fact, there are a number of features that are hands-down superior in the other. I haven't quite figured out how to explain it to people coming from the other side, but for me, Ruby just hits the sweet-spot on so many levels. People talk about Macs being usable and even loved by grammas who know nothing about computers and hackers at the same time, audiences on complete opposite ends of the spectrum. Ruby is similar. On the one extreme, it's approachable to complete newbs. I know designers who would turn their nose up at the sight of code but were willing to learn the basics of Ruby to implement their designs. On the opposite extreme, it supports first-class continuations out of the box, which isn't even part of the Common Lisp standard. Also, a lot of times when I would've needed a macro in Lisp, I simply didn't in Ruby. And that's hard to explain... Sure I can do things with macros in Lisp that I can't in Ruby, but all other things being equal, wouldn't you choose the non-macro way over the macro way? (Sigh... I hear the flames starting.)<p>I'm not sure I agree with you about state, but it's true that with a web server and db, I've so rarely ever needed more concurrency features. Maybe this means Clojure is just not meant for people like me writing mostly web apps. But to play devil's advocate, maybe it's a good thing to let a piece of software designed specifically for handling concurrency -- handle the concurrency. Namely, a web server or database. This actually forces me in a good way to design my app up front to do any heavy processing asynchronously outside of a web request, which often means a queue, which often implies work divided into small pieces run concurrently by workers (separate processes, possibly on remote hardware, not just using an agent in another thread or relying on shared memory) which may die at any time without significant effect (a la Erlang). ...Again, maybe I'm just not in Clojure's target audience.",1308187367
2659753,comment,2657745,2657980,2,0,zmmmmm,,,"My main experience with Hibernate but I could give you a nice long list of examples.   The big problem is that there is a pretense of transparency and simplicity when it doesn't actually exist.<p>For example, Hibernate tries to optimise how much it loads and saves.  This means it doesn't load foreign keys automatically and it has its own logic for exactly when and how it flushes data.<p>If you are loading an object it will by default not load the collections of objects that are related to it - that will happen lazily when those properties are accessed.   Sounds fine, right?  Exactly what a good developer would do by default anyway.  Until you pass one of those objects around to a naive code module that knows nothing of the database and it tries to access the property - which looks like a nice in-memory collection to them - and it now executes an expensive query on the database that you weren't expecting.  In fact, the naive code module might get a whole list of these things to work with and it might sequentially query each one.   The best case here is that it's thousands of times more expensive than it should be, but the worst case is far worse - the database transaction might have ended or have been rolled back (which generates a giant exception+stack trace), or the rows might have been locked (which might just make things slow but could result in deadlocks since this naive code doesn't know anything about the database).<p>The way I see it in the end is that ORMs try to hide some of the most important parts of your software design from plain sight.  You feel like they are hiding trivial stuff that is boring and you don't want to waste time on.  But in the end that stuff is absolutely critical to your design and some of the most core stuff you should be thinking about.  Having it all hidden away makes you <i>not</i> think about it at all until its too late and you've built a whole giant application on shaky ground.<p>After being through this enough times I am now expert enough to confidently build applications using Hibernate and save time over plain SQL.  But the body of knowledge I had to accumulate just about Hibernate is equal to all the knowledge I ever had to learn about plain old relational databases.  These days, if I start a new project using an ORM I try to minimize its use down to just being a convenient utility for  loading rows and map them into an object's properties.<p>The one thing I will say in their defense is that when time is your <i>most</i> critical factor - eg: you're a startup with 3 months of runway and your end product is going to be mainly demo ware to get your next round of funding - an ORM like ActiveRecord, etc. is absolutely the right thing.",1308187324
