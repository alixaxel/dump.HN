For someone who is suddenly out of their comfort zone, I can understand the frustration. A few tips:<p>1. Before thinking of names, get meta. What's the company about, what would a ""good"" name connote, what are the ideas the name should express? Write down a narrative of all the awesome things the name should convey. If you're diligent in following this recommendation, all kinds of new ideas will emerge.<p>2. Say any potential names aloud. Do they roll off the tongue, or are they awkward tongue twisters?<p>3. Do your domain lookups via the command line, not some web site. It's been suggested that domain lookup sites snatch your queries and register them. True? I don't know; but you can't go wrong using Whois in your shell of choice.",1308192850

2659937,comment,2659012,2659012,1,0,JTfor2032,,,"There is no doubt that this is good cause.  Yet, there is much to be pessimistic about it. First off, it will be excruciatingly difficult to produce a documentary of decent quality, comparable to ones such as ""Inside Job"", with only a budget of 150,000 USD. You definitely need to look to acquire a budget of at least 300,000 USD. Secondly, this documentary is extremely vulnerable to being thwarted by the ""big six"" media corporations. The only thing that stands in the way of corporations having complete power over the American people and their government is pro net-neutrality regulations. We will of course witness the perhaps the most determined onslaught on a small organization than we have ever seen taken by the corporations. Finally, creating and releasing a documentary presents the challenging fact that the current political situation concerning net neutrality changes at a rapid rate. A couple of examples would be how Obama campaigned  on net neutrality, yet when he came into office his administration had corporations make a law that protected their interests over  individual citizens. The other example is how Meredith Baker approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal and then resigned from the FCC to become the leading lobbyist for Comcast. This ever changing nature of net neutrality would make it necessary to release the documentary shortly after it has been filmed.",1308192552

I'm not always in the mood and don't always have special inspiration, but I maintain the schedule.<p>A friend recently resurrected and redesigned (after 2 year hiatus) his site and it looks amazing.  His writing is amazing.  Problem is that the site is complete and he hasn't written one post because of his perfectionist nature.<p>Is there a right answer here?  What is better:  continuously writing in the name of honing skills or withholding talent in the pursuit of perfection?<p>Another blogger advised the former, saying that as far as blogs go your mediocre content will simply be forgotten and a really good piece may make HN and go viral.  In other words, just do as raganwald suggests and be prolific before all else.  There is no real downside to maintaining a schedule and just going for it.<p>For beginners like myself I tend to agree with that statement - practice, hone your skills, develop your methods and thought processes and continue writing every day.",1308191138

Perhaps today it is more acceptable.<p>A former roommate who graduated from one of the best, if not the best, Indian school opened my eyes to the rampant cheating that goes on in those hallowed halls. His class was apparently legendary for their cheating. Nonetheless he was a charming and extremely competent individual who, in an alien environment, when the chips were down and there were no Indian classmates to ""cooperate"" with, hit the books hard and earned his Masters degree admirably.",1308191049

The further away from that you move, the more likely you are to end up being another one of the many PayPal horror stories that are all too common. Things that can't be confirmed ""shipped"" by a disinterested 3rd party raise a flag. Things that can't be verified as having been delivered to a specific physical address raise a flag.
