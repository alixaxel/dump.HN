Someone is unlikely to burgle a house using this technique, but it's a very practical method for determined attackers against otherwise hardened targets. With the prevalence of master and sub-master keying systems, the leak of a single key could potentially give access to dozens or hundreds of locks.

Which is really too bad, because Davis of all people might have appreciated a roughened, technially imperfected image that somehow did something new.<p>But this looks to me like a very low-resolution duplicate.  Only on inspection do I see elements that say ""pixel"", and these aren't particularly important or interesting.  All the examples cited by the OP are considerably more different from the original than the image in question.<p>To get more clearly into the category of ""fair use"", I would think the art would need more significant differentiation.  To an unexpert eye, these might be things like:
- Variation of the palette into something typical of an NES game
-  Revisit the perspective to make it more two-dimensional, as an older video game would (the image clearly depicts Davis at an angle in a way we wouldn't have expected in an 80s game console)
-  More exaggerated usage of ""pixelized"" elements
-  Introduction of elements / themes /motifs from other pixel art pieces
-  Turn the image upside down, put curious, ""where the hell am I?"" look on Davis' face
-  Pixelized chipmunk 
-  Pixelized Thelonious Monk<p>If the idea here wasn't to invest a lot of time into the image itself, and have some that plays the marketing role of 1950s cover art, then do something evocative but more clearly distinct.<p>Finding the line between ""derivative"" and ""creative"" is not a computable problem.  But it gets a lot easier with the quality of the art.  But it seems to me the photographer has a point.  Especially when I consider that the image real does look like a low-res JPEG -- if he tolerates that, the next question will be the difference between this and an actual low-res JPEG.<p>Now, could he have been nicer about it?

Not wanting to become type-cast as a Windows guy, I chose to do it on a unix based system. For this, I use an Ubuntu image in Virtual Box, and have been very happy.<p>> I just feel 'safer' in Windows.<p>I guess I could say I'm the same, though I think its more down to simply preferring Windows 7's UI/UX over the likes of Gnome and KDE. I've also tried customising a whole variety Linux window mangers, but always gave up.<p>So what I'm doing now is using Virtual Box in headless mode, then ssh-ing in with X-forwarding enabled. This gives me new icons in Windows 7's task bar for every 'remote' Linux window I have open. (though really I don't use much more than a terminal and maybe gvim). To an observer looking over my shoulder, it would just appear that the 'remote' Linux applications are native Windows programs.<p>[edit] I didn't really address your point about the learning curve to learning a new OS. This is valid issue and all I can suggest is to give it a try, and using a VM is an easy way to just dip in. You can get pre-installed Virtual Box images for many Linux distros such that it is really easy to get started. Unfortunately, my set-up took quite a bit of effort to get started (even with my familiarity with unix), but using a full-screen Linux VM is a good place to get started.<p>I guess what I was describing is just where you can go with it once you're comfortable.",1308917052
