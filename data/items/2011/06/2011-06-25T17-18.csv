Think of how many people asked you to write stories about them when you were at the Times, and that little part of you that died inside every time and made you actively NOT want to cover them simply because they asked.  Meanwhile, if you heard about someone doing something awesome <i>cough</i> Reddit <i>cough</i> you'd want to go write about what they're up to and spread the word.<p>It's the same for these kids.

2696136,comment,2695905,2695905,10,0,sardonicbryan,,,"I actually think one Interaction decision they made (intentionally or unintentionally) that helped with engagement a lot is the lack of a queue system for becoming DJ. Forcing people to be first to click to become a DJ when one leaves means that anyone who wants to be DJ means that everyone who wants to DJ has to be paying close attention/very engaged in the room, which probably leads to more chats, more thought put into what they will spin, etc.<p>This taps into people's natural desire to be seen and heard and impact the world around them, and also makes them more invested the longer they wait -- if you've been waiting for a DJ spot to open up for 30 minutes, or haven't been able to click in fast enough, you feel almost obligated to stay until you get one.

I don't see how you could arbitrage that into a profit.<p>Also, paying off (non-tax-deductible) loans essentially buys you <i>after tax</i> dollars, while investments must be bought with <i>pre tax</i> dollars (though some are capital gains taxes if you hold them long enough).  That's an additional 15-40% you have to chop off the return rates of investments when comparing them to paying off debt.",1309024278

So while not the best, that saves on the energy consumption to post process normal plant output into pure enough CO2 for sequestering.  That energy also has to come from somewhere.<p>Also, if a 50% conversion efficiency is realistic, that is a benefit, because the same energy output could be produced with a reduction in waste byproducts, or more energy output could be achieved with the current levels of waste byproducts.<p>Both are advantages.

Fortunately for me, the jobs aren't in demand - I am. This comes with the consequence though that there seem to be a lot of crap jobs out there, lots of people looking for experts in Java or .NET.<p>I'd like some advice on how to spot a job that will actually foster my intellectual growth, and not keep me stuck using the same language/technology day in, day out. I want to be encouraged to learn new programming languages and technologies on the job (or at least <i>for</i> the job). I want to actually be using my computer <i>science</i> background (I know a lot of interviewers ask questions about algorithms, but how many jobs actually require this knowledge?).<p>I don't want to be a glorified IT professional, and I really don't want to get stuck at some company lego-programming Java code, which is what I feel most of my non-academic work has accumulated to over the years. Maybe I'm being too harsh on myself, but its hard to be proud of my work when every 30 minutes I have to lookup an example or reference of some part of an API, and then modify it for my purposes. Maybe this is normal.<p>I'd like to think that I'm smart and passionate, but of course its hard for me to judge. That said, I'm confident that with enough work, I'll be able to land a job at my ideal company. The trouble is, I don't really know where to look.<p>For what I'm pursuing, what do you think are the best types of companies to look for. Will tech giants like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have what I'm looking for? Should I search for smaller companies to start with? What about start-ups, would this be a good idea for someone straight out of college? (note, I have no debt, and money isn't much of a concern to me... yet) Lets not forget industry either. Which industries do you think encourage what I'm looking for, and which will tend to stifle it?<p>I'd like to hear your advice and learn about your experiences after college. Most of my hardcore experience is in Java, C, and C++, so advice on convincing employers that I can pick up other technologies quickly would be appreciated as well. Thanks.",1309022795

It sucks!<p>There are 300 pieces of equipment with bill acceptance devices that have to be upgraded where I work but I've been transferred to a different section at work, my current job plus the out in the field, where there are 7000 more devices which have to be upgraded. That's just the hardware.<p>When the $100 polymer banknote is physically made the Bank of Canada sends the data to device vendors who use the data to create firmware to send to their clients, but they can only make the firmware once the Bank of Canada sends them the specs of each new poly banknote.<p>After the $100 note the least used by the general public then will be $50 the next least used. Then the last three which I would say will be released also from least to most used so: $10, $5 then finally the most commonly used is $20 bill.<p>Each time the notes are releases the device vendors get it first and make the firmware so that means five different firmware changes spread out over two years.<p>Add to that some bill acceptor devices have limited memory which means they may be able to hold data for one or two types of banknotes, different series version of the same denomination, other may be able to retain ten of each note.<p>It sucks but it's expected and it will improve security, I hear bill acceptance devices for Australia's poly money has nearly 100% acceptance rate of valid banknotes (100% rejection of fake notes).<p>I'm guessing since the notes are not paper there will be less bacteria (especially impetigo) contamination and shedding of paper dust which is a big problem if you work with currency.",1309021692

You need a small core to maintain it. For most applications this makes the most business sense as the trade off of having one or two people still on the project is less expensive than having IT manage the installs of native applications. The result of moving the enterprise to web apps should have been a massive shrinking of corporate IT head counts and a small increase in dev head counts. Instead we see them defending their budgets by inserting themselves between the user and the browser and performing these massive test cycles. It's simply an inefficient use of resources cause by enterprise empire builders don't want to see a shrinking of their power.",1309021491
