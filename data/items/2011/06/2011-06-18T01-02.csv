When someone down-votes something and then runs off, no one actually benefits in any way from that (unless the post that was down-voted was complete trash).<p>My extensive edit was an attempt to lure out the down-voters so that I could find out exactly where the wheels came off in the original post.<p>Looking back, I probably should have angled for a less confrontational tone in my edit, but I have a hard time getting tone across in these things.<p>You know, you spend less time typing each post than you would spend on a research paper or an email but more time than a text message. It is a challenging thing to get the tone just right. I much prefer face to face conversation any day of the week, but I like this place a lot.<p>The thing is that this is my first time actually <i>not lurking</i> on a site in nearly 10 years, and HN has its own unique culture.<p>Look, you've been on this site for more than an order of magnitude longer than me. Do you (or anyone else) feel like helping a newbie out:<p>When anonymous down-votes strike, is it better to reply to yourself, keep your edits small, or just walk away?",1308362373
2667726,comment,2667398,2667712,5,0,rkalla,,,"jerf, the oddest part is that if you read through the de-duplication and redundancy designs of modern SSD controllers (like the SandForce SF-2k series) not only do the drives do automatic de-duplication and compression on the fly, the scatter the bits evenly across the memory arrays (in parallel) to control even wear-and-tear of R/W cycles on the memory.<p>Then they typically write the bits to multiple locations or an entire section of the drive is maintained for parity information, sort of like an on-disk RAID5 setup where the individual blocks of NAND can be though of as ""disks"". For example, a 120GB drive typically has something like 150-160GB of storage space on the disk. This is not unlike what spindle disks do with a large section of disk not allocated to the format operation and kept behind for failed sectors that are re-allocated by the controller.<p>So <i>all</i> that work and the failure rates are still too high for comfort. It's really surprising to me and suggests that all of this needs more baking time.<p>I have no idea what the failure rates are in lower-end drives like the Kingstons and other drives that are likely rebranded garbage. I imagine it's not any better :)",1308362315

There are unquestionably a lot of operations that the SSD makes much faster. But in normal day to day use, I can barely tell the difference. Booting is fast as hell, but how often do I reboot? I don't compile much on either machine, but neither do most normal users. I don't think the average laptop user is i/o bound most of the time (unless they're swapping, and then the solution is more RAM not an SSD).<p>To me, the biggest benefit SSD gives is battery life. I like that it's quieter too. But neither of those is worth the price premium. Which is why I haven't stepped up for my home machine even though I get to compare it on a daily basis.",1308362149

It was a few hours' worth of work, and they were using CVS, and didn't really have a good branching model, so I didn't do any work-in-progress checkins.<p><i>While I was coding the feature</i>, the SSD failed.  This manifested itself via all sorts of strange compiler errors, and so I rebooted.  After that, Windows didn't show the SSD anymore, and my code was never seen again.<p>So, while the SSD did save me some time, I effectively lost it all when it failed, due in part to my stupidity, but also due to the fact that you need to understand that <i>if you buy an SSD, you MUST plan for failure</i>.

2667667,comment,2667398,2667398,42,0,rkalla,,,"Something to consider before going the SSD route: failure rates are high right now.<p>The Intel X-25 series seem to be doing OK, but the Vertex2 and Vertex3 (brand new SandForce 2k-based drives) have really terrible failure rates. I've heard mixed things about the Crucial drives.<p>I am sure you guys have read Jeff Atwood's post[1] about how every SSD they've put into machines in the last year has failed. I shared that around with a group of friends scattered around Chicago and the bay area - the friend in Chicago has a company with 30 employees. They have put SSDs in 12 of the developer machines, by the end of the year 10 had failed (Vertex2 drives).<p>I think SSDs have a lot to offer, the performance is there for the right use-cases (which is almost every disk I/O scenario save for a few), but for a lot of folks the idea of having drives fail <i>regularly</i> is a suicide-inducing though (current company included).<p>I'm sitting on my hands for an SSD not because I don't think they are awesome, too expensive or not big enough... I'm waiting because the failure rate seems to be painfully high in these things. I want some more time in the oven before I start sticking them in my work machines.<p>There also seem to be other non-failure related issues as seen with the Vertex3 launch that everyone jumped on; Lookup ""Windows BSOD Vertex3""[2] for a long list of issues. At least enough to make you take pause in buying one.<p>I have a 11 year old Fujitsu drive that is still running, an 8 year old Seagate 15k SCSI drive that is still chugging and the two SATA's in my desktop now are both 3 years old (no RAID)... I expect 5 years out of a drive at this point, turning the speed up to 11 at the expense of digging back into my workstations or servers to replace busted drives and rebuild RAID arrays... uggggg... at least for me that sounds super painful.<p>The only SSDs I would consider at this point if for some reason I had to get one are the Intel series, namely the 500 series. The X-25's (as mentioned) are still going strong with low failure rates and there is nothing to suggest the newer releases are any different. I'd rather see some 5-year results from those things before pulling the trigger though, which is why I haven't yet. I also haven't needed the insane speed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=windows+bsod+vertex3&qscrl=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&#3...</a>",1308360143

That way, VCs can protect their downside while investing in some of the companies that have the biggest potential.<p>That being said, these valuations are still quite high.",1308360100

It's a singular event obviously, so do you need to lead up to it with relevant content or will it just sell itself because people are already searching for it?  Are there ways to get a multiplicative effect out of it, say use it to boost other products?  Also, how do you keep taking advantage of it even after the event passes?",1308359685
