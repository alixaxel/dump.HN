Loopt isn't some shady company trying to steal people's credit card information for something malicious. Their goal, in the end, is something benevolent for all parties.<p>If they fail (which is likely for any startup) then it's because the idea wasn't a good. It stands to reason that they can make this clear to both parties: consumers and businesses. If they didn't at this point then I am sure they'll fix it because ultimately everyone actually will be angry. The market will answer so you need not worry. I am sure Loopt has done a sufficient amount of customer development before exhausting all their engineering bandwidth, marketing resources, and product focus--meaning you should consider giving them the benefit of the doubt.<p>Let businesses decide. It's not something you're capable of proving. Loopt likely is gaining more feedback about it then you realize.",1309056777

2697241,story,,,1,0,throwaway280287,"My startup is failing, I need advice.",,"Its been 10 months that we are working on our startup and it never gained traction that we would like to see. Its a social web application. Me and my co-founder are really good friends, we started working on this idea, just after college. We had couple of good offers to join, but we decided to do our own startup. Weve read all the essay's of PG, we have the hackers attitude. Weve worked our asses off, we got one funding offer as well, but that was too low to do anything, we are based out of India. Weve all the latest technology stack, djang/jquery/orbited/apachemq and all. Weve learned a lot of things during these 10 months, Ive became a different person altogether, from a college kid to an entrepreneur, have came a long way.<p>Coding, testing, deploying, releasing, going to the crowd, iterating, we have learned this all. Ive worked upon everything, from django to UI/UX, making banners to videos, PR to marketing, support to sales, everything. Its been a wonderful life so far. I wouldnt have learned all these things, had it been a regular job after college. I am so grateful for myself and my co-founder for letting me work on all these, all these months.<p>Its been an emotional roller coaster ride too,    many many strange, weird, unimaginable things happened too. We started with very small amount in hand, it was the worst decision among all others. Money started to become a problem of us. But we managed somehow.<p>The story has many twists as well, 3 months back, both of us lost our laptops, yes both of us. It was a painful time. It took us well two weeks to recover from that. We met with so called startup mentors of India, listened all the bad things one could listen, we iterated our product, pivoted again, but its a social app, it takes time to take off. Especially, if you are in India ( nothing that I am complaining). We have all the patience an entrepreneur can have. We got covered in national newspapers as well, but nothing big has happened so far.<p>Its been 10 months. We have simplified our product, removed almost all features, weve worked on the design, very hard, its come out good now.<p>Lessons that we have learned is, social web app is a saturated market, you are compared with facebook, even if you dont want, everything can be done by making a facebook app or whatever and you need a lot of good people/networking into the tech world to really get them off the ground. We lack it.<p>Final words, we are not doing good. We are in good state of mind, have taken all the positive things from it, me and my co-founder has a great co-ordination, its just that we didnt pick the right idea or we were too young then. Now, we are at the point that we want to take some decision, whether to move on, do something else or to stick on it for some more time.<p>Personally, I am thinking of working at a startup in SV. The biggest thing I lack is exposure, contacts and the experience of working in a real startup environment. I am not really sure, if that is even possible. But I really want to make things move fast from here on.<p>I need advice from fellow hackers.",1309056258

Gould systematically selected data from Morton's tables that tended to inflate the measured volumes of Native American crania. He did so by averaging some group means instead of overall means (although Lewis and colleagues show that Morton himself had used group means for many comparisons, contrary to Gould's claims), by excluding some small-skulled groups entirely (claiming sample size as a criterion), and by omitting crania that had not been measured in the earlier, seed-based analysis. There is no logical reason for these choices other than selection bias -- Gould began with a conclusion about Morton's unconscious motivations, and worked to confirm that conclusion by selecting some data and omitting contrary data.""<p>Paul Krugman's takedown of Gould<p><a href=""http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html</a><p>""What I encountered were quite a few references to Stephen Jay Gould, hardly any to other evolutionary theorists. Now it is not very hard to find out, if you spend a little while reading in evolution, that Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is bevolved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading.""<p>If you want some more this is good too.<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/</a><p>As an aside if someone can explain to me what the hell the big deal with spandrels is I'd appreciate it.

Still, in order for the anonymous source's testimony to carry any weight, there'd have to be some solid evidence.  Either they'd have to show traffic logs, or they'd have to show the results of forensics done on the suspect's hdd.  If you've properly distanced yourself from your activities, then there shouldn't be anything on your hard drive to implicate you.<p>Ultimately, it comes down to human fuckups.  Bradley Manning is not in jail because he didn't take security precautions, he's in jail because he talked to someone he shouldn't have.  The same will be true of any reasonably sophisticated hacking organization.  They can take all the precautions in the world, but a vengeful ex can bring the whole thing crashing down.",1309054486

Place the balls at the twelve points of the clock, note which way the balls rolled off (e.g., along the 3:00/9:00 axis), and then put those two balls and a normal ball at 12:00, 4:00 and 8:00 to see which way the pan tips and whether the abnormal ball falls off first (heavier) or last (lighter.)  However, I see from these comments and the solution on the site that it's actually a scale with two pans so this method does not work.",1309054404

Why not replicate TOR with a botnet?  Bounce your communications around a plethora of average joes and you have yourself a more stable tor.  If you spread the botnet without a CnC server and have the infected machines bounce random traffic around, it would be damned difficult to break.  TOR is open source, so it shouldn't be too hard to modify it to work on a private network.  The nice thing about it is that if you attract to much heat you can always ditch the network and start a new one.",1309053899
