Whenever I'm looking at people's profiles on LinkedIn, I'm looking at their work history and their recommendations, the other stuff being basically useless. And mostly I value recommendations coming from people I know.<p>So it's a social network and I think it is more pure and valuable than the Facebook graph since on LinkedIn you only want a thousand connections if you're an HR person, not because you need friends for Zynga games, so most people on LinkedIn have between 10-200 connections representing old colleagues.",1307951999

2648426,comment,2648305,2648415,8,0,utunga,,,"It won't do a perfect job, and their will be false positives, but the point is, unlike with spam in email - because of their asymmetrical following model, false positives are not nearly as much of a problem. Twitter should absolutely do this.<p>Twitter could easily detect spammers - by their follow history, reputation score (eg a google-rank link like SVD of the follow graph), or simple ratios like follows vs followers. It will inevitably false flag some people but that's not nearly so much of a problem.<p>That is, they don't have to outright ban these spammers, all they have to do is block these people from search results available for #hashtags or @replies.  In the case of genuine people false flagged as spammers, they can still get their message out to genuine followers. It's not too much of a loss to be banned from search results and @reply messaging until you build your karma level a bit.<p>You're absolutely right twitter should fix this and do it fast. It's a goddamn shame seeing a potentially very useful public resource - like adhoc organising around #hashtags - being destroyed by the actions of a few.<p>tl;dr Twitter can starve out the spammers just by blocking search results.",1307951799

2648424,comment,2647924,2647924,3,0,auganov,,,"As any other social site ever created it seems to be following the same path.\nEach month what I'm seeing on my landing page is getting less relevant and more annoying (even without growing my friend base too much and having around 20 friends, I cannot imagine what happens to those over 100). Most of that spam is generated by few active friends, while the rest does pretty much nothing.\nMost of communication that I see taking place is very very meaningless, somebody posts a video: ""lol"", ""haha"", ""nice one"", that's pretty much it.<p>For me it's a socially filtered spam [funny stuff?] site.<p>If some site can encourage people to have meaningful communication again it will take on Facebook, no doubt.\nGet 3 of my important friends on the site and I'm sold. Then Facebook just becomes a big contact list. And at that point I'm not sure where it goes. It might be a contact-list site for a long long time.<p>Facebook might not die as a website, but competitors will definitely takeaway a lot of value from it. And so far I don't see it becoming much more than a contact-list.<p>And keep in mind that the less engaged the users are the less ad revenue there will be. I have no doubt that as we're speaking right now users are less and less engaged with the site. Growth is still fast so the revenue is rising, but once that stops it will crumble.<p>The will have to get more aggressive with ads or people will simply stop to notice them at all. Or perhaps start selling more of the user data. At this point there's not much you can do.<p>Also the growth they see outside of the western world might be very much junk. I'm in Poland, Facebook craze is already old news here yet I get english ads? \nIt's great that AT&T has high speed internet for 20$, but I'm sorry, I cannot purchase that here.<p>Everybody knows ad revenue is tricky. Facebook is no different.<p>Nobody is going bankrupt, I'm not saying that. Facebook is here and it will stay for few more years for sure, but to compare it to google is crazy. Google can be conquered too I'm sure, but Facebook definitely makes for a far more fragile target.<p>Personally I'd say it will simply decay and we might not see another social site being that big in a long time to come. Facebook has half of the world on there, cool, but guess what, I am not connecting with those people and never will.<p>Facebook managed to get a lot of people registered in one place, but has it managed to truly connect a lot of people?

As a first step to finding tweets relevant to chch earthquake and filtering out spam it does also allow for filtering by address when people mention an actual address in the tweet.<p>For example if they say 'at 23 Maidavale lane' or 'in Sydenham' it tags those tweets as being in a particular suburb and in the region of canterbury. For example:\n<a href=""http://chchneeds.org.nz/#!/loc/canterbury"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chchneeds.org.nz/#!/loc/canterbury</a><p>I had grander ideas for this but it was all about people in canterbury choosing to actively use the tags #offer and #need. When I realised that eq.org.nz and their volunteers were doing a better job of filtering and sorting (and getting their message out) than i put my time into helping them.<p>At this time eq.org.nz has been shut down as it does use quite a lot of volunteer hours to keep going, but everyone and anyone is welcome to try and use the data from chchneeds in anyway that they think it may helps. It's all open data made publically available of course. I'm @chchneeds on twitter if you want to get in touch with me.<p>Also for what its worth I also set up a similar service for the japanese earthquake, but was overwhelmed by the amount of data, and I wasn't keeping up so I had to shut it down.

At the beginning this heterogeneity was seen as an advantage because the amount of easily accessible information was unparalleled. However, in the past few years it seems like most successful platforms (be it YouTube, Facebook, Tumblr, Amazon, Wikipedia, iOS, etc.) have done well because there was a consistent and one-stop shop experience throughout.<p>There is still tons of room on many different verticals to improve and disruption to occur, but I wouldn't expect things to come full circle.",1307949440
