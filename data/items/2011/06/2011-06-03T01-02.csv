2614863,comment,2614347,2614401,1,0,mindcrime,,,"Just keep in mind that Java and Javascript are two totally different things, and have very little in common.  The naming thing is just a historical legacy of some branding / marketing strategy that Netscape jumped on back in the '90s.<p>As for Play Framework... yep, I've heard <i>of</i> it, but I haven't used it.  Everything I've heard has been favorable, but by the time I got wind of it, I'd put a lot of time into Grails and am using it pretty heavily now.  And if I were to switch away to something else now, I'd look hard at Lift or something else using Scala.  But Scala would probably have a steeper learning curve for you, which is why I didn't mention it before.  With Groovy, the syntax is mostly a superset of Java, so it's very easy to start writing Groovy as just ""java files renamed to .groovy"" then introduce the Groovy stylings and idioms as you learn.<p>But anyway, yeah, spending some time playing (no pun intended) around with Play and evaluating it, probably wouldn't be a bad idea either.  :-)",1307066377

The behavioral patterns are very similar to a pump-and-dump scheme: many people have a large number of coins (usually acquired at a low price through early mining) and are aggressively and inaccurately promoting Bitcoins to people whose money they will be taking.  Bitcoin as a technology has the potential in concept to be more than a scam, but the way it is being used appears, for all practical purposes, to be indistinguishable from a scam.  Like Groupon, it gives people the appearance of a vested interest and turns them into marketers.<p>Even if not a scam, your conclusion that it's currently entirely speculative is inescapable.",1307066258

At my current employment, we had issues with xen and raid drivers for example which did not work with the xen kernel (but that may be our own incompetence).<p>When KVM was first out, it required support from the CPU, whereas xen did not. KVM still requires this CPU support, but it is very hard to buy a x86 CPU without the feature nowadays, whereas it was not so common 3-4 years ago.

It absolutely blows on OS X for whatever reason.<p>That said the point of Flash on Android is not to have guaranteed high performance, fluent apps that work like native ones. That's an impossible goal - for one, Adobe cannot control what kind of Flash/AS code all of the developers out on the web will write.<p>And secondly on my Xoom with 3.1 - Flash works great enough - no stutter or crashes. Does the job. So as more decent hardware comes out and they optimize Flash even more it will become better.<p>This whole cult like insanity people have created for and against Flash is mind blowing - it's there you can use it if you want, don't if you don't. No one is forcing anything down your throats folks. For me I will take reasonably working Flash instead of not working at all.<p>Oh and before you beat up the HTML5 drum - it's not there yet and it's not the absolute reality of the web today.",1307064371

2614742,comment,2611281,2612525,6,0,kragen,,,"There are several confusions in your short post.<p>First, assuming you're talking about the US, your bank accounts are insured by the FDIC, and the FDIC is not part of or formally backed by the US government. There are lots of people who believe that if the FDIC were in danger of bankruptcy, the US government would step in to support it  as it did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  but until the government actually promises to do that, you can't call it a ""vote of confidence"".<p>Second, the US government's dollar position is short, not long  its dollar-denominated debts are greater than its dollar-denominated assets.  In financial terms, a short position is a way to bet <i>against</i> the value of the underlying commodity.  The US government is currently about $7 million million dollars ""short"".<p>An illustration may help to clarify. Suppose you are a private in the Zimbabwean military in September 2007.  Suppose your monthly pay is about US$180, but you are paid in Zimbabwean dollars, so your pay packet is actually Z$5.4 million for the month.  The Zimbabwean dollar has been hyperinflating, and you expect it to continue to lose value.  You don't currently need to pay any expenses. Consider the following options:<p>A. Keep the Z$5.4 million in cash.<p>B. Immediately buy other commodities with it; for example, buy 300 kilograms of rice and store it in Tupperware in the pantry.<p>C. Immediately buy other commodities with it, and also borrow an additional Z$10 million some poor sucker is willing to lend you at an extortionate 20% APR, and use that to buy rice too.<p>Option ""A"" is maintaining a ""long"" position in the Zimbabwean dollar.  This amounts to a bet that the Z$ will retain its value.  If you had taken this option, you would have lost 90% of your salary within a few weeks.<p>Option ""B"" is maintaining no position in the Zimbabwean dollar.  It doesn't matter what the Zimbabwean dollar does thereafter; you still have the same amount of rice.  (Practically speaking, in situations like this, there tend to be price controls on most things you can buy with the collapsing currency.)<p>Option ""C"" is maintaining a ""short"" position in the Zimbabwean dollar.  If you had somehow found such a sucker, then within a few weeks, you could have paid them back by selling off a tiny percentage of the rice you bought, as the Zimbabwean dollar continued to inflate.<p>This is the position the US government has taken relative to the US dollar.<p>There are, of course, other reasons to take long or short positions on commodities other than speculation on their future value.<p>Third, even if we accept the premise that the implicit guarantee of the US government to keep the FDIC afloat amounts to ""the US government is willing to insure my bank accounts"", that is simply a further short position.  FDIC insurance is for dollar-denominated accounts up to a fixed dollar limit.  Whoever is on the hook to underwrite that insurance in the end, they'll have an easier time paying out their claims if the US dollar loses value.  If your bank account has $78000 in it and the currency loses  of its value (which happened here in 2001), the FDIC bailout only has to come up with the current equivalent of $19500 to pay you back.<p>Fourth, the government is not ""more than people"".  It's just people.",1307062899
