2715511,comment,2714917,2714917,5,0,thomaslangston,,,"It is bad.  The main problem (besides the black toolbar which blights every new design) is that full day events are black text on the calendar's color (e.g. green).  This would be fine if I could select a light color, but the timed events are on a white background.  So I can read one, or the other, but not both.  Why get rid of the white text for full day events?<p>The create button looks gimmicky and cartoonish as well.  I feel like this is the result of UX testing gone terribly awry.  A bunch of individual metrics (how long till a user can figure out how to create an event, how long till a user can identify which page they are on, etc.) without a coherent aesthetic to bind it or any other holistic thinking beyond ""make it the same across all devices"".",1309463918
2715510,comment,2715302,2715478,2,0,hugh3,,,"If I have just one criticism of google+ so far, it's that the look-and-feel is just a bit too white and sterile at the moment. It feels like hanging out with your friends in a hospital waiting room.<p>Of course that's partially just that there's not much going on there yet, compared to facebook... but the other part is a page design issue. Facebook feels more intimate partly because of the use of colour, but partly because of the small fonts and lack of white space and photos everywhere.<p>Aside from that, the ""Circles"" feature is precisely the right functionality. Why yes, I <i>would</i> love to be able to sort my ""friends"" into ""people I've met at least twice"" vs ""people I actually like"" vs ""people I actually like who <i>also</i> live locally"" and so forth.<p>edit: Oh, and one other major criticism: it's picky about browser, and won't work on either of my work machines. I can understand it not liking the Firefox 2.0.0.12pre that I have on my desktop machine, but the Firefox 3.5 on this laptop can't be <i>that</i> out of date, can it?<p>On the other hand, that could be a feature too.

2715497,comment,2714270,2715067,5,0,Silhouette,,,"> In reality, she only uses it for calling, texting, e-mail and facebook, and it's not inferior at all for those things.<p>I was in the market for a decent phone for my own business purposes a few months ago.<p>I don't use (and don't want a UI to be cluttered by) MyTwitBook+.<p>I do want phone calls and messaging. I do want some basic PIM tools. I do want some basic web browsing and <i>useful</i> apps. And I want them to be easy to use, efficient, and safe.<p>For me personally, that means things like a physical keyboard, good sync'ing with other devices and software I work with, and robust security features on the phone. (I tried the leading smartphones at the time, and just didn't get on with touchscreens for typing significant amounts of text.)<p>Does this sound like any particular company's traditional target market? Of course it does.<p>Then I went to the store, and checked out the BlackBerry Torch. And I found that its screen was half the resolution of everyone else's model of that generation. I found that its e-mail integration wasn't nearly as straightforward as it could be. I found that it didn't have a well-established browser that could put up modern web sites at an acceptable speed.<p>Best of all, I found that the store wanted to charge me several hundred pounds to get a Torch on a 24-month lock-in plan. In the UK, I could at the time have picked up a top-of-the-range phone from pretty much anyone else for free on a 24-month plan, or I could have bought those top-of-the-range devices unlocked to use on any carrier's monthly plan for not much more than the money the Torch was going to cost me with the lock-in.<p>In short, I should have been RIM's perfect customer. I wound up buying a £20 Nokia non-smartphone on a 1-month plan, which still gets me the separate number/phone for business use that I really wanted, and I just use a laptop or similar for the other stuff. As my younger friends might say, epic fail.",1309463661

It would be basically a Hail Mary strategy for both companies (definitely more for RIM than for HP at this point). Apotheker has said that HP is looking to license webOS with other companies right now.

From what I gather, RIM has strengths in their business partnerships, and decent hardware. UX isn't one of them (point #1).<p>So outsource the OS to one of the companies that has bucket loads of cash to spend on UX and developer relations, pair it with RIM's own strengths, and reap the benefits of both.<p>RIM is essentially in the same boat as Nokia, but without a CEO that has the balls to make changes where needed.",1309463302

Now if light leaves A it has to travel that 1.54bn ly to point B; it shouldn't take 12.9bn ly to do this.  \nHowever, A and B aren't fixed points - so though the light from A is heading towards B, B is trying to run away (albeit at a slower pace).  Here, Ifran's calculated the minimum average speed at which B would be running from A as .88c (if we assume that light from B is moving at c and not influenced by any interference, and that both A and B moved at c for the first .77bn years).  That seems to be moving too fast, given at this stage in the universe's life the known/current laws of physics apply.  Redshift can account for some of this, and Inflation means that the starting distance can also be much larger than the assumed 1.54bn ly, which hopefully explains the rest?",1309461545

Like almost all PaaS product, there are restrictions that limit what you can do (library support, native code support, etc) and these limits frustrate developers that go in expecting the same experience as having a virtual machine. The limits mean that App Engine isn't the right solution for every application under the sun. But if your application doesn't have super unique requirements, the value that App Engine provides is hard to beat.<p>Ten second deployments, one click version management (and roll back), logs and monitoring, and autoscaling mean that we can be really agile pushing new versions of the application.  App Engine's recent changes to the scheduler and Always On feature have really solved the slow instant start issue that still plagues a lot of Heroku developers.  Last year the datastore had a ton of performance and reliability issues, but the new high replication configuration appears to have solved the problem. The biggest issue for us is the one that's mentioned here a couple of times and that's SSL.<p>For now, App Engine is nearly perfect for us. If we end up with unique requirements, we can definitely spin up a few EC2 instances and hook them up to App Engine's Task Queue. But I'm not excited about having to manage machines. Personally, if we hit a limit with App Engine, we'd be looking to another PaaS offering like Heroku or dotCloud, or Infrastructure as a Service like MongoHQ/RedisToGo before bothering to deal with machines again.",1309461499

They'd have a huge drop in operating expenses because they'd be supporting a much narrower field of business lines.<p>I'm not sure they'd see a significant drop in operating expenses.  Their development expenses in particular wouldn't change, unless they're going to completely give up on actually delivering a competitive product.  When your company is built on delivering a device, selling fewer of the devices just means your profit margin goes down.  It doesn't actually make the devices cheaper to design, implement, or manufacture.<p>> Maybe if you only look at the history you choose to. I'd venture that 80% of all successful business is focusing on a niche. It's easier to do one thing well than it is to do everything half ass, and that will always create opportunity.<p>That's only true if the niche is one that has demands a mainstream product cannot fill.  When a mainstream product meets the needs of the niche, the niche evaporates.  For example, you see that corporations have niche systems for land-lines, because there is no mainstream demand for complex call systems.  No one needs 1000 lines in their home and so Avaya and Cisco don't try to sell PBX systems to the public.  On the other hand, there are no niche desktop systems in corporations.  They use the same Dell or HP systems as home users.  There's no value in a niche product, so the niche product no longer exists.<p>Smart phones are an example of where the corporate niche is evaporating.  There's no requirement for a company to use Blackberry devices.  At this point, it's basically just a legacy concern.  If an Android phone can do the same job, then what's the value in standardizing on Blackberry, especially if Blackberry becomes a niche -- and therefore more expensive  -- option?<p>> Um, no, they aren't. I'd love this to be so, but it isn't. Apple and Android are focusing on the consumer. You need to consider the fact that at a certain level, the needs of consumers and corporations are divergent. It's extremely difficult to focus on two groups with opposing interests and serve both well. This is essentially my argument.<p>Except this isn't true.  Corporate needs and personal phone needs are very nearly the same.  They both need voice service, email, maybe SMS.  Corporations might need VPN, but that's built into the ""consumer"" phones as well.<p>Please tell me what it is you think corporations need that they can't get from a RIM competitor?  And especially please clarify how corporate users and consumers have <i>opposing</i> interests.<p>> You seem to be making a case that employees will not carry two devices, while at the same time forgetting that one doesn't cost them anything.... As a person that would love an iPhone but who has a corporate issued blackberry, the fact that I have a free device is more than enough to comfort my lack of app selection and better UX.<p>So what you're saying is that all of your needs are actually met by your Blackberry?  Doesn't that mean that your claims about personal vs corporate needs being different/conflicting are incorrect?<p>But to answer you, no, I didn't forget that.  I'm saying that some people choose to pay for an iPhone rather than carry a free Blackberry.  This may not be the case for you, but I've seen it at my company.  I've also seen people who carry two phones.",1309461380

I've always thought that you'd need another dimension to describe that, and another dimension for the square root of <i>that</i> unit, and so on.<p>But no.  (Let's tackle sqrt(i) as a simpler case first.)  We can answer sqrt(i) in terms of rotation as described in the article.  i is a rotation from the unit vector by 90°, so applying that twice turns 1 into -1.  What operation applied twice would result in i?  This just clicked: a 45° rotation.  Thus the unit vector at a 45° angle is the square root of i: 0.5√2 + 0.5√2 * i.<p>The mathematical approach bears that out.  Follow the rules of complex number arithmetic to square 0.5√2 + 0.5√2 * i (multiply it by itself) and you do indeed get i.<p>And we can solve sqrt(-i) the same way.  -i is a 270° rotation from the unit vector 1.  So the square root of -i is a 135° rotation, or -0.5√2 + 0.5√2 * i.<p>Finally, a 270° rotation is equivalent to a -90° rotation.  So -45° should also be a square root of -i, and indeed it is.  Multiplying 0.5√2 + -0.5√2 * i by itself also gives you -i.  We've arrived back at the axiom that all numbers have two square roots of opposite signs.  135° and -45° are the same vector pointing in exactly opposite directions.<p>Last question:  What's the <i>cube</i> root of i?  Easy: a 30° rotation.  The 30° unit vector is 0.5√3 + 0.5i, and cubing that does indeed get you i.",1309461317

The nut of the problem for me is that it's obvious you're intending a profit making venture (tos, etc.) but you aren't telegraphing where the money comes from. With heroku, etc. it's clear what their intent would be (paid hosting) even when embryonic or unstated. As many IDE's are free without service terms if your intent is to sell SaaS, perhaps a ""beta testers get free (blip) when we launch"" - or whatever.

Basically you are contributing in a way that adds value, because you add value to the community. I think this is true of most of the people with good karma here -- each person contributes in his/her own way, and the sum of those is a community. I like that you think to ask, but I think the fact that you care enough to ask obviates the need for feedback.<p>Second -- I take slight issue with the notion that persistent but average input is somehow not valuable to the community. Average here is pretty darn good, it's what attracts readers. The comments in large part are not super-comments or majorly insightful. They are just discussion, the whole of which provides usefulness to people like me.<p>Third -- Please keep contributing in any way you see fit. HN is good and you aren't lowering that.",1309460461
