1)How about being able to up-vote comments? Some insights and comments are more valuable to your core community; and it would be convenient for them to be able to see that reflected, as well as allowing them to encourage it.<p>2)How about being able to merge similar or duplicate posts; so instead of duplicated posts in a subject you would see all the duplicated posts under the most popular/valuable post, as chosen by the users' up-votes.<p>It is a general-knowledge based site right now.

While the numbers aren't broken out directly in their market filings, it is both obvious from their behavior, and support by quite a number of analysts that the App Store(s) return significant operating profit to Apple.<p>Cook suggests they run the service ""just a bit ahead of break even"" which would suggest that they're up instead of down, but even that presumably dubiously includes a large swath of media buys that are arguably more promotional for the ecosystem as a whole than simply getting iPhone users to go buy an album or app today. There's a reason that they don't break it out: pissing off their content partners.<p>Think about it.

You can't file a patent without inventing something; to be enforceable, a patent must document a ""best known mode"" of operation sufficient to enable someone reasonably skilled in the disciplines relevant to the patent to actually build the thing.<p>So this article does not in fact suggest that you can file ""hover jellybeans"" just because the thought occurred to you to do so. Rather, it adjusts a somewhat arcane dispute resolution system that many of you didn't even realize existed so that the patent system in fact works the same way you thought it did, which is that the first person to file a document describing and enabling an invention unencumbered by prior art wins the patent.<p>Presaging the ""OMG WTF PATENT LOL"" stuff, let me say: <i>I don't care</i>.

I've heard it argued that this kind of pricing for scarce products would damage the brand (e.g. no-one wants to hear about $500 tickets for a concert, and wants a mix of customers rather than the perception that everyone at concert X or buying product Y are rich douchebags).<p>The promoters, or Apple, or whoever, are leaving some money on the table in order to spread early access to the product to people who are enthusiasts, not necessarily those who want to spend the most money.<p>What you've decided to do is to try to take this money off the table yourself, in ignorance of the social conventions that you're violating.<p>I wish your business a slow death, but a speedy journey to hell!",1308020912

Make extrapolations as necessary.<p>Remember your first year (or two?) of development?  Looking back, you were probably way in over your head, had mentors looking after you, making tons of mistakes etc.<p>Fast forward 5 years.  Can you write code faster? Probably not. Can you write better code? Sometimes.  It's all about experiences and learning from them.  When you take a new job, or a new project, or a new anything, you call upon past experiences to guide the efforts of this process.  It might be something as vague as ""I am going to write tests first because I found it helped me earlier"", or (ignoring TDD), ""I'm not going to write this function like this, because I know the code will be hard to test when I get around to writing a test for it later""<p>You learn this all from experience.  Senior people who have been in the field longer have more experience.  They aren't ""better"" in the sense that they are smarter or have more intelligence, they just know MORE because they've been exposed to more.<p>It's also why so many people (especially in hacker news) have been successful without degrees.  It's not a degree that matters it's EXPERIENCE.<p>It might be a fine line differentiating between smartness gained from pure intelligence and ""smartness"" gained via experience, but I think it's an important distinction, and one that I think this post highlights well.",1308020614
