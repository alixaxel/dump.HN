N log N is 100 times better than N^2 as soon as N is over about 1000.  (The obvious-to-me way to implement an ordered map in Python would be to maintain a dict and a sorted list of keys; inserting N items into a sorted list is N^2.)<p>Second, this kind of data structure <i>might</i> be fast in PyPy. Like, C-like fast, or worse in the constant factors by only a factor of 2 or 5.  Certainly you could imagine JIT optimizing dynamic language implementations where that was the case.

2671492,comment,2670224,2670636,2,0,seats,,,"I didn't hear the author call anyone racist. In fact I think you are only supporting his point. These kids were minorities in at least two ways, race and age (for the girl there is a third). I would say that age was clearly the biggest deterrent for people joining their efforts and the tone of the article to me was more about age than race. Even look at the title, it says '11 year olds learn hard lesson', no mention of race. Two white 11 year old kids would have had the same tough lesson.<p>These kids are minorities at this event mostly because they are minors. That'll fix itself in time and I commend the author for trying to help keep their spirits up so that this was a positive experience for them instead of a let-down.<p>There is also something interesting to say here about the psychology of voting without commitment. If the voting at this event was your true ranking of which team you wanted to join (i.e. you rank all ideas and join the top one that makes the cut), then no one would have picked these kids. When there was nothing on the line, no one wanted the kids to feel bad so they got some 'mercy votes' or maybe 'cute kids, nice try' votes, but when it got down to voting with your feet, no one thought their ideas or abilities were attractive enough over the alternatives.",1308509709

Rather than spending time and resources convincing companies to download and try your product, you instead have to spend time and resources convincing companies to actually <i>pay</i> for your product.<p>If you don't add a lot of value and it's not something business rely on, then it's a tough business model (vlc, etc.).  However, when you're software is used by companies who value their time <i>more</i> than money (I'm channeling Jonathan Schwartz here), you are in good shape.<p>I've worked with numerous companies that were all happy to pay the Redhat, MySql, and Jboss licensing fees once the product was up and running and profitable.  Suddenly a few thousand dollars a server seems kind of inconsequential if it means at any moment you can have developers on the phone getting your app back up.<p>The argument of the Open Source paradox could just as easily be applied to SAAS in general.  As software and hardware becomes easier to set up, run, and administer all while being more reliable, than surely people will move away from SAAS?  Of course not.  Just because a company <i>can</i>, doesn't mean they want to stray from their core competency to save a few bucks.  Same goes for buying support contracts from Open Source companies.",1308509703

Also it isn't implementable on all Unixes.<p>The way it works is that if you say<p><pre><code>    foo <(bar) -o >(baz) <(quuz)
</code></pre>
foo sees them as command-line arguments, which might look like<p><pre><code>    foo /dev/fd/3 -o /dev/fd/4 /dev/fd/5
</code></pre>
and if it is clever enough to treat them as filenames and open them, then it will get the stdout of bar, the stdin of baz, and the stdout of quux, respectively.<p>The way this works is that the shell opens pipes to the other command lines first, then generates filenames for them.<p>I did not know that you could use it with other I/O redirections such as <!<p>As a bonus, the <() syntax means you can pipe even to and from commands that don't read from stdin or stdout.
