Perhaps this phenomenon can be accounted for by observing the proliferation of superfluous polysyllabic adjectives which have doubtlessly been deployed strategically to serve as an <i>argumentum a contrario</i> to Mr. Sanger. And under the influence of the philosopher Marshall McLuhan's famous slogan, ""The medium is the message,"" may we not risk the hypothesis that those who, in the language of the intellectual, dispute the relevance of the intellectual thereby refute themselves?",1307498265

2631735,comment,2631522,2631522,17,0,shawnee_,,,"It could probably be rationally argued that cartel behavior is as destructive as (or more destructive than) monopoly behavior in a capitalistic economic system.<p>In a monopolistic situation there's almost always incentive for those ""outside"" the monopoly to weaken or disband the monopoly's stronghold; if enough individuals join together and engage in cartel behavior <i>independently</i> from the monopoly, the market at least turns into a duopoly.  However, in a cartel situation where there's no threat of duopoly or oligopoly, there's <i>more</i> incentive to join the cartel than there is to attempt to disband the central monopoly that's essentially controlling the cartel.  It's almost like high-level blackmail because it makes the monopoly stronger while weakening the incentive to compete ""outside"" the monopoly.<p>For example -- my favorite soapbox issue:  the National Association of Realtors.  They could be likened to a cartel of people unified in their incentive to keep their ""spread"" around 6.x percent.  These IPO financiers are likely in the same boat:  they all know and silently agree that they're better of keeping their spread at 6.x or 7.x percent than they would be going off on their own or using their ""little"" money to compete with the ""big"" money of IPOs.",1307498057

The anti-intellectuals are the people who react badly to this overwhelming sense of one's own smallness.<p>In 1900, colleges decided what it was important for an upper-middle-class person to know. One set of writers and texts was in the canon; the rest were not. Sometimes the selection was based on quality but it was often political as well. It wasn't actually possible to have ""all knowledge"" but one could get all the ""important"" knowledge in a few years of study. Any thinking person in 2011 realizes that this is no longer true (if it ever was). There's a million times more genuinely valuable knowledge out there than anyone can take in in a human life. Also, the authorities once trusted to decide what was important have been disrobed by technology; the increased power of technology has allowed us to discern that they aren't much smarter than the rest of us.<p>Anyway, the result is that a lot of people get really insecure and overwhelmed when they realize how much they know nothing about, and there's a tendency among some people, as a defense mechanism, simply to declare large sectors of knowledge useless, unimportant, or outmoded.<p>It's not just the less intelligent who have this attitude either. I've heard an esteemed computer scientist (someone with a name, but I'll withhold it here) argue that the only useful literature is science fiction because everything else is ""just the seven deadly sins, over and over again"".",1307496155

(I do, but I pay big-city rent for a reason.) Instead, let's talk about modern information technology.<p>Have you ever visited tvtropes.org? Don't go if you don't have the rest of the day to waste. It is <i>seriously</i> addictive, mostly because it's a sterling example of hypertext in action, maybe even better than Wikipedia. Every article is linked to the others. Every citation has a link. You want to check a reference, you click. You want to surf a chain of references <i>N</i> generations back, you click <i>N</i> times. You can't <i>not</i> follow the links on tvtropes.org, unless you simply hate all pop culture.<p>It is the height of irony that HTTP was originally invented to link up academic publications, because when last I surfed academic journals, six years or so ago, it didn't work that way. You would click a journal article, maybe click through a couple of crappy login screens, maybe navigate up and down some menus on some journal's CMS, and finally find the article after a bunch of surfing. It would have footnotes. The footnotes were almost never links. Instead you had to manually type their key information into your local library's website in some other window, and then hope that your local library had the journal, then surf through some more screens and up and down some more delightful CMS cruft before you found the article.<p>Smart folks would download PDFs of everything as they went and then file them in some personal database like Endnote. But they still wouldn't be cross-linked. You had to spend time organizing them, or use the search a lot.<p>I assume that this workflow has improved at least a bit since then. Maybe Endnote or its competitor is smarter, maybe journals have finally started publishing hyperlinks. Maybe it has even improved to the point that academic literature is half as easy to surf as, say, tvtropes.org. In which case I take back much of what I said, and we can go back to estimating how many people can actually be expected to access the blessed terminal where all of this can happen. But I bet it hasn't improved that much. I bet it's still impossible to construct a hyperlink from <i>Nature</i> directly to <i>Science</i>, mostly because they've got different and incompatible DRM.<p>Mind you, things are heaven compared to when <i>I</i> was in grad school, when following references from a paper meant going into the stacks, laboriously collecting one heavy paper volume per footnote, physically hauling them back to a photocopier, and copying the articles two pages at a time. Oh, the hours I spent. Life is much better now. But, you know, young people don't know or care about how hard <i>I</i> had it. All they can see is that it's fifty times easier to research the plot of any episode of <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i> than it is to follow a chain of citations from a Nobel-winning publication back two generations, and that a popular article about a videogame from 1980 can link to its sources but a popular article about a publication from last Wednesday's <i>Nature</i> can only link to a paywall.<p>Science is always going to be a hard sell compared to the rest of our culture, so why do we make it even harder?",1307495528
