2677959,comment,2676739,2677033,5,0,cschwarm,,,"I would say you're mixing two different things: (1) irrational beliefs, and (2) worship. Belief in homeopathy, psychic powers, alien abductions are examples for (1), but lack (2).<p>There is good evidence that we're predisposed for (1): Our brains seem to have ""interpreters"", located mostly in the left brain hemisphere, that are trying to make ""sense"" from the input (Gazzaniga, M.S.: The Ethical Brain, 2005).<p>There are two situations when this gets more obvious:<p>1. When the brain input (or the brain connections) is partially broken. For instance, if one shows split-brain patients the word ""Walk"" so that only right brain hemisphere notes it, they stand up and walk. When asked why they did what they just did, they often come up with an ad hoc explanation: ""I just wanted go get a coke."" This is the interpreter working, trying to make sense from the fact that the person just stood up although the interpreter had no signal from other parts of the brain about possible reasons.<p>2. When the brain input is ""unexpected"". In psychology, so-called ""non-deterministic"" (or non-contingent) experiments make the participant believe she can influence the results or reactions of a setting, although, in fact, she can not. In such situations, humans also come up with explanations even if there's nothing to explain. In other words, they are trying to make sense out of non-sense input. These experiments go back to B.F. Skinner who was able to induce superstitious behavior in pigeons. [1]<p>What's interesting is how resistant some of these beliefs are. Generally speaking, the more effort is put into an explanation, the more resistant to change.<p>Worship, on the other hand, seems to be a more complex and special kind of belief. It's not just trust without doubt or unreasonable admiration, but also magical thinking: the idea to be able to influence reality by appealing to a powerful being.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner#Superstition_in_the_pigeon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner#Superstition_in_t...</a>",1308646664

2677954,comment,2675975,2676887,1,0,weel,,,"I think you are right. But that does not mean that this isn't in Uber's interest. Normally, it's not in any business's interest to lower prices to the point where you don't have enough capacity. That would be leaving money by the curbside that you can readily grab, and it would not even be particularly useful for your customers, because your product still needs to be allocated and customers end up spending time and effort to get their slice if they cannot simply buy it. But that reasoning assumes that everybody who might like your product already knows about it. And that simply isn't true for Uber, which is why they need all the marketing they can get; and what better marketing than this. The fact that they are rubbing up against a popular-in-SF (if batty) trade unionist ideology only makes it better, because that will mean more newspaper coverage.",1308646493

The union represents a small number of taxi drivers and tries to improve their economic position at the expense of that of everybody else in the city. Moreover, basic price theory shows that the union is likely to hurt ""the people"" (i.e. everybody else) more than it helps the drivers, because they don't just increase the fare (which would be a pure transfer from customers to providers -- fair or not, it's not a net loss) but they also decrease the number of rides.

The bank panics didn't have lasting damage, recovery was fast and they didn't get bailed out by the government. Perhaps government control has mitigated against these little panics, but it set the stage for real meltdowns and slow recovery afterwards.<p>There are two distinct functions banks do: money storage and lending. These can be completely separate. You only need a money store for the convenience of not having to carry metal. Nowadays, you may want an electronic store as not to have to carry cash.<p>As for lending, that is a function much older than banks themselves. You don't need consumer deposits to lend money. Some banks do operate that way, but there should be a more clear distinction. We could have 'vault banks' and 'lender banks'.<p>Both 'vault banks' and 'lender banks', or combinations can operate in a free market.",1308645922

Then the scores were removed and I found myself regularly having to sift through the comment thread cause, like what the OP says, the top comments are more than likely the people who commented the earliest on the thread. In a comment thread where you have at least 30+ comments, you do sometimes find some interesting comments in the middle of the thread but again, without comment scores, I have to go through every one of them to pick out what is good or not. I would more than likely not be bothered if the thread had 100+ comments unless I'm absolutely interested in that topic or if it had comment scores.<p>As for your solution, I disagree with the bigger the karma of the scorer = the more points is added to a comment score.<p>I've seen this before in a particular forum and what I noticed was that users will start ""blindly"" agreeing or pandering to users with high karma just to get them to vote on their comment. I.e. If pg disagrees with say climate control, and a topic comes up in regards to that, you'll more likely see the comment thread heavily gravitating towards pg's views.

I've got a ZuneHD, and it is much more usable than the iPod touch (I had one of those too).<p>Though usability had a significant affect on the initial strength of the iPod, I believe it was Apple's HUGE marketing effort the created exponential growth.<p>I see the same thing in the current market. As Apple is selling both hardware and software, and taking all the profits, they invest heavily in marketing and create a single consistent message. If we compare that to Android, who is responsible for marketing? The hardware manufacturers are doing most of the marketing, which creates a fragmented message re: Android, as each maker is trying to sell their hardware. People can only absorb so many messages, and I think it gets confusing for people.<p>I think comparing the two markets is a bit simplistic. Due to the app ecosystem, and a stronger demand in OS capabilities, I think this will be a different market. But Apple's strength in marketing and current 'darling' status should be considered in any market comparison. The market gives Apple a halo, and Apple has been exceptionally good at keeping it polished.",1308644332

I've heard only great things about what you're doing, and I hope you can improve the quality of web translations in Japan.<p>I've been involved in a number of multi-lingual Japanese sites, and I wonder how you feel about competition from Japanese companies.<p>As I'm sure you know, translation is one of those things that every large company knows they need, but doesn't want to spend a lot of time and or money on. Accessing an API and getting translations seems to be well beyond what most web companies here are capable of, and so you see companies like J-Service[1] which gives their 1-click solution to site translations. I've seen a number of sites (usually s or s) that have used J-Service as a quick-fix for their translation needs.<p>While services like J-Service have a number of failings (SEO being the big one), their ease of deployment makes them a low-hanging fruit for a lot of sites.<p>Do you find yourself tempted to go in a similar route with MyGengo, or are you more focused on a global strategy with your API at the forefront?<p>Keep up the great work!<p>[1]<a href=""http://www10.j-server.com/pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www10.j-server.com/pro/</a>",1308644301

Well, you could for instance ensure that the most common patterns are as readable as possible.  Most of the time, that means adding special support for them, or let the user write such special support.<p>Case analysis, for instance, is a pattern.  Now you can implement it with nested `if`, or you can use a `switch` statement (if your language has either `switch` or macros).  Personally, I prefer the `switch` statement, which at a glance makes clear what pattern is used.<p>GoF patterns <i>are</i> useful.  The shame is C++ and Java's inability to properly implement them.  Really, if you often use mixins, maybe you need closures.  If you often loop over data structures, maybe you need `map` and `filter` (as closures or special syntax). And so on.<p>GoF patterns don't suck.  They just highlighted how much <i>C++ and Java</i> sucked, by showing how much copy-paste you have to perform.  In an ideal world, patterns would only be instantiated once: in the compiler or in a library.<p>On a related note, here is why I think C++ and Java suck, badly: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/classes-suck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/classes-suck</a>",1308643568
