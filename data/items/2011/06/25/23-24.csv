Sure, there are <i>theoretical</i> weaknesses in TOR, but you'd need to control quite a few exit nodes to even begin to have a chance of pinpointing the endpoints.  Combine that with a compromised wifi as a last resort (which you erase the logs of regularly), and you're pretty damned safe.  All of the people who were arrested for hacking the CIA or DoD were caught many years ago, when anonymization tools weren't nearly so well developed, and the need for anonymization wasn't so clearly recognized.  I'd like to see a modern story of the authorities finding someone who was hidden by TOR + vpn.  I just don't see it happening any time soon.",1309045338

Besides looking cool, here's some other points from my experience: It just works better. Granted, a couple years ago, ubuntu wasn't as nice as it is now, Mac OSX just works so flawlessly, never restart, never shutdown (just close the lid), sleeps and starts up in literally 1 second, great battery, connects to wifi flawlessly, and LOVE the multitouch mouse features. I also really like certain programs including iMovie, Logic (music production), Photoshop. I've tried switching to Gimp, for example, which just doesn't feel right to an old-time Photoshop user. On Ubuntu, I was pretty happy with overall experience, and if I was ONLY using it for development, it would be just fine. I would recommend Mac to any developer, but if you are already very comfortable with your Linux laptop, you're probably not missing anything THAT compelling.

For many merchants, that's a negative.\n- Merchant having to deal with customer inquiries about a deal they know nothing about. That's a negative.<p>It should also be noted that Loopt picked really high profile businesses like Bi-Rite and Ritual Coffee. These places usually have lines and don't have much need to run large discounts.<p>If Loopt had picked obscure businesses, it would make it easier to claim they weren't trying to benefit from the business's good name.",1309042886

If you let the job push you around you are the problem: you must engage with others in your tribe and interest them in the tools and techniques that you wish to use and learn. Even if the company is change adverse over time they will listen to the value you bring.<p>That said, picking a company should have very little to do with their technology stack and everything to do with the people that you work with. Find out about them: (a) do you respect them? (b) are they intelligent? (c) are they open-minded? (d) are they engaged in learning new things?",1309042859

First off, it's boring and damn near unreadable (it was one of the only assigned books I never made it through in college). But in a larger sense, the slaves are ""heroic"" and ""emotionally nuanced"" only in the sense that HBS makes them fulfill a racial type: sympathetic, penitent, long-suffering Christians. They're treated more as people than as property, but more as caricatures than as people.<p>The interesting contradiction of UTC, to me, is that it had this enormous significance to history despite being terribly written. As a modern reader, I couldn't get any emotion about the book other than it being terrible.
