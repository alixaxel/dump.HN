2627853,comment,2625860,2625860,16,0,nlawalker,,,"""iCloud"" seems to be an obvious name to those that have been paying attention to the current state of technology, but if you think about it for a second, it's actually pretty genius. Taking the name ""iCloud"", as opposed to ""iSync"" or something else that more clearly and directly describes the service, is a masterstroke.<p>Why? Because up until now, ""cloud"" has been a vague term whose value is extremely difficult to explain to consumers (trying to explain that gmail or Skydrive or Facebook are all kinda-sorta ""cloud"" in a few different ways will just get you ""oh, so it's just the internet!""). By tying it to a clearly-defined product or service that has real value for <i>regular people</i>, Apple now owns the term ""cloud"" as used in general discourse.<p>It's like how in the 2002-2003 timeframe, every non-Apple MP3 player was ""a different-looking iPod"", but this is in reverse. Every mention of ""cloud"" or ""cloud computing"" will evoke ""oh yeah, you can get your phone pictures on your PC without hooking it up!"". They've given a buzzword-bingo term a real definition that a lot of people can relate to.<p>Contrast with Microsoft's ""...to the cloud!"", a desperate attempt to get back into the consumer space that shows just how firmly they are trapped by enterprise thinking. It'll make your kids smile! It can edit photos! It will give you movies to watch when you're bored! Even the masses won't fall for something that vague - they need clearly defined <i>products</i>. ""To the cloud"" reminds me of the first couple years of ""the .NET initiative"": wind and stars that would do everything from control your house to drive your car and make the world happy again.<p>As someone interested in technology, I despise that Apple has further conflated an already massively overloaded term, but I have to give them recognition for their marketing skills. I can't wait to see how much more difficult it's going to get to explain ""cloud computing"" to a CIO who has spent the last week enamored that cloud computing means that he can get his music on his iPhone and his Mac.",1307419161

It sounds like iOS will have Twitter at the OS level, so it's likely that it will be the same client ID/name for all tweets regardless of if they're coming from Safari, the Photo app or anything else.

Also at first target a specific area: medical, manufacturing, office, and design to those specs.<p>Pro Tip: Think about mass production from day one, it will really save on the headaches, go as far as finding the type of manufacturer you are going to use and select the parts based on those criteria.

If you and Joe come up with an idea over drinks and decide to pursue it then splitting equity should be based on involvement/commitment/investment.<p>However, onboarding multiple cofounders and splitting equity equally for an idea that you just had and has barely made it ""off the napkin"" (or that you've worked on for a while) is probably a bad idea.<p>This post is really just trying to get people to ""consider the maths"" of startup equity for various structures and it's impact on your ""take."" I started a project with 6 guys (yes, 6) and cut everything equally. But it shouldn't have been an equal split, and thinking about the long-term dilution of multiple rounds and share of possible exit (discounted for execution risk, among other risks), it became a drag on my motivation. Which then made me mad at myself for getting influenced by the monetary aspects of the project, and a vicious cycle ensued. Needless to say, the project failed and we never got close to launch and disbanded.<p>So this is an important post, and extremes should be avoided (Zuckerberg on one end, open-source on the other - is that a good spectrum?).",1307417136

Next time they capture a code compare it with all the tokens being emulated to see if there is a match, if yes, possible success, you have cloned their token and a keylogger will also capture their pin.
