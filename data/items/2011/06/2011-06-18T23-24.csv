2669837,comment,2668871,2669006,0,0,nxn,,,"Since all of these compile down to javascript, they all suffer from at least some limitations of javascript -- the main one being performance. Yes, all browser manufacturers are trying to make it as fast as they can, but I sincerely doubt I will see the day javascript can run as fast as a statically typed and (jit) compiled language that isn't being executed by the browser. And when I say that, I don't mean little synthetic scenarios where some piece of javascript manages to be faster than something gcc spit out. I've already seen those, and they don't impress me any more so than a hummer being able to look like a ferrari if you get the angle and lights just right.<p>I'm a fan of P/NaCl for this reason. Their approach goes directly at the problem instead of banging on a square peg for years and years until it barely manages to fit through a round hole. By the way, that is the only way I can describe using html/js/css for application development at this point. If it makes me sound bitter/angry, it's probably because I've been doing it for too long and grown tired of how tedious and limited it is.",1308441436

There is no waiting for a feature.<p>Incrementing by one each release (rather than 4.1, etc) may seem like Mozilla is making a big deal out of nothing, for the sake of publicity.  However, it just means that all releases are equal.  There will never be a huge 3.6 => 4 style release ever again, and eventually people will lose track of what Firefox version they have (much like how people have lost track of Chrome versions).<p>tl;dr: While it has a few cool new features, Firefox 5 is more to get Mozilla in the release-often groove.",1308439844

The modern demo scene is mostly about cool GPU tricks written in HLSL or GLSL, which have huge advantages for both performance and space (see rendering the world with 2 triangles - <a href=""http://www.iquilezles.org/www/material/nvscene2008/nvscene2008.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iquilezles.org/www/material/nvscene2008/nvscene20...</a>).  It would be cool if the demo scene started focusing more on pushing CPUs instead of GPUs, but that would require adoption of really exotic graphics techniques that for some reason run better on a multicore CPU instead of a GPU, or a focus on something other than graphical effects, like simulation or audio processing.

I'd recommend it to anyone, but I don't think someone else is ""wrong"" for using Pylons/Struts/MVC.NET/etc.<p>Here's what I've observed about programming languages and frameworks. Each programming language has a community. The priorities of that community will dictate the direction of the framework, and to a lesser extent, the language. Frameworks seem to advance/change faster than the core language itself.<p>So, rather than asking what language/framework you should use, you should be considering what type of community you think fits your team/product best.<p>As I mentioned, we love Rails. We've been extremely happy with it, but it's a fast moving framework that requires constant learning and comes with it's fair share of drama. I'm ok with that, because our team doesn't mind the pace, and we enjoy the benefits of a stack that has strong ""default opinions"". I've introduced several PHP programmers to Rails, and they're constantly amazed at the broad nature of the Rails development stack. Aspects like deployment strategies with Capistrano, and now asset pipelining, are all concepts that the Rails community embrace and support. However, if you're not down with having someone else dictate these aspects of your project, Rails probably isn't a good fit for you. That doesn't make either decision wrong.<p>If you have an MVP, take your time. Short-list three or four languages/frameworks and do the following:<p>* Run through the ""hello world"" tutorials for each.<p>* Have a look at the documentation for each. How well does the documentation read.<p>* Pick a component of each framework, like the ORM, and dig in to the documentation a bit. How detailed is it? Documentation that looks good at first may turn out to be not-so-great when you get in to the details.<p>* Drop by the IRC channel for each. What kind of discussion is happening? How are new members treated?<p>* Look for mailing lists related to the language/framework. What types of problems are being solved? What's the focus of the list?<p>At the end of the day, you're the only one who can tell you what is the right fit for your organization. Hell, it might be PHP. Don't fall in to the trap of believing that the right language/framework is going to make your product a winner. It's the people, not the tools, that make the product go.",1308438673

My Linux desktop use is now limited to the once a year that I install a distro to force myself to use a different OS for a couple months, mostly to see what I'm missing. Turns out, I'm not missing anything, so after a couple months I go back to using a system I enjoy.<p>But here's the thing, the people who use Linux as their main desktop environment aren't crazy, or fooling themselves. They prefer it to the alternatives. They evangelize about it (actually something I wish everyone would stop doing, regardless of their OS allegiance). For them, it's the best way to use their computer for the things that they want to use their computer for.<p>So I'm not sure that there is a problem. With the exception of the small number of people who fantasize about a world-wide exodus from Windows to Linux on the desktop (who are certifiable, if they think there's a remote chance that will happen), I get the impression that most Linux users are quite happy with it (as well they should be).<p>I think maybe twelve years ago, if you were a full-time Linux desktop user, you were probably compromising on technical quality for an ideological preference; but I don't think that's been true for a long time.",1308438197

2669748,comment,2669316,2669703,4,0,cturner,,,"You're framing the issue by saying that creation of IP happens for the reason of selling it later on. This is circular (IP wouldn't exist - it is a direct product of prootection), but I'll assume you meant that there'd be less investment in ideas in an environment without IP.<p>I disagree with your framing and conclusion. People work with ideas for the purpose of solving problems or satisfying interest that they have, not just directly commercialising the results. I write software in order that my business can operate in its environment. Mendelssohn was inspired to write the Scottish symphony. Free software authors have a commercial interest for their work because it increases their chances of getting good work, and the same applies for music teachers who compose and record, and literature professors who write, and scientists who publish.<p>Creating an ecoosystem that is oriented around direct commercialisation through the mechanism of IP cannibalises the innovation of people who solve problems and satisfying interest because of the extra weight of restrictions it places upon them. Many of the tunes in Handel's _Israel in Egypt_ were directly ripped from other work he had access to. That oratorio could not have been created in the current IP atmosphere.<p>Further, ideas benefit from network effects in a liberal idea space. Copyright hampers the exchange.<p>You equate IP with being all protection - this is misleading. IP is just one form of protection, one that is government backed. Consider Steam - a mechanism that furthers commercialisation of ideas without leveraging IP. The growth of models where businesses take responsibility for their own commercial model is stunted by the government protectionism offered in the form of easy copyright. This further fuels arguments like the one you've made. We look around us and see copyright everywhere tied up in ideas, and fail to appreciate the opportunity cost of the situation.<p>Without copyright you wouldn't have Hollywood, but you would have something else.",1308438025
