Every feature they offer you is designed not to generate profit so much as it is to keep you with them. By giving away their services for free it obviously increases their brand name, encourages brand loyalty, but also levels the playing field. They set the bar by offering these services for free. No one will pay for a service that is at least comparably offered for free. For this reason if Google makes gmail free then every other website has to offer their mail services for free, the same goes with Google Calendars, and all of the other apps they offer. Why would they want everyone to offer their apps for free? Because then the difference between them and Yahoo or Bing or any other site is on marketing abilities and few companies in the world come close to challenging Google's marketing capabilities.",1309491929

If the website needs an income from advertisements to keep itself alive and I enjoy spending my time there, why not.

I simply will not let NetworkX throw some nasty trojan-infested advertisement at me (and this is only one of the reasons why I blacklist JavaScript by default). I may want to contribute, but I don't want to donate (one way or another it often turns into a hassle). I would like some innovation in how advertisements work on the web.<p>I don't want to feel like a leecher of your bandwidth and CPU. In return, you should give me the same benefit.<p>In fact, I want to see a friendly ad-network. Say, something like:<p>[] all dependencies are hosted by the domain you are visiting. This might even decrease bandwidth consumed by advertisements.<p>[] if you trust the domain, you trust their advertisements (even if you use various script blockers)<p>[] this might be deemed evil by some, though: initially (?) this would obsolete ad-blockers since it would become harder to determine what is an advertisement and what is normal content. But personally I do not mind. I would consider it a good feature.<p>[] a view or a click is verified by the user and the advertising domain, then signed and posted to ""neutral place"".<p>[] you, the user, can opt-in or opt-out to share information about you (e.g. should long lasting cookie be able to couple you up with your Facebook ID). Not entirely sure how to enforce the advertising domain to keep its promise here, though. It would probably\thave to be based on good-will and since they are putting themselves and not the advertisers in the line of fire, it might just work.<p>[] ... more?

The writeups from the founders of ZeroMQ always make it seem like a magic bullet, but a few years back when I got down to implementing a distributed 0mq C++ application, it was a hoary mess and we had to implement basic thread pool functionality to keep track of all of our resources. It turns out that we would have been better off using an off-the-shelf messaging solution that kept track of the resources, even with the 'overhead' that an independent broker like RabbitMQ brings. At least the product would have been finished (AFAIK it was scraped and raw binary socket write/reads were used instead).<p>So the point about Erlang bringing ""Fast process creation/destruction"" to the table is especially important: if you want to bootstrap an application which needs low-latency, low-overhead distributed message passing, you are better off using Erlang or something else.",1309489619
