The biggest leaps were made long ago. The invention of electricity, the steam engine and the combustion engine, those enabled automation on a scale that was truly never seen before. Then there was slavery: that's competition from globalization/immigration if there ever was. China, India and the other low wage countries are getting higher standards of living <i>fast</i>, so their wages go up and their competitiveness down.<p>I strongly question the assertion that we are currently losing lowskilled jobs to automation or competition at a faster pace than in the past.",1309942776

Preferably, you need somebody that has experience dealing with $5/hr offshore developers (i.e. they have learned how to effectively use them on somebody else's dime).  $5/hr sounds cheap until it takes 4 weeks to deliver a crappy deliverable that doesn't work, then you start feeling just how expensive $5/hr can be. :)<p>That technical person can source qualified offshore talent, bundle up both design and development projects to outsource, do the heavy lifting programming that just can't be done via outsourcing and they will be able to setup your infrastructure.<p>Without that one technical person on your team, there's virtually no chance you'll be able to effectively use an offshore developer.<p>To find this person, find some local companies with at least 100 employees that build a web-based product.  Call up pretending to be a manager for an offshore development firm and speak with their Director of Development or CTO.  Your goal is to find a local company that currently outsources their development.  Then find who their senior developers/architects are and poach them.

That's a pretty scary step for most techies.<p>You have to narrow down your scope to a specific market vertical.  Get as specific as you can.  Then you start getting customer feedback ASAP.<p>If you have several (or a lot of ) markets you can go after with your idea, then pick a couple to test.<p>What sometimes happens is you end up in a market that wasn't even on your radar because you talk with somebody about the tech you're building and they apply it based on their experience and, boom, you're in some totally out-of-left-field market that proves to be the lowest hanging fruit.<p>Find some competitors, then use LinkedIn to connect with some former employees, especially sales people.  They will be perfect SMEs.  Even if you don't partner with them, you can still pick their brain to get a better understanding of the market.<p>Next place to find your hustler would be to identify your best potential customers, then try to connect with one of the technical people via a back door channel (i.e. don't just call the company and ask to speak with them).  This is a bit trickier, but still very valuable because you can cultivate a relationship with an inside champion (which makes the sales process much easier).<p>The hardest part (for me anyway) in finding a hustler is that you'll have to spend time working on your value proposition. Once you branch out beyond being the lone soldier, you have to figure out how to communicate your idea to other people.  This takes time away from coding, which is always tough for any hacker. But it's an invaluable exercise.",1309940403
