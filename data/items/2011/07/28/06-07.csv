After all, credit ""counseling"" is an act of counseling, not just hard financials. To us the four pillars of financial stability (for customer already in financial distress) are Education, Budgeting, Counseling, and Community. We can obviously provide some of these but not others.

An example of this is airbnb's own policy of not disclosing renter contact information.  Despite what they say, airbnb believes that people are not fundamentally good as their concern of users circumventing their payment system is greater than their concern for the safety of said users (at least to the extent that stories such as this don't hurt their business more than payment bypassing would).<p>If airbnb believed what they espouse, they'd quit trying to outsource their trust in humanity to their customers whom they aren't liable for and instead actually <i>trust</i> that <i>people in general</i> won't sidestep the payment process.",1311835798

2815672,comment,2813575,2814851,4,0,mkramlich,,,"But they are approaching it from the standpoint of rules and a framework. The rules are called ethics and the framework is society. Laws and government regulations are a different set of rules, and much newer and more transient. What should be guiding all of us, I hope -- regardless of the current state of legal rules & regulations -- is whether something is ethical and what the impact is on society. By some standards, what hedge funds are doing is unethical or parasitic, and may in fact be a chaotic force which on the net creates more hardship than benefit to most of society. Thus, the details of whether they are currently legal or not is not important, in comparison. We can change laws to better reflect our ethics and what we think is best for society. So talking about social value is precisely and massively relevant: it's one of the main reasons we have laws. And it's quite possible that hedge funds are exploiting a temporary state of affairs where technology and the legal context allow them to do certain activities, and they'll continue to exploit until and unless we make changes to their environment.",1311835206

Failing that, a lightly skilled (50h practice) lock-picker can open most household locks, even ""secure"" ones, in under fifteen minutes.<p>Beyond that, the lock/deadbolt/wall is pretty weak. A sledge hammer will open almost any door in a single blow. Windows are essentially just big gaping ""serial-killer's enter here"" signs, as you can easily break them and gain access to the domicile. Where, presumably you would feed on the brains and organs of the residents.<p>And worse, the phone company publishes a book that lists your name and address. No longer do serial killers need to drive endlessly, trying to stumble upon a Stuart or a Fred, they can just pick up a phone book and they'll find a perfect list of people, indexed by name for easier killing.<p>PANIC!<p>But seriously now, you're over-reacting here.

It depends on how they represent themselves. If they purport to offer screened participants and don't, that's a problem. But if they don't it simply means they're offering a lesser service, pay accordingly.<p>I want a market to exist for cheap and potentially dangerous things instead of offering only padded kid-safe versions. For instance, Lithium-polymer remote-controlled vehicle batteries. Essentially the same tech as the laptop/cellphone batteries that occasionally catch fire. But they don't have protective circuitry built in to prevent this. If you overcharge them they will catch fire. But they're far cheaper and you can draw more power than if they had safeties built in.
