2827364,comment,2826513,2827280,3,0,rflrob,,,"Depends on what you mean by ""sequence a genome"".  There's nothing out there that can take a single chromosome and sit and spit out its sequence from one end to the other (even from organisms like yeast that have much smaller chromosomes).  Instead, with high throughput sequencing you sequence between 30 and 150 base pairs at a time, and then stitch several million of those reads together.  This computationally difficult problem can be made easier if you know the approximate spacing between two given reads, so you can connect islands together.  Illumina (and possibly SOLID, but I'm not sure) lets you do paired-end sequencing, where you get both ends of a particular DNA molecule, and depending on how you set up your samples, you can have mate pairs separated by 3,000-5,000 base pairs.  In order to get a really good <i>de novo</i> assembly of a genome, you typically want on the order of 50-100x average coverage of the genome. A single sequencing lane (which costs ~$1300) can get you about 5x coverage of a genome.<p>It's often possible to tell how many times a gene is repeated because, statistically, you should get fairly uniform coverage of the genome (although there are lots of artifacts in the sequencing process that makes this less true).  If you get significantly more reads from a particular locus, it's likely that it's been duplicated.<p>Glancing at the figures in the article, more than 65% of this ""structural variation"" seems to be insertions or deletions of less than 10 bp, with only 2% coming from elements greater than 1,000bp.",1312077015

The purpose of a nation is manifold, nations provide a lot more than just a currency for example: rule of law, public services (roads, fire service), judicial system, safety regulations, an open and efficient marketplace.   Currency is a means to some of these ends not a purpose in and of itself.  Now like everything else in life not all of these tasks are always well executed and thats why governments do things like change laws and policies and provide for mechanisms such as the courts and a free press.

2827345,comment,2826921,2827256,2,0,geuis,,,"Remember that when a wave moves through a volume of fluid, say air or water for example, its the energy of the wave that moves and not so much the medium. This is the classic example given in high school when talking about waves at the beach. (I always thought it was disingenuous because water is obviously moving when the waves break. The power of analogies sometimes breaks down.)<p>Anyway, if you can imagine a sub moving forward through water it pushes its way through the medium. Water molecules get jostled by all the external jiggers and bits on the vehicle. So if you look at a volume of water say 20m x 20m x 3m (basically a big flat square). Most of the water in that 3m wide space stays in that space as the sub moves through the square. However, all the jiggery bits have imparted energy to the molecues in the space. So as the sub finishes passing through, there's a lot of excess energy left in its wake. That's your noise and turbulence and such.<p>So if you can put something around your sub that helps to return the water molecules to the same or similar state they were in before the vehicle passes through a particular volume, then effectively its like the sub was never there. You get to move through the water much more efficiently because you aren't imparting as much energy to it, and its a lot quieter.<p>This even got me thinking about airplanes. So we all (should) know that its not the speed of air moving over a wing that gives it lift. Its pressure differentials created by a wing moving through a volume of air. Air can be perfectly still and powered flight works just fine.<p>So imagine you could put one of these grid things around a plane. If you can effectively reduce the turbulence created by moving through air (a fluid), then you get better fuel efficiency, less noise, and you can go faster. This is why some designs for newer planes are considering tiny dimples in the surfaces like a golf ball. It helps reduce turbulence.<p><i>Edit</i> See my addendum comment below.",1312076295

I didn't mean to imply an actual Greek suffix, I was using <i>-o</i> as a theoretical example.<p><i>However</i>, just glancing again at Wikipedia I see that ""In Modern Greek Ω represents the same sound as omicron"". So actually this is a perfect example of the native speaker's bias I'm talking about. You can't tell those suffixes apart in speech because of spelling, you can tell them apart because of context— but you're so used to conceptualizing them as fundamentally different, it didn't even occur to you that to a non-native they sound the same.<p>It's also worth noting also that headlines follow their own peculiar grammar rules which make them unusually prone to forming garden path sentences— lots of native speakers get confused sometimes too. ESL courses cover headlines specifically, since their grammatical structure is so opaque: <a href=""http://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r46-headline-english.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esl-lounge.com/student/reading/4r46-headline-engl...</a><p>Don't take any of this as a criticism of your broader point— I'm willing to grant there are levels of ambiguity, and English with its highly lexicalized grammar — and especially Headline English with its nearly absent explicit grammar — is definitely up there on the scale.

It's supposed to be about where the company is at now and where it's been in the past -- not just for potential investors, but for current investors who might want to compare against their previous projections. Predicting the future is left as an exercise for the reader.<p>Marketing expenditures, particularly for new companies in new markets, are based on projections. If Groupon is trying to attract investors based on its current profits, then slashing the marketing budget might be a reasonable course of action. But I doubt it is; they are trying to attract investors based on its potential for profits in the future, and part of that growth story involves spending a lot on marketing. With that in mind, slashing their marketing budget (or for that matter, pretty much any other part of their budget) would not make any sense, and would likely turn off investors (even if unsophisticated).",1312074682

A person who does nothing but check e-mail will be paying pennies per month, which is not going to pay for the ISP's costs. Instead, I would expect there to be a monthly fee just to have service at all, and then usage charges on top of that. I'd expect that roughly 50% of the current typical monthly charge would be to have service, and then the rest would be captured by usage charges.<p>There's also nothing preventing ISPs from providing volume discounts. Indeed, they should, as their own cost per byte per customer should go down as the customer uses more.<p>I'm not sure why you see it as a good thing that average users subsidize top users. Surely top users should pay in proportion to their additional use? After all, I don't pay the same amount for my electricity as somebody who cools his house to 60 degrees and leaves his lights on 24/7.
