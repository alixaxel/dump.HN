There is a fair chance it wasn't even a picture of an ex.<p>-There was <i>some</i> context, albeit I believe the main point was to keep people awake. 6 hours of speakers is a lot.<p>-Maybe I'm thinking too much into it, but I'm fairly sure 'type faster' was analogous to 'little shit can add up'.<p>-I've always considered 'bitch' to be a female specific version of 'dick'. Both being fairly synonymous with 'asshole'.<p>-She very much objectively f'ed up some of Frank's things. I was sitting between them and the bottle flew directly over my head. It is kind of a joke to get mad at someone's immaturity and respond in-kind, damaging a bystanders property.<p><i></i>Long story short- Noah is blunt. Maybe douchey.

In a 'free society,' if a majority of people think you are an asshole, they are going to treat you like one. If you don't want to be treated like an asshole, you'll have to adjust your behavior.

Chernobyl, Fukushima, TMI.  This type of problem can't happen with fusion reactors, as the reaction stops as soon as reactant stops being fed in.  This is not the case for fission, because of the need to attain near-critical mass before the chain reaction can occur.<p>2) Waste disposal.  As fissile material is consumed by a fission reactor, the resulting waste products are still highly radioactive.  This waste has to be stored safely (the famous cooling pools from Fukushima were the first step in this process), for very long periods of time, generally measured in decades and centuries.<p>3) Fuel availability - there are not huge quantities of fuel-quality fissile material available on Earth.  This limits it's usefulness going into the future<p>4) Theft of fuel - although reactor fuel is not generally very useful for bombs, sometimes the waste is.  Some reactors, eg breeder reactors were in fact designed to generate bomb material, more so than to generate electricity.<p>Have a look at that list, and think about how it applies to nuclear fusion.  Meltdown is impossible, waste disposal is far easier (it's just the reactor's shield that gets radiated, which is a much more contained problem than that of radioactive reaction by-products.  The amount of fuel for a fusion reactor on this planet is just huge, and you can't make bombs out of the material coming in or out of a fusion reactor.<p>These are the reasons that fusion reactors are highly interesting, not because of the possibility to generate more power.",1310390786

I'd like to keep building on this and add things like SSL certs, an API, add-ons for Google Apps (and more), and an iPhone app. I'd also like to eventually (if things go well) get accredited by ICANN as a registrar and no longer be a reseller.<p>I'm hoping to get some feedback right now though.

You might not identify a scalable business model within 1-2 years, or you might not find the best way to monetize your assets. You might reach in 1-2 years just ramen profitability, with the rest of your work tied up in non-liquid assets (like non-monetized-yet code). The third year might be the one where you go crazy and manage to scale your business.<p>But, here's the catch: a convertable note is debt; if you don't manage to raise VC money or angel funds, which is even more probable if you're not located in Silicon Valley, if you don't have connections, a track record or if something goes wrong in your startup, that convertible note which you carelessly signed 2 years ago comes to maturity. You're expected to pay $150'000 or whatever out of nothing when you've just reached ramen profitability. If the investor is an ass, he's now your creditor and can ask your bankrupcy (and get the intellectual property, the domain name and all the code of your startup without you being able to do a thing).<p>So in respect to convertible notes: thanks but no thanks.",1310389610

Did you not read the distinction I've made several times here about a joke uttered at a conference and calling a woman a bitch on the job? No, I don't think the latter is acceptable <i>at all</i>. And the screening I referred to is not for potential sexual harrassment claims, which I BTW take very seriously (my wife is a professional)-- it's for people, male and female, who are professionally and continually aggrieved. Regrets? Not on HN. Karma is like that.",1310389448

The most commonly proposed fusion reactors use D+T fusion, which produces hugely energetic neutrons, the most dangerous kind of radiation that you can think of. You need hugely thick walls to contain these neutrons and be heated up by them, and some kind of system to extract the energy from the walls. And yes, the walls and the extraction system end up radioactive, and now you have this huge radioactive mass to take care of somehow, instead of tiny pellets of spent fuel in their cladding. You have other problems for other reactions. Again, the devil is in the details here, an individual fusion reaction might look good, but by the time you include everything else you need, not so much.<p>Also, any system of safety and containment that will make this look good, will make fission look even better.",1310389325

I mean, it had its share of problems, but it made this far easier).<p>Um, what, boring? No, I have a lot of things I could do, even with my body, that don't include probing orifices. Actually, probing orifices offers only so much novelty, and at some point the appeal is much more based on the partner and physical/emotional closeness than the exact probing equipment and configuration.<p>As for nationalism -- fun fact, the office I worked in Europe is 90% male. I had the pleasure to work in a similar, corporate office in the US (the same corporation, actually). The proportions were much closer to 60-40 or close to that. Libertarianism is only a part of US, and not all US. Just by calling US libertarian and assigning all accomplishments to EU you become a nationalist. When EU worked on worker rights (which had some support from US as well), welfare state and other things that we're currently in the process of getting rid of, US was working on gender, racial and religious equality, political correctness, and a lot of other stuff that I don't feel like researching right now but US is probably trying to get rid of.<p>And, right now, Europe has a lot of its own problems with nationalism, racism, neoliberal economic politics and all that. We may have made some good decisions in the past that enable us to point fingers at US and say ""haha, we've done X better than you"", but so did they. Also, we have countries that are <i>monarchies</i>. Seriously. In 21st century. No kidding.",1310389246

Once there is enough momentum many people join, but the natural reaction is to preserve yourself by not joining in until there is that momentum, which may never happen unless the circumstances are <i>just right</i> at exactly the right time because everyone else is waiting for other people to get started and create said momentum.",1310389246
