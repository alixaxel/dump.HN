For every guy who drops his project, it is very likely that someone will pick up the same project and turn it into a smashing success. This is why you always hear people say ""Man I had the same idea x years ago"".<p>In the past 7 months alone this happened to me 3 times with code I actually wrote and that is sitting on my machine, granted the code is only 5% of building a company.",1310349546
2749172,comment,2747328,2748613,1,0,kragen,,,"You are mistaken in your assertion that those sets of numbers necessarily describe different distributions or situations.<p>I will explain this more carefully so that you can understand what the key points actually are.  Please take the time to read and understand the explanation below.<p>You are correct that they are percentages of two different things.<p>However, if 87% of the wealth, whatever that is, belongs to the richest 25% of the population, then it's entirely possible for 88% of the wealth to simultaneously belong to the richest 28% of the population.  That would just mean that 1% of the wealth belongs to the 3% of the population between the 72nd and 75th percentile, which is an entirely plausible state of affairs.<p>Consider, for any number X from 0 to 100, you can find a number Y that makes the statement ""The richest X% of the population owns Y% of the wealth"" true, <i>without changing the distribution</i>.  Y is continuous and increases monotonically with X; and when X=0, Y=0; and when X=100, Y=100.  Under those conditions, there is guaranteed to be exactly one point in [0, 100] where X = 100-Y.<p>If you want to compare two different distributions, it's helpful to oversimplify them to scalars, since otherwise you have vectors in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, which are tricky to compare.  If you know that in the US, the richest 25% of the population controls 87% of the wealth, while in Argentina, the richest 10% of the population controls 70% of the wealth (it doesn't), you don't know which country is more unequal.  It could be that the richest 10% of the population in the US controls 87% of the wealth, or 34.8% of the wealth, or anything in between.  Furthermore, it could simultaneously be the case that, in the US, the richest 10% of the population controls 80% of the wealth (making the US seem more unequal), while in Argentina, the richest 25% of the population controls 90% of the wealth (making Argentina seem more unequal).<p>There are lots of possible choices of scalar.  The smallest percentage of the population that controls 50% of the wealth is one reasonable candidate.  The percentage of the wealth controlled by the richest 50% of the population is another.  The Gini coefficient is a third.  And that unique point of intersection where the richest X% of the population controls (100-X)% of the wealth is a fourth.<p>Does that clarify matters?",1310349514

Not sure about the documentation quality.<p>* <a href=""http://geetduggal.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/speed-up-your-python-unladen-vs-shedskin-vs-pypy-vs-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geetduggal.wordpress.com/2010/11/25/speed-up-your-pyt...</a> lists an example where PyPy is in fact faster than C++ with STL. Not sure how it would compare to well-optimized C, but remember that JIT warmup time will hurt you for short lived jobs.<p>* Can't answer this one, sorry.<p>* RPython is still around---PyPy is written in it! Certainly it would be more friendly toward the JIT, which does best when the types of variables are consistent (which is required by RPython). Plus, RPython can be translated directly to native code and you can get rid of the JIT entirely.<p>* Unladen Swallow tried to do a lot of the same stuff that PyPy is doing, but on top of LLVM. It never did much better than CPython (within an order of magnitude), but if it did they were planning to merge it into CPython (of which it was a branch). PyPy is a followup to Psyco (which only ran on 32 bit x86) by the same people, but Psyco ran under CPython.<p>* Cython does not interpret Python---it compiles from a language that looks a lot like Python but with C-like semantics (for example, optional strong typing, and the ability to directly call C functions), and turns it into C or C++ code that can be compiled into a Python module. As such, it targets a slightly different use case.",1310348858

What other profession gets that, right?<p>Speaking from experience, she generally brings home work every night (grading, lesson planning, etc).  Weekends too.  This fluctuates based on time of year (grading a round of research papers, preparing new lessons for a new quarter, etc).<p>Summers off?  Kinda.  New lessons and curriculums often have to be prepared for the following year.  She's been doing that for a bit already whenever our little guy naps.<p>The other part of overlooked is the emotional toll.  In my wife's case, she's dealing with high school freshmen, juniors, seniors, all who are one hell of a handful most of the time.  Last year, she had a class that had her crying more than a few times.  The kids were literally trying to make her cry.<p>But besides all that, teaching is a profession that is charged with preparing and educating our youth for tomorrow.  Obviously, teachers go into it knowing this, and often for that very reason.  But in my eyes, that's quite a responsibility.  There are plenty of better paying jobs out there with less vacation that, at the end of the day, don't make much of a difference.<p>(For the record, my wife's district actually pays pretty well, so I don't think she's underpaid).",1310348658

If you're using a language that has accessors you can call a private init method, but you have to do it for all of the properties.  Or you can just use methods, but again you have to remember to call init at the beginning of them all.
