Behavior changes through out the day though which sucks LOL<p>And the most amazing thing was user testing is near useless, the demographics, experiences, behaviors are so vast. Even as noted the time of day has a huge effect on readers.<p>So no matter what you do you isolate a community, so you compromise and compromise, and produce the most average pile of junk anyone has ever seen. But people understand it, sure they moan, but they get it. Go for the lowest common denominator.<p>The times uses the motif of a news paper online, I guess because it's contextually people understand.

In both cases, I was in excellent shape before the trip (155-160lbs at 5'11"" with low body fat and good muscle definition). I work out three to four times per week, plus box twice per week.<p>I lost about 10lbs during each trip. When I got home from Peru (the first trip), I was mortified.

I was bigger and stronger than before the trip in three weeks.<p>After the second trip I was less scared, because of the previous experience. I was just as strong as before the trip in about three weeks again, but I didn't gorge myself as much, so I stayed a bit leaner.<p>I guess what I took away from the experiences was that you're bound to loose body fat while traveling, simply because you do so much walking.
