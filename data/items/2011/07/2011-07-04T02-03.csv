What if I POST to 'getAllPageNames'? It doesn't make sense, does it?<p>Personally, I'd say that if a developer can't be bothered to read the whole nine(!) verbs of HTTP, he shouldn't use the API. I mean, GET is described in just 11 lines!<p>And (s)he doesn't need to read your docs: the smart thing about the Uniform Interface described by REST is that the same verbs work on <i>all</i> services of the same architecture (in this case, HTTP).

If a worker goes down because of a system crash or network failure, then that job wouldn't get processed again for 5 minutes. That's (for us) an acceptable overhead. There's a chance the job gets processed twice, if it gets locked, work gets done, but releasing the lock fails. That's a trade-off we're willing to make as we can't really think of any better solution.<p>I believe, since redis has built-in support for expiring records, this maybe even easier.
To process job 332, you would try to check the existence of 'lock:332' and then set it if it didn't exist, and give it an expiry time.<p>Would be interested in hearing how other people solve these types of issues.",1309747629

However, I don't see a real problem with the way Rails does things because it's ""by default"" and I think a dev ends up causing a lot of unnecessary trouble for himself by using stock to_json. The more I work with Rails building out a JSON API, the more I realize that .to_json is just another way to ""scaffold"" - it's not useful in production. :)",1309746128

Most of your code shouldn't be dealing with timezones or local time, it should be passing Unix time around.""<p>I can attest to this. At a previous job our entire API used UTC. It was clean and worked at every layer of the app, from django to our client-side javascript. When we needed to display a human readable version, we did the translation at render time. All interactions with time as data was done with the UTC timestamp and saved much headache.<p>A couple months before I left, one of the engineers proposed switching everything over to a textual representation according to ISO_8601. I forget the nature of the argument, but it was inane(to me). This actually led an extensive back/forth email exchange between various members of engineering, me as one of the frontend engineers, and even the engineering manager who seemed to favor the idea.<p>I argued, ""why change the entire stack which works just fine, etc etc"".

The only measure of demand you site is Manufacturer's New Orders, which does show an increase.

Classes and prototypes are both way to make objects. With a prototype, you start with an actual object as an example, and make more objects just like it. With a class, you start with the abstract set of properties that describe a type of object, and make more objects from that blueprint.<p>Think of it as the Platonic ideal of a thing (the class), versus the canonical example of a thing (the prototype).<p>To get specific: The idea of Bicycle, versus my blue bike with red streamers. Both can be used to make more bikes, in JavaScript.<p><pre><code>    newBike = new Bicycle
