Because if not, the alternative is shutting down these services, which is bad for those of us who bother to backup their emails and have their own domains.<p>Personally, I feel this is a simple matter of personal responsibility. It's free, so you can't expect support.

It is very hard to pitch Android to someone who is not tech savy, simply because of the choppy and sluggish UI.  This has also become the talk of the masses, most people who haven't even used Android say the following:  ""I've seen Android, its cool, but its not as smooth and stable as the iPhone.""  
The iPhone's hardware fails a lot (I've exchanged my 3Gs twice in less than a year), it also freezes at times and drops calls, but what do people see and remember!? UI!!  If android wishes to ever compete seriously with iOS, GPU acceleration is a must!<p>On a side note, who cares about the older phones!? they can keep being sluggish... There's less than a handful of Android phones that won't support GPU acceleration, there's more than 30 that do...<p>Conclusion:  MAKE THIS A PRIORITY, its time to put the choppy UI days behind us, this year is going to bring amazing hardware to the table, and the new iPhone is good, but not THAT good... As it stands, all iOS has on Android is a ""smoother experience"", why hesitate to fix it!?""<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6914</a>",1311386012
