But the mental habits that the internet as a mass medium fosters are antithetical to study and reflection.<p>I love the internet, not least because of the ease with which I can obtain information that used to take hours in the library. But obtaining specific facts is not the same thing as learning or thinking.<p>From observing myself and others, I believe that something is wrong. I'm getting way more brain stimulation from the internet than I used to without it, but in terms of things that matter to me in the long run -- growth and learning -- it is of poor quality. I remember the quality of a life spent with books, and this is definitely not it. I feel like I'm experiencing my own atrophy, and it dismays me. Sometimes I think that one of these days I should post a list of books to HN and promise not to come back until I've read them.<p>So no, consuming information from the internet is in practice nothing like getting an education in the humanities, for anyone whose brain is wired like mine and those of people I know.<p>Books are food, the internet is a drug.",1311469060

2798307,comment,2797309,2797914,4,0,lostmypw,,,"<p><pre><code>    Talking about stuff like this is bound to sound esoteric, I think. So\n    I want to put this disclaimer upfront that I detest esotericism.\n\n    I can only assume that your problems are similar to mine, so I can\n    only suggest what works for me. And that might not completely work out\n    for you in the end, but it's worth a try for sure.\n\n    Concentration: The problem of not being able to keep distracting\n    thoughts away can be lessened with meditation. I came across this\n    suggestion in the book Pragmatic Thinking and Learning [1] and have\n    found an excellent CD to listen to called Guided Mindfulness\n    Meditation [2] by Jon Kabat-Zinn.\n\n    I tend to try to avoid meditation because for a while I seem to do\n    fine and so long as I do fine it just feels like a waste of time for\n    me. Time that I could invest reading a book. But eventually I always\n    end up having an extreme amount of distracting thoughts to the point\n    that I cannot learn anymore. I've now had this problem crop up often\n    enough with meditation always helping that I'm now a lot more willing\n    to spend the time and meditate. I want to emphasize that for *me* it\n    was necessary to get to the dead end and suffer from it to become\n    willing to change something. Maybe you can relate.\n\n    Structure: Well well, the way you write it sounds a little bit rigid\n    to me. I tightened up imagining all that structure you strive for and\n    I'm thinking you should relax a little bit. Or at least I should (and\n    do). So maybe we are different in this regard.\n\n    I do think you should lay back a bit and think about what really\n    interests you deep down in your heart. I assume you've been working\n    too much on hopelessly boring stuff, because with that I can relate\n    again. I've been working a little bit on a little server in erlang but\n    somehow at some point I couldn't bring myself to working further on\n    it. Well I could, but all the time I felt something was wrong.\n\n    As I'm happy to learn interesting programming languages and have heard\n    all the hype about lisp for so long (I'm looking at you, pg) I finally\n    gave in and started reading Practical Common Lisp [3] and now\n    Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming [4] and what can I\n    say. I see now that what disappoints me in erlang but also in other\n    languages is having forced upon me one paradigm and/or a rigid set of\n    rules. In the case of erlang that might be perfectly fine as the\n    language can make certain guarantees that way. I've realized though\n    that I would much rather enjoy the lisp-ish freedom while molding a\n    solution. So this is my story of disappointment and fresh wind.\n\n    One quick addition in the end: In an xkcd comic [5] there is a\n    description of a solution (see the alt-text of the image) that delays\n    access to certain websites (like reddit, hn for me) but does not block\n    them completely. It just delays the access (-- more discussion on the\n    xkcd blog [6]). This serves the purpose of destroying the notion of\n    instant reward these stupid little bits of new information might give\n    you, however irrelevant they may be. I've found this to be helpful for\n    me because sometimes in the past I've procrastinated the hell out of\n    the day. I got fed up with repeatedly spending hours with unproductive\n    stuff and feeling sorry for the time in the end. See the pattern? I\n    needed to run into this problem several times before I decided that I\n    have to change something. I don't want to make some point here. I just\n    find this pattern interesting.\n\n    What I have done is I have taken an existing little chrome extension\n    called delaybot which by default only delays for rand(1.5) seconds and\n    changed the delay to 30 secs. This has worked wonders in the\n    beginning. I say in the beginning because I've now disabled the\n    extension as it is getting in my way now. No, this is not the\n    procrastinator disabling a helpful little tool. :-) I've found that\n    since I've picked up meditation again I didn't run into this problem\n    anymore anyways. I also tend to just bookmark away a lot of actually\n    interesting discussions to read them later, which of course I never\n    do. I do this bookmarking and closing of tabs because I tend to\n    accumulate too many tabs easily otherwise.\n\n    Not all is great though, the article made me realise that I'm a little\n    bit too hard with myself when I'm excerting will-power. I try to go\n    through the mentioned lisp books fast (as there are more to come\n    still) and at some point I notice that I can't bring myself to read a\n    lot more at that point. To me this looks similar to the cookie\n    experiment where a group of people is less productive after excerting\n    will power in a previous task.\n\n    So, to conclude: Even if not all is roses I can say with certainty\n    that meditation is the single most helpful tool to increase my\n    productivity. It changes me from being helpless to being more in\n    control of what I'd like to do with my time.\n\n    Regarding your lack of passion: Man, search your feelings. If you find\n    something that really interests you, you probably wouldn't think much\n    about what other people could do better than you. That AI book [4] I'm\n    reading? It features ancient techniques at the point where I am right\n    now but it's still a great read and I'm learning a heck of a\n    lot. That's what keeps me going. Also, lisp.\n\n    Phew, that was long.\n    I would love to hear feedback. :-)\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-P...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Guided-Mindfulness-Meditation-Jon-Kabat-Zinn/dp/1591793599/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Guided-Mindfulness-Meditation-Jon-Kaba...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Prog...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/862/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/862/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/02/18/distraction-affliction-correction-extensio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/02/18/distraction-affliction-corre...</a><p>EDIT: I've changed the formatting because it renders with long lines otherwise.",1311468599

2798304,comment,2796891,2797813,1,0,jimmyjazz14,,,"I agree that sometimes just writing code is a good way to get started solving a problem however, I do not believe it is usually the best approach in general.  Spending to much time planning can be a problem but many new programmers jump into writing something without even considering the problem much before hand.  This approach very often leads to learning lessons the hard way, which I admit is not always a bad thing. In the long run though failing to learn to think and plan before you code can limit ones abilities.<p>Different problems call for different solutions and sometimes just jumping in and coding can be lots of fun but, on the other hand, some projects require a fair amount of problem understanding and planning.

(FWIW:  I happen to be female.)<p>I would suggest you back off some and let this be her baby.  If she whines, ask ""so what do you plan to do about it?""  Let her know that if she wants to change this, you are happy to provide practical support.  But if she wants a shoulder to cry on, you aren't really interested.  That ""I feel your pain"" crap isn't really your style.  (This is what I routinely did with my sons: I will help you explore your options but if after exploring your options you choose to keep doing the same thing, don't come whining to me about it.  You can come back at any time and get more assistance with brainstorming and such but I am not a shoulder to cry on and I have no sympathy when you clearly brought this on yourself and keep doing so.)<p>I have known a couple of men who both pressured their wives into going back to school etc.  They were never really satisfied.  Both men found me wildly attractive...and promptly behaved towards me in the same butt-in-sky, controlling fashion with which they had tried to run their wive's lives.  This does not fly with me.  And it doesn't work.  Pushing someone around to force them to do better in life is not the way to create someone who does a good job of standing up for themselves.  In order to ""benefit"" from this type of help, she first has to cave to your demands.  It actually gets kind of the opposite of the intended result.<p>I would also recommend you pick up a book called ""Chore Wars"".  Women are routinely expected to do the lion's share of housework, cooking, etc.  Helping more around the house (or hiring help if that is feasible) is something genuinely supportive you can do to remove real obstacles to her having the energy to put into being more ambitious.  I know for a fact this works.  I left a husband who was really dumb about the ways in which he was holding me back and I told my two sons at some point that I would rather they take over the housework and cooking so I had the energy to work overtime instead of encouraging them to get jobs.  This serves multiple purposes for our family.  But it is very clear to me that all the studies and what not I have read are correct:  A big obstacle to the success of women is the proverbial 'second shift' which motivates them to choose pink collar ghetto jobs so they have enough energy left to do all the ""women's work"" after they clock out.<p>Best of luck.",1311466844
