Also, I've noticed the ATMs at convenience stores, bars, on street corners etc are usually the swipe ones and the ones at banks are usually the keep your cards ones for some reason. To me the ones that give me card back right away are much much nicer as it's much harder for me to forget my cash than my card, and it means I only have 1 thing (which is my goal anyway) to get from the machine. It's nice that basically the ones around the places I wind up when I'm tipsy in the middle of the night are the ones that're set up so they're hardest for me to mess up.",1310101069

If you have the choice of places to work, do you want to work at a company vetted by Sequoia, who has the best deal flow there is, or vetted by a VC you've never heard of?  Do you want to work for one whose follow-on war chest is hundreds of millions, or just a few million?  One who will be able to help in crucial times, or one who adds no value?  One whose involvement alone brings press at every new product announcement, or one who gets no extra attention from media?  All things being equal, the value for an employee of working at a company with a top VC ought to be near the same as it is for the founders (with a little less upside).",1310100829

You buy shares based on dollar amount (fractional ownership, ShareBuilder.com does it as well). Ticker symbols are accompanied by company logos, so its obvious that you're buying Apple Computer stock, not just AAPL. Your portfolio is also gamified; win achievements for doing well, get placed on a leaderboard, share with friends, etc.<p>In general, everything about trading is complicated. If you look up your favorite company, and you're overloaded with stock information about High/Low, Bid/Ask, Volume, closing price, etc. And the more investment options are given, the worse it gets (mutual funds, options, currency, etc.). Everything appears complicated, so yes, it is intimidating. To get a better grip of what a better UI would be, it would be a good idea to look at the intentions and desires of a new trader. I think the average joe wants to start trading because: a) They think they're smarter than the average person, and can make a few bucks off their stock picks. b) They think it'll be fun to learn.<p>Feel free to take any of my work or ideas.",1310100597

A* finds the shortest path, this problem requires a Hamiltonian cycle, two entirely different problems.<p>Finding a Hamiltonian cycle has much more in common with solving a sudoku puzzle than with finding the shortest path in a graph; both are problems for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. Now, this problem is about finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a restricted class of graphs, so there is a chance that you could solve it efficiently, but it is non obvious. If you know how, perhaps you should publish a paper on it: that might be a major breakthrough.",1310100459

Basically, the options are:<p>Immutable vectors - loads of temporary heap objects<p>Mutable vectors - spaghetti data flow<p>Implicitly grouped primitives - horrible verbosity and repetition<p>And of course, there's no operator overloading.<p>There are potential solutions to this that could be implemented at the language level e.g. stack objects or macros that expand to primitives at compile time, but none of the other mature JVM languages seem to do any better at it.<p>Say what you will about C++, but it lets you write code like this:<p><pre><code>  vec4 lerp(vec4 a, vec4 b, float s) {
    return a + s*(b - a)

I agree that censorship isn't relevant here in the sense that it's applied to art, but there is a legal question of whether or not what he's doing is protected by the First Amendment.

If he had put cameras in the eyes of a statue in a park and recorded people interacting with the statue, would that be forbidden as well?<p>I get where he's coming from, and I get that some people would be upset by it.  That's why we need to have a conversation about what privacy means in this day and age, and how much of a reasonable expectation of it you have in public spaces (and what constitutes a public space).

I know that and use screen, and the post we are discussing mentions tmux, so he knows it as well.<p>You asked what the difference was. I told you.<p>>> whereas an emulator with some mux features can provide benefits not easily achievable with a standalone multiplexer.<p>> The op was being snarky but that was the whole point. iterm2 doesn't seem to be giving something which we(in a generic sense; I use linux and have nothing to do with iterm) want and aren't already doing in the current emulator/multiplexer setup.<p>Yes, I got that as well. My point is that it is in fact nothing at all like ""tmux with an icon""; It's a terminal emulator, which happens to:<p>a) be better in various ways than hte Terminal.app that ships with OSX (256-color support, for a start. See upthread for many more).<p>b) have some features which overlap with dedicated terminal muxes, like tmux.  If you look at the links I mentioned, the idea is to make iTerm recognise you're using tmux (even on a remote host), and translate its split panels into GUI split panels, amongst other things.<p>So yes, it does (or will) provide additional features.<p>>> One example would be mouse-based text selection. Using vertical splits in tmux, and triple-clicking to select a full line will select the contents of both split regions, whereas a GUI app can limit it to one region. I'm sure there are plenty of other features.<p>>I don't use tmux but that's the behavior in gnu screen vertical split as well.<p>Precisely. But iTerm2, being a GUI terminal emulator, <i>can</i> do that. That is a feature.",1310098355

These two things let them exploit their smarts very well. But bighearted? Not really.

Their foreign aid is more effective than elsewhere because of the size of their economy, but as a proportion of what is earned, it's not competitive.<p>My personal experience in the US is that the people are very welcoming and friendly, which leads me to think that Americans are bighearted to people they personally know, but not so much to strangers - eg witness the powerful currents of public opinion against welfare or universal healthcare that don't really exist in contemporary countries.",1310098347
