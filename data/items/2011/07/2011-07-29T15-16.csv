Perhaps when a comment formatted in a particular way recommending a merge receives n number of upvotes that could trigger the merge?<p>It's difficult because so many blogs and other news outlets in the tech media world travel in flocks. After one does some original reporting the rest jump on the story and (usually) cite the original source. However, the original source for the story doesn't always rule on HN in terms of hosting the main conversation. Sometimes this is because of the timing of the submission and sometimes one of the members of the 'flock' are higher profile and gain more knee-jerk upvotes (TechCrunch comes to mind).",1311955196

As far as I know when you want to move between major versions (the next one is 7->7.1) you have to basically wipe the phone and start from scratch. Because most Android apps use local storage that isn't synced to the cloud, to actually keep your data you'll have to use hacky things like Titanium Backup that may or may not corrupt data, particularly so for system settings.<p>The biggest shortcoming I see in CM is this, the lack of a good Over The Air upgrade method that keeps your data.

Think about all the oil/gas used in fertilizer production, pesticides, mechanization, harvesting, processing, storage, trucking, packaging.""<p>Believe me, farmers think about that subject far more than you can imagine.  They do everything they can to reduce the number of passes they have to make through each row of crops.<p>Farms like my in-laws leverage technology to the maximum.  For example, they have GPS units on their tractors that are integrated with meters that track how much fertilizer is being distributed and they've been tracking this for almost a decade.  When they harvest, they have GPS units on the combines and sensors that are tracking yields.  At the end of every season they use 2D and sometimes 3D modeling to determine the optimum distribution of fertilizer down to a few feet.  The off-season is dedicated to crunching these numbers, plus a mountain of other data that is collected.  The goal is to absolutely maximize the efficiency of resource use: fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, etc.<p>When it comes to the question of sustainability you've got to remember that many if not most farms are generational.  Fathers passed the farm to the current generation, they hope to pass it to their sons or daughters.  They are far more invested in the economic and environmental sustainability of their operations than the folks that have made sustainability a trendy buzzword.<p>And understand that I <i>am</i> talking about industrial farms.  There is no true distinction between the ""industrial farm"" and the ""family farm.""  They are one and the same, but there is a lobby out there that has it out for agriculture.  You sound like a real jerkoff if you're attacking the ""family"" farm, but if you use the word ""industrial"", you conjure images of smokestacks belching pollution and fat white guys in suits lighting Cubans with the money they stole from the pocket of the janitor.  It's totally cool to attack those guys.<p>Think about it this way.  Where I live it takes about 1,500 acres to support a family.  Let's say you have three families working a farm, a father and his two married sons and their kids.  That's three families that need about 4,500 acres to make a living.  That is <i>a lot</i> of land and it requires an industrial, in the dictionary sense of the word, operation to farm.",1311954425

2822390,comment,2820567,2821686,1,0,erikano,,,"The method I am about to mention here is based on that which was outlined earlier by somebody else [1]. As I will mention further down, the method I suggest here will give the administrator and the CEO the opportunity to conspire and retrieve users passwords without the affected users knowledge, but I will here assume that such could not happend and that if they really wanted to do so, they could find other means anyway (keylogging, etc.)<p>First time: On his client, the user is asked to enter a password which is checked to comply with password rules. This password is salted and hashed before it is stored on a central machine.<p>n-th time:  On his client, the user first enters password ""n - 1"" which is then salted and hashed and sent to the central machine for comparison. If hashes match, you may enter the new password ""n"" which is checked to comply with password rules.<p>Password ""n - 1"" is then encryted with password ""n"" and stored on the central machine. Password ""n"" is stored on the central machine in two forms:<p>1) Salted and hashed.<p>2) Encrypted with a public key.<p>Password ""n"" is encrypted with a public key and stored on a he central machine. Also, when this machine stores the new public key encrypted password, it deletes its own records of any previous public key encrypted password for the user in question.<p>Through recursion, all old passwords (""n - 2"" ... ""1"") are decrypted and the new password is checked so that it does not match any previous password and that it is not a simple permutation of any of those.<p>If the user forgets his password, the administrator physically logs into a machine which is very tightly secured. This machine does not allow inbound connections of any kind over the network and can only make outbound connections to the central storage machine. Furthermore, the machine does not allow the usage of any removable media (CD, DVD, USB stick, etc.). The drives of the machine in strongly encrypted, as is the private key which is stored on this machine. In order to decrypt the disc of the machine, two passwords are needed. One of the passwords is held by the administrator, the other by the CEO of the company. The same goes for the private key which also has two passwords, both of which are needed to decrypt it. Thus, two people must be involved in order to decrypt the password for a user. Once the administrator and the CEO has logged into the machine, they connect to the central storage and retrieve the encrypted key for the user and then they open their shared private key and decrypt the password. After the user has been given his old password, he must create a new password following the procedure described above. That way, the administator and the CEO does not know the users new password (unless they conspire to do so, but that would be breach of trust).<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2820976"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2820976</a>",1311954290

""I told the landlord, and he commiserated with me, and helped me change the locks."" And heck, she already mentioned changing the locks.<p>As far as the investigation, Airbnb has claimed that a suspect has been apprehended, but apparently neither the SFPD nor Airbnb have contacted her with any further details. She's not necessarily blaming the SFPD for not having caught the suspect; but she's arguing that the spin that Airbnb has put on this story is untrue, that everything has not been resolved, and they have not been as helpful as they claim.<p>And why would someone who had just been victimized by someone anonymous they connected with on the internet want to publish a whole bunch of personal details all over the internet? Internet vigilantism is not some silver bullet; publishing more information may lead her to be more vulnerable, not less. Her intent is not to get ""the internet"" to help catch the thieves; her intent is to warn people about the risks of using Airbnb's service, and that Airbnb will basically do nothing to mitigate those risks.<p>And it's not like this story is completely made up. Brian Chesky wouldn't have written a response confirming many of the details and contesting none of them if the story were untrue. All he did was try to put a positive spin on it, which this second post demonstrates is just spin, with no real content.",1311953725

Primary education has to educate everyone. Private colleges can be selective about students, kick out students, etc, etc. You can't compare a system that has to educate everyone with one that can be highly selective. It's apple to oranges. But, private colleges as a whole are questionable. Look at all the diploma mills, aggressive recruitment to private ""colleges"" with substandard education, no real campus, whose goal is only to make a profit. I can't find it now, but I read a story recently about a scam private college that bought another school that was accredited so that they would get the accreditation which wouldn't be rechecked for years!<p>So in short, I think some private schools do a great job for some students, but I'm highly doubtful that it will work well for primary education that has to educate everyone.<p>I think US colleges are great, but it's not the same goal as primary school. I don't think the two are comparable.<p>The private prison example isn't exactly the same, but it has similarities that you guys are ignoring. The main one is that the incentive is to maximize profit, not to make a better prison or school.",1311953707

It does well in liberal arts college rankings, but it's not well-known. In fact, my Y Combinator interview began with pg asking me, ""You're Canadian?"" (He was thinking of Carleton University.)<p>Going to a school with name rec is certainly a plus. And if you're in the startup world, that goes double for MIT and Stanford—not only do they have outstanding CS and engineering programs, but they also have an extraordinarily entrepreneurial culture. If you tell a venture capitalist that you went to MIT, for instance, that's a strong indicator that you ""get it"" as an entrepreneur. It's neither necessary nor sufficient to get them to write a check, but it pretty much answers two of the questions every potential investor has: ""Is this guy smart?"" and ""Does this guy understand how startups work?"" If you went to a no-name school, you've got to find another way to answer those questions.<p>Just remember: Once you've actually <i>done something</i>, that defines you far more than what school you went to. I didn't lose my shot at Y Combinator because pg hadn't heard of my school; I lost it because my team hadn't built anything before. If we'd been Stanford grad students rather than University of Michigan grad students, maybe that would've helped. But you know what would've helped more? Having ever deployed an app worth using, or developed a popular open-source project, or written a book on a programming language (say, CoffeeScript).<p>In short: ""Make something people want."" Aspire to do something noteworthy enough that you can introduce yourself as ""Hi, I'm the creator of so-and-so."" At that point, no one will care which school you went to.",1311952968

Rather than apologize and recognize the error, they tried to turn it into a debate about whether fat people should fly, and they misrepresented the situation further.<p>I saw that comment on tech crunch and felt that Chesky was begin dishonest (based solely on having ready he previous blog post from ej) and now we see that AirBnB tried to get her to shut up!<p>As a frequent AirBnB customer (staying in a place rented via AirBnB at the moment, in fact) I'm finding that I'm having less and less faith in the company as these incidents unfold.  (I'm not just talking about this, but Kutchner, the Craigslist, the fact that they keep their customers in the dark, etc.)<p>Frankly, as someone who has been online for two decades now, talking to people I can get a good feeling for how trustworthy they are.  AirBnB inhibits this because it inhibits communication-- it can only happen thru their service which is not conducive to having a dialog.<p>The sole purpose of restricting this communication and restricting customer's ability to assess the risk in any of these transactions is AirBnB's desire to prevent the possibility that a deal might happen off of their site.<p>Reality is, this is silly.  We found an apartment on AirBnB once and then found it on the internet (wasn't hard given knowledge of the details of the apartment.) We could have booked it that way and saved the AirBnB commission... but we booked it thru AirBnB anyway because we wanted them to escrow the funds. (Little did we know how little protection AirBnB provides in that regard.)   But we were able to find out more about that apartment by looking at its website compared to the info on AirBnB.<p>And more importantly, having the owner's email address allowed us to discuss a lot of possible issues about the situation, and assess their trustworthiness... something impossible or difficult to do thru AirBnB.",1311952314

In December, that means off season for me (athletes tend to pick up some weight during that period), we had an physical exam for Uni - I weighted 94kg at that point. So at the end of all the tests I walk into the doctors office, who while peering into my file commands me to take off my shirt and sit down. She proceeds to comment the results along the lines of: ""... everything is perfect, but you are overweight (BMI 26.6) - you absolutely have to loose some weight!"" At this time she rises her eyes from the file and looks at me sitting in front of her, top naked. Blushes and says: "" but only a kilo or two!"".<p>BMI may work for average.

If you call people living near you, you don't dial that code. This behaviour doesn't translate to mobiles.",1311951841

This is a job you can learn by doing.<p>If you have a development background, look into devops, which is the hybrid/crossover movement. Learn how to deploy your app, how to configure Apache (or the reasons why you might not use Apache at all). For your next weekend project, try getting a cheap VM/VPS and deploying to that instead of Heroku.<p>The nature of sysadminning is changing, thanks to the flexibility offered by 'cloud' hosting solutions and automated deployment and configuration management tools. Learn how to use chef or puppet. Look up 'chef-box', which uses vagrant and VirtualBox to give you a virtual network that's configured using chef. You can use this to learn how a real network works.<p>Learn about virtualisation, buy a cheap machine (I like the HP Microserver) and install Xen on it. Increase your swearing vocabulary by trying to use VMWare in production with no support contracts.<p>I have no idea how you learn about Windows. Never owned a Windows box, never had to do meaningful support for Windows systems. Even if you're a Mac/*nix person, you should probably learn how to manage a Windows network, though.",1311951810

The prices for mobile phone plans in the US are much higher because they include the phone subsidy.<p>it's the same in most european countries (and has been for a decade or so), and even in countries where this is <i>not allowed</i> (such as belgium), plan prices are not significantly lower.<p>Although generally you have a sliding scale: most euro countries have laws letting consumer break 2-years contract for a free (which is usually a function of the number of months left on your contract), so you can usually get 12-months contract (lower subsidy => more expensive phones) and no-bind contracts (even lower to no subsidies). They're also generally more expensive per month: having you as a pretty much guaranteed customer for 2 years is much cheaper for the carrier.<p>There are also bits and pieces of regulation which varies by country. In France for instance, subsidized phones are SIM-locked but carriers must let you unlock it for free after 6 months.",1311951615
