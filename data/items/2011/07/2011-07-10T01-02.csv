As for using off-the-shelf solutions, I would expect CRM software to maybe come the closest, but it really does seem like a niche that needs special software, if only for the reason that no minister wants to feel like the software they're using cheapens the Gospel by treating it as a sell-able good.<p>Maybe it's just a problem of terminology. Regardless, I still think there's a need not currently served by off-the-shelf CRM or specialized Church Management Solutions. Ministers need help with engagement and communication, especially with the explosion of social media, which no current church software is equipped to integrate with.",1310262540

2746800,comment,2746360,2746766,10,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Well, that's all a lot of nonsense. One of the more hilarious traits that most programmers seem to share is their belief that they can logically deduce what's true and what's not in fields in which they don't even know the basics.<p>Given that every major field of study that I'm aware of has aspects which are hotly debated by that field's experts -- people who have spent more time researching, studying, and contributing to that field than the vast majority of programmers have spent programming -- I'm disinclined to believe that it's possible for you <i>or anyone</i> to sort out fact from fiction just by listening to a debate about it.<p>To come back to the subject that started all this, interstellar space travel, there are piles and piles and piles of theories and facts and data that are probably well understood by only a handful of people on the entire planet. So, if you know nothing -- or little -- about the practical and theoretical complications and possibilities of space travel, and you hear from someone that claims to have some conclusions on the matter, it's reasonable to ask about their qualifications on the subject as a signal about whether or not they are full of shit.<p>Space travel is something I am interested in, like many geeks of my generation. But I don't presume to have even enough knowledge on the matter to figure out who's full of crap and who isn't. Heck, just recently, someone from Johnson Space Center spoke up on a Reddit thread about the space shuttle, when a Redditor asked why the shuttle wasn't left there for additional storage or as an escape vehicle. Of the various reasons that the qualified person gave in answering the question, I think maybe one of them was one that I'd thought of ahead of time.<p>The more I learn about everything, the more I realize that I know nothing. Asking someone about their expertise doesn't mean I'm not thinking; quite the opposite.",1310262525

Bostock's work is the most useful and thoughtful visualization framework on any platform, and at this point the only reason I use Hadley Wickam's ggplot2 is for graphics that need more marks than Chrome can handle on the DOM.<p>Initially I didn't see what D3 offered over Protovis, but I've since come around---D3 code is closer to the underlying page elements that make up the visualization, so you can leverage your existing HTML/SVG and CSS knowledge.
Also, unlike Protovis, D3 has animation baked in by creating/removing DOM elements and tweening their positions and sizes.<p>The latest public-facing work we did using D3 is this linked treemap & linechart, which uses both HTML elements (treemap divs) and SVG elements (linechart lines):<p><a href=""http://keminglabs.com/ukuni/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keminglabs.com/ukuni/</a>",1310262240

Yeah I would agree most church software is not that great (I use Easy worship instead of PowerPoint and that totally rocks).  First because a lot of what the church does has echo's in business software.  Office managers use MS office and off the shelf accounting software.  I know pastors use facebook to connect with others (or should be but that is a different post).   The church software that I have seen was either too expensive for the churches I was serving at or was not a felt need for us to go out and purchase.  I have thought long and hard about church software and I see needs, but most of those needs are being met by off the shelf software that helps with the need to manage or the need to connect.",1310261539

For example, 4 yrs of undergrad and a starting job at Google can see you making close to over $100K in 3-4 years.  As a medical student you have 4 yrs of undergrad and 4 yrs of medical school (that can be a tremendous amount of loans).  Then throw in anywhere from 3-7 years of residency making $40K.  Depending on the specialty you choose and how hard you wish to work the median salary can range from $120K to $450K.<p>They may not be equal, but I know developers pulling in $200K that are just turning 30.

The only time I ever had a problem was in an interview with a guy who had /two/ PhDs, who handed me his biz card (with two degrees on it) and who said that he had two degrees several times while introducing himself, and who the company jettisoned a few months later (because he was obnoxious and impossible to work with).<p>Build your network and don't sweat the paperwork.",1310260024

2746736,comment,2746360,2746360,12,0,econgeeker,,,"I've noticed this form of anti-intellectualism is becoming more prominent in recent years.  It is almost as if people are being taught it.<p>When presented with an <i>argument</i> that they cannot debate, people will demand a ""citation"" or ""credentials"".  In both cases, they are pretending like you have made a logical fallacy.<p>Saying ""I've got a degree in auto-body repair from West Alameda Tech, therefore, java is a terrible language"" is obviously pointless.  You can see how the degree has no bearing on computer science.<p>But if the degree <i>were</i> in computer science, the argument would still be argument from authority.  But the debators then switch to debating whose degree is better.<p>You find this a lot in political debates whereby somehow, politicians (who often do not have very useful degrees, as they tend to be lawyers rather than engineers or scientists) somewow are magically transmorgrified into ""authorities"" on whatever subject they have an opinion about.<p>And you-- as an engineer, or scientist or economist, are expected to somehow cite credentials that are superior to theirs.... as a politician?  Any credential would be superior to what amounts to being a paid liar, but of course this is letting your debate opponent set the terms anyway, and thus your PhD in computer science with Donald Knuth as your thesis advisor means nothing compared to the authority of some ex-TV comedian who managed to parlay that fame into a senate position.<p>Another variation of this is the demand for a ""citation"", invariably from opponents whose citations, if you can drag one out of them, are to blog posts, which are themselves essentially another variation of the argument from authority.<p>The real problem here is, these are tactics whose effect, of not their purpose, is to eliminate reasoning and thought from debate.<p>They are excuses to ignore the quality of an argument and thus ignore the need to address that argument, or make a counter argument.  Instead, they jump to the position of arguing from a logical fallacy, which precludes from possibility the idea that their opponent might be making a good, logical, rational argument.<p>If you find yourself asking people for citations or for their credentials, check to see if you've narrowed your objection to a particular fact, or if you can argue against the logic they are using.<p>Otherwise, they should rightly consider you to have conceded by trying to move the debate onto a false basis, where, <i>at best</i> your position rests on a logical fallacy.",1310259812
