The main thing that's missing from JSON's stringify() is a depth parameter, so I added that.<p>JSON.stringify() also can't handle circular references or reconstruct reference to the same object if it occurs more than once in the JSON object, so I added that, too.<p>The fancier stuff adds something called ""JSON Sigils"" to the JSON output, which the deserializer can interpret.  To maintain backward-compatibility with all the other JSON code in the world, I created ""serialize()"" and ""deserialize()"" to handle the fanciness, but made sure ""stringify() and parse()"" work the way they always did (plus the depth parameter, of course).<p>Lastly, while I was implementing this, the internal object reference lookup mechanism looked promising as the beginning of a ""jPath""-style query implementation, so I added some initial support for that.<p>I'll be using this as a base for some other projects I'm working on, so I'm sure I'll find and fix plenty of bugs, but please feel free to create an issue or, better yet, send me a pull request!",1309661392

I figure it will help me as far as getting work, plus take my skills to the next level. I want to only do one certification because they're setup such that if I were going to do two of them I might as well just get my Ph.D. My bachelor's is in philosophy with an emphasis on formal/mathematical logic, which combined with my own experience has served me well as a coder, but I really want to take it up to the next level and either be able to get a position in a good company where I can make cool stuff or start my own company and make cool stuff. My primary experience is in web development in the LAMP stack with the standard web languages: HTML/XHML, CSS, PHP, and javascript, and I would rate my HTML/XHTML and CSS as very good, while I would only rate my PHP and JS as fair. I would like to get everything up to excellent but I also can't be in school forever nor can I pile up the classes too hard because I need to work at the same time (I'm ambitious but realistic).<p>So my two top choices for certs are the general programming cert: http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/programs/computer-programming/courses<p>and the cert that focuses on internet stuff: http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/programs/internet-programming/courses<p>So what would like to ask is:<p>1. Which cert should I get? I'm open to doing maybe two or three electives (in fact I intend to, because regardless of which I get, I want skills beyond either of them), but which one in specific?<p>2. I know some C, and I intend on doing both the C classes regardless, but should I do C++, C# .Net, or VB (I already know some VB)?<p>3. I am pretty good at PHP, but one can always get better and my first impulse was to plan on doing their comprehensive PHP class. The thing is, I have been hearing good things about both Ruby and Python, and they have classes on both. I have heard especially that Ruby is really good for fast development and that in general it is a lot of fun. So should I get better at PHP or take in some Ruby?<p>My goals are to be reasonably well-grounded for whatever I might have to face and to be prepared for work. While I know that's impossible, it's possible to get closer than I am, and I want to be a true asset to whoever I end up working with/for. That means skills that last rather than flashes in the pan, and I worry that Ruby might be one of those, while PHP is tried and true.<p>Thanks in advance.",1309661066

The first big plus was that I was able to quite my part time job and do web development working from home.  I then quit college to do freelancing full time (I hated college and my grades were crap, so this wasn't as bad of a decision as it sounds.)  I then decided that I could take this a step further and not just work from home, but work from anywhere in the world.  I then moved to the Philippines and two years later I'm still there.<p>Peter Cooper mentioned that your year out could turn into a ""procrastination-ridden year of hedonism"" and I would agree with that.  It's really easy to get caught into a ""vacation"" mindset.  My first year here ended up being more of a case of ""let's see how little work I can do and still get by"" rather than building my business.  The beer here is really cheap and there are a lot of expats who don't work.  Every day is Friday, and if I'm not careful I can slip into their same routine.<p>That said, I'm not sure I would take the path you are looking at.  I think you need to define your goals more clearly.  What is the reason for learning to code?  I learned how to code during my free time after work and on the weekends.  Most important for me wasn't to have a lot of full days to learn how to code, but rather practicing every day if even for an hour a day.  So, you don't have to go on a year sabbatical from your job just to learn how to code.  Also, if you are practicing every day, you can get pretty good relatively quick.<p>After you learn how to code, what are your plans?  This is where you are very vague.  Though I'm a freelance web developer, I wouldn't suggest this for most people.  This is a real business and takes real commitment.  It takes a lot of time and effort to really figure out the business side.  It's stressful and I don't have much time or energy left over to work on my own projects.  I would love to be working on some sort of start-up idea which would allow me to switch, but I can't afford to break my business cycle (quit accepting work, build my own application with no money coming in, perhaps have to start taking in new work if my idea doesn't work out and having to rebuild the cash-flow cycle.)<p>If you want to build something, you can take the time to learn the code just as you are doing now.  As you said, progress is slow but you are still making progress.  If you were to be competent in 3 months, then that's not really very long.  Maybe another few months and you would be surprised with what you could accomplish.  Even if you aren't a guru yet, you might just be good enough that you can tackle just about any problem that you run into.  At this point, you are ""good enough"" though you will continue to hone your craft.<p>So, the moral of the story is that the year away isn't something you need to do.  You can learn what you need to learn doing what you are doing.  Keep building up that savings (something you will lose when you leave,) keep building on the side and be patient.  Eventually you may even be able to build something that makes a bit of money.  If you could build an application which could bring in $1000 / month in profit then you would have enough to live on without having to dip into your savings.  That's the point where I would be considering moving abroad.<p>I'm not saying don't do this.  I'm saying that you should be honest with yourself and define your plans more clearly.  What is it that you really want to do?  If it's simply to get away for a year in Thailand then go for it.  If it's to learn to be a better coder, then stay on your present path, it's working!  If it's to quit your job because you are simple ""done"" with it, then go ahead and take a sabbatical to find yourself again (though I'm not sure I would want to burn through my savings to do this, it would be better if you could support yourself while there so that you don't have to touch your savings.)<p>On a side note, the Philippines is also a great place.  It's about the same cost of living.  English is an official language.  The visa allows for tourists to stay up to 16 months without having to do a visa run outside the country.  I live in Dumaguete and I work out of an office (working from home just isn't effective for me anymore.)  The biggest downside is the infrastructure in general is probably worse than in Thailand.",1309660778

2722888,comment,2722504,2722859,8,0,Peaker,,,"Well, this is basically manually implementing Iteratee inline your solution.  The idea is that Iteratees allow writing this as:<p><pre><code>  main = run_ $
       enumFile someFile
    $$ splitWhen isComma
    $$ map reverse
    $$ iterHandle stdout
  where
    isComma = (== ',') . chr . fromIntegral

Basically Iteratees are a generalization of the technique you've implemented, but:<p>* Generalized for any error type and support various modes of error handling/propagation (they can go up to the producer, or down towards the deeper consumer as error inputs).<p>* Are generalized to many types of ""buffers""<p>* Have a high-performance counterparts of standard ""list functions""<p>* Are a standard base for many libraries to extend (http, xml, etc), and are faster, more powerful and more useful than standard strict IO libraries (Haskell's base libs, and Python's stdlib).<p>So both Python and Haskell have standard ""strict IO"" libraries. Iteratees are really a new idea -- that Python does not do well yet.  So I don't think Haskell's progression of the state of the art in IO handling is really evidence that ""IO is unsolved in Haskell"".",1309660739

And if any of them do it, I think the main problem in their life is not the availability of the drugs.<p>As for drinking in bars, when I say ""too drunk"" I mean dangerously drunk, not just making a fool of yourself and being rude to the staff. The point is that most bars won't let you die on their premises, or even come close to it. In most cultures, recreational alcohol consumption has a social aspect and this is desirable. Drinking in a field in secret in the dark means that if somebody does get into trouble, it's less likely to be noticed before it's too late.<p>As for people being kicked out of a bar for being too drunk, I think most people would just go home and sleep it off. The sort of person who will go to the effort of acquiring more alcohol and heading off alone to drink in secret probably has other problems.<p>Again, I'm struggling to say this concisely, so I think the important point is that limiting access to alcohol/other drugs merely attempts to relieve one of the symptoms of a larger problem.

2722865,comment,2722778,2722778,2,0,geuis,,,"I know this sounds dumb, but hear me out.<p>I've been an iOS user since shortly after the first iPhone came out. At a previous company, I had to do extensive cross-browser mobile testing on iPhone/iPad, several Android phones, and the Xoom (Android tablet). Every time I picked up one of the Android devices to do something, I had to ""think"". Its annoying as hell.<p>And by think, I mean that when I went to turn on the Xoom the power button wasn't in an obvious place (its on the back). When I was in either a phone or tablet, there was a different way to access the wifi settings on <i>each</i> device. Getting back to the home screen was annoying. Why do I have to page back through 3 previously opened apps when I just want to go to the homescreen. (To be fair, there <i>is</i> a separate button to go to the homescreen directly. But why are there 4 buttons at all?)<p>Clearly, my experiences have been shaped by my years of experience using iOS. To that extent I've even been using iOS 5 beta for the last few weeks on my phone. While it clearly has some rough patches, the new features are well thought out and polished. (Sorry, not going to talk about specific features because I don't know if they are uncovered by the NDA yet.)<p>So when I say that Android makes me have to stop to think, I mean that any time I have to use one it has these annoying gotchas that require mental effort to examine and bypass. I would be happy to say that it was just me, but a lot of my friends have switched from iOS to Android phones over the last year and I hear a lot of the same complaints from them too. They aren't technical illiterates by any mean, but they don't spend their days immersed in this stuff like I do. One runs a print shop, another is an audio engineer. One even edits video at a porn company.<p>I think a good way to summarize the difference, and the problems, is in a recent ad proclaiming ""your wife will love the Tegra2 chipset"". iOS devices inspire people.
