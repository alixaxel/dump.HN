This time, I really tried to customize my desktop to be as productive as possible, and I almost succeeded.\nThe windows mozaic display from all desktop a-la-mac when the mouse reaches the top left corner was useful to switch from firefox to konsole. I really like gwenview, yakuake and konqueror for file browsing carry useful features.<p>On the other hand, I couldn't get my networking to work properly. Whether it's network-manager or the kde frontend that's clunky, I don't know, but it made it impossible to switch from a network to another without rebooting the machine.<p>It also took me DAYS to find how to deactivate this really annoying desktop switch when the mouse reaches the side of the screen. At some point, I was being very careful not to drag my mouse to the side. Terrible user experience.<p>KDE is full of options, everywhere, but in the end I felt like most of them are useless. The lack of separation between ""basic"" parameters and ""super geek advanced that even the developers don't touch"" ends up in big control panel with plenty of options, and you don't even know where to start looking. So you start Googling, which is usually not a good sign.<p>Being back to XFCE4 is indeed a relief. Like working out after months of junk food.",1311854047

2816198,comment,2814864,2815104,2,0,gjm11,,,"I did a little simulation. Start the vendors off in random places. Each tick, pick a random vendor and move it to its optimal place (either just left of the left-hand other one, or just right of the right-hand other one, or half-way in between; I assume for convenience that some second-order effect makes the midpoint best when you're between two others, and when putting a vendor in a new ""outside"" position I put it 1% of the way from the old ""outside"" vendor to the edge).<p>The resulting evolution settles down quickly to a situation in which all three are very near 0.5, and every time the middle one gets the chance to move it does so (to be just on the other side of whichever of its rivals has more space on the other side). If you plot a graph of this, you get a sort of braided effect, with the braid never getting very wide or moving very far. So it's kinda-sorta stable even though (necessarily) the vendors keep changing places.<p>With n>3, all sorts of more interesting things happen. For instance, for n=4 the state of the world is usually as follows. You have a cluster of (usually) 2 vendors near a (<1/2) and another near b (>1/2). The outermost vendor in each cluster is happy where it is; the inner ones will jump to just beyond the outermost of whichever cluster is further from 1/2. This means that the clusters tend to be equally far from 1/2 (because the nearer-in one is preferentially jumped to) and tend to move outwards (because a jumping vendor always jumps to just outside a cluster). But this situation can break down in two ways. (1) A vendor jumps from one cluster to the other, so we have 3+1 instead of 2+2. Then the now-isolated vendor, on its next move, will join the other cluster; we now have 4+0. Now what happens is that cluster moves en bloc towards 1/2, at which point it typically splits in two. (2) The two clusters get far enough apart that a leap into the middle becomes favoured. Actually, in my simulation #2 never happens because #1 always happens first. For larger numbers of vendors, though, you get a kinda-similar situation (two clusters, one on each side, slowly moving outward) but the number of vendors in each cluster is large enough that #2 can happen before #1 does, so sometimes you get one leaping into the middle. (As the number of vendors gets big, this becomes the dominant kind of transition, and the overall effect is that generally the vendors are quite evenly spread.)<p>A more realistic simulation might give quite different results, but I'm at work right now :-).",1311851073
