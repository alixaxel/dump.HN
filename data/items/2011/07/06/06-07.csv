For example, there's a Dover edition of Georg Cantor's Theory of Transfinite Numbers which gives essentially the original development of ordinal numbers, which is based on (Cantor's own) development of set theory.  Another original I recommend is Conway's On Numbers and Games, although that field (surreal numbers) has not been as influential.  I think it's underrated.<p>About Lockhart's Lament: This guy sounds a bit angry about things.

In more detail, I'm not completely convinced that he's isolated the real source of trouble in the US math education system.

What I've found is that for most CS-oriented people, beating around the bush is really just getting in their way. If you create the correct mental model for them, much of git becomes self evident. This isn't easy and takes a couple of days of intermitent whiteboarding but everything 'clicks' soon enough.<p>Big things:<p>Explaining that the object name (d56abc..) is really a SHA1 hash of all the contents. Git then uses this name to uniquely identify Git Objects.<p>Git Objects consist of: blob (file), tree (directory), commit (pointer), tag (well.. its a tag..). When you do a ""git checkout"" you interact with commit objects. When you do a ""git ls-tree master ."" you are looking at a tree object.<p>Branching is done by putting the following in .git/refs/heads/branch_name:\nd56abc..<p>And a branch will always just point to a commit object.<p>Finally, the working directory is of very little concern to git. It has handy functions to drop some of its stuff there for you and it can tell you some differences between its HEAD and your files, but really Git begins at the Index.<p>+ Lots of little things.<p>Edit: It is always fun to do a quick 'echo ""dbc123.."" >> .git/refs/heads/new_branch' and show someone that that is all it takes. It really quickly shows how not-scary git is. There is a ton of complex technology that enables its awesomeness but it is a relatively simple system.",1309933479

But why don’t people do things like successful companies?<p>Let me show you how ""smart"" people make it difficult to achieve business success.<p>They don't make a good product and improve it by heart, they cut corners instead. They believe they know their product, but their staff and customers don't. Actually, at least their staff can see that attitude clearly, and their customers can feel it, so their enemies are glad to spread the bad news when the product fails.<p>They don't set a price above their cost. In fact they don't know the real cost. If you cut corners, you will never know the real cost. You need really good designer, maker, and vendor; all these things together make for a good product and also a reasonable price. You can set a high price, but who will buy it?  Finally, you are playing a must-lose game with yourself, only you don't think so. Your customers, your staff and even your competitors, they know, they all know.<p>They don't tell their customers they have what they want.  Instead, they put their ads everywhere telling the whole world how good their products are, and shout at everybody passing by “buy me! buy me!” Why do they do this like a mad dog? They don't know who their customers are, not to mention their needs. So, a mad dog starts to run marketing.<p>When they make a mistake, they don't tell their customers, they don’t even tell their staff, because they have too many secrets and this is just a new one. They pretend nothing happened. Only when things become too serious and they start to lose control do they start to hire a pr company with lots of smart brains to figure out an even bigger lie to get them past the crisis. Then they file this big dirty secret away in their huge dirty library with the label: secret. Every time they host a party to celebrate this huge success. They don't care where this leads them. Actually, there is no easy way back.<p>They don't make fair deal with anybody, they always try to avoid it over trying hard to get more in any deal. They want their staff to work harder and get less, their vendor to offer better products with lower prices, they don’t want customers to know the product, and instead buy anything they offer blindly. Yes, it can happen one or two times, but you are not the only smart person in the world, and you can't make people do business with you, thus feeling stupid again and again. Eventually everyone will leave you: staff, customer, vendor, and even you will confused, thinking “if I am so smart when it comes to business, then why do things go badly?”<p>So stop being a smart business man, start running your business like an idiot, and you may find the thing you dream of, overnight success, even faster.",1309932153

Say I have opened a File and do a File->Save as on a directory mounted from an external storage (say mounted via NFS ). In such a case the file contents need to copied to that storage and there are two copies of the same content. But with 'git' branching that is not the case at all. When you create a branch you just create a new reference to a commit and you start from there, nothing more than that.",1309932087
