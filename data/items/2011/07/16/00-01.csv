2769757,comment,2768707,2769237,2,0,mdda,,,"But the point of these AAA ratings is that they are the 'top slice' of a pool of lower rated debt.<p>Suppose a typical student is has around $50 in their wallet at any one time : Demanding $50 from a student is pretty risky, and so is demanding $25.  But if I have a large enough room full of students (say 100), demanding $2500 from the room (which on average holds $5000) is much less risky than requiring $25 from each person.<p>That's how AAA securities can be built from bad credits : Not everyone goes bad at the same time.<p>So the argument should not be about how crazy the idea of bad credits allowing the creation of good credits.  The argument is about correlation coefficients.<p>Moodys / S&P / Fitch got the correlation coefficients between subprime borrowers completely wrong, because they believed that house prices could not all simultaneously decline in the US.  And the investment banks had no incentive to explain the errors of their ways to them - and people who weren't ""On-Side"" at the rating agencies were relegated to lower-growth areas.  And the regulators had no clue.<p>And here we are.",1310777886

2769752,comment,2769596,2769596,1,0,geuis,,,"I can't disagree with this more.<p>1) Most bigger open source projects have a core team. Think about the jQuery team for example. Often, the release candidates are intended for the core team, not the general user.<p>2) General users of a particular project generally know better than to use RC's in production. They might not be part of the core team, and unless they are going after a specific feature or bug, will ignore RC's and go with latest stable releases.<p>3) Release Candidates are supposed to be feature complete. If a user needs to start testing their applications against new features being introduced can usually do so early against Release Candidates. So contrary to the author's statement, indeed you can expect 3rd party engineers doing those kinds of integration tests to file bugs when things aren't working right. I've certainly done it, and I imagine many devs on HN have too.<p>4) If you want to look at a situation where you <i>don't</i> get Release Candidates, remember how often Facebook changed and broke Facebook Connect over the last couple years. It is <i>not</i> fun having to re-architect your FB integration 3x within a matter of a few months because they just pushed code live with little or no warning.",1310777830

With that goal in mind, should I focus on learning Objective C for iOS or Sencha Touch? I'm leaning towards Sencha Touch for several reasons, but my problem is that I don't know what is used in the industry. Which one would help me get a job at a startup to develop mobile apps?<p>Here are my pros/cons thoughts:<p>Obj-C\nPros:\n- Direct interaction with the iOS SDK and iOS hardware\n- What the industry and startups do?\nCons:\n- It will take me longer to be effective (big learning curve)\n- I can't use Obj-C skills to develop for other devices.<p>Sencha Touch\nPros:\n- Faster to be effective (smaller learning curve)\n- I can use my skills to develop for several mobile devices at once.\nCons:\n- Cost of a commercial license\n- Does the industry/startup community use it??",1310776249
