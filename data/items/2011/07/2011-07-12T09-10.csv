2754163,comment,2753933,2753933,1,0,trotsky,,,"The author's main issue seems to be with the explanation that running software from the internet is risky, since he removes that in both dialogs. And yet it's unquestionably true - running code from the internet be it signed or unsigned is a pretty risky thing to do unless you know what you're doing. His main argument for why you'd want to remove it is that most people ignore your warnings anyway. However true that is, it's certainly not true for everyone.<p>The advice really doesn't seem to fit the real world. Suppose you had a place with a dangerous undertow and a sign to warn people about it. If five people died one year after choosing to ignore the sign few people would agree that a sensible course of action would be to remove it.",1310464701

2754160,comment,2752133,2752855,1,0,danssig,,,"wtf man, this post is full of nonsense and bizarre assumptions.  Circles aren't for stereotyping people!  No one has groups called ""Blacks"", ""People who are intolerant of other people's cultures"" or ""the Dutch"" (why would a racist follow people he/she hates anyway?).<p>Circles are for providing context.  Every time I go to facebook I see a post from someone I don't remember knowing.  I look in my list and see that they are apparently a friend of mine, but from where?  In Google+ this problem doesn't exist.  When I add them I put them in the context that I know them by (e.g. ""Close Friend"", ""Family"", ""Photography class"", ""WoW Friends"", etc.).  When I know them in multiple contexts I can put them in each one that applies (e.g. ""Colleague"" and ""Friend"" means they see everything I say to friends and everything I say to colleagues).<p>>It certainly isn't something we openly brag about in the real world<p>You haven't even used the service, have you?  It's not something we <i>brag</i> about because no one knows what circles we have!  All other users see (if we allow them to) is how many people we follow total.  Basically the same info facebook shows.<p>>Personally I only have one circle and everyone goes in.<p>To each their own, but I don't even see how this is possible.  You're going to put people like Robert Scoble (someone you might presumably <i>follow</i> but not post baby pictures to) in the same circle as your grandmother?

While building <a href=""http://keeprecruiting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keeprecruiting.com</a> we did not obsess over IE. This wasn't planned or anything but we really did not have the time. We ensured that it displays alright and does not break the functionality but we did not bother to make it look pixel perfect. We have built this product for recruiters who are notoriously uninformed about technology. We were helping one of our beta customers and one of the forms in the app was misaligned in IE6. We do not support IE6 but it was the only browser accesible to her at that time (new WinXP image). She immediately closed the browser double clicked on IE again and googled for chrome. This is one of the typical recruiters who does not understand about computers but somebody has told her that if a site looks bad in IE open it in chrome. The machine did not have Chrome so she went ahead and downloaded it after briefly cursing the IT that they do not install Chrome by default and that she had to get it on to her machine.<p>This is probably because google has started advertising big scale in India[1] as a part of the ""Install Speed"" campaign. Given the unbearably slow internet lines in India, highlighting ""speed"" as one of the features is a clever way to market it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=active&biw=1280&bih=658&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=google+chrome+billboard+india&oq=google+chrome+billboard+india&aq=f&aqi=&aql=undefined&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=25679l27670l0l12l8l0l0l0l0l549l549l5-1l1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=active&#3...</a><p>So for a bootstrapped startup, spending the time on getting the product right is more important than making it look good in IE. In fact, most customers don't care. They will simply move on to a different browser. You can spend the time providing them the features they need. Everybody wins.",1310462756

The way I choose to carve up reality is going to be slightly different from someone else's, and that difference is important.<p>(...and, in fact, the way I'm now reading the original poster's concept of ""public circles"" also seems like it is defined per-poster; but the mechanism on Flickr for ""public groups"" that mc32 is talking about is quite different: it requires a bunch of shared coordination over what that group means.)<p>(...and now I've skimmed through a bunch of your history on HN, and found that you talk about ""public circles"" occasionally, but do not mention ""public groups"", so I'm just confused. You do, however, compare them to Facebook Groups, which to me have that same global namespace problem. It is useful and important that my public circle might be called ""Android Bytecode Manipulation"" whereas someone else's might be called ""General Instruction Manipulation"", as these aren't even hierarchically related; ""Sneaky Programming Hi-jinx"" from someone else may be relevant and interesting to you as well; once you force things to be maintained in a public namespace it becomes a lot less personal and a lot less social in the particular ""sharing is what it means to you"" way that Google+ is all about.)",1310461215
