Cutting through the back of the safe would yield the same contents. In this way, safes are more like BIOS passwords. The password is written to the hard drive and the BIOS acts as a gatekeeper. However, there's no reason you couldn't use a BIOS designed to ignore the presence of a password.<p>If we were to design a physical analog to encryption, it would be more like a matter scrambler. You place your diamonds, jewels, insurance papers, etc. (or, in this case, incriminating evidence) onto a platform and enter a password. The contents of the platform are TRANSFORMED into a pile of pebbles, dirt, and dust which you sweep into a bag. The bag's contents are indistinguishable from anything else in your yard (Remember, GOOD encryption is indistinguishable from randomness as both encrypted data and random numbers do not compress well). The proper password will cause the matter scrambler to reproduce the valuables but otherwise will just yield more dirt, dust, and pebbles.<p>It is therefore an ACTIVE process to reproduce incriminating evidence in a case by decrypting data. One is not providing access to already existing evidence, one is PRODUCING it from pure garbage.<p>Ordo ad chao ac ordo ab chao.",1310179658

The key question is not whether the information on the laptop must be disclosed to the government (we assume the subpoena is proper and if the laptop were unencrypted, the government would have the right to use it at trial), but whether the act of providing the password demonstrates a key element of the crime: that the defendant had control over the laptop and can therefore be assumed to been aware of/responsible for the creation of its contents.<p>In other words, is providing the password a neutral fact--as in Hiibel vs. 6th Judicial District of Nevada, where the Supreme Court found a law requiring individuals to provide a name when stopped legally by law enforcement--or is it self-incriminatory?<p>The Supreme Court has ruled on similar questions in several instances.

Since you now have a new dependency you have to pass all the way down your callstack, it can get painful quickly.<p>You still have the issue of global state, but I think that's altogether more complicated. Sometimes state really is global to your program and exposing it everything makes a certain amount of sense. It may well be ok for managing system resources (thread pools, network connections, IO in general). I think often you can get away with a boolean flag or two shared across a whole app. If it's read-only it's not a problem at all.<p>You need to be aware that every bit of shared state you make available or continue to use is a potential source of bugs and maintenance. Every bit of this that you expose needs serious thought. Don't let it snowball. Even if it means you have to make a few extra types of object or pass a stupid number of arguments all the way down the callstack, that's usually preferable because at least then you can reason about what's going on.",1310177106
