After close to 4 weeks now of trialing Chrome, I'm 99% certain that I won't be going back to FF for development and certainly not for everyday web browsing. I've now installed a total of 10 extensions into Chrome that well enough duplicate everything I had in FF (supporting my web dev and typical browsing activities). And bear in mind this is from a guy who has used FF for many years and was really looking for any excuse not to make the switch. But I gave it a chance and am actually quite surprised that Chrome has won me over.<p>The clincher for me was looking at Chrome extension development. The extension system for Chrome seems really accessible and well thought out and I feel like I could make some Chrome extensions for myself without really any hassle at all. In contrast, I have been told by acquaintances who have made FF add-ons that FF add-on development can be quite an unpleasant experience.",1309584887

PLUS the new Groups feature works like Circles. I have a Group of my close friends that is closed and private. All the photos we upload there are only visible to those in the group.<p>The problem is, Facebook has continued to move the Friends lists feature in more and more obscure places. It used to be easy to see the list and the posts from people in that list, but now they've hidden in the account menu.",1309583082

Name.com domains are $10 always, with frequent no-coupon-code sales at around $7. Namecheap domains are $10 and come with a one year valid SSL cert and whois privacy.<p>By comparison, without coupons, a godaddy domain is $12, and from looking at their site it appears to be an additional $12 for whois privacy, and i couldn't find their SSL certificates start at $50.<p>It's true that godaddy runs a <i>ton</i> of promotions that make their domains cheaper, but you're spending a lot of time to get the price down to their competitor's normal prices, and without the extra goodies you get with them.",1309582826
