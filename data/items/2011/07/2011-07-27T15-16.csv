2812683,comment,2812555,2812632,45,0,a5seo,,,"These pages rank at the top of the site: search because they  have a lot of backlinks.  Why?  Because someone created the profile, then went out and created links to their profile page (e.g. <a href=""http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/links?site=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fuser%3Fid%3Dzithromax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/links?site=http%3A%2F%2Fnews...</a>).  Why?  Because they were probably planning to drop a link on their HN profile page to a page that sells Zithromax.<p>This is a common strategy on Youtube or really any social site that gives you a profile page and the ability to drop a followed link.  Even if you're building junky links to your HN profile page, the overall domain authority and trust of HN is relatively high, so it's a way to launder link juice and create a quality link to whatever it is you're selling.<p>Eric Ward wrote about it here: <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/social-link-manipulation-11429"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/social-link-manipulation-11429</a><p>There's a fairly good sized contingent of the affiliate marketing world that depends on this link building strategy.",1311782356

2812666,comment,2807796,2810642,2,0,rakden,,,"Just pointing this out as a woman who is in CS. There is rampant sexism within the field on the lower tier levels.(Still in school so I have yet to deal with higher level positions) Your grunt programmers, techs, and general support staff are down right scary. I have been hopping around company to company for a bit now and some of the places are just down right creepy. I worked one job where open sexism was encouraged and there was a massive boys club mentality. There was one guy who kept joking about how sexy I was and pulled pulled on my hair whenever he walked by.<p>Also as a whole I have found that even if I am more knowledgeable than everyone around me, I still have people come up and in some of the most condescending ways possible. Many times I am talked down to like I am some sort of child. (I once had someone try to explain how multicast and ssl works to me. They are studying for their A+, I am about to get my CCNP and also churning out all sorts of neat code for our department to help automate a lot of the boring tasks.)<p>I would say its not so much a genetic issue, but more the field itself has many cultural issues it needs to get past.<p>Last note: Filing complaints about a lot of these problems would most likely hurt me in the long run. I figured out after my first couple jobs it is easier to ignore them than try to find a new job.<p>Edit: Regarding skills themselves. It is a much simpler answer to claim that society 'encourages' woman into positions. Even if there was such a gap (Not saying it may not exist mind you) their would still be tremendous overlap and there would be some males within female bounds and females within the male bounds. The odds of that gap being massive enough to overshadow cultural issues is highly unlikely.<p>Also these stories are not representative of my whole experience in the field. They have been cherry picked to help illustrate a point.",1311782115

Members of the alliance would work together to acquire patents, and these patents will be used as patent lawsuit deterrents. Any non-member company who sues a member of the alliance will have to face a dozen lawsuits from other alliance members. (Alliance members should sign a legal agreement not to sue other members on patent-based issues.)<p>Of course for this to be effective a huge number of patents is needed, but there are probably a lot of big companies willing to give big bucks to avoid the patent menace, and they can raise enough money to acquire a huge number of patents. Plus each company will come with its own patents.<p>I guess others have already thought of this and found it impractical, which makes me wonder why it is so.",1311782044

Just to insure that congress doesn't accomplish anything and the markets are uncertain going into election 2012.<p>Splitting the difference is a major problem here.  The Republicans are incentivized to be as crazy as possible because attitudes like yours, and most editorial boards will just split the difference assuming 2 valid points of view.
