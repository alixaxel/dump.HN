However comfortable this may seem to from an employee perspective, if an employer decides to fire you they must really, really badly want to get rid of you. And that can seriously damage your reputation.<p>The result is that instead of firing people, both parties usually make a deal: the employee leaves ""voluntarily"" and gets a big fat final paycheck. Technically no firing has taken place and the whole process is way less confrontational. Employers will gladly give you a reference and keep quiet about why you were let go in exchange for a smooth exit.<p>You'll be hard pressed to find someone in the tech industry in Europe who has ever been fired.",1310799574

Don't focus on recovering losses, focus on the future.<p>Buying colo (or especially higher level stuff like managed hosting or even worse, EC2 or PaaS) from a single vendor with multiple sites doesn't protect you from:
1) Them going out of business
2) Them deciding to bounce you as a customer
3) Them getting raided by FBI/Al Qaeda/etc. at multiple sites<p>You ALSO want to make sure the providers you pick don't share much physical infrastructure (e.g. don't use SoftLayer AND Internap at the same physical buildings...).<p>The hassle is it means 2+ sets of support numbers, 2+ sets of provisioning procedures, 2+ sets of billing and contractual relationships, etc., but it's worth it.

On a lark, I took a class on Native American Literature (just on the name alone, I thought it would have been more Native American lore; it turned out to be contemporary fiction written by Native Americans).  The entire grade was based on one mid-term and one final.  The mid-term I failed.  When it came time for the final, I realized there was no way I could even answer the single question and simply walked out of the class.<p>I fully expected an F for that class, but I ended up with a C, which surprised the hell out of me.<p>I was recently talking with a friend (a former English instructor for a well known university in the United States) about this, and he said I either received a ""Gentleman's C"" or (more likely) the instructor simply thought he lost my paper and erred on the side of grade inflation.",1310796414
