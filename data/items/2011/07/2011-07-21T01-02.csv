2788217,comment,2788110,2788110,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not bad. The app looks great and your page copy is very effectively targeted. However, there isn't enough of it. when I click one of the items in the cycling list of features, then I expect a new page or a significant amount of extra detail 'below the fold' - not a stock photo with a one-line explanation of a concept that is already self-explanatory to anyone working in the industry.<p>there are other features that I want that I don't see, which are increasingly important to ADs. These are not as critical as the 5 primaries identified already, but which in my view are essential for buy-in. If they're absent or not planned for, then a competitor is going to be able to add duplicate your existing features with little difficulty, add others not available here, and generally leverage their brand to drink your milkshake. The first-mover advantage is very slim, especially in a cutthroat business staffed by technological conservatives who are used to overpaying because they're spending OPM. If an existing provider goes mobile within the next 1-2 years (and they will) their install base will swamp yours. Delays to market will be explained away as 'making sure the product is really ready'.<p>So what are those missing features?<p>o screenwriting software integration - Final Draft at a minimum, also Adobe Story and other competitors. FD can generate breakdown lists, and being able to import these will reduce the work needed for breakdown by 80-90%.<p>o screenplay/breakdown versioning - on large projects, changes in shooting order or rewritten scenes are the norm. Assume they will occur and make sure the process of 'forking' is as easy as possible.<p>o Storyboards. I can't believe you don't have 2-way integration of location scouting and breakdown with mobile cameras.<p>o export to media/printing - in a remote location, you cannot safely assume access to the internet, cloud, or universal availability of smartphones or internet-capable devices among the cast and crew. You will still need to be able to produce sides and fall back on more primitive methods. On long nights in the middle of nowhere with terrible weather, paper, pencil and flashlight are going to be around for a while yet. When it comes to charging electronic devices, cameras and sound recorders are going to take priority over ipads and cellphones.<p>o allow for retroactive changes to be made under the cirucmstances described above; sometimes a weary crew will come back to base camp with a list of necessary changes that are handed to a confused production manager, and which must be entered correctly for the following days' shooting schedule to work.<p>o contact management - naturally you want to have that information centralized, but nobody likes having to enter everybody's contact details into a yet another database program with yet another set of misspellings, incorrect phone numbers, yadda yadda. Allow contact import from GMail, Facebook, google+ hotmail, and other major providers. Allow the creation of a contact address that automatically harvests email information and builds the mailing list. Provide call sheets that include hyperlinks and/or graphical maps leveraging some popular mapping API. Use email, Twilio, Twitter, checkin and location services to automagically alert and monitor call times, navigation planning, ride-sharing, and general logistics.<p>o Ensure that the logistical functionality also applies to location/prop management, gear rental, suppliers and so forth.<p>o Include templates for model, location and service releases and allow for digital signature and post-production hard-copy transmission to reduce presale clearance issues. Releases matter, but to so few people on set that they are frequently overlooked during production, leading to expensive headaches later. The closer to sale or release, the more expensive the headache.<p>o Pre/post breakdowns - breakdowns are such a hassle that they are often prepared only for production, while project management before and after principal photography is often done on the back of an envelope. Get pro with this from the outset. Which also means...<p>o input for shooting logs from the AC/Sound team<p>o digital slating - again, this should be out front - scene/shot # and shot clock on an iPad or Android tablet are a no-brainer, and a key visual sell for your branding. A major missed opportunity in your existing design.<p>o Not to mention GPS on mobile devices. Don't just do an electronic implementation of what's already on paper or a laptop and then make people manually add information from digital sensors.<p>o Hell, start planning now for being an input vector for video/audio recording. I have posted audio that was recorded on an iPod because the director suddenly got inspired while he was having coffee with one of the actors and had the means of production in his pocket.<p>o Platform agnosticism - although Apple dominates in the film world, it is by no means universal. Don't confine yourself to a single platform, especially when 95% of your functionality can be achieved with html, css, and node.js.<p>o Build marketing in from the getgo. Eastwood should also be the tool of choice for image tagging tagging, media assets, managing a social media, and driving your marketing campaign from pre-production onwards using the most enthusiastic and committed members of your team - your cast and crew, who stand to benefit directly from the film's success. You'll also need to coordinate their availability for post-production, sales, and release phases, from wrap parties to reshoots to private screenings.<p>o I'm not 100% sure about your branding; the name 'Eastwood' is very clever but might be misinterpreted as implying the authorship or endorsement of a certain Famous Actor...who has more money, fans, and legal experience than your whole team put together. If I were your lawyer, which I am not and which I could not be because I am not a lawyer, then I would advise against infringing on Clint Eastwood's right of publicity because that would basically require you to give him a Large Amount of Money or ownership of the company in lieu. Great name, now pick another. Sorry.",1311213435

The reason this is a bigger deal than you make it out to be is because Clojure is hosted on the JVM. That means it's generally had a chance to enter the enterprise, and beyond that, has access to the entire JVM library and interop.<p>What this means now is, for the first time, you can write Clojure code on the server, interop with legacy Java code or well-tested libraries, and then write Clojure code on the client, full stack. This, as far as I know, is a pretty big game changer since it allows you to write a full-stack web application that is part of the Java ecosystem in a single language that happens to not suck either.<p>Edit: To clarify, I'm sure there are other JVM lisps, and other Javascript lisps.

2788186,comment,2788091,2788091,1,0,jerf,,,"You don't need a specialized lexer for this. A regex to split on key words (AND, OR) and symbols (parens, whatever else you've got) is sufficient. A parser would be helpful, <i>if</i> you really, <i>really</i> think your customers are going to run complicated queries against your database with nested OR clauses and serious use of parentheses and stuff. You may have such customers, they do exist, but bear in mind the average user has no idea what the difference between ""A AND (B OR C)"" and ""(A AND B) OR C"" is; if you don't know why your users are above average and picky, you might consider something very, very simple instead.<p>But let's go on assuming that's not the case, because it's certainly a fair possibility. The next step is to find The Tutorial that all parsers <i>always</i> have like it's some sort of law of the universe, the Arithmetic Expression parser. This covers basic operator precedence (multiplication and division vs. +/-), parenthesized expressions, hopefully the unary negation operator, and hopefully at least sketches the evaluation code for the resulting parse tree. Good news! This is almost exactly what you want, except multiplication is AND, addition is OR, and unary negation is NOT. You just need to tweak your regular expression to either emit ""wordA wordB wordC"" as a series of tokens which your parser will add together, or with just a bit of work on your regex, they'll come out as one token. Take your time transforming the grammar, one step at a time; make it so it takes ""3 AND (1 + 3)"" instead of ""3 / (1 + 3)"" first, little steps, because the error messages that come out of parsers can be a bit confusing at first and you want your changes to be minimal.<p>This may take a few hours to wrap your head around, but it's a very easy use case for parsing, and the time spent learning how to really, truly parse is time well spent.<p>Oh, and be careful with the generated regular expressions; there are some DOSes that can be done with those, and be sure you do something sane with asterisks and other special characters. If your regex engine supports the equivalent of \Q and \E in perl, use it.",1311212319

    db_obj.fromClause(this.bizarreCaseStatement()

When I start working with db_obj, it might come from some other part of the application for which the ""basic ORM"" was just fine.<p>Now I want to add some weirdo custom stuff in but I can't - I have to go back to the part of the application that produced db_obj in the first place and refactor that to use custom SQL.<p>It's one or the other.",1311211709

2788161,comment,2784086,2786167,1,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I think you read my post wrong. I too am skeptic of the module system. I highlighted why I think this language will be more likely to be used as a better Java by thinking like the hypothetical target. I also noted a key fact that framing is a big deal. So while your conclusion makes perfect sense, it fails to give psychology enough weight. Scala can do OOP well yes but it also caters to functional programming. Kotlin seems like it will not go out of its way to do so. To some people this is good. I prefer functional programming and so would still use Scala by default when on the JVM.<p>Pattern matching is easy to get good enough. In fact I've never found a pattern matching system that I wasn't happy with. Scala's case classes are powerful but a bit different to the norm, I think Kotlin's will be more familiar to many by de-emphasizing algebraic types. But they do clutter it with what in Scala would be called extractors.<p>As for syntax. People create crazy DSLs by leveraging corner cases in scala's lenient syntax, Kotlin seems to restrict there. I think this is a good thing for many people. I came to Scala with a good amount of functional programming experience, I found its concepts dead easy. The hardest part was the syntax and how many different ways there were to do some simple things e.g. function syntax and proper uses of _ are tricky for the new comer.<p>How is Scala big? For the reasons I think it is wonderful and would rather use it. Existential types, extractors, implicits, optional laziness, currying, actors, composing with maps and fold at the forefront. I think it is elegant but most people prefer to just get the work done. By the way, you don't need higher kinded types to do a collections library which takes first order functions. You just need higher kinds for succinctness.<p>I will note that I mostly write F# code and am less familiar with the JVM - thanks for the correction on inline. Although Scala's doesn't seem to be of the same caliber as F#'s based on a cursory search. Do correct me on this too. Although Scala does have a higher kinded type system. Unlike F#. In F# I sometimes have to abuse inline to get around this limitation.",1311211572
