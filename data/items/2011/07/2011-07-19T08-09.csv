2780069,comment,2778342,2779501,7,0,Mz,,,"I spent some time at death's door and I have 2e kids in my life and other significant challenges.  Some thoughts:<p>1) Deal with your problems.  You probably have some significant problems.  But most of us don't want to really face them.  For example, you probably have some medical condition that runs in the family that would likely respond well to preventive measures in terms of eating better and exercising.  Most people do.  If you are American, diabetes, obesity and so on are rampant.  Eating right and exercising regularly are personal challenges, especially when surrounded by the way most Americans live.  I do this every day and it's really rather exhilarating.  I and my oldest son take a 7 mile walk at least once a week as part of our efforts to take care of our health issues.  It's a lot more satisfying than spending every other weekend in the ER like I did some years back.<p>2) Do volunteer work with some charity that deals with some very big problem that hits a nerve with you personally.  I have done volunteer work at a homeless shelter and I run a health site (that doesn't really make money, so it's still basically ""charity"") and spend time on email lists for folks with the kind of diagnosis I have.  When I most feel like wallowing in self pity, my awareness that my problems are so much more manageable than that of most folks with the type of problems I have helps keep me grounded. If you are used to living in a more insulated fashion, I think the effect would be to keep you alive and help you avoid sticking your head in the sand pretending you don't really have problems.<p>Peace.",1311065567

If you want to do that, there are much better alternatives. This class was about content (I used the term ""Answers"" in my posts). When it comes to content, the required skill set is finding the answer, compiling the answer, assembling the answer, putting a team together to collaborate to find the answer, etc. Learn writing somewhere else. The fault is thinking that writing is the only way to express these skills. Writing has certain formal conventions, such as citing sources. A failure to cite sources is considered plagiarism. Content is different. Facts cannot be copyrighted, and this class was about content and those facts. With respect to facts, the conventions are different. It makes no sense to pretend to teach students to write when you are trying to teach them content. We do it in academia because except for medical school, law school--where writing papers is relatively uncommon, compared to other disciplines--we don't know another way to do it. But don't call this cheating. Failure to document sources, OK. Academic dishonesty if there's a misrepresentation, OK. Providing the professor with the content he asked for in business school?  That's not OK??",1311063818

It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them. It counts the destruction of our redwoods and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and the cost of a nuclear warhead, and armored cars for police who fight riots in our streets. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.<p>""Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages; the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.

Just like we would search for our keys under the lamppost, instead of near the car where we lost them.<p>Unemployment rate is similar.  We don't <i>want</i> everybody to work full time.  Most jobs are boring and tiring anyway.  No, the goal should to <i>reduce</i> mandatory work.  Blame Microsoft?  Actually we should <i>thank</i> them.

I've worked a lot with consultants. I'm not picking on McKinsey, and when I hire them I want them to check precedents.

If they find an answer that someone else has come up with that solves my problem, and it's not a trade secret, copyrighted or otherwise off-limits, I'm thrilled. There is all too much reinvention of the wheel. I still see this as a failure to document sources, not ""cheating."" One of my points is that the exercise of writing papers should not be the only way to learn. 
Take a macro view of things: some have written that with respect to Turnitin that they are horrified at 40% of the papers are plagiarized. Really? These papers for the most part are not word-for-word copied (though I admit that some are). Do you really think that hundreds of thousands of high school students have original insights about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye? Or that there is similar originality in readings of Aristotle's On the Parts of Animals? In a way it's reassuring that statistically these papers tend to converge. Of course, whether it is worthwhile to include Salinger in a curriculum is another story. As far as original insights, my guess is that Jerry's troubles at summer camp (bed wetting) might have contributed in some way to his oeuvre.
