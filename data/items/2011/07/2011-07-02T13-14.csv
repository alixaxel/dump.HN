2721606,comment,2721141,2721141,2,0,NathanKP,,,"I'm not sure what to count as my first business:<p>At about age eight I did the lemonade stand thing, but quickly noticed that most people driving by my stand didn't purchase. So I took my lemonade operation mobile, in a red flyer wagon. By visiting a couple local parks I was able to sell easily 5x as much lemonade as I could staying in one place. It was a fun homeschooling project, as my parents gave me ""investment money"" and I had to keep track of my expenses and income and pay them back.<p>After that the next thing I would count as a startup would be Amazon Affiliate Script, when I was 19. It was basically a wrapper script for Amazon Affiliate which displayed products automatically based on page keywords and the visitors geographical location. It served nearly 10 million ads, and made about $500 dollars total, before Amazon adopted a similar feature and rendered my idea not very useful.<p>Currently, at age 21, I run BookFlavor (<a href=""http://bookflavor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bookflavor.com</a>), a book search engine that generally makes $75-$100 a month. It's a cool side project that I show off and which gets me 2-3 job offers a month.<p>However, I don't have much time for other projects or even my own projects these days as I am working full time for StoryDesk (<a href=""http://storydesk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storydesk.com</a>), a startup creating a web authoring tool that helps sales teams create their own iPad apps using simple drag and drop, WYSIWYG editing without writing a line of code.",1309614695

Look at the Wikipedia article.<p>> <i>personally, i believe that capitalism is inherently statist</i><p>Maybe its name it's unfortunate.  Some people call it free-market anarchism, but that includes other kinds like mutualism, agorism, etc.<p>> <i>a state is simply an entity with a large amount of land capital.</i><p>Land and capital are not the same thing.  You can have any of them independently of the other.  Are you aware of geolibertarianism?<p>Also you're blending together capitalism (and its crony state) as a system with capitalism as a free market ideology.  And I hope you don't confuse free market with taxing the poor and subsidizing the rich as crony governments do.<p>Last but not least, please read about panarchism.  All flavors of anarchism can coexist with each other, because they aren't really that different.",1309614579

2721602,comment,2720840,2721049,4,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"There's problems with all three of your statements:<p>1. IE on XP isn't getting any better, it's stuck at IE8. I'm sure people in Redmond are as desperate for people to upgrade from XP as we all were for people to upgrade from IE6, but as we've experienced, wishing and hoping aren't enough. Last I heard XP was 60% of Firefox base, and if you assume they are older machines, it makes sense that they also have an incentive to use the fastest browsers to wring the most out of their machines. If all they do is browse then it makes much better financial sense, and the alternative browser probably clears up a bunch of security problems too.<p>2. IE isn't the default browser in Europe, which is a market that's bigger that the U.S. New users get prompted to choose from a short list, which includes Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera. In many other countries IE isn't as dominant due to language or cultural issues. In the UK and US which are traditionally strong for IE, Safari on Mac is also strong which makes up for weaker showings by Firefox and Chrome and that's a growing and influential market that Microsoft has conceded entirely. Only China and South Korea are really IE strongholds and South Korea now has something like 15% Android thanks to an explosion of mobile browsing and being the home country of Samsung and LG (mobile being another growing and influential market that Microsoft seems totally out of the running for).<p>3. If people really are that lazy then a) it prevents them upgrading XP, b) it prevents them switching back to IE if previously switched to (the auto-updating) Chrome and Firefox, and similarly switching from Android and iPhone in mobile..",1309614470
