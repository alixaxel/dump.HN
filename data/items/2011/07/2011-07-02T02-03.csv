2720876,comment,2719551,2719551,3,0,Skywing,,,"I'm really glad to see a site, in YC, trying to tackle the problem of contacts. A particular problem I always see is that when people lose their phone, or lose all their numbers, they create groups or events on Facebook and spam their whole friend's list for numbers. Also, if people on my contact list change their number then all of a sudden I no longer have it. (emails, twitter accounts, etc too)<p>I'm happy for Everyme, but this really serves as more of a reminder to myself to follow my gut instinct. I had been working on my own version of a service that aimed to solve these exact problems that I felt like I had, myself. I had worked on it for about a month and had it working with full-text search on various info fields for each contact. I kind of wanted it to be a Quora (the find/ask a person feature) meets a cloud sync'd contacts service. Time to apply for YC S11 rolled around and I had planned on applying with this site, but at the last minute I switched to a location-based chat website, Geohello, which I posted on here. I spent a brief week or two on Geohello before switching to yet another site, which was a dumb location-based Groupon clone, for your iPhone, called Ayowe. I ended up applying to YC with both Geohello and Ayowe, instead of my contact info website, called Tactifo. Neither of the two sites I applied with got in. (I applied with two because I had a co-founder)<p>Just goes to show that I should have stuck with my gut and focused on the original site. Anyways, best of luck to Everyme! :)",1309574211

On very large tablets it will be crucial to have ""app management"" (sort of like window management).<p>It's not only for usability, but for the software market.  Most developers will be stuck at their assumed resolutions for awhile.  And initially, no one will want to run an iPhone app at ""10x"" size, but people would probably be happy if they could at least run 4 iPhone-sized apps on the screen at once.<p>And this would go a long way toward true multitasking, because a tablet could present the <i>illusion</i> of a large-screen integrated app that is in reality a collection of small utilities from more than one developer.  That could make a truly valuable tablet, since at all times you could display exactly what you want to use (e.g. a stupid drawing pad app in one corner, an SSH session in another, heck a VNC session in a 3rd corner and your E-mail in the 4th).",1309574186
