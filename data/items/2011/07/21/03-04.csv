Ok...so group everyone in one circle, simple enough eh? You don't have to classify your contacts, you can simply put them in an ""All"" circle. Plus, are you saying it's easier to manage all your friends as individuals like you have to on FB? At least Google provides a way of classifying your friends, better than no way at all. Having too many Circles is the user's fault, and yet in the end, it doesn't even matter since you can easily treat all your contacts as one Circle.<p>If Google+ does not end up succeeding, it will not be because people get ""Circles Fatigue"".

That means the AI needs to not give the player any block that would let him fill it (I,J,L,S,T) - so the player can force the AI to just give him O and Z blocks. If the hole isn't against the wall, the AI can only give O blocks. There are only a few, if any board states where the player cannot create a line using only O and Z blocks - the player just needs to make sure he doesn't loosen the restriction on the AI (such as by covering the hole).<p>If the hole is 2-wide, depending on the hole's depth, the AI may only be able to give T blocks, if even that, and for most board states, you'll probably find that T blocks can be used to make a line without loosening the restrictions on the AI.",1311219961

2788401,comment,2785239,2786005,1,0,pyre,,,"This was just explained to me by our DBA for a data warehouse (technically a 'data mart' not a data warehouse if you want to pedantic) that we're building. Say you've got two tables:<p><pre><code>  table a (\n    id integer primary key,\n    data text\n  )\n\n  table b (\n    id integer primary key,\n    postal_code text\n  )\n</code></pre>\nIn reality, postal_code is a natural key, so there's no need to the surrogate key b.id but if you insist on using it that way you'll end up with this:<p><pre><code>  select *\n  from a inner join b on a.id = b.id\n  where b.postal_code = '97000'\n</code></pre>\nThe query plan for this will end up something like:<p><pre><code>  NESTED LOOP\n    TABLE B\n      WHERE postal_code = '97000'\n    TABLE A\n</code></pre>\nThat means that it will do a <i>full table scan</i> of table a for each record in table b where postal_code = '97000'. There are a couple of ways to mitigate this:<p>1. Use postal_code as the key.<p>2. Perform two queries:<p><pre><code>  select * from b where postal_code = '97000';\n</code></pre>\nand use the result of that to filter table a<p><pre><code>  select * from a where id in (*); -- or similar\n</code></pre>\nSo now it only does a single pass table scan of table a<p>3. Use Oracle which has something called a 'star join' which basically does option #2 automatically for you.<p>Obviously this is the simple case. Things get more complex the more tables you add in.",1311218254

I think the grandparent is missing that only in very special circumstances does the i7 make a difference, probably less than 1% of your time.<p>Lets assume its 10%. 3 years * 52 weeks *40 hours per week= 6,240 hours working.<p>Lets assume that for 10% of that day you're using your computer in a way that the i7 is able to make faster. Assuming you get 10% speedup, that saves you 62.4 hours, the equivalent of paying yourself $8.01/hr.<p>But frankly, assuming your computer spends 10% of your workday performing i7 optimized tasks seems high. 1% is more likely (if not still unreasonable). And at that rate, you're paying yourself $80.13 per hour.<p>And keep in mind that you are paying yourself to sit there for an extra couple microseconds between computer operations.<p>Not that you shouldn't get the i7.
