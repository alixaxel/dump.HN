2774822,comment,2772607,2773881,2,0,staunch,,,"The truth is that you pivoted Mahalo years ago to being a ""How To"" site. It wasn't a real search engine for very long at all. You saw what Demand Media was doing and did exactly the same thing. You denied it the whole time and then finally admitted it only recently when Panda broke the model for you.<p>During those denials you would always point to a couple decent pages on Mahalo that were well done. Now you can point to a few <i>videos</i> that are well done.<p>The problem is that your product was, and is, 95% mass produced crap and 5% good stuff.<p>Look at the recently uploaded content on Mahalo's YouTube accounts. It's almost nothing but 1-5 minute clips of crap like<p>""How to say 'Knife' in Spanish""<p>""How to say 'Door' in Spanish""<p>""How to say 'Chocolate' in Spanish""<p>And the music/computer/gaming equivalents.<p>This isn't the kind of product that people are going to come to rely on or love. They'll only find this stuff when they SEO-stumble across it.<p>If YouTube decides to slap down video content farms you'll have the same problem all over again.<p>If you look at some of the best SEO-driven sites like StackOverflow, TripAdvisor, or Yelp you'll notice something entirely different from Mahalo. Those sites have massive followings of people that actually <i>love</i> them. They are reliant on SEO, but in a very different way from Mahalo.<p>People search Google for a programming question and <i>scan the page</i> for the stackoverflow.com link. They search Google for a restaurant and <i>scan the page</i> for the yelp.com link. Same with TripAdvisor.<p>No one is searching Google or YouTube then scanning the page for the Mahalo videos.<p>You have a head start on video content farming and Google seems to be pretty slow. Eventually the focus on quantity over quality will catch up to you and you'll suffer the same way you did with Panda.<p>The product just isn't good enough to stand the test of time.",1310954330

2774818,comment,2774254,2774743,19,0,abduhl,,,"I think it would help if more people understood the time demands of teaching a course (neglecting other faculty duties, just looking at the teaching component).  Many people have seen it only from the student side and not the instructor side.<p>From my experience, teaching a 3 credit course (meeting MWF for one hour each with no labs/recitation) requires the three hours for the course plus the following:
1. an additional 1 to 2 hours per class of prep. time to get yourself situated for that paricular class
2. 0.5 to 1 hours of meeting with your TA regarding grading and what is being covered in the course this week (more if the TA has a recitation session)
3. 3 to 5 office hours for students (of which a majority is not used, but still must be set aside)<p>All together, teaching a three hour course takes about 10 hours a week on the low end.  Dealing with cheating students takes time from every portion of this 10 hours.  You must waste time in class addressing the cheating.  You must waste time in preparation thinking of ways to stop the cheating.  You must waste time talking with your TA about the cheating.  You must waste time dealing with students who will admit to ""working together"" but never ""cheating"" during your office hours.<p>The most important part of this, and the part that gets eaten up the most, is the office hours.  This is where students should come to delve deeper into a subject or clarify material.  Dealing with students during this time sets back students who truly have an interest in the subject and cripples students who have fallen behind (which will most likely lead to more cheating!).<p>While 44 hours over a semester sounds like nothing to most people, it is actually a significant amount of time wasted for the class.<p>As an aside, many students think that teaching is a faculty member's first and foremost duty.  Depending on the school, this can range from absolutely true to downright false.  Most schools have a layout on what they expect from their faculty regarding research, teaching, and service.  Most schools weight that in decreasing priority as listed.  If a school is well-known for its research, chances are it follows this pattern and teaching is not a priority for the faculty outside of good student evaluations.<p>Edit: A course at my school lasts for approximately 15 weeks which comes to ~150 hours per semester at 10 hours per week.  At 44 hours, dealing with cheating would take 30% of my time spent on the course during the semester.",1310954051

But in my imagination, my approach would be much less time-consuming. I cribbed this from my high school physics teacher. It involves little detective work and no long drawn out confessions.<p>When cheating is detected, simply send a note to the student with the following: ""I'm aware that you cheated on this assignment. You have received a failing grade on it. The next instance of cheating will be referred to the honor board and you will fail the class."" Any student who wished to contest the charge would be referred to the honor board immediately. Contest it with people whose job it is to handle this sort of thing. The policy on cheating would be posted at the beginning of class and strictly enforced.<p>The reason why this is so much more efficient is because the net time spent compared to a non-cheating assignment is probably negative. This is simply because you no longer have to read or grade the papers that are found to be copied. Since there is no conversation to be had with the student, there's also no extra time spent there. The only marginal cost is if a student wishes to appeal your verdict, but I doubt there will be much of that happening since the consequences would almost certainly be more severe.<p>This also solves the problem of bad ratings. There's no need to play the hard-ass in this situation, which is probably where the rating trouble comes from. Since the interaction is terse and factual, the students won't have much face-time in which to build resentment. You could even put something like, ""I know you can complete this class successfully, which is why I'm not referring you to the honor board on the first offense. Please come to the TA's office hours if you're having trouble on your papers in the future. I look forward to working with you and helping you achieve your goals in this class"" at the end of the email to put a positive spin on it. (Although the idea of having ratings come from people with whom the professor is in a somewhat adversarial relationship seems like one that could be improved.)<p>Anyway, I see where this guy is coming from but I'm not sure his is the right decision.
