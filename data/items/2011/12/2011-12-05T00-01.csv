 In my opinion ,this is not the best option.At some point ZD would have to come back with a response,atleast to their customers. Not responding keeps Freshdesk(FD) in driving the discourse and makes ZD look timid.<p>- CEO should make a short tweet ( & no more) ,IMMEDIATELY.It should say "" Still stand by my ripoff comment.IMHO ,a crappy ripoff. "" . this will prevent this issue from becoming any more sensational and will stop adding fuel to the issue  . ZD CEO should stick to his ground by saying that FD IS A RIPOFF<p>The ZD CEO made a subjective,nasty comment about a competitor's product - this happens all the time.
ZD DID NOT make any of the nasty comments like ""indian cowboys"" etc. Ben keepes and the personal comment by ZD  is the only connection with ZD.  FD is trying to make ZD look guilty by association.<p>- Next they should go on the offensive by targeting FD customers and  prove that FD is indeed crappy. eg FD customers will get 6 months free.",1323046795

My real gripe with Rails is about how it disparages good enterprise-class database practices, and so this is why I'd call it a ""toy"" system.<p>That doesn't mean you can't do interesting things with it, but rather that you are essentially talking about an application closely tied to the db schema it stores its data in.  The idea of enterprise-class applications sharing their data in a common database is something entirely foreign to (and incompatible with) the Rails way.<p>This doesn't mean it can't be used in an enterprise environment.  For example, you could have a Rails/MySQL app with data imported periodically into a PostgreSQL multi-application database, but I wouldn't call the former ""enterprise-class.""",1323046698

Gah, at least exceptions provide a backtrace.<p>What's needed is a dependent type system (like that of ATS or Ada) that allows the range of allowable values for an integer to be decalred.  A halfway-smart compiler can then statically check (using e.g. abstract interpretation) that the intermediate results of arithmetic performed on such integers does not exceed the system integer size, and that the results do not exceed the declared size of the result variable.<p>(In fact, if the programmer places runtime checks at the right places, such range declarations aren't even necessary as they can be inferred by the compiler.)<p>Such a system would <i>statically guarantee</i> that no overflow will occur.

3312444,comment,3312101,3312101,0,0,acqq,,,"This is wrong on so many levels it's hard to even start criticizing. TL/DR: the guy wants more or less the semantics of decimal floating point numbers (with NaNs and all) in integers, and believes that such ""integers"" would be ""better"" in his words""to make it difficult for those specialized integers to flow into allocation functions, array indices, etc. That sort of thing is the root of a lot of serious bugs in C/C++ applications.""<p>In fact, integers that we have in current CPUs are product of let's say at least 50 years of engineering and they are optimum, even if somebody declares them ""the root of a lot of serious bugs in C/C++ applications."" I've got the news for him: a lot of other and older languages have the same behavior because that's the local optimum for a hardware implementation and it will remain so even once we have decimal fp numbers of the same speed as integers (even if we ignore that actually we won't). Before two's complement there were other integer variants implemented in hardware and they turned out to be less functional as two's complement representation.<p>Then gives the example that if this code<p><pre><code>  result = result * 10 + cursor - '0';
</code></pre>
were evaluated as<p><pre><code>   result * 10 + (cursor - '0')
</code></pre>
there won't be overflow, totally ignoring that the languages often have exactly defined order of evaluation and that if the language has the defined order of evaluation from left to right for + and - then the only proper evaluation is only<p><pre><code>  (result * 10 + cursor) - '0'
</code></pre>
It's as simple as that.<p>Then he ends with the loop that wouldn't work with floating point NaNs (and therefore wouldn't fit in NaNs for integers too):<p><pre><code>  for (x = INT_MIN; x != iNaN; x++)
</code></pre>
because every number is not equal to NaN, so the above loop would never end.<p>I'd say everything he wrote is not even wrong.",1323046492
