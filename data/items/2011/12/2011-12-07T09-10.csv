This is a good and welcome move by Microsoft, but the whole process of paying distribution partners to changer user's home page to MSN and search engine to Bing is rather sketchy""<p>I am puzzled by the reaction of some journalists and people here. Have you actually thought why the toolbar is marked as malware? Usually, that's because one guy in one of the AV companies installed the toolbar, didn't like it and so put a flag on. Malware as a definition is something that does harm   to your computer. We could argue whether this is actually the case as most of the toolbars, including StartNow just provide search functionality and homepage reset - this is how they make money - there is no reason to do anything sketchy on top of that.<p>I am not trying to defend toolbar companies here but the quote above that its actually a good thing to replace StartNow with Babylon is misinforming the public. These toolbars all do the same thing and they should either be marked all by AV companies or not. Of course its never gonna happen because there are some AV companies that won't flag toolbars because hey - they distribute toolbars too!",1323251841

I don't know anything about the industry, but it seems like the only reason the movie studios control production is because they own distribution.

3323147,comment,3320332,3322101,2,0,mike-cardwell,,,"<p><pre><code>  The trust anchor scheme SSH uses is ""key continuity""
</code></pre>
There is also RFC4255 which allows people to publish fingerprints of their SSH server public key in DNSSEC secured ""SSHFP"" RRs.<p>If you have a resolver which supports DNSSEC, you can run this command:<p><pre><code>  ssh -o ""VerifyHostKeyDNS yes"" grepular.com
</code></pre>
You wont be prompted to verify the fingerprint as usual, because  OpenSSH will already have done that verification using the DNS. You also know for sure that grepular.com has resolved to the correct IP address.<p>There is also ""VerifyHostKeyDNS ask"", which just displays the result of the lookup, but still allows you to confirm the fingerprint.<p>DNSSEC allows you to do stuff like this because it secures the integrity of the record all the way from the authoratitive DNS server to the users resolver.<p>There's also DANE (still going through the standards process) which allows you to publish a fingerprint of your SSL certificate on a domain/port basis, in DNSSEC secured DNS. If you install a Firefox addon named ""Extended DNSSEC Validator"", visit <a href=""https://grepular.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grepular.com/</a> and click the lock button to the left of the address bar, you will notice it says:<p><pre><code>  ""Domainname is secured by DNSSEC and the certificate is validated by CA and DNSSEC""
</code></pre>
This is because I'm following the latest draft of the DANE protocol. Will be nice when the spec is finalised and browser support becomes native. I don't like that any CA can currently generate a cert for my domain.<p>Another benefit that DNSSEC brings is with PKA records. I publish a record in the DNS which contains a URL to my public PGP key, and its fingerprint. You can automatically download my key and encrypt something using it by typing:<p><pre><code>  gpg --auto-key-locate pka -ear mike.cardwell@example.com
</code></pre>
Replacing ""example.com"" with ""grepular.com"". Because I also have DNSSEC set up on my domain, if you have a DNSSEC supporting resolver, you know that the fingerprint you've received hasn't been tampered with on the way.<p>Of course, somebody could compromise my DNS server or the end users resolver. I'm not claiming that DNSSEC is a perfect solution. All I'm saying, is that the integrity that it provides to DNS lookups is massively valuable.<p>By the way, I wrote a long article about setting up DNSSEC on Monday: <a href=""https://grepular.com/Understanding_DNSSEC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grepular.com/Understanding_DNSSEC</a><p>[edit] I forgot to mention the ""Certificate Stapling"" functionality built into Chrome now. <a href=""https://dnssec.imperialviolet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dnssec.imperialviolet.org/</a> uses a self signed certificate, but Chrome users wont get any notification about that because of the tech described here: <a href=""http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/06/16/dnssecchrome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/06/16/dnssecchrome.html</a><p>[edit2] Another benefit I forgot to mention. I use third party DNS slaves for redundancy. Because I'm using DNSSEC, those third parties can't serve up different records to the ones I configured, either on purpose or because they've been compromised. Well, they could, but DNSSEC supporting resolvers would just SERVFAIL the modified responses.",1323250556

It's a ridiculously powerful feature. It lets you wrap and replace functions at runtime, which gives you incredible monkey-patching power, which is important to people programming in the real world.<p>My favorite example: Suppose you have a naive O(2^n) recursive factorial() function. I can write ""factorial = memoize(factorial)"" and suddenly your recursive calls are to my new wrapped function, which references your original implementation inside its closure. This is only possible because your recursive implementation dynamically dispatches by name. I have turned your O(2^n) implementation into an O(n) implementation.<p>In an unsafe systems language like C, I would only be able to accomplish the same thing with some severe memory hacks, and in a language like Java or C# I don't know how I would be able to do the same thing without some serious involvement in runtime reflection tools, and maybe even some decompilation.",1323250064
