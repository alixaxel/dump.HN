I'm more than happy to do whatever I can to help him and his company out.<p>BizSpark sponsored the event by buying everyone pizza and beer.  H&F doesn't get a dime out of this.  Hackers & Founders is completely boot strapped ourselves, and do a lot of this for love of the game.  And, we're pursuing becoming a for benefit corporation.<p>When Rand and I first started talking, about speaking to our people a few months ago.  I arranged for SEOMoz to give H&F members two free months of SEOMoz for free.  I emailed that offer to our people last month, but no one signed up.  I figured that after Rand spoke, people would be a bit more interested in trying the SEOMoz service out.<p>I emailed the link to the free trial out with the link to the video to our Meetup, because I'd received about 20 emails asking for both the video as well as the free trial in the past 24 hours.<p>The free trial is also publicly available as a sponsor link on our meetup page at <a href=""http://www.hackersandfounders.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackersandfounders.com</a>.<p>I apologize if people thought that I was trying to game the system.

His writing has helped me out a great deal in the past.<p>And, for what it's worth, SEOMOz has an affiliate program.  If people sign up for a one month trial, the referrers get $25.  It's not really worth that effort for me, and that's not what H&F does.  So, we chose to waive the affiliate fee and SEOMoz chipped in the extra month to help everybody out.",1322823115

Their idea of opening a window is called ""SetVideoMode"", so no wonder it goes wrong.<p>If a software uses X11 windowing in a way that most apps these days do, using extended window manager hints for fullscreen, etc, this problem would not exist. Btw. I use my window manager's full screen feature to do this. It works a whole lot better for games which allow resizing windows (this often excludes SDL-based games because you explicitly have to tell SDL you want a resizable window) than letting the game set full screen mode (usually via some horrible deprecated X11 legacy api).<p>The nVidia display driver is not perfect either, it doesn't support Xrandr yet, so expect problems with multiple displays (and rotation) until the situation is corrected.",1322822970

Whether or not you and I are jerks is immaterial to the fact that when haggling over money, each side is in an antagonistic relationship. Each is rewarded for extracting virtually as much as they can from the other. (Personally, I think it's an absurd system.)<p>And I don't know about you, but I do know a gal who CAN ""program her way out of a for loop"" — I've seen her do it, such females actually exist — and if you're a decent listener, they may do you the favor of telling you about the extra crap they face due to men's kooky gender ideologies.<p>Anyway that said, I agree you can hack somewhat better pay out of a manager by handling them properly. Much of their professional world is social, so they are extra-sensitive to social cues.

There are alternatives to domination and passivity.<p>* Asking more than their highest range — if they negotiate me down, I did something right.<p>* Building my bargaining position by: increasing my relevant knowledge/ability, being a good presenter and listener/talker, overkilling the technical puzzles which you can do at home, and being able to walk away from a given deal.<p>AI prof Patrick Winston has helpful tips on giving presentations: (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9F536001A3C605FC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9F536001A3C605FC</a>)<p>* Note that the initial hiring decision is when the market transaction is made.

I'm claiming that the collective average of STEM and LA leads to a rounded group, assuming ""roundedness"" in this case is considered to mean equally proficient in the diverse areas of knowledge.<p>As a metaphor, assume we have a bag full of red, purple, and blue marbles, where the purple is equivalent to roundedness (having equal amounts of red and blue). Replacing all of the red marbles with perfectly-purple ones actually <i>decreases</i> the purpleness of the bag -- it shifts the average color towards blue. Even if we give the blue ones with ""a bit more 'rounded'"" purple, to echo your call, the average remains shifted more towards blue than it was when there was red to balance it out.<p>LA majors don't have a roundedness value -- pure-LA is as unrounded as pure-STEM. I'm generally working under the assumption that ""roundedness"" means that you're knowledgeable in many areas, instead of only knowledgeable in a single one. Replacing a specific set of specialists with jacks-of-all-trades leaves the group with less average knowledge in the direction of the replaced specialists' knowledge base.<p>You could be arguing to make <i>everyone</i> completely and equally rounded/purple -- replacing both the blues and the reds, so that everyone would graduate with both a full LA degree and a full STEM degree. But your call for adding ""a bit more 'rounded' to STEM majors"" instead of having LA majors didn't sound like that, and making everyone be dual-degree seems a bit infeasible.",1322820388
