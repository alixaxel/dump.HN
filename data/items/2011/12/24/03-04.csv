The tech industry will simply become part of the problem, and politicians will become empowered — more suitors competing for their attention.<p>Instead, I believe the approach to GoDaddy is a better example: that bad policy will hurt politicians’ ability to maintain support.<p>The Internet, and thus the industry, has enormous reach with voters (and lobbyers like GoDaddy). Swaying the support system is our best bet, and much more honest.",1324699181

I worked on ads for Timeline.<p>The article's unsubstantiated premise is that Facebook releases products solely with its bottom line in mind. Based on my experience working on ads for Timeline, I'd say that this is antithetical to our nature. We optimized timeline for user experience (engagement) and released it not because of its impact to our bottom line but DESPITE that.<p>If you aren't convinced, look at the ads on Timeline, and compare to Profile. There were on average four ads per Profile page. Now there's two. People also click away a lot faster on Profile (because there's less content), but people now scroll around and navigate within Timeline. Photos are bigger, we show a lot more content. The resources to support these new products are expensive. If this doesn't illustrate our focus on engagement over our bottom line, color me surprised.<p>Just another point I wanted to clarify: Whenever money changed hands, even for organic content like sponsored stories, they are clearly labeled ""Sponsored."" If you don't see Sponsored, there was no optimization for revenue, because no money changed hands.<p>Ultimately, I think the author is exploiting a confusion between news feed and timeline. Sure, we will experiment with sponsoring organic content in news feed (max one), but they will be clearly labeled and things you can already see.<p>I just wanted to clarify a few issues that the author is either truly confused about, or is aware of but intentionally exploiting. I hope this helped.<p>If you have any questions I can answer, I'll be happy to clarify.",1324698360

They get sold -- no one leases 2-5yo used cars, but buying a nice $50k car used after 2y of lease with better than new warranty and service for 25-30k and keeping it for 5-10y seems to be working pretty well for me.<p>What you'd really need for leases to get old cars off the road is a design for refurbishment and upgrade, like military vehicles, aircraft, etc.  It is reasonable to think electric cars may go that way, with drivetrain swapped out for a new one, but that kind of design usually increases weight and cost.  It probably makes sense to just sell used cars at a discount, or to scrap them.<p>The only way to get used cars off the road is a progressive inspection and road tax system like in Japan, and even them most of the old cars get exported and driven elsewhere.",1324697391
