3392007,comment,3391766,3391766,5,0,quanticle,,,">But when you consider the university’s efforts to accommodate what students and faculty are already using — and its ultimate choice of Google — it raises a larger question. Why do schools even provide an email account anyway? Gmail and most web-based clients are free. Schools — especially state school strapped for funding — could save on huge infrastructure costs by cutting the email systems and just letting student use their own accounts.<p>Why? Verifiability, that's why. Students still use the ""I didn't get the e-mail"" excuse. Having a University controlled mail system allows administrators to see that the message went out <i>and</i> that it arrived at destination.<p>When I confirmed the forwarding between my University e-mail and my GMail account, I had to click past a very stern warning saying that I was now responsible for my own e-mail and it would be my responsibility to ensure that my e-mail address was up-to-date and that official university correspondence was still getting through. In other words, I couldn't use the ""I didn't get the e-mail"" excuse, even when the email <i>actually</i> never arrived. I never had any issues, but I don't know if that was just because I was lucky.<p>We have to remember that e-mail is not a reliable protocol. Mail delivery can fail for any one of a number of reasons. If you're using e-mail to convey financial information (like billing reminders or due dates), you have to take that into account. Having both mailboxes under your control allows you to add a layer of verification on top of SMTP.",1324863688

So it's interesting to see a decent list of distinctive features -- I've gone over it to see what features there are that don't exist in my usual work language, C#. The things off this list which I don't have, couldn't code, and actually want are macros, conditions and restarts, and generic functions. I don't understand MOP enough to comment on, either. I'm pretty sure the rest is either available as libraries, just isn't important enough, or could be coded fairly quickly --  although I'm not sure it'd be wise to try to write common lisp in C#, Greenspun's tenth rule and all. ;)<p>I do note the PG quote at the bottom of the page -- ""the power of Lisp cannot be traced to any single one of them. It is the combination which makes Lisp programming what it is"" -- and I can see that unity being very elegant.<p>But the real standout item is macros. I suppose it's the only unstealable feature. Or rather, those attempts to steal it, like .net DLR Expression Trees, make really ugly code and are never going to be standard programming techniques.<p>Anyway -- thought-provoking.

Other than the questionable methodology of the study options are annoying, especially in the small amounts offered to most low-level employees (in the offers that I have received previously and that I've tried to help friends understand). Also, there is the issue that they are only options (usually non-transferable) so you also have to exercise them (that is, pay for them). I've met more than a few people who just haven't had the cash handy to exercise options before they expired. Then there is tax which can take lots of time and money to sort out if you work for a multinational. Perhaps they should have considered that no net gain does not provide an incentive. Unless you work for a company that is going through record growth or you have the personal resources to capitalize on stock (no debts or other things that need cash more urgently) then stock options are practically worthless.",1324863043

3391984,comment,3388893,3389842,2,0,6ren,,,"Summary: poor abstraction is worse than no abstraction.<p>In Java, the ""DSLs"" you tend to get are at the class level, in different files. Like any abstraction, these can be well- or ill-designed. There's some differences to lisp: (1). the abstractions are less flexible/powerful, so there's less to understand; (2). having them in different files makes it harder to grasp the whole than if all in one file (or one screen); (3). the syntax is fixed, so you can at least understand the symbols without understanding anything else.<p>I think that inventing a new language has the best chance of making something that is a genuinely better solution. But if you want it to be understandable, it's helpful to link it to existing concepts that are already known, understood, and with known modes of use and application, perhaps via metaphor - i.e. adoption through familiarity.<p>But the general case for adoption seems to be that something must be x10 better (or compelling in some way) for people to go through the pain of adoption, of learning new syntax, new concepts, new ways of working, new infrastructure, new tradeoffs, new gotchas, new shortcuts, new consequences, new policies, new standards, new training, new suppliers, and so on.<p>If you can reduce the pain of adoption, adoption is more likely.<p>Put another way: there are two kinds of pain: the pain your solution addresses, and the pain your solution creates. The reason to adopt your solution is to reduce pain, but if the solution itself brings too much pain, it's simply not worth it.<p>Relational databases are an example of this. The relational concept solved the pain of storage change, but also created pain (difficult to use; x10-x100 slower). As those secondary pains were solved (with SQL; with optimization stategies and Moore's Law), its adoption accelerated.<p>So, sometimes a fundamental improvement needs to place power and flexibility over ease-of-use - but to be adopted, sufficient ease-of-use is essential. And your abstraction has to be, not just <i>good</i> or <i>better</i>, but  <i>x10 better.</i>",1324862612

You inherited the social traditions that made you more than a serf, but are not passing those traditions on to the next generation.  They are quickly going away through corporate owned lawmakers creating a neo-feudalistic corporate fascism.<p>All I want is for people like you to spend some of your time engaging in community leadership and politics, like my grandfathers did after the war to create and defend the middle class, the social safety net, and social mobility. You came from a poor background, but I come from an upper middle class background whose ancestors played roles in creating those social programs that kept you alive and gave you access to educational resources. They did it for future generations of poor children like you were, and I want you to pay it forward through civic participation. Don't just tell the poor to go wallow.

Freelancing, contracting, consulting, products. Some have gone further than others.  Some had business model limitations (finding people), others had limitations of my interest.<p>One thing: All made money.  Why?  I was too young to get credit.  The only way I got to do what I loved was to find a way for it to make money, sustainably.<p>12 years later, what do I have to show?  Money made.  Money spent.  Worked hard. Lived Hard. Partied hard. There was no middle, only extremes.<p>In getting there, I starved and managed my last x dollars more times than I count.  Little by little, I rid myself of desire for almost all material, social and other desires.<p>What hurts me to say the most is this.  This suffering was avoidable in many ways looking back.<p>Software startups have two main challenges.  First learning business in general, and two, learning what they are made of as people.<p>The only thing I needed to develop in my self is maintaining a high work ethic (avoiding burnout) and developing a focused pursuit of finding and doing the right things.<p>That doesn't require playing all-in hold em poker with your life.<p>Here's the thing: The act of building a business that doesn't make money itself, seems to me, to be a violation of what a business is meant to do -- make money.<p>If we as creative, creating, innovators expect to sustainably create for a long time, we have to do this for the long haul.  Right now, the culture seems to be give it your all or get out of the way.  The best financial successes rarely have done it like this, though.  Apple bootstrapped.  Microsoft bootstrapped.<p>If I have to love what I do, I have to spend time enjoying it and loving it.<p>Being absorbed to the point where my body, energy, relationships all suffer is akin to saying I'll hold my breath long enough until I reach other side of the pool while under water.  How many drown, how many don't?<p>How much innovative energy and people have been sacrificed to find the fraction of a fraction?<p>How much innovation has been lost where it's needed?<p>Here's my challenge, can we lay down our egos, our need for glory and making a success ""worth it all"", to start solving problems that pay for our time to give us the real freedom to pursue the big ideas without suffering?<p>For me, the quality of my relationships is my wealth.  I became broke because of startups.  No time, making, or creating memories.<p>Now I'm taking it back and launching a few ideas a year as products.  They make money, growing slowly.  I know the idea that I'm to give my all to will come on my path as long as I keep my work ethic up, keep a focused pursuit of recognizing what I need.<p>Until then, living for a living is as important as startups.",1324862485

While they handle the simple cases perfectly well, they forbid some assignments that really can't get you in trouble, and would be quite useful in practice.  In particular, while ""int const * const * "" exists, it can't be assigned from an ""int * * "", even though this is sound.  This makes it hard to write const-correct functions handling 2-d arrays.[1]  kzrdude's link shows how they have to rule out certain constructs that are not obviously wrong.  It doesn't explain how the C++ assignment compatibility rules allow more, while still being sound, but that's a bit much to expect from a C FAQ, particularly as the C++ rules are somewhat involved.  (I can't find a decent reference that explains the rules well.  I found one about six months ago, but didn't save it, as I don't professionally use C++.)<p>[1]: Preemptive pedanticism: Yes, there are difference between C arrays and pointers, the expression types merely decay in the right contexts.

Piracy is Copyright infrigement which was already tried.<p>I'm not going to say it's not illegal - it is. I have no problem with it being illegal, but I do have problems with how it's redefined as the ""big corp publisher"" sees fit. At various times ""piracy"" meant among other things:<p>- playing purchased media on a different player than designed by the publisher<p>- playing purchased media in a different country<p>- making own copy for private use on a different device, or in a different format<p>- breaking disk protection so you don't have to use publisher's spyware<p>- buying used media from previous owner<p>- downloading albums from internet if you already own the cds<p>- using/printing/copying purchased item more than X times (when this fact is not stated in big red letters on the outer packaging)<p>- downloading a copy of some album/book/... if they are not legally sold in your country and cannot be obtained easily enough (for example distributor/producer not shipping items from japan to europe, or country-specific ""bonus tracks"" on albums you otherwise own)<p>- using abandonware<p>I remember at least one article claiming each of those to be ""piracy"" (apart from the last point, which actually is a copyright infrigement now, but i believe shouldn't be). I believe each of those points should be completely legal and are valid use cases, but many publishers claim otherwise.<p>Also you make the common mistake of ""The thing that the musician lost is their revenue"". No - they have not lost anything yet. I might actually like the album which is why I'll buy it later. That's what happened with all albums I have. I download it, if it survives a couple of days without deletion, I'm most likely going to buy it. I'm not going to claim it's currently legal, but unless you're into mega mixes of whoever's on top in pop right now, you've got little chance to check if you really want the whole cd. At least in UK with very limitted choice of on-demand streaming.<p>Re abandonware, availability and country-specific items. I don't care how ""illegal"" it is. If I can't buy Samla mammas manna albums from '70s then noone's losing anything here.

3391947,comment,3391675,3391675,91,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"In 2009 I started a company with another guy, and I used to read articles like this, about how startups are so very difficult, and how you have to put everything on the line, your health, your wealth, your relationships, everything. It's a very common theme in startup-land, and I constantly hear from founders who sacrificed their marriages, worked 19 hour days, slept under their desks, and racked up tens of thousands in credit card debt, all to make their dream a reality. The message is very clear: you have to be willing to do <i>anything</i> to succeed. Articles like this fed my ego, and made me feel like I was part of an elite cadre of founders. Then my startup failed, leaving myself and my cofounder with tens of thousands in debt and a pretty rough mess to clean up.<p>In the meantime, a good friend of mine who started a little project on the side slowly grew it over a period of a couple years into something that supports his family very well and has a good shot at doing millions in revenue within the next 5-10 years. And I don't think he's been very stressed while doing it. He loves what he does, has tons of time for his family, etc. The cynical among us might term this a ""lifestyle business"" and they'd be right. But I don't think that bothers him and I can't say I blame him.<p>There's this really ugly side of the startup world that drives founders to completely unreasonable levels in pursuit of fast wealth creation, and it comes as a result of two factors: founders are naturally ambitious, driven people, and investors are in a hit-driven business. So the result is that investors naturally gravitate towards founders who either hit a billion dollars in a few years, or die trying (sometimes literally), and then investors and founders both are incentivized to craft this story that they only way to win is to win big, fast, and with all your chips on the line. And these things become self-reinforcing, so you have investors talking about how the real reason startups are so valuable is that founders can work so hard that they accomplish a career's worth of work in just a few years. The message is clear: you need to work 90 hours a week and either be the next Dropbox or flame out. And for the model most investors work under, that's the only way they really make money.<p>But the more I look around, the more I wonder if there's really much correlation between blowing your life up and startup success. Yes, you hear a lot of successful founders talking about how they killed themselves to get there. But thanks to survivorship bias, you don't hear from all the ones who risked everything, turned their lives and relationships and health upside down, and then lost. And increasingly, I'm seeing a lot of examples of very successful founders who definitely work hard, but keep an eye on themselves, their health, their relationships, etc. and have lines they're just not willing to cross. 37signals is the classic example here, but there are scores of others, many of them right here on HN. The key seems to be patience and humility, two things a lot of 20-something founders (including myself) have in very short supply<p>Maybe startups are so hard because we're doing them wrong.",1324861545
