They don't even respect the skills I had, they're not academic skills.  This made me doubt myself, and to catch up on the academic side of cs. This taught me the lesson of being overconfident.

Unless the application has a bad internet connection as a requirement I assume its faster or negligible to fetch pages via ajax vs loading them all into the client up front.  As far as choosing between #2 and #3, for my applications its usually obvious, the table either contains 5-25 items (go with 2) or thousands of items (go with 3).<p>In the middle ground i guess it comes down to loading:  Can you afford to use more memory in the web tier or would you rather keep that memory usage down and suffer slightly long update times?  Assuming your database is well designed it should only had maybe 10ms onto your response time to just grab the page from the database vs already having it in memory.",1324529357

Just because the ICANN is in the USA, does not mean that the USA should removing an entire website from the worldwide internet for failing to notice one piece of infringing content that was user-submitted.<p>SOPA is just too vague and not only targets sites which are specifically made for piracy, but also those simply made to allow user submissions, such as Youtube, where there a great amount of original content, not made for copyright infringement. This also targets new sharing platforms, including those not yet made. Launching a new sharing platform as a startup is going to be almost impossible under this law. If SOPA was more specific towards the sites that took part in rampant piracy (and did not discard the notion of innocent until proven guilty), I would be far more supportive of it than I am now.<p>The idea of the ""internet"" being disrespectful towards content creators is an uninformed generalization. The internet is a community anyone can be part. There are no formal requirements to be part of it, and as a result of that, there are going to be people, who will take part in such activities. Due to the fact that there no requirements to be part of the internet, it is not possible to make a claim about the internet as a whole.<p>Lastly, iPhone jailbreaking and game-console hacking is so the owner of the device has the freedom to use their device in the way they choose.

The system uses the different sensors to determine occupancy times and then in turn determines the necessary amount of time needed to run the AC so when you'd transition from an unoccupied to an occupied state, you do so efficiently while maintaining thermal comfort(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_comfort"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_comfort</a>), which is measured with light, temperature, humidity and potentially CO2 levels (I'd have to reread the article to see what the Nest actually has).<p>georgieporgie asked about access to thermostat information being accessible over wifi. My second stab is that the thermostat actually reports back to the Nest servers with their unique ID, you register the stat to your account and pushing the button sends a signal to the server confirming you are in fact in possession of device. From there, the thermostat sends periodic updates and receives messages about how it should be running.<p>The ZigBee support will most definitely be for future/additional appliance communication and total site monitoring (energy consumption, fault detection, etc).",1324527042

3380326,comment,3379962,3380189,23,0,cheald,,,"The concern is that because Coffeescript automatically scopes variables to the scope of their first reference, it can introduce maintenance issues. Consider the following:<p><pre><code>    foo = ->\n      bar = ""woot!""\n      console.log bar\n</code></pre>\nThis compiles to:<p><pre><code>    var foo;\n    foo = function() {\n      var bar;\n      bar = ""woot!"";\n      return console.log(bar);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nbar is locally scoped to foo(). Now, 2 weeks later and 200 lines earlier, you come along and define:<p><pre><code>    bar = ->\n      alert ""Holy crap cheese is awesome!""\n</code></pre>\nWhich compiles to:<p><pre><code>    var bar, foo;\n    bar = function() {\n      return alert(""Holy crap cheese is awesome!"");\n    };\n    foo = function() {\n      bar = ""woot!"";\n      return console.log(bar);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nNow, all of a sudden, the ""bar"" reference in foo isn't scoped to foo() anymore, it's scoped globally, and once you invoke foo(), it'll replace the function bar with a string, potentially breaking your app. It's an ease-of-maintenance issue.<p>This isn't consistent behavior, though. If you define your top-level bar() function <i>after</i> foo, like so:<p><pre><code>    foo = ->\n      bar = ""woot!""\n      console.log bar\n\n    bar = ->\n      alert ""Holy crap cheese is awesome!""\n</code></pre>\nThen you get ""correct"" scoping (and the outer bar is shadowed):<p><pre><code>    var bar, foo;\n    foo = function() {\n      var bar;\n      bar = ""woot!"";\n      return console.log(bar);\n    };\n    bar = function() {\n      return alert(""Holy crap cheese is awesome!"");\n    };\n</code></pre>\nOn one hand, it could be argued that this is a ""name things better"" problem, but on the other, I have to agree that it'd be nice to be able to explicitly scope things when needed. Given that the behaviors are divergent based on what order the variables appear in, I'd say it's confusing enough that a way to explicitly say ""hey, I know what I'm doing, I want to shadow any outer variables and declare local scope here"" would be useful.",1324526869
