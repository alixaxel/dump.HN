He appears to be picking and choosing particular statistics that support his claims while ignoring others. For example, he talks about low marijuana use after saying that Portugal had a relatively high rate of use of hard drugs, which to some extent compete with marijuana for use.",1324951153

I appreciate everyone being civil while still letting me know this isn't very good. In all honesty, I think I was lazy in putting it together.

It's not as alien -- it's not as big a deal for you to go through an art gallery and chat up yuppies as it is for her to go through a convention center being gawked at by nerds.<p>After my girlfriend and I had been going out for six months or so -- this was five or six years ago -- I got her a laptop and a wacom pad. She was a painter -- she'd never touched photoshop, illustrator, corel or anything. I tried to teach her how to use them.

3394492,comment,3392567,3393041,4,0,m0nastic,,,"So, here is the list of the things that I'm most passionate about (all with equal weight):<p>* Application Security<p>* Black and White fine art photography with an emphasis on people<p>* western furniture from 1910-1965<p>* The women's fashion industry between 1990-2000<p>* 20th Century Russian literature<p>* Syncopation in drumming<p>My girlfriend has absolutely zero interest in any of those. Sometimes she'll patronize me when I start going off on a tangent about one of them, but more often than not, she'll stop me and say ""elevator"" which is her code to let me know to just give her the highlight of what I'm talking about.<p>If I were compiling a list of qualities for an ideal relationship partner, I might include any or all of those as things I'd like them to share an interest in. It would seem to be beneficial to be with someone with similar interests.<p>I've known people who share similar interests. I don't quite think there's another person who shares all of my passions, but with the exception of application security (for what it's worth, I've yet to have a relationship with someone else who likes busting applications), I've been with people who are also passionate about those things. There's been no appreciable difference in how those relationships have turned out.<p>The one thing which I do think is of the utmost importance, is for your relationship partner to understand ""passion"", regardless of what your passion is in.<p>My girlfriend is a writer. She understands that when I'm sitting at my computer for long periods of time swearing about session id's and verbose error messages I'm in a similar state to how she gets when she's sitting in front of her computer writing.<p>She loves how excited I get when I storm out of my office into the kitchen and tell her ""They're totally fucked, I can take money from other people's accounts."" If I start to regale her with the method I've used to perform such an activity; she gives me the look, and I stop. But she gets why I'm excited.<p>So I'm not going to go so far as to say that it'd be a bad thing to be in a relationship with someone who shares the same passions as you, but I will say I think the key is finding someone with passion about anything. Someone who will give you support when you're spinning your wheels, or can't quite figure out how to do what you want to do. Those people are keepers.",1324950181

How am I supposed to boycott Nike or Reebok?  I buy shoes like once every two years.  Should I write an angry blogpost a year or two from now when I pointedly buy a non-Nike shoe?<p>(As an aside, why the hell are Nike or the Ford Motor Company supporting SOPA?  Is it one of their subsidiaries, or just corporate solidarity?)<p>An effective boycott needs to be noticeable, and that means either terminating a subscription or stopping an extremely regular (daily or weekly, perhaps monthly if it's substantial enough) purchase.  The only other company on the list which seems vulnerable to that sort of boycott -- unless there are far more people picking up something weekly from Tiffany's than there should be -- is Time Warner.  Terminating your cable service is a very immediate, noticeable act.  If as many people terminated their TWC service as transfered domains away from GoDaddy, I think it would make some headlines.<p>Of course, internet service is pretty screwed up in most markets.  Many people don't have a choice of (high-speed) internet service provider at all, so protesting TWC probably requires turning off your internet entirely, which is pretty hard to manage.  So really, GoDaddy is probably the <i>only</i> company on the list which can be effectively boycotted.",1324949907

3394466,comment,3394170,3394170,1,0,nr0mx,,,"The analysis of the players in the mobile market and their motivations is spot on, but the rest of the article rests on shaky grounds.<p>First off, Windows Phone is not superior to Android. It may be ahead in some respects, but it certainly lags Android in others. And that is the current situation. Till the last update Windows Phone clearly lagged Android in features. It may be comparable now, but it is yet too early to expect this to make a big difference. The real question is if achieving feature parity with Android is enough to let it succeed?<p>When Android arrived on the scene it didn't have to contend with another Android. Windows Phone does. The carriers and device manufacturers that may invest in Windows Phone are the same ones that are already invested in Android (except Nokia). I can't see that Windows Phone provides them with something that Android does not. Sure, they will hedge their bets and make Windows Phone devices, but the success or failure of Windows Phone devices does not (yet) have the same impact on their balance sheet as that of Android devices on which they currently depend. When they adopted Android the mobile ecosystem was very different and it was their lifeline against a seemingly unstoppable Apple-dominated world, and they had every motivation to make these devices a success.<p>A final point - fragmentation - I don't see how Windows Phone can avoid fragmentation. The more successful it gets, the more fragmented it will get. Thanks to Android, users expect to be able to get hold of the exact big/small/cheap/expensive/with-without-keyboard smartphone  variant they want.  Windows Phone can only avoid this  fragmentation at the expense of market share.<p>""will end-user dissatisfaction with Androids inconsistencies and fragmentation be strong enough to allow the better product to succeed.""<p>Most end users don't care about fragmentation. Developers do, and people who invest in their mobiles do, but a significant fraction of users - the ones who ""don't know what they hate"" - do not typically know or care about ICS, or know what additional features it provides, or if their phones will get upgraded to ICS.",1324949364

It could be that the addresses are gone, but at the very least the road network will be there from the TIGER import.<p>> I'm not a cartographer, I have no interest in being one. I certainly am not signing up to integrate OSM into what I'm building and be on the hook for user complaints about missing map data, and have to do that myself.<p>You don't have to be a cartographer to add data to OSM. You sign up, point and click or drag and drop. It takes minutes and you don't have to have any particular knowledge before hand (especially cartography). Having said that, I completely understand not wanting to be on the hook for user complaints. That's why Google charges thousands of dollars. Some people (the writer of the blog post in particular) aren't interested in paying that.<p>> Not to mention, contributing to OSM in the strictly legal way is not at all trivial - for legal reasons you simply cannot consult any other map, so basically you'd have to go out, walk/drive/bike around your area with paper and pen in hand and ""map"" it yourself. That or trust you have perfect memory w.r.t. your city. The bar for contributing back is high, can we blame people when they'd rather just have a map that worked?<p>This is not true. Mapping with paper and pencil on foot or bike or car is a great way to get outdoors and thousands of people use this technique to add to OSM every day, but you can also use any one of the dozens of aerial imagery backgrounds available to help you create data from memory.",1324947608
