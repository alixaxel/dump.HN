This resembles a lot like a local startup weekend (not saying there is such an option wherever you live).<p>2. MVP in 14 days in some cases is unrealistic without even knowing what it is you're looking to do. Some ideas can be done in a day. Some require several weeks or months to get a few features done for a basic MVP. It all depends on the idea.",1324961949

And I love sports -- I'll watch NBA and MLB games and my life will be quite alright. I'll even play sports videogames & read about sports & watch sports news on television & I will do it without watching ESPN or the NFL.<p>So I'll give you that the freaks won't switch but I don't think you'll give me that the casual fans will if they associate the NFL or ESPN with these bad things.<p>Out of curiosity, would you be able to give up ESPN or the NFL or even one of those things?

Our notion is that by bringing together young people with all sorts of different skills, we can hack together creative solutions to humanitarian problems in countries like war-torn Sri Lanka. We had our first event a few weeks ago, and through that we're starting to gather people in health care, engineering, law, business, etc... but I think there might be a HUGE opportunity for coders. Example projects would be: data visualizations of forced displacement of populations or hospital access, UIs for rural primary care telemedicine, Ushahidi-style real-time mapping of public health incidents via SMS, web-based communication between American physicians and over-worked doctors in war-affected regions, and more. Many ideas would probably take advantage of APIs provided by entities like Wikipedia or Google. Are there good suggestions on how to get in touch with developers/designers who might be interested in this sort of work? Would anyone in the HN community be interested? Thanks!",1324961069

Yes, your linked list will be implemented iteratively, recursively, in Java, in C, etc etc. Yes this leads to homegrown libraries because then you'll turn around and use this same code in your next homework, because it builds off the prior week's.  Or if you failed horribly the TA releases theirs but of course they've implemented it differently than you so there's a learning curve if you have to modify the code. Then after that, you can use the built-ins (unless it's been decided you have to implement your data structure with yet another nifty feature). It's teaching fundamentals.<p>With the homegrown libraries, the closest I ever saw to that was the LC3 assembler we had to code in.

Apple might not have actually done X better, but they did it first, and people like what they already know.  The comment about the unlock gesture is especially relevant; there is no need to stipe something across the screen to unlock a tablet.  If people copy that, though, the reviews will inevitably compare it to Apple's implementation, and will like Apple's better.  (Be it less lag, better color scheme, better font for ""Slide to unlock"", etc.)  If they do something completely different, like a hardware switch, then everyone will be happy because it's the first time they've ever seen anything like that and the idea will be allowed to stand on its own merits.<p>The Fire is flawed from the start because it uses out of date software.  If you are going to advertise something as Android, then people expect it to be good at Android.  Look at Archos' Android tablets; dead because they kept it on 1.6 forever.  (I will certainly never buy an Archos product again.)  The solution is to not advertise it as having Android, even if you use Android behind the scenes.  There are many Linux devices that don't claim to be Linux, and as a result, nobody ever cares that GHC 7.4 doesn't run on it; it's just a box that runs software that does stuff rather than being ""a Linux box"".  (Hell, the original Kindle is a good example of this.  Do you want an xterm on your Kindle?  Nope!  So you don't care that it doesn't have X11.)<p>Anyway, I guess I'm saying that the key to hardware design is expectation management.  Be different so that you aren't compared to Apple.
