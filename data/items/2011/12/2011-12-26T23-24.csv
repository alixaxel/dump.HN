How to retain the users<p>With no traffic sources, even if you convert all the incoming visitors, you will still have 0 subscriptions. It is not your case, you have the some visitors and a PR momentum so you should have enough visitors to tracks your performance on subproblems 2 and 3. Your product has a viral mechanism. That means that all your active users will expose their facebook friends (throught the vote) to your app. So you should be able to get some organic growth. (that means you shouldn't waste time on traffic acquisition)<p>Thus 3 success factors:
- convert your new visitors into active users<p>- push your users to promote their ""goals"" to their friends<p>- make it easy and appealling for the friends to become user<p>To be sure you are working on the most important task, use google analytics and track the bottle neck.

The issue is with trying to compile the latter on a compiler written for the former.<p>This will always be an issue when dealing with a language as entrenched as C: Most of your user-base will have oodles of code written under the previous standard. If you break backwards-compatibility on a level that's going to take them multiple man-months just to get working again, most aren't going to bother and will stay with the older standard instead. Your new standard stagnates and dies.<p>There IS a way to do this, but it's not nearly as simple as you seem to believe. Take a look at what's happening with Python 2 & 3.

The entire domain registration system is very loosely coupled as it relates to transfers - too loose imo, and breakage is really easy.

From a casual view, it looked like the other end had cut us off, and a quick deep dive made the parsing issue immediately apparent.<p>Domain transfers was an afterthought to the multi-registrar model and was designed and implemented as policy (i.e. ICANN), not as a technical process (i.e. IETF).
