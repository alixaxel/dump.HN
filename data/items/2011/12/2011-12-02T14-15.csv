The goal was to shift users away from the Google search box towards a service geared towards shopping.  I'm sure you can see value in that.<p>Hot company du jour is Pinterest... probably headed towards 3B pvs/month and recently closed a round of funding at $200-250M.  Keep an eye on them if you think it's all still a commodity.  It just depends on what lens you look through.  Part of the challenge is putting aside one's cynicism and trying to positive about what your company _can_ be or _could_ be if people take it seriously.",1322837979

3304150,comment,3303958,3303958,2,0,someone13,,,"Since the page seems to be down/loading slowly for me, here's the changelog:<p><pre><code>    General\n    \n    - i386-softmmu is no longer named qemu but instead referred to as qemu-system-i386 for better consistency with other targets. A new tool is likely to be introduced that uses the qemu name so distributions are advised to not undo this change.\n    - QEMU now uses a separate thread for VCPU execution. This merges the biggest difference between the qemu-kvm tree and upstream QEMU.\n    - A new memory dispatch API has been added internally. A new monitor command ""info mtree"" can show the hierarchy of memory regions in the guest.\n    - QEMU now has a build dependency on glib and makes extensive use of glib.\n    - QEMU now can run on more hosts. Hosts without a native code generator can use the TCG interpreter (TCI). See Features/TCI for more information.\n    \n    Block devices (disks)\n    \n    - QEMU now supports I/O latency accounting in the monitor command ""info blockstats"".\n    - Errors are now tracked per device and are shown by the monitor command ""info block"".\n    - All image formats now support asynchronous operation. IDE and SCSI emulation will use this feature, while other devices (notably floppy and SD) will not.\n    \n    IDE/ATAPI\n    \n    - A large number of bugs were fixed regarding CD media change and tray locking.\n    \n    SCSI\n    \n    - Memory management errors could crash QEMU when scsi-disk encountered I/O errors. Many instances of this problem were fixed.\n    - The accuracy of error handling for SCSI emulation has been greatly improved.\n    - SCSI devices can now be addressed by channel, target (id) and LUN. Not all emulated HBAs will support this feature (in particular, the LSI controller will not).\n    - Block device pass through is now supported through a new scsi-block device. The scsi-block device works with block devices (like /dev/sda or /dev/sr0) rather than /dev/sgN devices, and is more efficient because it does not consume arbitrary amounts of memory when the guest does large data transfers.\n    - SCSI CD-ROMs now report media changed events.\n    - SCSI CD-ROMs now support DVD images.\n    - Bugfixes for IDE media change also apply to SCSI.\n    - SCSI devices now report a unit attention condition when the system is started or reset. This may cause problems with old firmware versions.\n    \n    VDI\n    \n    - Now supports discarded blocks in dynamically-sized images.\n    \n    User-mode networking (SLIRP)\n    \n    - SLIRP can process ARP replies and gratuitous ARP requests from the guest.\n    \n    ARM\n    \n    - QEMU now supports the new Cortex-A15 instructions in linux-user mode (via ""-cpu any""): VFPv4 fused multiply-accumulate (VFMA, VFMS, VFNMA, VFNMS) and also integer division (UDIV, SDIV).\n    - The vexpress-a9, versatileab, versatilepb and realview-* boards now have audio support.\n    - QEMU is known not to work on ARM hosts in this release. (ARM target emulation is fine.)\n    \n    pSeries\n    \n    - sPAPR VIO devices can now be created with -device.\n    \n    Xtensa\n    \n    - QEMU now supports DC232b and FSF xtensa CPU cores.\n    - QEMU now supports sim (similar to Tensilica ISS) and LX60/LX110/LX200 machines.\n    \n    Migration\n    \n    - QEMU now supports live migration using image files like QCOW2 on shared storage</code></pre>",1322837871

3304144,story,,,2,1,krelian,"Ask HN: Is affiliate marketing mainly about SEO",,"I worked at a company that did affiliate marketing about a year ago. I quit because I was burned out but I was also in disagreement about the focus the company had which was more about SEO than building an innovative product. I did a lot of research at the time and it seemed that for most websites (that was in the insurance industry so there is a ton of competition) the most important goal was appearing on Google first, the actual content of the website is of secondary importance. The reality was that for the end user clicking on result number 5 and result number 50 didn't  matter much because the main difference between them was their SEO budget or strategy.<p>I have contemplated coming back into this field now with an attitude of ""if I build something good, they will come"" but I am faced with the doubt that I might have gotten it all wrong.<p>So my question is, in your experience is it possible to build a profitable affiliate marketing business without the pressure that you'll have to dump money on SEO or be left behind?",1322837804

Yes, it prevents programmers from having to write code like:<p><pre><code>  with obj.lock:\n      obj.counter += 1\n</code></pre>\nBut it means that code that should by all means be lock free is now always blocking all threads. In other words, it helps really novice programmers write really simple single-user single use prototype-level code, but prevents concurrency in real-world production environments.<p>Locks should be exposed in most languages (except environments like JavaScript which are inherently single-threaded).

But your site itself is brilliant!  You are really on to something with vocabulink.com.  I've formally studied 10 human languages, of which I can speak/write/read 3 fluently, and have passive understanding of another 2-3.  People often ask me how I learn languages, and a good part of my answer is very similar to what you are doing with vocabulink.  As you've discovered, the key is to use vivid, even silly, mnemonic devices.  Building up a large vocabulary is key to learning a language.  Don't waste your money on flashy tools like Rosetta Stone -- they don't work for most people above the age of 8 or 10.  Adults learn differently than children.<p>So if someone out there is looking to learn a foreign language, my recommendation is to combine vocabulink's approach to build up a large vocabulary, and find the best concise grammar available for your target language.  If you don't remember grammar fundamentals (e.g., what's a prepositional phrase, direct object, relative pronoun, etc.), then you need to find a good book in your native language to review those concepts.<p>In any case, cool concept for a web site.  Sorry for the off-topic post.  Thanks for telling us about your experiences with Haskell.

All spend money on cinema, entertainment events, video games and legit DVD's and box sets of things they really like.<p>In all cases the decision to go pirate is convenience + cost. A DVD at £14 is seen as too expensive. Similarly 79p for a single audio track file which you only need to play on your iPod seems a little pricy. Since Spotify came about everyone I know has cut back on music downloaded. Apart from iPod tracks there is no reason to get the actual file.<p>If pirated content disappeared overnight I personally would mostly live without. If I did buy a DVD for a silly price, that would mean I wouldn't be visiting the cinema that week. I think the majority of my friends would do the same.<p>The trouble with law makers is the influence the music and film industry have on them. The facts are there to be seen. Someone who goes out of their way to get a pirate copy of something will typically spend more on entertainment than those who don't.<p>The music industry likes to believe that every track downloaded is 79p they could have had. That isn't the case at all. If you took away all pirated material you would restrict discovery of new entertainment. Film / Music people may get slightly more money from certain people but the majority of this money would come at the expensive of other things.<p>I am not saying piracy is good but it certainly isn't the devil which many law and policy makers make out it is and its nice to see this acknowledged by an EU state.",1322836800

Ultimately, I took a different route. Note that this plan works best for young, single folks. This is also not a ""get rich quick"" scheme. Positioning myself took about three years on its own, much less getting going on a start-up. Keep in mind that this was my plan. It is not the only (or best) plan, but it worked for me.<p>* Position yourself for minimum cash outflow. Minimizing your cash needs means you can take bigger risks. I found a decent 500 sq ft apartment and drove a cheap car. Without a family, all my other expenses were dirt cheap.<p>* Save up a three month buffer and strike out on your own gig, but not your start-up yet. I chose consulting because the income potential is so high and it provided a great networking opportunity. I doubled my annual income (from my old salary) within a year, but far more importantly, I was able to accomplish a few transitional steps in getting my start-up going:<p>- I built a relationship with a great developer by feeding him work from consulting clients.<p>- I built relationships with other business owners and took a lot of time to understand their business.<p>- Ultimately, I met the person who would connect me with the greatest team I've ever worked with.<p>By the time I found the right team and opportunity, I had a year's worth of expenses saved up, and a small amount of money to contribute to the operational expenses of the company. Coming to the table with cash in-hand gained me a lot of respect from other team members. Because everyone came to the table with their own income streams, we were able to bootstrap and now, 100% of our equity is founder owned. That's a pretty exciting reality for us.",1322836250

Big tech companies are famous for doing this.<p>One of my favorite uses of NIH is to replace something like, oh I don't know -- SQL -- with another query language ""to make it easier to write queries"". Right. Because SQL is so baffling, that we need to replace it with another syntax. And what will that syntax do? Convert a statement to SQL.<p>I use NIH as a filter in interviewing.

Instead of this:<p><pre><code>   p(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)\n</code></pre>\nmove that P(B) to the other side:<p><pre><code>   p(A|B) p(B) = p(B|A) p(A)\n</code></pre>\nNow notice that p(A|B) p(B) is simply the probability that both A and B occur. That is, it is p(A∩B). The same goes for the right side.<p>Basically, to compute p(A∩B), you can say ""I've got to have A"", which gives a p(A) factor, and ""given that A, I then need to also have B"", which gives a p(B|A) factor, so p(A∩B) = p(A) p(B|A). Or you can start with B, and then say you need A given B, and that gives you p(A∩B) = p(B) p(A|B).<p>So all Bayes really is essentially is a statement that there are two ways to compute p(A∩B) and they have to give the same result.<p>PS: if you are thinking ""wait a second...I thought p(A∩B) = p(A) p(B)"", that's for independent events. If A and B are independent, P(A|B) = p(A) and p(B|A) = p(B), and the general formula then reduces to p(A∩B) = p(A) p(B).",1322835474

If you want to argue from a comparison with Canada, you're going to have to flesh out your argument much more than ""Canada is more regulated, and didn't have the same effect we did"", since there's a world of other differences in the situation.<p>The economics experts have studied the situation, and found that the repeal of G-S couldn't have been the cause. Consider [1]<p>[QUOTE]<p>Given a history like this people wonder how repealing the law could have been a good thing.  But a significant academic literature has investigated these claims and rejected them.  Eugene White, for example, found that national banks with security affiliates were much less likely to fail than banks without affiliates.  Randall Kroszner (now at the Fed.) and Raghuram Rajan found that (jstor) securities issued by unified banks were (ex-post) of higher quality that those issued by investment banks.  A powerful book by George Benston went through the entire Pecora hearings which supposedly revealed the problems with unified banking and found them to be a complete sham.  My colleague, Carlos Ramirez later showed that the separation of commercial and investment banking increased the cost of external finance (jstor).  Finally, my own work (pdf) unearthed the real reasons for the separation in a titanic battle between the Morgans and Rockefellers.<p>Thus, the history of banking before Glass-Steagall and now our recent experience after is consistent, generally speaking unified banking is safer and repeal was a good idea.<p>[/QUOTE]<p>And it's not just a question of academic theory. The actual empirical evidence bears this out. Let me expand my original quotation from the article [2]:<p>[QUOTE]<p>Just look at which organizations have failed:<p>* Bear Stearns was an investment bank before it was sold to JP Morgan Chase (which includes a commercial bank).<p>* Fannie Mae were Freddie Mac were government sponsored entities before the government bought them.<p>* Lehman Brothers was an investment bank before it want bankrupt.<p>* Merrill Lynch was an investment bank befor it was sold to Bank of America (which is a commercial bank).<p>* AIG is an insurance company with no commercial banking division.<p>...<p>If Glass-Steagall's repeal had meaningfully contributed to this crisis, we should see the failures concentrated among megabanks where speculation put deposits at risk.  Instead we see the exact opposite:  the failures are among either commercial banks with no significant investment arm (Washington Mutual, Countrywide), or standalone investment banks.  It is the diversified financial institutions that are riding to the rescue.<p>[/QUOTE]<p>[1] <a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/09/glass-steagall.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/09/gla...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.heritage.org/2008/09/22/the-glass-steagall-myth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.heritage.org/2008/09/22/the-glass-steagall-myth/</a>",1322835192

At the very least there should be the ability to root your phone after contract, or whenever you want if you buy the phone full price. Sadly, that doesn't happen often. But when I bought my Nexus One outright, it was very simple to root it.",1322834480
