3390041,comment,3383624,3389881,2,0,earbitscom,,,"- Transparency about the level to which companies infringe.<p>- Accountability for mass infringement and repeat violations.<p>- Rigid enforcement against companies who exist almost exclusively to provide access to illegal material.<p>There are two companies that need to be addressed:<p>You have companies whose businesses are primarily built on copyright infringing content that their users upload under DMCA.  Often small companies pop up who use this method until they're big enough to be noticed, and then they go back and negotiate retro-active deals.  This creates an unfair advantage for them over companies who choose to operate completely within the law.  These companies' only responsibility is to take the material down when they get caught, with no steeper penalty for repeat offenses or for building a business around this turnaround time.  Grooveshark is an example of an American company that falls into this category.<p>If you could see the number of takedown requests and repeat violations companies receive (I propose they be issued and resolved through a centralized database), it would be clear which companies exist almost exclusively to provide access to copyrighted material, or who do not place high enough priority on preventing copyright infringement.  I believe they need to be held accountable without placing the burden of pursuing civil penalties on the backs of individual or small company rights holders for whom a lawsuit is not equitable.  There should be severe penalties for companies whose infractions far outweigh the legitimate value they provide.  Those penalties should not require a class action lawsuit or the war chest of some large company.<p>Then there are companies who are just outright havens for illegal material, whether hosting it themselves or making user-shared content easy to find and access.  Most of these companies are offshore, or they are only providing links and information without providing the content itself, both of which makes it hard to pursue civil penalty.  I think there should be a clearly defined and transparent method for measuring the degree to which sites provide little value beyond access to illegal material, and those sites should be held accountable.  There has to be actionable recourse and, unfortunately, you can only pursue civil penalties from companies who are domestic (or in a participating country) or who actually profit from their actions.  In the case of sites who are not domestic or who do not generate meaningful financial gain for their illegal behavior, your only real option is to shut them down in one way or another.  If the criteria for a site being eligible for this type of action is clear, and the infraction history is transparent, I have a hard time justifying not taking action against them.  That being said, I do understand that we live in a world where rules are abused and I don't understand everything I need to about how such rules would be enforced.  But I don't think the the fact that it's difficult and not foolproof are good enough reasons not to pursue a better system.<p>The DMCA has put the burden of policing copyright on the shoulders of rights holders and that's fine, but penalizing companies who commit massive infringement should not be the job of a bunch of small artists and independent companies.  Then there are companies for whom the option of legal recourse is not an option, and those people should be handled in the strictest way possible without putting too much power in the hands of arbitrary organizations.",1324771053

However, his claims could be checked by someone in a Japanese manufacturing company.<p>In the meantime, I don't see why it is surprising that Japan is doing well.

If no one objects, then they proceed as if everyone voted for it. What Ron Wyden did was object to bringing the bill to the floor. Thus, it will require him to give consent or a vote of 60 Senators to bring the bill to the floor (which they wouldn't try to do unless they were sure it would work).<p>Most of the time, there are only a few people actually in the senate chamber. The person standing in for Reid, one Republican Senator, the person giving some sort of speech/statement into the record and for cspan, and whoever is next to do the same. Within each party, any Senator can (publicly or secretly) ask their representative in the chamber to object on their behalf. Ron Wyden did so publicly, in the past people have gotten riled up about ""secret holds"" where the leadership of the objecting side doesn't expose who objected. If Harry Reid really wanted to push for the bill, he could call a vote, which would put everyone on the record voting in favor or opposition on bringing it to the floor, but Senators hate being officially on one side or the other of a bill, so they usually wait until they can convince whoever has a hold to drop it (usually through giving them some sort of favor, etc).",1324770591

It is not my Java programming experience that the Java <i>language</i> limits the too-clever-by-half idiocy.<p>If you want to say that the kinds of companies that hire Java developers dont hire clever idiots, thats a different discussion. But Ive seen so many convoluted architectures built out of Java that it feels to me like too-clever-by-half is a constant across all languages, and the very best thing for me is discouraging cleverness, with second best being let people do their clever things in a language that helps them, rather than making them write even more inscrutable clever code just to get away with being clever in Java.<p>This is my point above, and perhaps it doesnt match your experience, namely that some clever things will be done, and Java will not prevent them from being done, but merely prevent them from being done simply and cleanly. So why not have this other pro do what she is going to do, but do it simply and cleanly thanks to a powerful language, rather than resorting to XML and other shenanigans?<p>But honestly, I fear we are now having a weird discussion where our working assumption is inheriting code from people we dont respect.

(Just don't put a whole lot of effort writing a heartfelt argument informed with evidence and rigor--its value comes more from indicating to the politician the breadth and energy of opposition to SOPA.)<p>But focusing on GoDaddy isn't a distraction, either. One of the central rules of political organizing is this: you pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. Victory isn't going to come in one fell swoop: if it comes at all, it will be through a loosely connected series of small victories, looking plausible only in retrospect.<p>GoDaddy is an easy enemy: it has an anti-charismatic founder who has a long history of general shittiness. A victory there doesn't only screw over GoDaddy, which is in the grand scheme of things not even a secondary target--its only actual goal is to make a quick buck from the feds. But what a victory does do is this: for one, it sends an obvious message to Congress and to other companies that the Internet matters: it's providing objective information that, yes, the anti-SOPA forces have some power, and other players might re-evaluate their current strategy to accomodate that new information.<p>But beyond that, and more important than that, is that it builds the movement. A victory sends a signal to people who are anti-SOPA but disenchanted that there is at least the hope of victory, bringing them back into the fold. It generates a bunch of news articles providing valuable anti-SOPA publicity, which is especially valuable since broader public knowledge of SOPA is one of the things we need most now. And it develops commitment and better engagement for the movement via showing how each of us as individuals can contribute to change.<p>It's not an either-or choice: you can both send letters and move your domains from GoDaddy.<p>By the way, if you're reading this and you haven't sent a letter... close out this window immediately, write a letter, and send it.",1324768444

3389960,comment,3388893,3389709,4,0,raganwald,,,"<i>the 10,000 lines of code in Java's Dependency Injection Framework is a red flag to me.</i><p>We agree.<p><i>The chances that someone who writes the same thing in lisp has drastically simplified the implementation are not so high.</i><p>We disagree.<p>First, when I roll my own, I scratch only my own itch. I dont need to build something that works for everyone, everywhere. Its like Microsoft Word: MSFT boasts that most users only need 5% of what it does, but every niche of users uses a different 5% of the whole thing.<p>But can I roll my own? Well, I suggest that the answer is more likely to be yes in Lisp than in Java. First, folklore suggests that defects are constant per line of code. Therefore, if I need fewer lines of Lisp than of Java, I should have fewer defects to contend with. I assume three things. First, I need much less than the full frameworks functionality. Second, Lisp is more expressive than Java, so I need fewer lines of Lisp for any functionality than of Java. Third, I suggest that languages with meta-programming support are particularly well suited for tasks like dependency injection, reducing the amount of code I need to write even further.<p>Now, the big DI framework is written by someone else. So is it free? No. I need time to learn it, time to use it, I can make mistakes using it, I can get an XML configuration wrong, I can implement an interface when I am supposed to extend an abstract class, I am not immune from defects just because I am using a library.<p>So the net question for me is whether the chances of successfully rolling my own feature in Lisp for my projects specific needs are greater than the chances of successfully using an existing framework in the Java world=, and parallel to that, the question is whether someone else working with my code will find it easier to decipher the XML configuration and interfaces and classes I have written to work with a Java DI framework or will find it easier to work with the smaller, simpler and more compact Lisp code written for this specific project.<p>Reasonable people can go either way on this, I find it hard to believe that Java is obviously a win, especially if theyve used one of these big frameworks with the many gotchas (as I have).<p>p.s. Of course, the wild card is that there are plenty of libraries in Lisp as well.
