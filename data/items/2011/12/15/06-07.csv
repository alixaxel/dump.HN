I never stated that they're doomed to feel depressed, just that they're doomed to feel depressed if they don't do something other than sit and think. Depression tends to lead to a lot of rumination anyways, so it probably will seem pretty ridiculous to them to be told to be more introspective.<p>To clarify, I put those (schizophrenia, homosexuality, transgender)  as examples of brain structure and wiring (just like clinical depression) and mentioned homosexuality explicitly because it seems less stigmatized than mental illness currently. A gay person can accept being gay and live a happy life, but they can't think themselves into being straight if they try hard enough. An individual diagnosed with major depressive disorder can accept they are clinically depressed and require treatment, then take the treatment and live a happy life, but they can't think themselves into not requiring outside aid to be in a non-depressed state.

To be a top exec at a music company does not necessarily depend on skill or acumen.<p>Music execs can fail horribly at one company and then effortlessly transition into another great exec job at a competing music company. It's a small world. The music industry has this idea that its very complex and difficult and needs years of experience - but its really not.<p>If your founder happened to know the right exec in an e-commerce department and was able to show a demo/trial you could have been in with a chance. Anything related to billing software always has a good chance because its easy to make a case how it is generating revenue from day one. That's a difficult thing to do.",1323929884

In short: equal parts engineering and business skills.<p>eBooks are the engineering afterthought that careful business planning brought to fruition. Amazon never set out as a business to upset the book industry, just like Apple/Google never set out as a business to upset the mobile handset industry.<p>I see many plays Amazon has made as a sort of hydra start-up company. Take a piece of technology: how can we turn this into a business nobody has tapped into? How can we use pre-existing models that work well to push our form further?<p>I remember years ago when Amazon was bringing its clusters into the grid-computing-for-pay arena, now known as ""cloud computing services"". I thought it was kind of a joke; they had too many servers and needed a way to pay for it all. Turns out they found repeat customers.<p>I remember when people started telling me they bought all their books on Amazon, and tons more of them since they were so cheap. I thought, oh great, a book wholesaler; probably not the same thing as getting the newest books quickly and at a competitive price. Turns out when you own the entire process of putting words to eyes it becomes a pretty good repeat business.<p>I don't think the execs of Amazon live in a bubble. I think they share information and work toward solutions like engineers do. That isn't to say they aren't vulnerable of classic business blunders, but if their corporate culture remains one of vision AND simple problem-solving they might just accomplish some more monumental feats - all the while staying in the black.",1323929391
