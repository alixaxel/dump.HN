Like, uh, I don't know, news.ycombinator.com for instance ;)).<p>On top of the OpenID URL, a lot of sites also want a way of contacting the user via email. So that's another bit of info that you're going to have to enter when you sign up for the first time. What's interesting is that your email address almost certainly identifies you already anyway.<p>So why not just use email addresses instead of the URL, and API calls instead of those hideous redirects to establish identity?

Most companies realise the disruption caused to a project when key staff leave and paying an extra 10K, 20K or even 60K passes a simple cost-benefit analysis - but only during that project.<p>Personal experience: I was one of about 5-6 people who actually knew what they were doing on a 50 person, 3 year project at a large company when I got a much better offer from a much better company. I called the HR manager in good faith to see if they would match it, but he didn't want a word of it (nearly hung up on me, in fact). That was until he was told by my boss that I'm needed on a critical project. Not only did he call me back and talk to me, the CTO of the company (who never spoke to me before) spent an entire hour with me, ignoring his constantly beeping phone, convincing me to stay. As flattering as that was, I knew by then that they only did this because of the critical project and took that into account in making my decision.<p>I still decided to quit.

There's a circularity to your use of ""deleterious mutations"" and ""bad mutation.""<p>Is the mutation which causes sickle-cell anaemia a ""good mutation"" or a ""bad mutation""? It increases reproductive fitness in places where malaria is or was common, so it must be good, in an evolutionary sense.<p>How many deaths has it caused once the population of people carrying the haemoglobin gene mutation migrated to a location without malaria? Is that mutation now ""good"" or ""bad""? How do you incorporate those numbers into your statistics?<p>Is the loss of eyesight a deleterious mutation? Definitely for a bird of prey, but not so for cave-dwelling creatures living in absolute darkness. For that matter, some people are attracted to people who wear glasses (and wearing zero-prescription glasses is such a turn-off!), so it might increase reproductive fitness.<p>Evolution doesn't know the future. If a population loses genetic resistance to a disease that's seemingly extinct, is that a ""good"" or ""bad"" mutation? How long does it take to judge that? After 1,000 years, should some thawed carcass reintroduce it and the species become extinct, does that count finally as a bad mutation and a single death?<p>For a real world example, consider the birds of New Zealand. They filled ecological niches which elsewhere were filled by mammals. Were these good mutations or bad ones? And when rats and weasels and cats and more were introduced to New Zealand, helping make many of those species extinct, then did those mutations retrospectively become deleterious?<p>If a genetic madness affects the leader of the US Strategic Air Command to issue orders which end up nuking a dozen Soviet cities, then what are the other cases which make that average out to one? If the nuking didn't occur, then what would the average have been?<p>What of a mutation which causes a speciation event? Is that a good mutation or a bad one? It's better for one environment and worse for the other.<p>There's a 10^-9 chance (1-in-a-million) that a ""bad"" mutation will mutate again back to the ""good"" form. With nearly 7 billion people in the world, that almost certainly happens a few thousand times every generation. In a generation we may be able to cure some genetic diseases through genetic engineering, so a ""bad"" mutation can be fixed.<p>With all those in mind, I can't figure out a way to get the numbers to come out ""1"" unless the definition of deleterious is defined to make it come out that way.",1324088428

<i>MY REPLY:</i><p><pre><code>  Hey Ben,

  Thanks for getting in touch.

  I uninstalled it. All I really needed was my attachments to appear on the right of the email *and* be     
  downloadable from the right panel. My only option was to transfer to dropbox (I use cloud app) or open the   
  attachments.me window and browse for the relevant attachment. 

  If you guys enable the attachments on the right to be downloadable directly I'll re-install straight away. 
  CloudApp support would also be great.

  Cheers,
  Andrew
</code></pre>
<i>FROM BEN:</i><p><pre><code>  Hey, thanks for the quick response :)

  I'm curious, what do you see as the advantage to being able to download the attachment on the right-hand side, as   
  oppose to being able to download it in the area provided below the email. Is it that we could consolidate all the 
  attachments in the thread into one area?

  Would love to get you back on board,

  -- Ben.

<i>MY REPLY:</i><p>Hey Ben,<p><pre><code>  When receiving emails from some people, GMail doesn't recognize the thread. It incorrectly assumes the reply's 
  are part of the email. So some emails get ridiculously long, and I have to scroll forever downwards to get to the   
  download link. When I first installed attachments.me, I was stoked, as I could see all the attachments relevant 
  to the thread on the right...but they were static names, not links :(

  Would it be hard to turn those static titles into attachment links?

  Regards,
  Andrew
</code></pre>
<i>FROM BEN:</i><p><pre><code>  That makes sense. I think you're right, it would be smart for the name of the attachment to allow you to 
  download it.

  I've added this feature to the extension, if you install the newest version here:

  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdgofjdapkmlgpgjfielacjckplcdjjk

  it should do the trick.

  Keep the feedback coming,
