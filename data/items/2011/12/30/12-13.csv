3407455,comment,3407245,3407245,0,0,leoedin,,,"The only problem with this article is that it makes the assumption that app downloads are correlated with resource loading speed, which really could be completely incorrect.<p>The hacker news traffic was very targeted, watching a specific video for the content. Assuming the HN traffic was during period which saw 6-8% conversion, the real cause of the low conversion rate is almost certainly due to people clicking through from HN, watching the video and leaving without looking at the site at all. I don't even own an iPad, and frankly when someone links a video on HN or similar social sites, I watch the video and leave, regardless of the video sharing site.<p>I'd assume their more day-to-day traffic is getting there via other sources. Perhaps people saying ""check out this app"", perhaps people coming through search engines looking for ipad related video - essentially a much more targeted audience.<p>I could be completely wrong. Based on the information presented, I've made a huge number of assumptions. However, I'd be truly surprised if decreasing the load time of your static assets is really the driving factor in visitor conversions.<p>Edit: It seems their ""App store downloads to web visit ratio"" isn't really a conversion factor as much as a comparison of the two. My interpretation of it is that they now receive 28% of their web visits in downloads (for every hundred web visitors, they receive 28 app ""downloads"" (although it's not clear whether a ""download"" is a video load, or an app install)). Surely that's just because their web traffic has fallen after the HN spike? I'm not convinced that there's any real basis to the key claim made at the bottom.",1325249625

3407446,comment,3405585,3406843,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> False. It's the opposite actually. A site continues to have existing safe harbor protection UNLESS it does this. Even Congress knows you can't put this type of burden on sites.<p>So any site can continue to operate as long as they pointedly don't police user content?  Considering that would make the legislation entirely ineffective, I suspect it'll get conveniently ignored.  It would also then <i>remove</i> the ability of sites to enforce their own terms of service on user content, for fear of losing protection.  (Consider that YouTube already lets copyright holders police user content, primarily because they got sued and more or less forced to.  That would then make them lose their safe harbor.)  And in any case, that would still force non-US sites to adhere to US regulations or get blocked, which remains a serious problem given the set of regulations the US would like to enforce on sites.<p>> False. Individuals and corporations cannot DNS blacklist, or block from Google results. That's only allowed based on a request from the Attorney General, requires approval of a Judge, and only applies to foreign companies that explicitly and solely exist for the purpose of copyright infringement.<p>Oh, and that makes it OK then?  That process seems likely to become a rubber stamp, especially for requests made by the companies that bought and paid for this legislation in the first place.<p>And considering that the congresscritters that approve the legislation often don't bother reading it before doing so, and rely on summaries instead, I'd hardly fault Tom's Hardware for relying on the general summaries provided by other technical sources concerned about this legislation.  SOPA has also undergone numerous changes and amendments since its introduction, none of which make it acceptable, but many of which make the details somewhat less concrete.  The article got the major points right, and the details close to right.",1325249253

DCA (dichloroacetic acid) has emerged as a compound that accelerates the destruction of tumors without the deleterious and debilitating side effects associated with chemotherapy or radiation. This is the first patent granted for the use of DCA to treat cancer, and represents a significant milestone in the Company's growth.<p>Since filing the application, other companies and research entities, both in the US and internationally, have also done much work to validate and unlock the value inherent in utilizing DCA as a therapeutic agent. Over the last four years, extensive validating research has been performed that documents DCA as a potentially powerful cancer treatment. Dr. Newell Rogers is one of the scientific pioneers suggesting that agents, including DCA, that disrupt tumor specific metabolic pathways, will have value as novel cancer drugs and, as such, she is the first researcher to have a patent granted on its use in the battle against cancer.<p>Viral Genetics has been strategically accumulating a significant and valuable portfolio of intellectual property rights around Dr. Newell's core metabolic disruption science.

For example, Apple could have every RAM module run for months at above-spec frequency, temperature and humidity to weed out bad modules. I do not think they do such severe things, but I do think (without having any evidence, except for the 'evidence' of their pricing) that they buy slightly/somewhat better batches. That does not guarantee that their products are better, but it will weed out the almost-dead-on-arrival ones.",1325246691
