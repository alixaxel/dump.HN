One can be relatively lax in distributing new sovereign keys, because there is no way to attack an existing one by granting another. One still has to be a little careful in granting them because a site without a sovereign key might be attacked by creating one in its name controlled by a malicious third party, but it's not as dangerous as the current system where granting an overly broad certificate to Joe Schmo can compromise google.com's SSL.",1324264021
