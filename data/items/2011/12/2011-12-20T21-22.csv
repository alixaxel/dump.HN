3375370,comment,3373672,3373672,2,0,tikhonj,,,"I haven't had time to read through the whole article (and I already know how type classes work :)) so I just have one little point to add.<p>As correctly put in the article, type classes can provide default implementations. However, one cute thing that was missed is that type classes can provide default implementations for <i>every</i> function, referencing each other:<p><pre><code>    class  Eq a  where\n    (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool\n    x /= y     =  not (x == y)\n    x == y     =  not (x /= y)\n</code></pre>\nThis way you can implement == <i>or</i> /=, and you get the other for free.<p>For me, the one new idea that made me understand why type classes are awesome was the read function: it's polymorphic on its <i>return type</i>. This means that you always give it a String and it returns whatever you need. This also means that you can have polymorphic constants--maxBound is the maximum of <i>any</i> bounded numeric type, so you can use it as an Int or a Float and it will always have the right value.<p>Overall, I now think that type classes are awesome. However, I also don't think a parallel to OOP is particularly helpful--I also learned OOP well before functional programming and found it easier to understand type classes by looking at how they were used than by comparing them to interfaces or templates.",1324418328

3375367,comment,3373702,3373702,1,0,kapilkale,,,"I don't think startups want a desingineer, but rather an expert at one skill (product UI/UX, engineering, marketing) with a pretty decent understanding of a secondary skill area.<p>For example, I do a fair amount of design work in photoshop etc. I can implement simple front-end stuff. But my co-founder can get complex front-end engineering stuff done 5-10x faster if I just help him pair program it. If I didn't understand code, we'd be unable to do that.

3375363,comment,3374282,3375287,3,0,dlikhten,,,"I have to say, as much as bitcoin is in a downfall, this actually makes a ton of sense. That was the initial goal of bitcoin, to create a de-centralized currency. As long as the BTC is a STABLE currency this works out well. Or short-term stable. It can become a medium of financial transfer: I buy 10 BTC, donate it, they claim 10 BTC, convert to cash. Done.<p>It would be great if there was a tool to literally facilitate this transaction without directly giving from one company to another, thus bypassing SOPA. I give the ""holder"" $10, the ""holder"" gives me 10 BTC. Then I give 10 BTC to say PirateBay. Then the ""holder"" guarantees that piratebay can sell 10 BTC to them for $10. Thats it. They only converted BTC to/from cash. I directly gave BTC to pirate bay. SOPA is ignored.<p>HOWEVER THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE INTERNET IS AGAINST. This will prevent all sort of anti-fraud that is going on now. You will wind up bypassing years of innovation to create a black market. It will be detremental.",1324418241

More?) copper disk attached to a crank suspended in the gap of a big-ass electromagnet. The idea was you spun the crank, and then operated a foot pedal that applied current to the electromagnet, which braked the wheel with eddy currents.<p>The disk had slotted sectors, so you could tell that the braking effect was less when those sectors were in the gap.<p>I don't know if the exhibit survived the themparkification of fi.edu...

I can get some really pretty results from doing my own designs, but it's a wonderful freedom to know that I'll spend 15 minutes in the morning iterating on a piece of paper with a designer today, and then just go away and do my thing. I'll get a PSD that will make the prototype UI more concrete late-afternoon, and the next morning we can talk about how using the UI makes us want to change it.<p>But if I was doing it all myself? I doubt that even with twice the time, the overall result would be equal, either on the code or the design side.<p>That designer keeps all of his visual design acumen and photoshop 'muscle memory' loaded into cache.<p>I keep my emacs key-chords, the code's secret sauce, my bash and git aliases and the topography of staging environments loaded into my cache.<p>There are definitely projects that exist where you can 'do it all', but ... node.js' model is great for maximizing throughput, but when you've got drastically different types of work, that's what you have multiple cores for. ;)",1324415982

And its existence <i>did</i> enable computer science research, because with C, operating systems were finally portable. C itself was a worthwhile contribution to computer science research. Kernighan and Ritchie built upon prior languages, but they were able to distil what levels and kinds of abstraction were needed to implement portable systems programs. Many of the concepts in C existed in C's predecessors, but not in the same form we know them as. It's easy to under-estimate how novel that contribution is because so many of us <i>think</i> in C now.<p>For a history of C from the source, Dennis Ritchie, read this: <a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html</a>",1324415095

3375137,comment,3374953,3375031,4,0,SpikeGronim,,,"""stack size is an implementation detail""<p>Thread stack size is an important performance tuning knob. If your app has 100,000 threads you really do care about running out of memory. If you have 10 threads you don't care. You should of course separate the choice of stack size from your application code. Your library still needs to support this.<p>""providing absolute timestamps rather than intervals is important because it prevents drift""<p>I don't know what you mean by ""drift"". When I put a timeout on a threaded operation (joining, acquiring a mutex, etc.) I am guarding against blocking forever 99% of the time. It is much cleaner to say ""this should take no more than 5s"" vs. ""this should end at XYZ time UTC"". Forcing the application to track elapsed time in the face of NTP etc. sucks. Letting the library handle those edge cases is good. It can use a CPU tick counter or similar.<p>""Fears regarding ntpd causing sudden jumps aren't well-founded (ntpd adjusts time very slowly, in sub-second intervals)""<p>What if I am sleeping in sub-second intervals? This goes to the general thrust of PHK's article. He is endorsing K&R C and pthreads because they give you minimal tools that can express a very wide range of programs. Building assumptions about how long people want to sleep for into an extremely widely deployed standard is a mistake.",1324414813
