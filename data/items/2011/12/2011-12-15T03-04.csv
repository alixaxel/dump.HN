3354966,comment,3352079,3353050,2,0,philwelch,,,"> just stay silent until you have something ""serious"" to say<p>That's my MO on any new forum. I only stopped following that rule on HN as HN itself got increasingly sillier.<p>And really, your VC example, in reverse, is in full display on HN. There are always articles complaining about unfair shit that VC's pull, and VC's probably talk about unfair shit founders pull. The proper response, assuming you're a VC that doesn't pull unfair shit, is to say ""yeah, I hate that shit and I never do that."" Look at how Peroni (a recruiter) contributes to the perennial complaining-about-recruiters threads.<p>The OP is about using indirect, passive-aggressive communication techniques to close sales. I think it's fair game to complain about indirect, passive-aggressive communication techniques and the people who use them, and if someone observes that it tends to be women more often than men, so be it. If you're a woman who doesn't use indirect, passive-aggressive communication techniques, you come into this thread in the same position that Peroni comes into the multitude of threads about how useless recruiters are.",1323921573

3354962,comment,3351649,3351649,1,0,jpren,,,"As several others have suggested, the elevator should behave differently at different times throughout day.<p>A smart elevator algorithm would adapt to the arrival behavior of people in a building through some clever stochastic simulation and modeling. For example, a simple model that could work quite well is to optimize for (read: minimize) the average time any passenger would wait for an elevator to arrive. But to do this, we need to model how frequently people request an elevator on each floor over the course of the day.<p>Modeling elevator requests
- We can assume that the number of people who request the elevator on each floor is a Poisson process with a mean of n. On a representative day (i.e. for an office building, choose a weekday), we can observe the number of people who arrive at the elevator each hour. This data would drop in as the n in our Poisson arrival processes.<p>Computing optimal solutions
- Using a statistical library, we can start generating simulated arrival data and apply integer optimization algorithms to determine which floor the elevator should rest on when there are no elevator requests, for each hour of the day.",1323921339

In my experience, one may question the superiority of dynamic typing at HN only to the detriment of ones karma. Well, its not HN alone, dynamic languages are certainly popular and quite persuasively championed.<p>Now I belong to the ""had been persuaded before, but now I am not so sure"" category. More so after discovering absolutely stupid typos and compile time checkable errors in long running Python code that I had written. It really sucks when your code bails out after 16 hrs of number crunching because of some silly error on your part.<p>I used to think, ""who makes type errors of all things?"" it turns out that that idiot is me. I am not claiming that dynamic languages are bad, or that checked languages are always good, but I do benefit from checked code. A better programmer perhaps wouldn't benefit as much.<p>Rather than implementing a type checking system badly and in an ad-hoc manner, I now lean more towards compile time checked languages, especially for pieces of code that I expect will run for a long time.<p>I think the sweet spot would be <i>optionally</i> type-checked / type-inferred languages, for example Cython, Common Lisp.

If you mean that they're two different approaches that can coexist, then yes. But I don't think they target orthogonal classes of bugs. In both cases, the goal is to employ some algorithmic, decidable method at compile-time to predict whether a given piece of code is ""correct"" or ""incorrect"", trading off the possibility of a false positive or false negative. Each approach does better or worse in different cases, but I think in a manner that either isn't orthogonal, or at least isn't obviously orthogonal (if ""orthogonal"" is meant in any strong sense, rather than just ""two different approaches""). And I think for any one, we can at least in principle ask whether the other one could've done it: e.g., if we're noticing a lot of bugs of a certain sort, could the type-checker have caught that? The <i>ambition</i>, at least, of static type systems is to render accurate bug-prediction impossible, because every bug statically predictable at compile-time will be a type error.",1323920377

Whilst these are important, music they do not make.  This demo is at the level of the very early computer music, some forty years ago.<p>I think what you fail to capture is emotion of the music. This can not be gained through a mechanically accurate replay of note values, in fact in a lot of cases, it is the inaccuracy or the movement in the timing of notes that can lead to emotion... Add to that the variances in dynamics (loudness), tonal quality and you start to gain some of the difference between a simple performance of tone and timing and start to see some of the complexity of a master performance.
