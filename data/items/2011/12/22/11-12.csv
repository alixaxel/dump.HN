It must also be noted that you don't usually read every single word in Asian languages since often whole sentences are short enough to recognise their whole shape.

The ability to solve problems ? The culture of correctness ?<p>The common ground between math and programming is the requirement of a very good capacity to manipulate abstract concepts in a defined frame of known validity. But it pretty much stops here. In mathematics, you define all your abstracts concepts and frame of validity, in programming, you are given a (very shaky and detailed) frame of validity on which you build up abstract concepts.<p>The ones that are good in approaching the discipline through the study of details to build up stuff that will work on top of it will make the developers. The ones that needs a strong and well defined frame for their work, for it brings a much more powerful ground and enable to reach very high levels of abstraction, will feel more comfortable on mathematics.<p>No wonder why those that can combines both of those approaches can yield stunning results.",1324554084

3381211,comment,3380734,3380734,2,0,darklajid,,,"That's a fascinating topic for me, for two reasons:<p>1) At the local Hebrew lessons I met a minister of the embassy of South Korea. He told me that Korean is a praised language all over the world (it was news to me - make of it what you want) for its simplicity and therefor speed for typists. He elaborated and said that both the layout (keyboard, I assume) would be very sensible and every 'character' is actually a combination of consonant-vowel-consonant and thereby simple (triplets, always) and carrying a lot of information. Since then I'd like to learn more about this idea and confirm or bust that claim.<p>2) Learning Hebrew is hard. A real quote from a coworker was ""It's an easy language! We only have 22 letters, after all"".\nReduce your alphabet (alephbet?) from 26 to 22. Note that of these letters, 5 are only special versions of other letters and replace those in the last position of the word. Which leaves 17 letters for most words/the meat of the language. And most words are rather short (okay, okay.. I'm not comparing to German here, that would be pointless. Even compared to english it seems to be the same or shorter to me).<p>Bottom line: I still have a bet going that I can generate Hebrew line noise (following the rules of going with the 17 letters and adding the required sofit/end letter if required. Gibberish ending in  would be 'fixed' to end in ) and will hit word after word. On my list of possible weekend projects I have an entry 'Hebrew or not' to crowd-source this.",1324554018

Many other businesses would benefit by going global right away.  Making the right decision here is sort of tricky.<p>Now, one thing to note is that this isn't an all or nothing question either.  A smart business will globalize where it makes sense and localize where that makes sense.  For example, if I am going to go and provide (or send someone to provide) training, I am not going to send someone half-way around the world for a short-term training contract.  On the other hand, sponsored development on LedgerSMB is easily global.  Payroll subscription services will naturally be a series of local offerings, while technical support for PostgreSQL can be more easily a global one.",1324553068

You can look for a particular character and find it at ease.

I might understand that people want to choose a small and easy to set up webserver to get going when starting developing a website.<p>But, in my opinion, as soon as you're getting serious, there's nothing better than developing on a system which as close as possible to your live environment (hardware is hard to mimic, so are websites running in the cloud) including same webserver and software configurations.<p>Of course this means that you either:<p>a) have any influence on software installed or \nb) know what is installed and how it is configured on the live system<p>I encountered several bugs which happen to be only on staging / live server, but which I did not encounter in my development environment. Why? Different OS. At this point, I'm trying to recreate my live-systems in virtual machines as close as possible.

This can be problematic when developing websites and applications. All my server-software is in the VM. I can choose when and what to update, problem solved. It also keeps my desktop clean, no stuff installed for developing purposes.<p>There's nothing worse than developing on a windows* machine and deploying on a unix-based os.<p>* nothing against windows developers.

In my mind, it has long been <i>inevitable</i> that - at the very least - the wealthy population of the planet will retreat into a virtual world, ala ""The Matrix"".<p>It's not just the benefits of instant, unlimited sensory gratification (which are IMMENSE - real-world physical attraction and location no longer becomes an issue for finding partners, you can enjoy <i>any</i> activity at <i>any</i> time which in the past could cost you enormously in terms of money and/or risk:  in a virtual world there's no spread of diseases if you're not in physical contact with people, no risk of death driving @ 140mph, etc. which also means a reduction in health costs, etc.).<p>It's simply far more efficient in many ways:  why physically travel to work when you can have virtual meetings, offices, etc.?  You could attend university anywhere in the world regardless of your location.  Doctors could operate remotely where it's physically cheaper to live.  Sitting at home all day (or in a Matrix farm) also means using less energy so you eat the bare minimum, don't need to own a car, don't need a big house with a garden, etc.  On a larger scale, how useful will e.g. war become as the demand for physical resources falls?  The efficiencies are mind-blowing;  it is globalization of both personal and economic activities and human resource allocation without the physical constraints.<p>Ironically enough, in the same vein as your comment, I would expect people on HN are more likely to be fans of such an extreme form of telecommuting, telelearning, etc.<p>Not that I'm not suggesting all of this is <i>good</i> or <i>healthy</i>.  Who knows what the psychological or physical effects of such a lifestyle will be.<p><i>Speculating further:</i> At that point, why bother exploring the universe?  Or more interesting:  to what extent would wealth exist?  It seems people would only need enough wealth to maintain their physical bodies and access to the planetary supercomputer. Accumulating more wealth could prove very difficult since classical economics falls apart in a virtual world where supply can become potentially unlimited over time.  Would it be possible to accumulate sufficient ""real"" wealth to construct devices capable of finding and communicating with aliens, and/or visiting them?  Would industries capable of building such devices even exist after everybody moves into the matrix after a few thousand years?  All in all, once civilization reaches a particular level of technological development, it seems like there's a very small window where anybody will see benefit to OR have the resources to communicate with aliens.",1324552143
