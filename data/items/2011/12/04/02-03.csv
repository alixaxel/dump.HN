I've already forgiven you for calling me ""not very good"" at my job, so no worries about that.<p>I would, however, love to know what the development tools in Firefox are that you find less mature or nonexistent in Chrome. There were some omissions in the first year or so of Chrome's development, but I find myself quite happy with it these days.<p>I'd gladly switch, though, if there are things I don't know about that could make me more productive.",1322967598

Firefox has had addons for much longer, and they are much more fundamental, than on Chrome or Safari. For example, while Safari and Chrome both have an AdBlock, Firefox's works much better (no flashes of ads, blocks more video ads, etc).<p>And modern versions of Firefox are doing a lot better again. It is much faster these days. They now have a much better release cycle, and their updater is smoother encouraging people to keep on the upgrade treadmill.<p>I wouldn't write Firefox off. The recent increase in competition in the browser space has done great things for all of the browsers; they have all improved dramatically over the past couple of years.",1322967516

His son was a pretty good baseball player until they had to decide between Math competitions and sports. I always tell him that his son has to become more interesting - less one-dimension Math/Science stud - like Cal Newport talks about on his blog. And that some schools for MIT could be looking for a few good baseball players.<p>The interesting thing is that the cutthroat high school his son is enrolled at - the AP weed-out courses, the hardest ones are the humanities. Courses like Modern European History.<p>> For these students, extracurricular activities play a different role than for their peers.  They dont use activities to signal their qualities, they use them instead to transform themselves into more interesting people.

If I understand correctly, are you trying to say that nodejs.org isn't being locked and that only a few people are having this issue? And are you also trying to say that we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions and this isn't a political issue and that while the GFW is ridiculous this isn't the place for a political discussion? I'm just trying to understand because I honestly didn't completely understand your comment.<p>I disagree and think this is a perfect time to talk about the politics of it even if this is a false alarm and an isolated issue. Does the GWF really help China politically? Don't the Chinese citizens know that information is being kept from them.<p>I think just knowing that your government is keeping information from you is enough to make a person dislike and distrust their government. At the same time I wonder if I'd feel the same if I grew up with censorship. It's one thing to have freedom then have someone take it away and it's another to not even know what you're missing out on. If the Chinese people don't know that there's a whole wealth of information they cannot access then they probably don't care. But if they once had full access and now it's gone I'd imagine they would be very angry about it.",1322967073

The article kind of made it sound like Mozilla was on the ropes which it's pretty far from. There will always be a market for those who want a browser from a company that is on their side and that's Mozilla. Chrome is aweso,e but there are going to be people concerned about the data collection that goes on. Chrome is out there to enrich Google. IE is infamous for being behind the times and just a crappy browser all around for standards, weird toolbars that install the,selves, etc. Then there's Mozilla. What ulterior motives do they have? From all I've ever learned they're just out there trying to build a kick ass browser and move the web forward. No search engine to support, no billion dollar software company to promote, just a humble browser maker in it for the users.<p>Chrome may overtake them in market share but I don't see Mozilla straying too far behind Google for the foreseeable future.

3309595,comment,3309108,3309329,17,0,microarchitect,,,"I don't know if this is a downside.<p>First a bit of background. I come from India where they practice reservation which I think would be considered much ""worse"" than affirmative action over here. The way the system works is that a certain percentage of seats are reserved for people from certain (usually lower castes). So for my engineering examination, I wrote a common exam conducted by the government along with about 80,000 other students from my state. Among the 80,000 about 35k or so did well enough to be given a ""rank"". The rank means exactly what you think it means.<p>Now, students are allowed to choose the college they want to go to in the order of their ranks. However, reservation means that people like me, who don't ""have a reservation"" have to choose seats from the general quota. The general quota was, believe it or not, <i>20% of all seats</i>. Out of my class of 140 EE students, we had 29 students who came through the general quota. About 15 more seats were available to students who were willing to do without the government subsidy.<p>Side note: Because my education was subsidized by the state government, I paid about $300 dollars a year in fees. The ones who went without the subsidy paid about $1200 dollars a year. All<p>All the remaining 100 or so seats were reserved for people from one or another of the reserved castes. For people in the general quota, the lowest (highest numerically) rank admitted to my department was 114. For a person coming from a reserved quota, the lowest rank admitted was 29xx.<p>At the time I felt this was grossly unfair. I busted my ass to be ranked in the top 100 among 80,000 candidates to get into this place and these guys were admitting students who weren't even in the top 2000 simply because they were born into the right family.<p>Over time, I've come to realize that I enjoyed a great many privileges these other kids did not. I had sporadic access to the internet, I had parents who were reasonably supportive of my studies, I knew English really well. I didn't get the 90th rank simply because I was awesome. I got it because I was lucky enough to be born with (some) privilege in a third-world country.<p>Many of my classmates from disadvantaged backgrounds have gone on to become competent engineers. I realize now that they fully deserved their chance.",1322964049
