PlayStation games are not easy to copy especially PS3 and you may even have to upgrade your computer to fit the games programs onto a disc. To copy PS3 games effectively there are a couple of things you may want to consider before backing up the PS3 files.\nBecause of the technology built into your PlayStation you may need to install a Blu-Ray burner instead of the traditional DVD one's. Though this upgrade may not be all that easy it will be something that needs to be done to burn PS3 game copies. Something that may make you want to go ahead and upgrade your hardware is Blu-Ray is what the games of the future will be on. So your purchase will definitely pay for itself in the long run.\nYou also want to download a program that allows you to break the PS3's encryption code so that you can burn PS3 game copies to its completion and make a good DVD. PS3 games are different that other games that you copy because they have a protection on them to keep them from being copied. This is why you will need the additional program installed on your computer.\nAfter all this is complete you now can begin to burn PS3 game copies. If you want to backup the games properly then you will need Easy Backup Wizard to lead you in the right direction. This is one of the only game backup software's that have mastered the method of copying video games so it is quite possible that others will not work. Now in the future with technology changing you may be able to use other software downloads but as of right now Easy Backup Wizard is the best.\nThe PlayStation 3 is a more sophisticated system and has a more advanced technology so it takes a little more time and money to burn PS3 game copies. Think of the money and time you will save with this software. You know how aggravating it can be when one of your games gets damaged, lost, or even stolen. With Easy Backup Wizard you can burn PS3 game copies to your computer and not have to worry about any of these problems again. Grab your own copy of the software and you to can burn PS3 game copies immediately.\nStop worrying about your games getting damaged, lost, or stolen. If you would like to backup your own video games from the PlayStation then you need to purchase your own software to do so. Burn PS3 game copies today.",1322999779

3310475,comment,3310301,3310301,38,0,Corun,,,"Android's graphics problems are not due to a lack of hardware acceleration. They're due to poor architecture.<p>The reason iOS is so silky smooth is because each view in UIKit is backed by a CoreAnimation layer which will be a pixel buffer in hardware. This means that if you move a UIView in iOS, no new rendering needs to be done of stuff that was ""uncovered"" by moving the view since each UIView has the full contents of its view stored in its CALayer. All that needs to happen is all of the layers are composited in their new positions which hardware will blazingly fast. However, as I understand it in Android, each Window (containing multiple Views) is one pixel buffer in hardware. Each view then draws in to that. This means that if you move a View in android, another view will be ""uncovered"" and since that area of the screen isn't stored somewhere, it has to go down the view tree rendering the now uncovered area of the screen. Even if that rendering is hardware accelerated, it's still going to be muuuuuch more work that just recompositing all the layers on the screen as in iOS, I mean imagine if there's text uncovered there? That's not going to be quick.<p>Now, there are downsides to iOS's approach - it uses a bunch more memory. But the upsides are basically what makes iOS good - all those silky animations. Android's just getting to a similar level of smoothness, but mostly only through better hardware.<p>(Caveat: How android works may have changed since I last looked, but that just makes the mystery of lack of smoothness even more interesting ;-) )",1322999104

(I have no comment about how generally this might happen today.) The classmate of mine who was called out about his ""race"" self-identification had a dad who almost anyone in the United States would identify as ""black"" (who definitely had African ancestry, along with European ancestry) and a mom whose historically traceable ancestry was all European. He (the student) himself looked ""white,"" so much so that he could pass as my brother. According to a report in our university's daily newspaper, after his presence in the Black Student Association (to which new students who had indicated that they were black were automatically invited by the law school) became noted, when he filled out his application forms, he checked the boxes for both ""white"" and ""black."" (This was before ""choose one or more"" was the standard language next to race categories on admission forms.) He stayed in law school, and he graduated, and he still practices law. But the other members of the Black Student Association ostracized him, even though he shared many aspects of the black experience in his daily life, and would have legally been classified as black in any southern state during segregation. (Our state, Minnesota, has never had de jure ""race"" segregation nor has it ever had a law against ""interracial"" marriage.)",1322998744

Most mobile GPU's use some form of tile-based deferred rendering that allows the use of dedicated on-chip local buffers and efficient caching, to greatly reduce RAM bandwidth pressure. If anything suffers from constrained RAM bandwidth, it's CPU rendering.<p>From a technical perspective this article is a very naive analysis, at best.",1322996836

This is odd, since the major part of a projects lifespan consists of maintenance, not development.<p>The one great missing online tool IMO is one that both integrates <i>and</i> separates the way the user experiences issues (like via Zendesk) and the way those issues are split up, prioritized and handled by developers (any known issue tracking system like Redmine etc).<p>Right now, every team I know either uses two systems in which the relationship is handled manually (and thus labor intensive and prone to errors) or one system that is only geared towards either audience.",1322996667
