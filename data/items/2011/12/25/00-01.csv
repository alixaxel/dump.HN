3390133,comment,3389972,3389972,18,0,nextparadigms,,,"I would've thought this was obvious. Google didn't just pay $300 to stop Firefox from using Bing, although I'm sure that played a big role, too, but I believe the reason Mozilla got $300 million was because they knew how to negotiate the price up. I don't think Mozilla really wanted to change to Bing.<p>Also, Google is a lot better off having an ally in Mozilla. Not so much because they don't want Bing to get a lot of users, but because together with Mozilla they have over 50% of the browser market share, and since the whole total of that market share includes very modern browser versions(Chrome always on latest version, Firefox not too far behind with the old ones), Google and Mozilla can pretty much dictate where the web is going now. I wouldn't be surprised if for those $300 million they also got Mozilla to accept using Native Client in Firefox later on. I think this part of the partnership matters more than just stopping Bing from becoming the default search on Firefox.",1324774440

We're in a battle right now about whether Internet free speech is more important than copyright, so suffice it to say that there's going to be even less support for the idea that copyright isn't important at all.<p>With that in mind, let's assume we're looking at a decade or more before copyright would be abolished.  During that time, companies will have a strong argument for why a law should be enforced.  My point is that those people are going to keep proposing legislation that protects their interests.  We can either keep risking one of those overreaching bills passing and threatening things that are actually important to us, or we can work together to address piracy, something that we'd be foolish to defend over our other freedoms.<p>I'd like to see leaders in technology speak out against piracy and for the rights of content creators in the same breath as they say this is not the legislation we need.  You're going to get more support from media if you acknowledge that there is a serious problem and offer to help address it than if all they ever see from the tech community are comments in forums about how information should be free and we should just abolish copyright.  If that's what they're hearing, they're just going to keep pushing for the legislation they want and ignore the opinions of others.",1324771867

The fact that it's managed to create 4 GDP points worth of net exports in the past 20 years is not exactly a ringing endorsement.<p>What's happened in Japan is that net exports have become a somewhat larger component of a not-rising-very-quickly GDP.

The other is that macros don't really let you do anything you can't do with lambdas in other languages, just with (much) easier quoting.<p>I don't think you can have it both ways.  (I'm not saying that any one person is making both of these points, but person B's anti-Lisp argument is arguing against person A's anti-Lisp point.)  If you can't use Lisp in a team because somebody might write a macro that you don't understand, how can you deal with Python or Ruby or C# code that inevitably tries to fake it by taking as parameters functions-that-returns-other-functions?<p>(The other common alternative I see these days is to make your DSLs in XML.  That means they're more verbose, you can't step through them in your debugger, and so on -- plus you still have the problem that allowing arbitrary DSLs is too powerful!  I suppose there's also a third alternative: don't even try to use higher-level abstraction, and build giant apps out of low-level spaghetti code.)<p>I've seen perfectly readable code in Lisp, even making extensive use of macros.  (There are conventions, and good programmers do follow them.)  I've also seen perfectly undecipherable code in every language I've ever seen.  When I've watched individuals write code in multiple languages, those that write bad Lisp tend to write bad anything.  Nothing that I've seen leads me to believe that there is any significant set of programmers who can only write bad Lisp code, but can write great code in lower-level languages.  We can give them Lisp, though, and they will at least write less of it!",1324771328
