Over the years of our business we have gone from Blue Cross/Anthem to now being with Kaiser- at one point we had a carve out plan where we had both. However, it always makes sense to go through a Broker who knows all the ins and outs each Insurer and its plan. The broker commission is paid by the Insurer not you directly. I believe the broker receives more when you add more employees to the plan - so they are invested in your growth. For our Company, the Company pays the first $200 of the plans monthly premium, the rest comes out of the employee paycheck, pre-tax. For employees 20-29, the premium plans range from $150-400. For 30-39 and Employee+Spouse or Family they go up to $300-1000. The employee can pick any plan that is offered (HSA, HMO, PPO, hybrids).",1323557088

Instead, because I'm anal about my media sorting, I manually move them to folders by movie/show/season/artist/etc that Plex scans.  But that's overkill.

If yes, there is an unbelievable world of music to explore, and you're in luck, because you can easily get most of it on the internet instead of spending countless hours combing through dingy record stores as we used to have to do.<p>As far as alternative rock music (the stuff that never got played on commercial radio) goes, there are basically two schools: the kick-ass school (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDNzQ3CXspU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDNzQ3CXspU</a>) and the melodic school (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844bENvq0e0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844bENvq0e0</a>). If you like either of those, there's a universe out there. I've always loved both.  And that's not to mention the parallel/intersecting universe of black music with its tremendous riches. The five peak years or so of late 60s soul, when blues and gospel merged, are particularly great. Their emotional resonance is unmatched by anything anywhere. A mid-period example is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5fqWugnIhk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5fqWugnIhk</a> (1967) and a late one <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPUGC4zFMjc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPUGC4zFMjc</a> (1971 or so). Again, there's a whole universe of this. Several, rather.<p>The 60s and 70s were a musical supernova. Especially the 60s, though the 70s stuff often sounds better. It seems you can spend the rest of your life finding amazing stuff from that era. A guy I knew named Greg Shaw who was one of the great champions of punk and garage rock had over a million records. He went all over buying them for pennies at yard sales because people thought they were junk. Later he released selections of his favorites on low-budget compilation albums. Every generation rediscovers this music. Stuff like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBB0e-dVhc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoBB0e-dVhc</a> and  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZXkzao9KvA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZXkzao9KvA</a>.<p>As far as rock music goes, the best material today is no different from the best of decades ago. It's the exact same patterns being reworked. Take e.g. the Black Keys- that's all they do. That's no criticism; it's the same thing the ""originals"" were doing. It's a little weird that 45 years mean so little culturally - i.e. that the music of 45 years ago and today are (technology aside) about the same. The process hasn't been linear. It's more like a state change occurred in the post-war years and we've been living in that reality ever since.",1323556468

The only large scale government healthcare in the US is the VA which costs a lot less than the rest of the US healthcare system because they pay for the doctors directly and cut out a lot of middle men that drive up costs everywhere else in the US system.  They also have more leverage when it comes to malpractice and doctor pay etc.<p>Now, your rhetorical idea that prices can drop 10% the first year and 10% the second would probably not be far off the mark.
