But it is clearly going the wrong way.<p>Also I'd be careful with saying 'never'. Here in the Netherlands, for example, nationalized health care was weakened a long time ago by privatizing health insurance, more 'at will' employment is pushed as panacea for the employment problem by right-wing parties, and weakening anti-discrimination law (especially anti-Islam) is also on the agenda of a popular party.",1323943191

3355560,comment,3355344,3355505,2,0,nknight,,,"> <i>What's wrong with XMPP multi-user chat?</i><p>I was speaking more generally than XMPP. I don't know the fundamental causes, but I haven't seen group/multi-user chat work reliably in years -- I think the last time I did, everybody was on ICQ using official clients.<p>The problems I have encountered are:<p>1) Group chats just don't start.<p>2) Not everyone can see/""hear"" everyone else.<p>3) Rarely, #2 starting and stopping randomly for people.<p>I've seen these behaviors on chats with as few as 3 people, up to 8ish (don't think I've ever gone higher than that).<p>I doubt the protocols are fundamentally broken in this regard, I assume I'm encountering implementation bugs, but they seem to be pervasive.<p>> <i>And I don't understand your argument of ""incompletely-routed"", especially if compared to IRC.</i><p>""incompletely-routed"" may not be a good phrase to use here, least of all because not many people ""get"" IRC anymore.<p>IRC networks eventually stabilized into a model whereby there was network-wide coordination of routing. Every server on a network can talk to every other server, and there is no leakage outside of the network. You know what you're getting when you connect to one of the major networks. With IM, links may be established between A and B, and B and C, but not A and C.<p>> <i>imho XMPP federation is much more powerful concept than IRC networking.</i><p>I would absolutely agree in so far as the <i>intent</i> of XMPP federation goes. In practice, there are two problems:<p>1) Some IM providers intentionally cripple it (e.g. Facebook).<p>2) Not all IM providers use XMPP in the first place. Even some of the ones that make available a limited XMPP interface don't actually base their services off of it (Facebook, Microsoft).<p>It's important to realize that IM is not the same as XMPP, so when I say ""IM"", I mean ""IM"", not the XMPP subclass. :)",1323942628

3355556,comment,3354580,3355510,29,0,Lewisham,,,"Hi. I'm Chris, the author of the blog post/work.<p>You're not wrong, although bug prediction is a very nebulous term in the academic literature which encompasses a pretty broad range of techniques. The term is used to properly ground the work in what's come before.<p>It's perhaps useful to talk a little bit about how I got where I ended up, which wasn't discussed much in the post for length reasons. I originally spent a lot of time trying to implement FixCache, a pretty complicated algorithm that looks at things such as spacial locality of bugs (bugs appear close to each other), temporal locality of bugs (bugs are introduced at the same time) and files that change together (bugs will cross cut these). It then puts it all in a LIFO cache and flags files that way. This most definitely fits in the ""bug prediction"" line of work, and a number of follow-up papers independently verified its success. but I was struggling deploying FixCache. This was largely because the open source code that had been written beforehand at the university lab [1] wasn't designed for MapReduce, and also because I was becoming worried that it was very difficult to understand how it flagged files, which could lead to the tool being written off as outputting false positives and then ignored.<p>About halfway through the internship, a pre-print of the Rahman et al. [2] paper was handed to me, which indicated that maybe everything FixCache was doing could be massively simplified and get largely the same result. We trialled both algorithms using user studies, and found that developers thought the output of the Rahman algorithm better matched their intuition as to where the hotspots in their code base was, so we went with that.<p>So, after this very roundabout discussion, we reach the question of ""If Rahman is a subset of the FixCache algorithm, and FixCache is a bug prediction algorithm, is Rahman a bug prediction algorithm, too?"" and I'll leave that for others to judge, but that's why it's been described as so :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/SoftwareIntrospectionLab/FixCache"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SoftwareIntrospectionLab/FixCache</a>

It's pretty much Integer BASIC plus subroutine parameters, with about thirty years of programming language innovation waiting to be recapitulated. Say I wanted to write an RSS reader that sorts items by date and/or title. How would I store a collection of feeds, each of which is a collection of items, when the only data structure is a map of key/value strings? How would I write a sort that uses a comparator parameter to learn what order two items should appear in? If the list is huge, how do I re-sort gradually without freezing the UI? If some feeds are RSS and others scrape Twitter or something, how do I dispatch to whichever implementation of getMoreMessages is appropriate for each feed? I can't remember the last time I had to write an entire application without being able to do all of these things and more (reflection? plugins? mocks for testing?) nearly effortlessly, and I doubt many people will be willing to do without them.",1323941141

That's why Facebook killed it very easily.<p>First the official client (which I never stoud btw) became shittier with each release. Then they made that (very very) bad Facebook copy and forced users to display their real name instead of nicknames.<p>Moreover Messenger suffers from protocol version fragmentation. Features in alternative clients are random. Some people see nicknames, others real names, some are unaware that their real name is displayed. Sometimes you get old avatars, sometimes new ones, sometimes you don't even know that your avatar does not work. Same for offline messaging, and multi-connection.<p>And sadly Pidgin MSN's implementation SUCKS and it was a bad day when their survey indicated that people wanted up-to-date support and they just dismissed it.",1323940901

It does get the job done, and is in widespread use, and has multiple server and client implementations, which makes it a gazillion times better than almost anything else out there. Hats off.<p>It was unbearably chatty - to the point of being unusable as a server-to-server protocol in a high-load environment in 2003. internal protocols (and even external protocols such as OSCAR, ICQ, and MSN Messenger) required 10% of the bandwidth and 10% of the CPU power. Jabber was usable but very expensive as a client-to-server protocol.<p>Nowadays, CPU is much cheaper and so is bandwidth, so these problems are gone. And perhaps clients are better behaved and standardised now (I have no idea how video, file transfer, etc are handled these days; the answer back in the day was ""not at all, or in a complex and non standardized way"").",1323939866
