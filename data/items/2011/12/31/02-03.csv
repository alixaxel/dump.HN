3409974,comment,3409751,3409955,0,0,mikeash,,,"Good point that you can compare the pointer with another pointer. However, your bit about consistency only applies to results from the same call. Nothing says that alloca(0) must return the same pointer on two different calls, and indeed one would naively expect the opposite. While one could certainly claim a compiler bug if the <i>same value</i> compared both equal to and not equal to NULL, that's not the case in the example given; instead, alloca(0) behaves as if it returns NULL in some cases, and non-NULL in other cases, which is completely allowed.<p>It's true that alloca is all implementation-defined, but do you know of an implementation where the value of alloca(0) is defined? On OS X, it is not defined.<p>Comparing alloca(0) to malloc(0) is off-base. The return value from malloc(0) has an important requirement that alloca(0) lacks: you must be able to pass the result to free(). Therefore, the compiler can't have it be an arbitrary value, whereas replacing all calls to alloca(0) with (void *)arc4random() would be (aside from the side effect of calling arc4random()) a valid transformation.",1325300398

3409955,comment,3409751,3409930,0,0,bdonlan,,,"On the contrary, you can do something safely with such a pointer - compare it with another pointer. If the value of 'alloca(0)' is _unspecified_, then this comparison is legal, and its result, while not specified, must be consistent. In other words, code like this should not fail the assertion:<p><pre><code>  void *x = alloca(0);\n  void *y;\n  int is_x_null = (x == NULL);\n  memcpy(&y, &x, sizeof(y)); // confuse the optimizer\n  assert(is_x_null == (y == NULL));\n</code></pre>\nNote that is_x_null can be either 0 or 1, and this value may even vary between runs. But it's not acceptable for the assert to fail here, and it sounds like it would with this bug.<p>If you argue that alloca(0) is 'undefined behavior', of course, all this goes out the window. Since alloca is not standardized, though, one can't really argue this - all of alloca's behavior is implementation-defined, and so if llvm-gcc really wants alloca(0) to be UB, it should document this fact as a porting concern.<p>Incidentally, all of this applies to malloc(0) as well. C99 defines malloc(0)'s behavior as follows:<p>> If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation- deﬁned: either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.<p>This is actually even stricter than 'unspecified', in that it requires the implementation to document which choice it takes.",1325299629

As far as the C language is concerned, alloca is a function like any other function.<p>(edit: To be 100% clear of the ramifications of this, even if alloca itself is implemented using horrible undefined black magic, a pedantic C compiler would not have advanced knowledge of that happening inside the function, and could not prematurely optimize it away.)<p>(Note: I use the term ""pedantic"" in this edit to describe such a C compiler, as the real-world behavior of practical systems does not conform to the view that ""undefined"" means ""could order a kill strike on your children"".)<p>B) Your example is kind of off, btw, as NULL and a pointer with dynamic value 0x0 do not mean the same thing: I am allowed to deference a pointer that is at the address 0x0, and the dynamic value of NULL need not be 0x0. ;P<p>(edit: This example was deleted by the poster I am responding to, but was an example involving comparison of a pointer value to NULL being allowed to be optimized to false if it had been previously dereferenced.)<p>(edit:) C) Your new example is at least internally consistent, but is still specifically relying on behavior that is undefined. The C standard does not define any undefined behavior with respect to calling the function ""alloca"" any more than it does calling the function ""hello"".<p>If the behavior of the function itself is undefined with respect to being passed 0, that does not affect the language's implementation of what to do when calling that function: it does not know how undefined it is.<p>What is actually going on here is that gcc has an optimized version of alloca that it declares as a ""builtin""; this is both to make alloca itself performant (one instruction), but also to allow it to make further optimizations in the function.<p>These optimizations should be compliant with the C language standard, and in this case they are not. Honestly, in the real world (as opposed to pedantic standard land), that's fine, but this case is just egregiously confusing.<p>In fact, sufficiently confusing that I can't imagine the developers of llvm-gcc would not consider it a bug; in essence, gcc and llvm's translation layers are being layered, and they are interacting ""poorly"".<p>However, as llvm-gcc is a discontinued product, this bug will not get fixed. However, this is currently the best compiler that Apple has provided us for use on their platforms as of Xcode 4.2, which is ""unfortunate"".<p>(Note: I just say ""unfortunate"". It is not necessarily ""horrible""; it is simply ""unfortunate"". There are many bugs in llvm-gcc that are not present in gcc, and it is ""unfortunate"" that Apple hates GPL3 sufficiently to have not only thrown a ton of money at replacing it, but have now even stopped shipping the old stalwart.)",1325299417

3409924,comment,3409751,3409908,0,0,mikeash,,,"Once you invoke undefined behavior, all bets are off. If the result of alloca(0) is undefined (and reading the man page, it appears to be) then any return value is valid. Likewise, the optimizer is allowed to assume that alloca(0) never happens, because once you invoke undefined behavior, anything can happen.<p>C is a dangerous language. A large part of that danger is to allow compilers to produce efficient code. A major point of ""undefined behavior"" is to allow compilers to assume that such things can never happen, and thus avoid generating code that has to deal with them.<p>To take a more sane example:<p><pre><code>    int *x = ...;\n    *x = 42;\n    if(x == NULL)\n        foo();\n</code></pre>\nA C compiler would be entirely within its rights to completely delete both the if check and the call too foo() in this code. It's illegal to dereference a NULL pointer, so the compiler may assume that that code path can never happen.<p>Now, you may set up your system so that 0x0 is actually a valid address that can be written to, with clever mmap tricks or whatever. You may then initialize x with NULL and run this code, expecting the dereference to work, and foo() to be called. From a naive point of view, that's what should happen. However, even though 0x0 is a valid address in this environment, dereferencing it is still undefined behavior according to the language you're using. If you manually wrote the above in assembly you're fine, but the moment you do this in C, all bets are off.<p>It's the same deal with alloca(0). You can't count on the return value being anything in particular, and simultaneously the compiler <i>can</i> assume that the return value is anything it feels like.<p>Edit: thought of a more pertinent example. Consider the following:<p><pre><code>    int x = INT_MAX;\n    int y = 1;\n    int z = -INT_MAX - 1;\n    if(x + y == z)\n        foo();\n    else\n        bar();\n</code></pre>\nDirectly translating this code to assembly and running it on any modern architecture would result in foo() being called (assuming I didn't screw up my arithmetic). The addition of x + y wraps around, and with a two's complement representation this results in the most negative integer being produced. That same integer is generated more directly in z, and the two compare equal.<p>But! integer overflow produces undefined results in C. The above program is ill-formed, and the compiler is completely within its rights to assume that the conditional is <i>never true</i>, because the moment you wrote x + y you gave up any right to expect any particular value in the result.<p>Interestingly, the version of clang on my computer optimizes the above to always call foo(), rather than always call bar(). However, either choice would be correct.<p>One certainly could get used to integer overflow always wrapping around according to two's complement and expect the above code to work. Upon encountering a compiler that optimizes the above to always call bar(), one might first suspect that the compiler is broken. However, it is the code that is broken, and the compiler is correct.",1325298942

Completely valid, since dereferencing NULL is undefined behavior, but not what one might expect after using a compiler that's more obedient.<p>There's a great post on undefined behavior in C, what it means for a compiler, and how LLVM and Clang deal with it here:<p><a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_21.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-...</a>",1325298600
