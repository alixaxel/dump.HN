You as the teacher are saying the <i>exact</i> same words, but mean two completely different things.  Kahn made this mistake and there are student comments showing the confusion.<p>Not correctly understanding assignment is one of the biggest failure points for beginners learning programming.  The '=' operator has little relation to '=' in any form the students have encountered before.   It means something like ""evaluate the shit on the right hand side, and store it in a variable with the name on the left hand side"".  That meaning is not really even close to the meaning of the english word ""equals"".<p>You can personally call it whatever you want, but if you want to be a good teacher to beginning programmers, then you don't call both = and == the same thing.

We do not ban everything that's unhealthy. The question is whether, on balance, the benefits of prohibition are greater than the costs. I think we agree on that, though we might disagree when we estimate the balance when it comes to narcotics. Unfortunately, statistics for both sides are limited. This scarcity of data makes the  Portugese experience really valuable.<p>We can know the cost of imprisoning all these people though. The US has the highest imprisonment rate in the world: 738 per 100,000. The UK, which has similar societal attitudes to drugs, though very different judicial policies, has 148 per 100,000, which is still above the median globally.

I understand that the value of a masters is highly suspect, but my belief was that I needed a stronger theoretical foundation before I got back into it. From my perspective, it seems that ""coding"" itself has always been something learned on your own time, since NONE of our classes teach practical coding. 
And as a result, I'm embarrassed. If someone asks me what language I code in, I can say that I've had a  good amount of experience coding in Java and C. But I have nearly no experience in Python, Javascript, you name it. Everyone tells me that this stuff is learned on your own time, but I have no time to spare.
I'm becoming frustrated as I take these master classes, as I find my time being increasingly consumed by things I no longer find relevant. Everything I do now seems geared toward acing interviews at Microsoft or Oracle (even in algorithms, my favorite class, I have heard ""now this is an interview question so pay attn"" all too many times). I don't have the time to learn how to do something as simple as setting up a complete backend, or learning objective c to make a fun app without my grades taking a huge hit. This is bothering me.
What should I do? I actually thought about dropping my masters and just learning what I want on my own, but I already paid for the (very) expensive tuition and it's nonrefundable. If I try to learn things on the side then I struggle academically and I probably will half ass the extracurricular programming too. If I  go all in on my masters classes I will end up not learning what I want but will hopefully learn the theory well. On a final note, I'm taking internet and web systems, software systems, and software foundations class next semester, which I think is more practical....",1320210051
