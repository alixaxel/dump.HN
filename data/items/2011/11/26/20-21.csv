Prices depends on supply and demand: if you reduce the supply of something and hold demand constant or increase it, that thing becomes valuable. The problem with preserving ""old"" buildings through legal means it that doing so prevents new supply (which usually means ""more units for an acre of land"") from coming online, thus increasing housing costs altogether.

Engineers by their nature, tend to focus on the first and neglect the latter. There are some great book on the artistic side, but I particularly ""Vision and Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom"" by David duChemin[1]. This is most definitely not a book about Lightroom but rather about your artistic intent which starts when you first think of the shot and how you carry that ""vision"" through to Lightroom and express with your post-processing ""voice"". The discussion are priceless and it works as a book even if you don't use Lightroom. His other books and ebooks are also very good.<p>[1] <a href=""http://amazon.co.uk/dp/0321670094"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amazon.co.uk/dp/0321670094</a>",1322340937

3280651,comment,3280498,3280498,20,0,oldstrangers,,,"I trained in traditional film photography for 8 years, worked in a darkroom and developed my own film. The 'technical' details that make a photo ""text-book-correct"" were some of the first things we learned. It was a given that you knew how to properly shoot a photo (and in our case, how to properly develop, enlarge, print, etc). This was the foundation for potentially creating something more than just a snapshot. You only ever really noticed these details when someone got it wrong.<p>With that said, after about the 2nd year, it became increasingly clear that once you knew what you were doing, you had almost no incentive to continue doing things ""correctly."" Critiques at the higher levels became increasingly abstract. It was understood that you could shoot a ""technically correct"" photo. No one needed to see that from you again, perhaps ever. You master the basics and you're suddenly let in on a secret that the basics don't really matter (at least in an artistic/scholastic context).<p>However, I can see why the engineer type would be attracted to the technical part of photography. It is a fun and rewarding endeavor to create things correctly, and not everyone wants to be an artist. Working in a darkroom is extremely rewarding in a technical sense because it rewards those who do things correctly and punishes those who don't. Ultimately, there are all kinds of reasons to fall in love with photography, and those reasons don't need to correspond with mine or anyone elses.",1322340468
