3279451,comment,3279225,3279419,15,0,jballanc,,,"The flu is an interesting beast. Let's say you are a flu virus that has just landed in someone's lung tissue. What's your next move? You had best get inside of a cell, and quick! You see, the human body has agents called white blood cells out looking for you.<p>Ok, now what's your next move? Well, you want to reproduce. Really, that's all you want to do. You don't care if you reproduce in this host or another host, so long as you get the chance to make many, many offspring. The problem is, eventually this host's immune system will catch on and eradicate you. So, you had best make plans to find a new host.<p>Now you have two choices:<p>1. You could reproduce rapidly. This will allow you to generate the greatest number of viral particles before the host immune system catches on. Unfortunately, as you reproduce your host will become ill. They will be less mobile and more likely to be quarantined, so you might end up coming in contact with fewer potential new hosts.<p>2. You could reproduce at a measured pace. You'll end up with fewer offspring total before the immune system knocks you out, but if you can leave your host <i>mostly</i> healthy, then they are more likely to bring you in contact with more potential new hosts.<p>As for why you are contagious <i>before</i> the onset of symptoms, that is due to another rather interesting feature of the flu. You see, the flu can cause damage in a variety of different ways. Obviously, taking over the machinery of a cell to make new virus particles is not good for the cell or a tissue. However, that's not the most damaging effect that flu can have.<p>For particularly fatal cases of the flu, what happens is that so many viral particles are produced so rapidly that the body's immune system goes into overdrive. <i>Never</i> underestimate the power of the human immune system, especially the power to kill humans! This is why the Spanish flu, the Swine flu, and H5N1 are most devastating to relatively young, relatively healthy individuals (their immune systems are the strongest).<p>So, the flu symptoms that result from the body's own immune system causing damage will only occur (obviously) once the immune system has already engaged and begun neutralizing the virus. Hence, this is why flu is typically only communicative before the onset of symptoms.<p><i>Edit</i>: I should add that despite this interesting feature of the flu, almost all diseases are primarily communicable before the onset of symptoms. This has as much to do with the immune system as it does with the fact that generalized symptoms won't set in until the buggers have already been reproducing for a while.",1322297604

3279443,comment,3277030,3278914,1,0,lloeki,,,"A fork is a mere 'git clone'. The brilliance and simplicity of SHA1s makes linking repos as trivial as a <i>git remote add</i>. I venture it would be quite costly to actively look at every commit of a new repo to match it with every other commit in every other github repo (unless they start maintaining a global index of all SHA1s->repos). So for now Github merely records that one cloned a repo, and I seriously won't blame them for that.<p>If the guy did things properly, although inconvenient we could just do that to merge back, but apparently what he did was rewrite or recreate history in some way, so that SHA1s changed so it's not even possible to <i>add remote</i>[0]. I guess that even with no common ancestor SHA1s one could still use <i>rebase --onto</i> to replay some part of his history.<p>Either way I can't tell because the repo is 404 now and I did not have a chance to browse it, let alone <i>clone</i> it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3277181"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3277181</a><p>PS: I like some of your ideas, like hiding forks that can be fast-forwarded (i.e they have no changes i.e their HEADs are  members of the parent repo), and detecting that one has pushed a repo that is obviously a clone of another, although I'd rather have it be manual (like a message on the github's console saying ""we detected that this repo could be a clone of that repo, do you want to mark it as a fork?"")",1322297252
3279442,comment,3277219,3278768,3,0,ludwigvan,,,"Thanks for your comment. I strive to be a great maker, so I love programming languages!<p>You are right in some sense, though. I think about the parent's and your questions from time to time. The thing is, I actually do love Python too. It's just that, as an outsider, I find the the Ruby community much more vibrant, and I sometimes envy the stuff over there.<p>I have a deep affection to most programming languages in general though, I do not think that I should choose one of them over the others. For example, contrary to general opinion, I find some parts of Perl beautiful too, and even this year have read a few Perl books.<p>As to why I happened to choose Python over Ruby, there are historical reasons. The first reason is that, as a previous academic, I first learned Python for SciPy, considering it as a replacement as MATLAB. Being that Python was backed by Google was a plus at the time.<p>It was when the App Engine was announced with Python support that I started making a few websites with Python, only to discover shortly that Django was the most popular way to go for making websites in Python (I would also highly recommend Flask as an alternative too, now).<p>Now, at this point I was proficient enough in Django, and started looking at Rails. I was immediately struck by some of its aspects, but still web programming was not my full-time job; and I feared that since Rails was moving so fast at the time, and that it relied on convention more than the explicitness of Django, I thought that after a week of not working on my project, I would forget some of that implicit stuff.<p>This, I believe is also the major reason why most people don't like Perl -- a chicken and egg problem. My impression is that those who do not like Perl are not people who code full-time on Perl (surprise!) and so view Perl programs incomprehensible after they maintain the code after a break. It is similar to natural language in that if you do not use it, you tend to forget some of the stuff that makes things very easy; while I would describe Python as more like solving a maths/geometry problem - easier to recall, easier to maintain.<p>So, I love Python, but it's just that I  also love most of these languages, and some parts of them more; Smalltalk, amazing in its world concept, Lisp (and now Clojure) beautiful with their flexibility. But where do I find a Clojure job, if I don't create that job opening myself with a personal project? I believe it is a general feeling on HN, most people have an affection for Lisp, but for some reason, do not (or can not) use it in their daily jobs.<p>Regarding your comment about Peter Norvig though, actually, he is a prominent guy speaking for Lisp; it is just that Python is more comprehensible by students (as it is closer to pseudo-code), that he has chosen to use it.",1322297223

3279391,comment,3279225,3279225,114,0,jballanc,,,"Reading some of the comments, I am reminded of the Greek concept of <i>hubris</i>...<p>In particular, it is funny how programmers, who make their living by controlling complicated systems, jump to the conclusion that every complicated system is trivially subject to human control. I had a professor once put it this way: disease is just that -- a dis-ease.<p>The first thing you have to understand is that no organism lives in a biological vacuum. Every organisms interacts with other organisms. When first two organisms meet, the interaction is usually rather messy. One or the other or both die in great numbers. Gradually, they make adjustments and the deaths decrease. One becomes a disease or parasite of the other. Eventually, the two organisms will reach a détente and begin living as symbionts. Given enough time, the distinction between the two may even vanish (see: endosymbiont hypothesis).<p>The flu virus is, in particular, a rather striking study of this process. Consider the vast majority of fowl who carry the virus asymptomatically. For them, flu is not a disease, but rather a simple hitch-hiker. For humans, you can predict the severity of a flu outbreak based on how well adjusted the virus is to humans. The more avian characteristics it has, the worse the symptoms and mortality are likely to be. At the same time, an ill adjusted virus is much less likely to spread.<p>One other thing to consider is that the flu virus itself does not exist in isolation from itself. The Spanish flu of 1918 is an interesting case in this respect. It was, as I alluded to before, ill adjusted to human hosts. At the same time, it was particularly communicable; something of an oddity for a flu with so many avian characteristics. It did kill a large number of people, but within a year or two the major damage had been done and the pandemic was over.<p>Why? Well, certainly a large portion of the human population that had become exposed but had not died were now immune. More importantly, though, the strain mutated and became better adjusted to human hosts. This strain, H1N1, then became the predominant form of the ""seasonal flu"". It is likely that you have become infected by a descendent of this very strain, probably many times over.<p>I would not fear this virus for the same reason that I do not fear Ebola or Marburg virus. Viruses that kill quickly and efficiently do not spread as well as those that cause some disease but allow their host to continue functioning more or less normally (all the while exposing many more to the virus). Of course, this is little comfort to the dead, and there will always be those who die from any outbreak (just go look at the annual death toll from ""seasonal flu""). It is far, far from a reason to start predicting the end of humanity.<p>One final note on the bioweapon/bioterror angle: if you follow the thinking of the people that actually contemplate the use of bioweapons, you'll find that bioweapons are only ever considered as denial-of-area or knock-down agents. That is, you can use a bioweapon to prevent your enemy from gaining or holding a strategic position. What you don't find is anyone proposing to use a bioweapon as a coup de grace. Those that study these things understand that any biological agent has an in-built time limit on its effectiveness.<p><i>Edit</i>: I just realized I should mention that while I don't appreciate the sensationalism espoused by the scientific press, H5N1 is a very real, very troubling threat. It won't wipe out the human race, but it does have a good chance of setting humanity back a decade or two (not from disease, but primarily from the knock-on effects of people reacting to the disease, halting productive work and worldwide travel). In my mind, though, this is all the more reason to publish this research and, while we're at it, pour some more money into the worldwide flu monitoring network.",1322294969

While there, I did talk to a few people about the IT climate. So take what I say with a grain of salt.<p>First and foremost, Turkey is a country of 80 million people. There is a significant amount of variety from person to person, but the tax codes and business rules are not IT friendly relative to other businesses. There is still a non-trivial tariff on computers and electronics, making supplies more expensive than in other countries. From what I vaguely understand it is easier for other companies to evade taxes than IT services, all of which increases the cost of business and makes outsourcing less economical compared to other Eastern European nations. (AKP, the ruling party, is thought of as business-friendly, but I haven't seen any work to really tackle their tax issues.)<p>Second, Turkey's government is censorship-happy. Nothing like hacker news or reddit would work there, much less something like yelp. (every comment would have to be read, lest someone gets trialed for ""insulting Turkishness.""<p>Finally, they don't have a great way for capitalization of projects. Also, the people with money seem risk-averse to new ideas.<p>Turks themselves are very entrepreneurial, and the few of them that I've known who were developers are generally rather sharp. I wouldn't try to outsource there, however, at this point in time. (Unless I end up there for a few years with a bit of cash and can poke at loopholes.
