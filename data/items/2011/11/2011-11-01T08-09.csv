""Nomenclature"" has several meanings, including simply a name or designation, a system of naming, or a set of names. It can also refer to the act of naming. But none of the meanings refer directly to the consideration of the criteria for what makes good names.

3181207,comment,3180015,3180015,15,0,todsul,,,"I just spent 6 months in India, which included a 12,000km circumnavigation of the country by rail. A team of 20 of us, half rail enthusiasts, half travellers and entrepreneurs, spent 2 weeks on Indian trains venturing to the country's most Western, Northern, Eastern and Southern points (in that order). We travelled a little in unreserved and Sleeper class, but mostly 3AC and 2AC. It was by far my favourite travel experience ever (after travelling extensively across 6 continents).<p>The Indian rail and ticketing systems are chaos personified. As a traveller post-India, I love the adventure of just trying to buy a ticket from a station. (Quick tip: stand wide, shoulders broad, with ticket form in hand blocking access to the hole in the ticketing window so others can't push through.) But, thinking back as an Indian-rail newbie, my goodness!<p>As an entrepreneur on a trip like this (full of industry experts), I couldn't help but see business opportunities. When I say experts, I mean guys that can recite the Indian rail timetable (approx. the size of the Yellow Pages) without missing a beat. They're also the guys that dominate the popular India rail forum called IndiaMike.com. The depth of their knowledge was staggering. When someone like me meets people like them, we can't help but plot and conspire.<p>From a business perspective, the problem with building an Indian Rail startup was getting access to the rail information. We had grand plans and certainly the expertise, but then came the stories of bureaucracy. Forget publicly accessible APIs, the IRCTC would apparently only give access through bribes. A couple of people I spoke with talked of requests for US$40k. (Dinner and expensive champagne is one thing, but $40k is on another planet.)<p>So why compete with Cleartrip, et al? Well, they're just not intuitive or efficient. They're actually a pain in the ass. We envisaged something like Hipmunk for Indian train travel. But rather than being satisfied with just better design, we saw an opportunity to bring Indian rail travel to the average foreign traveller. Of course, the last thing the Indian rail system needs is more passengers, but it felt such a shame that most people would never experience India the way we did.<p>In the end there were just too many hurdles. For starters, you can't book foreign tourist allocated seats over the internet (despite bribes and access to APIs). You can't even book them at most stations. Then there are issues with IndRail passes and availability. You can book tickets 90 days out, but the volume of ticket sales in India is mind-blowing. If someone wants to travel cross-country next month, sometimes they'll buy 5 different days and just cancel the 4 extra as they get closer to the day. The cancellation fee is so low that it makes sense. So in a country with 1.1 billion people, imagine people booking multiple tickets to provide flexibility. This is why there's such an insane last minute frenzy.<p>I still think there's an opportunity here, but the data needs to be made accessible.  In my opinion, this kind of openness requires structural and cultural change in government. I hate to say it, but don't hold your breath.<p>All of that said, I highly recommend travel by Indian rail to anyone. We were a mixed group of Brits, Americans, Canadians, Australians, etc and were treated more warmly than anywhere on the planet. Of course there were a couple of ""incidents"" (e.g. breast groping), but hanging out the door a speeding Indian locomotive in the middle of nowhere is something everyone should experience.<p>If you're a foreigner wanting to book Indian train tickets with minimum fuss, I've written a detailed guide here: <a href=""http://globetrooper.com/notes/plan-book-train-trip-india/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globetrooper.com/notes/plan-book-train-trip-india/</a>",1320137450

3181205,comment,3175430,3176788,1,0,ilaksh,,,"First of all, I do not use any of these terms in a non-specific non-technical 'buzz' fashion. I am actively working on implementing this system and the technology choices I made are not simply following trends, there are real advantages to working with things like Node.JS, NPM and CoffeeScript.<p>And just because I didn't get into detail in regards to the advantages doesn't mean that wasn't the an important part of the motivation.<p>For a platform like this, there are two sets of users: the non-technical users and the software developers building plugins and components for the system (not buzzwords).<p>Let me explain exactly what each of these words means technically in this context so that they cannot be mistaken for buzzwords.  I will admit that 'plugins' and 'components' can often mean different things to different people, but I don't believe there are better words to describe what I am building.<p>Plugins are extensions to the system which are easily added, integrated and configured.  This is a feature which is missing from a number of sophisticated web frameworks, but not missing from WordPress.  The biggest problem with WordPress is the language it is built on (PHP) and the architecture of the system.<p>I think that many web developers would welcome a system with something like the types of plugins offered by WordPress, but built on a much cleaner language like CoffeeScript, Node.JS, BDD (not a buzzword, I mean specifically developing starting with Vows and Jasmine, those are actual specific libraries for BDD as per examples such as here <a href=""http://vowsjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vowsjs.org/</a>) and a component architecture (I will explain exactly what I mean by that).<p>Components are reusable, interact on the basis of known interfaces, cohesive but decoupled, and substitutable pieces of software, which often, as in this case, present graphical user interfaces.  I intended to use them primarily (but not exclusively) to compose the user interface screens and to provide easy configuration and integration for different aspects of the system.<p>Building the screens from drag-and-drop, composed components with on-screen configuration rather than using mixed PHP, HTML and CSS code provides a major advantage (obviously) for end users and also (perhaps less obviously for many, unfortunately) developers.<p>Having reusable, easily configurable components available with built-in UIs could make plugin and application development much more efficient for developers than it is with just (for example) libraries of modules.",1320137408

This is why I did an experiment and built lokenote.com<p>I havent nailed it with lokenote, but it hints theres something there...  Im aware this is a first, imperfect approximation of the kind of tool that will enable people to annotate locations. Sometimes you need to build these experiments to see what works or doesn't.<p>I dont think the storing/retrieving of geo-data is that hard a problem, you can roll your own nested squares approach, or reuse whats there now, eg. Mongo 2d indexes.<p>Rather, I think the problem is making a nice way to integrate the location dimension into our tools/web apps more seamlessly.  eg. a dating chat app might just favour partners close to your location without being told what postcodes to look in. I see this as a 'too many knobs' type problem ( a bit like those search forms you see that have options for 10 different dimensions to filter on, which are better replaced by a single text search field, with hidden smarts. )<p>So how to bring location to the people, so its useful, effective, un-intrusive and read-write ?  I dont think that question has been answered.<p>[edit readability]",1320137165

He's human just like everyone else.<p>The thing is, NOT every project, not every product, not every service can be grown into a full blown company. It just doesn't work that way. Go to any store and look at all the bottles of shampoo you can choose from, all those brands belong mainly to 1 or 2 companies, Unilever and Johnson. Same with food products. If every little shirt, and every brand of crackers where its own company with it's own marking, and distribution, and it's own packaging plant, it's own lawyers, it's own administration offices, it's own headquarters... We'd be paying triple for everything. (although we would have a lot more jobs... correction, the Chinese would have a lot more jobs...)<p>Some products just can't be monetized to support themselves so they MUST be acquired by a company that can integrate them into its own profitable services (or product line) and compete better with other competitors doing the same.<p>If nobody flipped it would screw over entrepreneurs by forcing them to commit themselves to one industry, one company, one product line their whole lives instead of being able to create companies, sell them, repeat. Thereby going in and out of numerous industries and markets instead of just one.<p>Can you really see every product becoming its own corporation? On the other hand, companies like Google and facebook (who's only difference from competitors were features) grew into their own massive companies. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<p>Starting a company, growing it, and optimizing it are three different things. Very rarely are there people who are good at all three. Jobs is one of them, Zuckerberg another, but they're lottery stories. Their advice may not work for the majority of people.<p>- My 2 cents.",1320135991
