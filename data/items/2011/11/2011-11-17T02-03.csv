I'm sure they were very threatened by meeting a socially well-adjusted person.<p>The bottle of water didn't cause me any trouble in Europe, but I had real fear after having previously had a terrible run in the US both with the Thug Squad and Immigration.<p>I don't know if you have a doctorate, but I can tell you that this is a big red flag. As I said above I don't travel to the US for any reason any more. I once saw a girl who couldn't have been more than 16 who had collapsed on the floor in tears because of what I assume was the abusive verbal treatment she had received. She was literally dragged right across the floor of the room by some fat prick holstering no less than two weapons. She was clearly frightened out of her brain. I was then singled out for obnoxious treatment by a different troll for absolutely no reason whatever. I made it through the barrage of verbal accusations and threats, but shook for about an hour afterwards. You just know that you cannot so much as raise your shoulders or flare your nostrils without having the moron escalate his creative fiction and possibly deport you. They love that sense of power they get. You have to stand there submissively and not let them get a rise out of you all the while insisting that they are wrong.<p>In contrast, I have never had an issue with immigration or the equivalent of the TSA in any other country. I did once get a secondary interview at immigration in Europe by some shadowy figure from some secret service. It was as bizarre as you might imagine. He had the emblazoned vest, the earpiece, the whole kit, and he asked me random questions about my past. But it was polite, short, not at all frightening and it was pretty clear that he wasn't there looking for people like me. (Who knows what these people get up to. I'd not seen them at an airport before and have never seen them there since.)",1321496703

Each section is a big (i.e. millions of line of code and many engineers) worth of effort. All that said, depending on how systems are built, you can 
a) Create a base system that solves core issues 
b) Accomodate as much configuration towards that system to allow computation to occur differently based on what the employees do
c) Allow customizations of computation when as required
d) Make most of the data that can be changed, to be changeable through design (data driven instead of code)<p>Of course, there will be customers who will want to behave differently because the moon is in a certain position in the system.
