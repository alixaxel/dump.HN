Not only are the allegations insanely hard to believe, night after the 'alledged rape' the 'victim' went to a party with Assange and was seen enjoying herself in his company. Then later she and her best friend (who also had sex with Julian Assange during his visit in Sweden, go figure!) decided to go to the police and press charges. Then the case was dismissed by a chief prosecutor, brought up again by another prosecutor, dismissed and then brought up again, just as if there was some 'pressure' from somewhere to take this to court. After that, swedish high-profile lawyer Claes Borgström suddenly takes the case on behalf of the women. Non-political my ass.<p>What Assange claims to fear, and with our spineless government here in Sweden I can't blame him, is that he will be extradited from Sweden to the US.",1320238720

3186391,comment,3180397,3180397,1,0,CPlatypus,,,"The first thing I did on that page was add ""membase"" to the list.  If one adds the ""couchdb"" and ""membase"" lines, the result almost - no, not quite - keeps up with the MongoDB line.  This is compatible with my first thought that people have had trouble keeping up with Couch's continual changes in name and direction.  Relatedly, Couch* (the company) has often failed to provide a comprehensive solution, requiring users to grab other pieces from other places - e.g. BigCouch from Cloudant or Futon from the Apache project.  Contrast with 10gen/MongoDB: consistent name, consistent direction, single source for the whole solution including client drivers.<p>There are other factors as well.  I've heard some people say that Couch* is a serious memory hog.  Others have complained about dependencies.  The REST interface appeals to some, but others would prefer a more binary-oriented protocol.  The relentless positioning vs. MongoDB, and particularly some of the FUD being slung by Couch* advocates (hi rdtsc) is generating a bit of a backlash as well.  For all I know some of these issues no longer exist, perhaps some never existed, but without a focused effort to deal with these impressions they remain liabilities.  Couch* comes across not only as developer-oriented, but oriented toward a particular kind of developer.<p>Note that none of these factors relate to the technical quality of the two products.  I think Couch's general distribution/replication model is fundamentally a better one than Mongo's, though I think Mongo wins by having real ad-hoc queries instead of requiring the moral equivalent of stored procedures.  I thought little of Mongo's answers regarding durability and replication (and TBH still don't think they're at the level they should be) but I could see that progress was being made and I have enough of a long-term perspective not to get all perma-caremad about it.  In the end, I think Couch* has been held back a bit not by its technology but by all the ""other stuff"" that goes into making a project or company successful.",1320238101
