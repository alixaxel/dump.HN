Whatever get-up we have on, high-heeled shoes certainly add elegance and style; creating an appearance that exudes a touch of playfulness, sexiness and downright confidence.This is why women go for these types of shoes, and with plenty of styles out in the market today; we can have a closet-full of different high heels of various heights, colors, materials and designs; perfect for any outfit or occasion.",1321070360

I actually would love to support musicians and other artists/talented people by doing their Muck Work. One of the problems I've encountered informally is that there are major trust issues! My job requires them to trust me and building that trust is not easy, even in person, since there are so many sleazy MBA fraudsters out there.<p>Fraudsters specialize in getting people to trust them. Honest helpers, however, specialize in helping. I find that the fraudsters are accorded more trust than me, even though I don't have a scammy bone in my body.<p>I find it highly rewarding to help others focus on and develop their talents by moving the furniture out of their way. I actually just love seeing artists express themselves and so that motivates me to do their Muck Work. (great word for it by the way)",1321070085

Hence your life stops being full of unimportant things, as ultimately they're all equally significant (or insignificant).<p>After that, my thinking usually goes the following order: 1) Why do anything at all in such circumstances, life has no point, etc. 2) Wait, I still might as well enjoy the process.<p>For some reason, the latter normally looks superior (if I'm in good shape), so I'm trying to learn to enjoy the process.

They're not exactly the same.<p>Erlang's concurrency is organisational and explicit; the objective is to delimit subcomponents of a system in well established and isolated units, which can then communicate through message passing.

I too was in the enlisted ranks spending 6 1/2 years in the Army in Combat Arms (Scout) and Special Operations (PSYOP) and then was granted early discharge to start fall semester at UNC in 1997.<p>The article does a great job with the mention of accepting diversity.  Understanding ethnocentrism was one of the fundamental teachings from PSYOP and enlightened me in ways like nothing else.<p>Codeslush's words ring true and reflect what I would say regarding another poster's comments about capitalizing on skills.  The Army allowed me to capitalize on life.  My sacrifices were miniscule for what I think I gained with my service.  \nWe are fortunate that military service today in the U.S. is voluntary and as such is a very personal choice that is often misunderstood by many (even friends and family).<p>Be a generalist and open to any opportunity.  If you are good at what you do and are dependable you'll make great connections with all ranks whether their enlisted or officer(commissioned/non-commissioned or warrant).  And if you really excel there will be plenty of opportunities to work directly for (and yes with) O-6s and higher and see an entirely different military. If you're able and willing, the world by way of the military can be simply amazing.<p>I have always been a techie and still remember being playfully bashed for carrying around my Sharp 286 laptop after rotation back to staging at Hohenfels in Germany.  The next hot startup, the successor to Geocities -> Friendster -> Myspace -> Facebook and the next bubble will be waiting for you to provide your date of birth and phone number whenever you're ready.  Social media will still be around and solutions will still need to be solved.  What won't wait for you is your youth and the opportunities that are tied to it.<p>I would choose the same path all over again today if I was 18 (or even 30) and wondering about what life might have in store for me.

Wanting to try it out, I dove in and dropped $200 on an Intuos 4 small. Combined with a Das Ultimate Silent, I have a desktop input system that rivals pretty much anything. Using a stylus for desktop computing lets you move things around with rapid speed and precision since the cursor maps directly to what your arm is doing. Scrolling involves a tiny bit more work (although the Intuos has a scroll wheel that works decently well). Another neat thing is the ability to instantly open MyPaint and jot down notes when I need it. It doesn't hurt that my entire desk is jet black :).<p>Going from a stylus back to a touchpad feels like going from pens to finger paint. Mice feel clunky as well. Try it out!",1321067270
