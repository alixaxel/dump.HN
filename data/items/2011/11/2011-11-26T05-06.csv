3279178,comment,3278943,3278943,8,0,mindslight,,,"Although treasonous to say, I don't think a sexp-based language is appropriate for a wide community of programmers. (I'm currently enjoying coming back to PLT Racket from Clojure, so please don't write me off as someone who can't get over the initial shock.)<p>Macros make it <i>too</i> easy to define new syntax, to the point where things that should be core language features are neglected, only to be continually re-half-implemented, etc. Take a look at what passes for 'good enough' for destructuring in Clojure, both the older let-based and the newer core.match (which still lacks the extensibility of Racket's match). The deficiencies can always be fixed 'later', right?<p>No syntactic difference between function application and special forms means that one requires an editor that can somehow differentiate (slime/drracket approaches) to even have a <i>shot</i> at quickly scanning unfamiliar code (say, quickly looking at what an implementation actually does). It's pointed out that Guile will handle other languages (imho this is tacitly admitting uncertainty about Scheme). But multiple languages only stand to make the code-reading problem even worse! Never mind that Scheme will be the only first-class language (other languages can't consume macros) so alternatives are at best advertisements to get people hooked and having to learn the 'real language'.<p>The little bit of Ruby I've written opened my eyes to how much you can do with just first-class code blocks, and made me understand why something like SLIB would opt for explicit lambdas everywhere instead of macros. Macros are so enticing to cut down on boilerplate, but they're visually indistinguishable, and without plenty of forethought they're not composable.<p>Clearly many skin syntaxes for Lisps have been attempted and never caught on. I don't currently have much to add on that front besides a suggestion of not being afraid of well thought out concrete syntax (how many base special forms are there, really?). But really, I think my whole post shows the main problem with Lisp, at least for me. It's so easy to do things and it's such a blank slate that no matter what I sit down to do, I always end up trying to create a new language.",1322286154

It's somewhat common to ""try before buy"" via piracy and I don't know if I am really opposed to it -- yes, it opens the door to freeloaders, but even in the case of freeloaders you generally get at least free word-of-mouth publicity out of it. Digital piracy comes at no real cost to anyone; you're not taking stock out of the hands of one who bought it wholesale, you're not removing the copy of one who purchased retail, you're not even using the developer's bandwidth. The only adverse effect comes on the pysches of the money-minded MBAs that falsely correlate each download with a lost sale when in fact many are convenience downloads from persons already entitled to a copy of the software or pre-purchase ""trials"".

3279143,comment,3278606,3278606,18,0,idspispopd,,,"Part of the problem is ignoring why consumers download digital content through unofficial channels, and instead call any such download a case piracy. Rather these are holes in the business models of media providers, as such they're only losing money because they're not offering a product that suits the consumer. (Thus falsely claiming that they have lost a sale.)<p>For example a consumer may be downloading the content for the following reasons:<p>- Trialing<p>- Replacing lost/broken content<p>- Replacing content that is outdated VHS/DVD/Bluray/HDDVD/Cassette/Vinyl, you name it.<p>- Countering simulated geographical boundaries<p>- Getting around censorship or getting the uncensored version<p>- The media is simply not available (e.g. special editions, or event recordings.)<p>- Dealing with maligned DRM schemes<p>- Updating to a version of the software which isn't buggy as hell (adobe)<p>- Acquiring media that is no longer in distribution/supported by the author.<p>- Dongle keys are either incompatible, broken or taking up a free port on the computer.<p>In many examples here the consumer was never likely to buy or repurchase content, it's no money lost, and often saving the company needless harassment.<p>Here are reasons why people circumvent paying:<p>- They don't have the money to begin with<p>- The price is unreasonably high (microsoft learned this with office, when will adobe follow)<p>- The content is DRM'd, or locked to a particular system. (e.g. streaming services.)<p>- There is no way to purchase the content legally (regional or otherwise)<p>- The company has a monopoly on a file format or operating system. (many feel if they're forced to use something they shouldn't have to pay for it too.)<p>- The media does not present a value offering (differing to a high price, i.e. software that is known to be buggy, or is purposefully single use.)<p>- Exploitation of consumers (buy our product and we'll spam you forever or require your software to check with our servers every time you use it.)<p>As you can see there is a gamut of reasons why people turn to non-official channels, and the motive is not always greed or theft, often these are replacing other legal methods of acquiring the media.<p>What Steam, the iTunes music/app/book stores, amazon and Google(heck even allofmp3 knew it) have all realised is that removing artificial limitations on digital content allows consumers to buy digital content to satisfy their various requirements before even looking up a torrents site. It's not only easier and less risky (malware/getting sued), but it's usually faster, supported and reasonable.",1322285140

(Compare ""search warrant"", ""arrest warrant"").<p><i>Nobody is being charged with a crime.</i><p>That's not what a warrant is. Warrants are issued on the basis of probable cause. You probably understand this already with regard to search warrants: a prosecutor doesn't have to have filed charges against a person before the police can obtain a search warrant in the course of investigating the crime. The police only need to show that there is cause to conduct the search.<p>But more to the point of people not being charged: I'm not conversant in every relevant detail, but I presume the reason nobody is being charged in these cases is that the owners of these domains are unknown and outside of the US, besides. But again: nobody being charged doesn't mean warrants weren't issued for the seizures. The two are not the same thing.",1322284392

The majority of users are, in my experience anyway, put off by all sorts of things (and often quite unrelated to the merits (or lack of) the language itself). I have also experienced quite a bit of lisp hostility. All of these things add up for me to feel there are better choices as an extension language if you want the <i>average</i>[1] user to write extensions.<p>[1] by average I mean that they have the technical skill to do so, but aren't terribly invested in learning lots of new things.
