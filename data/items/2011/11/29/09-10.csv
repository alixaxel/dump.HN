RIM continues with its strategy of making stylish and slim phones, while maintaining the business features, in a move to attract a wider customer base.",1322560715
3289769,comment,3288671,3289006,3,0,vidarh,,,"It <i>is</i> an issue if there are VC's involved. One of the startups I co-founded and owned 25% on at outset ended up with a whopping 1% of the proceeds of the exit. I'm not bitter - in this case the exit recovered <i>maybe</i> 30% of the cash the VC's injected, after about 8 years - and so the dilution was understandable. But unless you bootstrap, you will increasingly be working to <i>also</i> enrich others, after VC's, options to other employees etc..<p>Exceedingly few VC-funded businesses end up with founders holding on to massive stakes all the way through to an acquisition or IPO. That is the tradeoff you make whenever you take VC money: You hope you accelerate your growth enough to more than offset the piece you give away. That is also why it is often more financially attractive for regular employees to join a VC funded startup: the growth rates are often similarly faster (but you often fail faster too, and more spectacularly; though failing faster is not necessarily a bad thing if you're first going to fail)",1322560699

It's just universally agreed token for how much people want something.<p>If there were no money, people will just invent something new in their place. Like ""talons"" for many rare goods in socialist states. In socialism everybody was paid almost the same, goods were priced according to the state order, but there were not enough goods for everybody (for example cars, but also TVs, houses, almost everything).<p>So there were ""talons"" for cars, which operated like ""more important money"". You worked in factory, you got your pay, you theoreticaly could afford car, but you still needed to have ""talon"" to buy this car. And talons were issued for people that had connections, or was useful to government (for example by spying on neighborns). So there were 2 kinds of money, and the kind that was important was the kind that was rare. People made big unofficial buisnesses on trading talons for other goods etc.<p>The moment the socialism was abolished we had tens of tousands companies created, because people wanted goods, and now money mattered instead of connections and ""talons"". So people started doing things that mattered to other people to earn money, to afford to buy things they wanted. In one month shops changed from having nothing (only very basic goods like bread, vinegar, etc, most food was produced by the only free industry during socialism - individual farmers that sold them on black market), to having everything. That was useful for people, and the reason it changed in so small amount of time was that money are a good way to show people what other people wants.<p>If people really wanted to stop hunger in Africa, we would do this years ago. The reason we didn't is - we don't care. Abolishing moneys will do nothing to address this problem.<p>Also - automation increased for last 200 years. People predicted working day of 3 hours, etc. Instead we work more, to afford more things.",1322559954

3289694,comment,3285811,3286535,2,0,scanr,,,"Yeah, I've been thinking about this and I agree with you. The problem here is the ISP pricing models. As part of their marketing, they create 'uncapped' tariffs based on a business model that says that most users won't download a great deal of data. iPlayer breaks that model but what it should mean is that ISPs re-evaluate their pricing plans rather than creating a tiered internet which has the incentives in all the wrong places.<p>Amusingly, some ISPs do quite well out of iPlayer. Plusnet has a fantastically cheap capped deal (6.95, which I suspect is a loss leader) that users almost immediately exceed by switching on iPlayer.",1322558476
