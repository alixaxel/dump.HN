3209684,comment,3208028,3208694,2,0,Fluxx,,,"Most sites use an HTML page to launch a JS-driven app because HTML as a presentation medium is not as responsive and lack the UX elegance that one can achieve with Javascript.  It's simply a technology stack that works better at solving the job.<p>The main problem is that everyone is reinventing the wheel to deliver that kind of experience with custom JS code that augments the DOM in different ways.  If browsers and the W3C worked out a way to deliver a similar UX over something standardized that browsers, crawlers and other consumers of the web could rely on, that would get used.",1320731917
3209683,comment,3209558,3209583,2,0,codeslush,,,"I disagree with point (1) and only somewhat agree with point (2).<p>For point 1 - I definitely don't like rules, and I have found that if you create enough value, you get away with making your own rules and can come very close to having a feeling of running your own business.<p>For point 2 - in the high tech industry, you can make as much, or more, income without the uncertainty of self employment/own business.  Running a business is HARD.  I tried it, for many years, and ultimately failed (well, I failed financially, but learned a hell of a lot - so not a complete failure).  Perhaps I was in the wrong business, but I simply didn't enjoy the non-technical aspects of it, which consume the majority of your time.  The ROI wasn't there - not for me.  Not every business is going to make you rich - in fact, most of them will not.  I can't say I've given up permanently, but I have gone back to the corporate world for now and do not regret it.  I disagree with the job stability portion of this point - you have ZERO job stability when you work for someone else.  I firmly believe you have more stability working on your own than for a vast majority of companies.  The concept of job security is a false sense of security.",1320731911

3209677,comment,3208422,3209567,1,0,skurry,,,"By market forces I mean supply and demand. And you have correctly noted that these have a secondary role in CEO pay negotiations. Instead, it's a question of power and indifference. Where does this power come from? It stems from the fact that the board with which the future CEO is negotiating consists of inside and outside officers. This means that he is negotiating with future subordinates (inside officers) and executives who might want to become the CEO of a company where this future CEO has a seat on the board. Who would openly try to lower the salary of their future boss, the same person they will have to talk to about their own pay raises? So, the board does not really have an incentive to push for the true market rate of the CEO, unless they are major shareholders, but usually lots of incentives not to do so.<p>> We'd have no need of minimum wage laws because anyone anywhere could turn down a job offer.<p>And right now janitors can't turn down job offers? I don't understand. How does a self-employed janitor have more power? I think you greatly overestimate the advantages of being self-employed, and underestimate the downsides.",1320731585

Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do.  This is the most important lesson of all, that we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives.  It is no exaggeration to say that our entire economy depends upon this lesson being learned.  Think of what would fall apart if kids weren't trained in the dependency lesson: The social-service businesses could hardly survive, including the fast-growing counseling industry; commercial entertainment of all sorts, along with television, would wither if people remembered how to make their own fun; the food services, restaurants and prepared-food warehouses would shrink if people returned to making their own meals rather than depending on strangers to cook for them.  Much of modern law, medicine, and engineering would go, too - the clothing business as well - unless a guaranteed supply of helpless people poured out of our schools each year.  We have built a way of life that depends on people doing what they are told because they don't know any other way.

Which is even harder with scripted pages. But scraping data isn't a solution. The semantic web may try to have web developers bring sense to data on a web page, but the problem remains. It's just a markup patch. It's doesn't define how to act on that data. Web Intents are just another patch to markup to bring verbs.<p>Direct access to the data sources with well define methods to act on that data and interact with it (instead of using form) is what works today through APIs. What doesn't work is that there aren't a lot of open standards APIs. Most well used APIs are proprietary and Facebook's a good example. I believe standard bodies should put their brains and efforts on defining API standards. Some standards APIs some clunky, are in use in B2B in the back ends but there's not much of it on the consumer facing Web. We must move forward to push separation of presentation, data and verbs for the whole Web, one small step at a time.<p>If most use cases on the Web used standard APIs, we would have true separation of content and presentation. We would even have the verbs to exchange/create understandable content. Then, you can use HTML/CSS to adapt a UI to any device with true separation.<p>That's the way we build apps and sites today and with standard, it would pave the way to a more exciting future.<p>So one day, if I want to have my own customized UI for that new holographic/gesture recognition device to shop with my preferred merchants, I just have to build an app and I'll be able to browse their merchandise, sort it like I want and finalize a transaction without even visiting their Web site.",1320730101

In physics, at least, this is very wrong.<p>In fact, fundamental theoretical physics has been more-or-less stagnant since the late 60's when the Standard Model was finished.  <i>But they have to keep handing out Nobel prizes.</i>  So the outcome is predictable: you see prizes being awarded to people who are fleshing out ideas which have been known for a half century; the low-hanging fruit has already been picked, so you have to work for years in the nitty-gritty to push the bounds.  Hence, the prize winners are old.<p>But this doesn't tell us anything about <i>physicists</i> and when they are capable of genius (and how could it?  does anyone really think that human nature has changed?), it tells us about the stagnation of the field.<p>The really interesting question is this: is the stagnation of physics more attributable to (a) some combination of fundamental technological/intellectual limitations or (b) institutional/social pathologies in Academia.

I understand (doing some research) that HN is wary of Ask HN: Review my startup posts from new accounts without any/much activity. For that reason, this post is aimed primarily to generate interest and attendees to check out our talk tomorrow (11/8 at 6pm) in Sunnyvale. Well be speaking about how weve used MongoDB and Node JS at LookupLink. Please come if it sounds interesting! Below is a link and a description to the event details:<p>http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-MongoDB-User-Group/events/36531032/<p>LookupLink provides a platform for individuals to easily access digital content through short tags and QR codes. We hope that one day people wont have to pass up on a car they are interested in buying, an event they'd like to attend, or a person they'd like to contact because they didn't have a convenient way to reference that information.<p>Our stack runs NodeJS and MongoDB and lives on Dotcloud (our awesome PaaS). We are very enthusiastic about the technologies that we use! MongoDB helps us stay agile, by not locking us into a schema, which helps us stay highly available while we continue to develop our product. We are a small team, so remaining flexible is essential to staying afloat. One of our challenges was finding a compromise between being completely schema less, and incorporating some structure. We managed to do so using some Node JS frameworks and our stack has never been happier, speaking only Javascript. Not to mention our developers too.<p>Again, we know that this is being posted from a new account, but if youd like to check out our startup and have any feedback, we would be very grateful to hear it.<p>www.lookuplink.com<p>Essentially yes, we are a QR code provider, but what differentiates us primarily is 1) the convenience of printing formatted flyers with your QR code and short tag (aimed at individuals and small groups wanting to post flyers linking to their content), and 2) our short tags. Short tags are convenient references to more info, something you could easily remember and verbally share with someone (e.g. Lookup A12 on LookupLink for more info). Anticipating a large amount of links being created, our free links provide users with a random short tag which expires after a few weeks (convenient for a craigslist ad, an upcoming event, or your contact info for networking at a convention).<p>Thank you for your time!!\nSteven & Andrew",1320729613
