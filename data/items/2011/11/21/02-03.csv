The National Academy of Science is also not surprised. They issued a report about a year ago examining the forensic sciences in the US and found that many fields do not have enough core research.  My favorite example is blood spatter analysis (think Dexter). This field is completely built around crime scene experience. It's only been within the last decade that some serious research has been undertaken to provide a scientific basis for the opinions offered in court.<p>Now, it's not bad if your particular field has a few areas that are still lacking in basic research. But you have a DUTY to express this in court. For example, in this case, the expert can say that based on his 40 years in the field, this is his opinion, but he should note that there is no scientific support, and he should always declare if there is any disagreement within the community.<p>Forensic science is an amazing field...unfortunately the practitioners tend to mess it up.",1321843653

On the other hand suicide rates are almost close to zero in societies that are very religious and their religion forbids suicide by banning them from a proper burial.<p>A) I have lived in Sweden for some months, and I have some conclusions (just my personal opinion). People while caring for community are more independent than most other nations at a truly  admirable level. They close in to themselves and deal with their own problems, they won't easily bother you with them. If they feel lonely for example they won't pester other people until they become accepted, they are proud and conscious (except when they are drunk). They are like fully autonomous units functioning in a coordinated society. Furthermore they usually don't blame their mistakes on others and because their society functions relatively well they cannot blame the system.<p>So maybe it is a mixture of self-awareness, pride and loneliness.<p>B) If you are fighting for survival, you don't have time to reflect on your problems. Everyday issues occupy your thinking time. Imho it is dangerous to prescribe inequality as a remedy for suicides, the goal (from a social standpoint) is to reduce despair not suicides. A U.S. citizen cannot afford to suicide and leave the rest of his family to a living hell, a Swede can.<p>C) The green box at the end gives another excellent point there are no miserable beings to look down to and feel better.<p>D) Something that is wrong in the article is about the research on the baboons.

But technology decisions often have subtle, far-reaching implications. So when managers make decisions they shouldn't (e.g., picking a toolset, or outsourcing a project, or simultaneously fixing resources, scope and schedule), they end up thoroughly screwing the developers involved. But if none of the other managers understand the tech either, then managers can happily blame the devs. Hands up everybody who has seen that?<p>Software is almost unique, in that it's a collective intellectual work that is expected to function and grow and change over many years.

Likewise, I had to learn various intricacies of divorce laws to pass the NY bar something I hope never to care about again.<p>Since getting my J.D., I've practiced law in some global law firms, and I've even taught practical contract negotiations at a law school here in NYC.  Every time I teach that class, a few students tell me it's the most useful thing they've learned in law school.<p>(Keep in mind that I basically negotiate contracts for a living.  If you're in antitrust, bankruptcy, etc., your law school usefulness mileage may vary.
