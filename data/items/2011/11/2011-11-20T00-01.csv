I started to play on launch day, but then stopped after only a couple hours.<p>Why would I stop playing one of the best games released in a long time? I realized that I wanted, for the first time, to get into the nitty-gritty of alchemy, crafting, and other things in the game. At first I tried to make a handwritten log of people, places, and ingredients, but that broke down very quickly. The game is so huge, that it's just not a practical way to approach the problem.<p>So, I spent the last week building rpglogger.com - it's basically a way to log your progress in a sort of ""build your own strategy guide"" sense. You create a 'log book' where you can add/edit/delete 'sections' in the book (e.g. NPCs, quests, items, locations, whatever you want), and define your own integer/text/string/boolean attributes on those sections. For example, if you want to track ingredients, you can add a 'string' field for the name of the ingredient, and 4 string fields, one for each of the effects it has in alchemy. That's just one example.<p>So, why didn't I just buy the strategy guide, or use GameFAQs.com? I don't like those approaches for games like this, because I feel it ruins the discovery elements by giving you all the answers. I needed a middle ground between handwritten notes and having all the answers.<p>So, there it is. One gaming geek's story. Right now Facebook login is supported. I plan on adding Twitter, and OpenID providers pretty soon. Right now you can add as many people/places/things as you want. Soon I'll be adding a realtime text search/filter box to quickly find objects, in addition to tagging support. I also built it specifically with the idea that I'd be running it in full-screen mode on my laptop, in the browser, while playing.

Basically, there are two types cultures related to development teams.<p>Culture A, treats the software as their business and respect it as much as they do their customers, employees and partners.
In an ""A"" department developers are empowered to take ownership over the code. This means that they feel obliged to refactor 
code and improve comments, documentation, and tests as a part of of whatever change they are delivering.<p>It is understood that bugs can come from this but that the overall benefit of not ending up with an unmaintainable system 
is worth the cost of an accidental bug from time-to-time.<p>Culture B, treats the software as a necessary evil or at best a commodity. Developers are instructed to perform the least amount
of changes to meet the changing business requirements. These department are almost always in crises mode as the inflexibility of there
bubblegum patchwork has put them into a reactionary relationship with the team who is driving the requirements.<p>In ""B"" departments you often see high turnover by the best engineers since they feel something is wrong with the departmental management strategy.<p>The high turnover in turn leads to less knowledge about the most complex components in the system and even more reluctance from the management 
and engineers to risk refactoring something that no one completely understands.<p>I've noticed the ""B"" shops are always looking for a new silver bullet, the new servers to be able to run the integration tests in under 48
hours since the code is not unit testable or changing frameworks every two years in hopes it will lead to a more flexible system.<p>Unfortunately, in my experience, the ""B"" companies tend to pay the highest salaries.",1321749099
