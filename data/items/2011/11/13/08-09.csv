They might be a little bit too bent on saving Framany's banks - however if these banks drop then Framany drops. If that happens Eurozone has no steering wheel and no engine to get anywhere.<p>So in fact it is essential that in eurozone:<p>1. Germany and France be saved from the worst.\n2. Germany and France beat the other juvenile countries into fiscal submission.\n3. The new ""germanized"" europe lifts itself out of ash.<p>Whatever people think, the whole point of eurozone is ""germanization"" of Europe. It's not as some people state that Germany is trying to occupy the Europe. The fact is that Europe wants to occupy Germany. Thats the whole point, the whole Europe and its citizenry would like to live in Germany.<p>And Germans know full well what they're doing - I'd even dare to say that they know what they're doing even better than 'mericans. Don't forget that Germany annexed DDR 20 years ago and that DDR was in much worse shape than any of PIIGS. Alo Angela Merkl along with many people in charge, grew up in DDR.",1321174525

What you write seems rather xenophobic besides being somewhat economically illiterate. From a strict economic point of view, there is no surplus of jobs. The price of labour should rise until the demand for labour abates; and the German workers would be better off. To the degree that that isn't happening (though Germany's population overall is decreasing, not increasing), it is because Germany has an open economy with free movement of labour. If you're attacking that, you're attacking the whole foundation of the EU, and I don't want much more to do with you.)",1321171217
