Although there's something to do with streaming he was involved with and I don't know much about that.  What's the story behind that?<p>PACER I do know about, first hand.  It is a low cost _public service_ that has historically operated at a surplus.  I'm sure the goverment _wants_ the public to have better access to this information.  This information is going to be free; it's inevitable.  It just might take some time.<p>But I read that Swartz went into a _federal court_ library and installed some stealth software; maybe it was just a simple script, doesn't matter.  If that's true, that is just a really DUMB thing to do, no matter how noble the objective.  Is that really the only place he could do the downloads?<p>And as for this MIT incident, the facts speak for themselves.  Most people have no idea what Python is.  They have no idea how fast an http server can respond to requests.  They don't understand the difference between open and closed data formats, or data that's easy to access versus data they have to click 25 times to get to.  All they see is a kid sneaking around.<p>Whether the charges he's facing are commensurate with the damage he's caused is another question.  But he does need to show more respect for existing systems no matter how slow to change they may be (even if he has to pretend).<p>He's definitely pushed the issue alright.  I just hope for his sake and everyone else who knows their way around computers he hasn't pushed a little too far, too soon.<p>If his methods are deliberately extreme, if he meant to do things this way, then he's either got some huge cajonas and unparalleled advisors behind him, or he's just young and stupid.<p>Though I don't agree with the methods, I hope it's the former.",1321588757

I was thinking more of making yourself the fall guy for things you didn't cause <i>and</i> cannot fix. I didn't know how to express exactly why, but scott_s summarizes part of my feelings on the matter quite well.<p>The rest of my thoughts on the matter center around the sense I get that, in continually taking responsibility (blame) for things <i>outside your ability to influence</i>, you will basically form a habit of it, which will lead you down a dark road of learned helplessness, omega behavior, and never being able to please your clients because everything bad that happens is ""your"" fault. If you think about it, if you form a habit of it and it begins to internalize, you are basically developing something similar to Imposter Syndrome.<p>Personally, when something is my fault I try to own it. When something is <i>not</i>, and is outside my sphere of influence, I try to skip past the issue of ""fault"" by briefly explaining the cause (in an attempt to show it was not incompetence on my part, while doing my best to avoid ""pointing fingers"") and focus on resolution.<p>Simple example: Coworker erases your work from centralized revision control (history and all), causing you to miss a deadline. Do you declare, ""There was a glitch in revision control, it is my fault for trusting it"" or do you state the facts and try to move on? The former certainly appears to be noble, but to me it appears to be the tragic hero sort of noble.<p>(I will add that I am very conflicted in writing this. I am saying to myself, ""You cold heartless bastard!"". I would, and do, cover for other people sometimes, but fundamentally I do believe in the untenable nature of regularly making yourself the scapegoat.)",1321588399

It is not clear from your wording if you are seeing a tax attorney to handle your business or personal finances, or both. md1515 is correct, there are specialized use cases for an LP for personal finance, unless you start to get into asset protection type or capital gains treatment schemes. I have some friends whose wealth is in the 1x-3x range of what you posted. One is in the energy business; he lets Brown Brothers Harriman handle a large portion of his assets. Another co-founded one of the top HFT firms in the nation; he's diversifying into various more conventional investments. The third was a principal programmer in that HFT firm from its early days; he self-manages and is doing some angel investing.<p>As you can tell, there is no one ""right"" answer. A lot depends upon your life goals and risk profile. The first friend is nurturing a generations-old wealth. The second is trying to propagate generational wealth. The third is trying to establish generational wealth. If none of your financial advisors have asked you to set down on paper what you want to do in life and how much it will take to fund that ambition, then you might want to center yourself and put that down to draw a starting line in the sand. From there, you can talk to them about how much volatility you can stomach, how much needs to be drawn and when, <i>etc.</i><p>It cannot hurt to get second and third opinion advice this early on your tax implications <i>before</i> the sale closes. Bob Hope was famous for deferring a lot of his pay into capital gains forms once he made enough to live on, and this greatly magnified his earnings over the years. If there is a portion of your sale that you are willing to put into that form, then now is the time to talk with your tax advisors about it before a more adverse tax treatment is taken upon your sale income.<p>If you feel at all uncomfortable with the advice you are receiving (<i>including and especially mine!</i>), then one <i>option</i> is to take the uncomplicated tax treatment hit now and sit on the gains until you are more comfortable with a specific set of actions. There are far worse situations to be in than paying a large tax bill now and parking the remainder into [CDARS](<a href=""http://www.cdars.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdars.com</a>), then taking whatever time you feel is necessary to gather your data and thoughts before you pull the trigger on structuring the gains. As my CPA tells me, some of the biggest tax payments he oversees each year are from clients who are too busy making money to complicate their lives further with tax efficient structuring. The interest alone on say, $10M (after taxes and fees) in CDARS, is around $100K, which should be sufficient for you to step back, take a deep breath for a year, and figure out where you want to go next. Even taking into account the ""opportunity costs"" of a naive tax treatment, that is really cheap insurance against hastily making a catastrophically bad decision in the heat of the win.<p>You can also contact pg, he certainly can give you advice programmer-to-programmer.",1321587422

3250474,comment,3246092,3250098,1,0,m-photonic,,,"I don't deny that past eras took their hidden psychological tolls as well -- for example, ""the problem that has no name"" that Betty Friedan wrote about. However, the fact that women's self-reported happiness levels have declined considerably between then and now seems to indicate that our own time may be worse for them in the aggregate. I also question the assumption that all those extra marriages ensured by the non-acceptance of divorce were necessarily unhappy. I've never heard anything about domestic violence or infidelity being more common back then (unlike, say, prostitution, which has experienced a precipitous decline due to the easy availability of casual sex).<p>Whether or not the old order is unworkable today depends on what you mean by the old order. The culturally-enforced economic dependence of women on men probably would be unworkable, but that's not what I'm arguing for. I just think that people would be <i>happier</i> in a society more oriented towards family formation than our current one. We do have some control over things like this, and part of that control comes in the form of the values we choose to teach to our children -- which, as you may recall, is what this thread's original comment was about.<p>I'm not saying that the past was better than the present or that I'd like to return to it. I do think that we should stop seeing the past as irredeemably tainted by its oppression of women and minorities (or whatever) and assuming that it has nothing to teach us. All I'm doing is criticizing our present time and its prevailing values.",1321587257

Sometimes I hold my finger on a word and a whole line of text is highlighted and thus I can't look up the definition.<p>Browsing my queue on Netflix is a pain and searching for movies on Prime isn't great either.<p>Overall, I rate the device 2 stars out of 5.  I wish I had not bought it.  Wait for version 3!",1321585317

The KF price is just 40% of the iPad price, and while the iPad has certainly raised expectations, it's unfair to expect a $199 tablet to perform at the same level of the iPad.<p>Marco has his mind made up on the Android, and though I'm not an Android fan (some would call me an Apple fanboy), I don't think he is giving this device a fair shot.",1321585265
