Voting to please your party instead of your citizens gets you full party support, and as far as beating the other guy, it has been shown that campaign funding has an unsettlingly strong correlation to campaign victories.<p>Making matters worse, voters tend to want conflicting things. For example, in general they want more government programs and also lower taxes.<p>Making matters even more difficult, what voters say they want and what they actually want can be different stories. Schwarzenegger got elected on the premise that he was going to do certain things. He tried to do those things. He was shut down by everyone- including directly by the voters.",1321599579

In 2000 most people were downloading base64-encoded porn from newsgroups or JPGs from modem-based BBSes that hosted multiple adult CDs.

3250853,comment,3249342,3249342,17,0,pak,,,"""...a certainty of three sigma, so theres about one chance in 100 the result is a fluke.""<p>This is a very incorrect way of summarizing the result.<p>When will popsci writers ever get this right?  Hypothesis testing <i>cannot</i> tell you the probability that a hypothesis is true.  It also cannot tell you if the result is a ""fluke.""  What it <i>can</i> tell you is the probability of seeing the data assuming the null hypothesis is true.  Without knowledge of the prior probability of the hypothesis, you have no right to say anything about the probability of the result being a ""fluke"" or not.<p>This is commonly misunderstood.  Perhaps I can illuminate it with an example.<p>Suppose I take a coin out of your pocket--a good old American quarter.  I then proceed to flip it six times and egads, I get six heads.  The chance that a fair coin flips the same way six times in a row is 2/(2^6), or 1/32--close to 3%.  Whoo hoo, that's more than a two sigma result.<p>Does that mean there's only a 3% chance the coin is actually fair?  NO!  If you <i>assume</i> the coin is fair, there is a 3% chance the coin flips the same way six times in a row.  There's a huge distinction in flipping the conditional.  Going by the infinitesimal number of quarters in circulation that wouldn't flip fairly, we'd say before any experiment that there's an overwhelming chance the coin is truly fair.  So there isn't a 3% chance the result ""is a fluke,"" if by ""is a fluke"" we mean the coin really is fair AND the coin flipped in a surprising way.  We KNOW the coin flipped in a surprising way, and if we know that at least 99% of quarters are fair, there's probably a near-100% chance that the data can be called a ""fluke.""<p>This is all to say, if the prior probability of your null hypothesis is high, one unlikely result should not impress.  You are merely demonstrating that unlikely things happen--and with so many coins and people flipping them they <i>should</i> be, from time to time.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value#Misunderstandings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value#Misunderstandings</a><p><a href=""http://invasiber.org/EGarcia/papers/MatthewsFinancialTimes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://invasiber.org/EGarcia/papers/MatthewsFinancialTimes.h...</a><p>tldr; what the article says --> P(Fluke|Data) != P(Data|Fluke) <-- what the statistic means",1321598207

3250774,comment,3250335,3250335,1,0,codeslush,,,"I started my professional career in QA, then ""downgraded"" to a support role in a different company because (a) it was a mile from my house instead of a 2hr commute each way every day and (b) it actually paid more!  Now for the interesting part:  In support, you have an opportunity to SHOW and CREATE tremendous value!  Value drives recognition.  Value drives increases in salary.  Value drives opportunity - within or outside your current employer.<p>Let me back up my assertions:<p>I worked for a large software company that had acquired a smaller niche company.  Niche company had some bugs that caused some problems for its customers.<p>I helped said customers resolve those issues.  Those customers wrote really nice letters and sent them to my employer.  Regularly.  It was actually a little embarrassing after a while.  It's almost as though I was asking for them, and I wasn't.  It just wasn't ""normal"" -- enter ""Wonder Boy"" nickname.  That's all good - I got raises and recognition.<p>Next, I developed a utility to help correct this problem.  I didn't actually understand much about programming, and it was a fairly complicated issue for me to solve.  Had to do with bitwise operators and all that good stuff.  I sought out answers to an equation I wasn't smart enough to solve, but for a problem I knew existed.  Once I had the bits (funny, huh?) of info I needed, I wrote a very simple program/utility to save companies from experiencing this problem.  Guess what happened then?  Development manager tried to recruit me (lucky for him, I didn't accept).<p>Then...I started working closer and closer with partners.  I was becoming somewhat of a subject matter expert.  I then get invited to present in partner training.  So I go do this.  What do you know?  Sales Consulting people see me and say - Wow - this guy is confident, knows his stuff, and can communicate to an audience.  Now, I get recruited to sales consulting.  Sweet - that works!  Not smart enough to figure out complicated bit shifts, but smart enough to solve real world problems and communicate those solutions to high level business people and lower level techies.  That works.<p>Create value!  Have passion.  Seek solutions to problems to problems that only you have visibility to!  You are in a unique position - you are the front-line!  You are seeing things that escape everyone else.  Use it as an opportunity to make people happy.  You make them happy and you solve your own situation.  You will have customers trying to recruit you when you solve major problems.  You'll have internal people fighting for you.  You'll have your HR department spinning their heads not knowing what to do when your boss is trying to give you a raise out of cycle, and two or more people from other departments in the same company are asking them for salary advice when trying to negotiate your role in their department.<p>Hope this helps!

3250770,comment,3249965,3249965,3,0,dmarble,,,"Summary<p>Some ideas to create new growth businesses:<p>(1) Go after the least profitable / bottom of someone else's product lines. Examples include specialty steel mini-mills starting with re-bar and moving up to finer steel products, and car makers that start by undercutting the bottom of the market (Toyota started with the Corona in the 60s, Korean car companies more recently, Chinese and Indian possibly next).<p>(2) Compete against non-consumption. Instead of focusing on existing customer bases, make something that opens up new possibilities for non-consumers. Make something simpler, more affordable. The Sony transistor radio was pretty bad, but it was cheap and infinitely better than nothing. This is where most job growth in America has come from, and where we should focus more.<p>Technology centralization is followed by de-centralization. Mainframe -> smartphone. Health care is still awaiting a lot of decentralization. It can become affordable by developing and marketing technology to allow low cost venues and low cost providers to do more sophisticated things. America's future depends on this.<p>(3) Understand jobs people need to accomplish, not just the customer's needs. ""The customer rarely buys what the company thinks it is selling him"" (Peter Drucker). Create an experience surrounding a product that helps get a job done. Products are easy to copy, but ""integration around a job creates defensible differentiation.""<p>Regarding outsourcing: ""Outsourcing often sets in motion disruptive business model liquidation."" AsusTek disrupted Dell. They started with circuit boards for Dell, moved to motherboards for Dell (Dell revenues unaffected, components moved off the books, profitability improved), moved to doing product assembly (Dell and Asus profits went up), moved to supply chain & logistics, moved to product design (Dell and Asus profits went up), moved to branding by selling their own. Same thing is happening in IT (TCS, Infosys, Wipro), auto companies (tier one suppliers), petroleum (Halliburton, Schlumberger), pharmas (CROs), and (with laughter) wall street analysts outsourcing their brains to Bloomberg.<p>Profitability is too often looked at as a percentage, for which many companies focus on shorter and shorter immediate wins. We focus a lot on IRR (internal rate of return), RONA (return on net assets - the fewer the assets, the higher the RONA!). In semiconductors, Intel is the only big American company that makes their own products. The rest are fab-less, which we think is a badge of honor because of some ratios and risk factors. Personal anecdote: Morris Chang, Chairman of TSMC noted to me that banks don't accept ratios as a deposit; and that he measures their profitability by, oh, TONS OF MONEY (laughter). RONA only works as a measurement if cash is a scarce resource. We need more concentration on innovations that actually grow our economy.<p>If you're wondering about his occasional slurring and use of the wrong word, he had a stroke not too long ago and had to re-learn a ton of vocabulary. Sometimes the right word just isn't there when his mind goes to find it!<p>There was an article on his life, work, and the past three years of hard-hitting health issues (cancer, a heart attack, and a stroke) in Forbes earlier this year. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0314/features-clayton-christensen-health-care-cancer-survivor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0314/features-clayton-chri...</a><p>For such a brilliant contributor to the world, he's as genuine and kind as anyone I've met.",1321596194

Monitoring is what found a similarly subtle bug at my past job once.<p>In the later afternoon a marketing guy on the traffic team came over and told me there was a problem with our trial signups. They'd dropped ~7% today for no apparently reason. We looked at the charts and today, for most of the day, compared to many other days and the past week there was indeed a dip. There were no changes to their marketing campaign or traffic levels either so they concluded it was a software bug.<p>But we hadn't pushed any new code that day. All that got pushed was some css changes from a designer so I concluded that it couldn't be a dev problem. I started looking from an ops perspective but couldn't find anything abnormal there either. There weren't a lot of memcached evictions, the db was doing fine, server loads were normal, etc.<p>I spent easily a couple of hours trying to find the source of the problem when marketing found it for me. Someone else was going through the metrics and noticed that we had the same trial signup rates for firefox, chrome and mobile browsers, it was only ie that had dropped. When filtered by ie and broken down by browser version he noticed that IE9, IE8 and IE7 were all the same as other days but IE6 had a 0%.<p>When you signed up to our site you signed up as a free member but were immediately offered a 5 day trial for a premium account and we had enough volume that the signup rates were predicatable and didn't vary much. When I created an account with IE6 it put me directly into the home page without showing me the trial offer page first.<p>Turns out the problem was indeed from the stylesheet change. The designer had not only changed a couple of buttons, he'd also added a font-face declaration. This font-face was not yet used anywhere and the font itself hadn't been uploaded to assets in production. What happened was IE6 would try to download the font-face and, when logged into our site we don't output 404 for pages that don't exist we redirect to the home page. So IE6 would get the redirect inside a stylesheet and follow that redirect in the browser. All the later IEs and other browsers simply ignored the redirect.<p>It was a very strange bug that would've resolved itself on its own the next day when the designer actually used and uploaded the font but it sure gave me a lot of head scratching and I never would've found it without the analytics.",1321596004
