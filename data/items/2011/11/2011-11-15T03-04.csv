As of today there is not a single phone on the market that runs Android 4.0. Besides, open-source does not mean open-development. They have every right to release the code to whomever they want, whenever they want. And because they release the source to most (as of now, 3/4) major releases, that absolutely counts as ""open source.""",1321329467

I <i>very</i> frequently find myself drawing on knowledge that I ran across during internet time-wasting, whether it was a relevant article I found on HN, or a Wikipedia article I found in one of those random-walk-through-link sessions (or the journal articles I found via the Wikipedia articles...). On the other hand, I also spend a lot of time ""keeping up with the internet"", so it's not free. But it's certainly shown up in papers I've published in my day job.<p>It's an interesting tradeoff; I'd say I'm less concentrated and diligent than most of my colleagues on what I'm ""supposed to be doing"", but I'm also more broadly aware of what's going on outside of our little academic bubble.

It's only loud when running full speed; which is rare enough. And that's not louder than the Mac.<p>Trackpad: it's in.. the regular spot.<p>Software: it's loaded with Sony stuff mostly. You can remove or reinstall if you dislike it.<p>Key travel: yes, it's shorter. No I don't see the issue with it, after having used it for quite a long while now. I switch to longer key travel keyboards and back to the Z21 without noticing.<p>The rest is just ""look, my iMac design didn't change in 4 years it's awesome, changing design sucks!"".<p>Now... let's see what the Z21 has and the others.. just plain don't.<p>SSD: Hello raid0 SATA3 SSDs. Have you ever reached more than 500mbyte/s read/write? Heck, sometimes its going near the 1000mbyte/s sequential. Copying stuff, reading has never been faster.

How the hell are others not all anti-glare by default ?<p>CPU: Hello regular voltage i7 2620M. The air CPU suddenly look.. you know.. just not in the same range.<p>Heat: what heat? It's extremely well extracted on the side and the rest of the system is at room temperature. Even under extreme load. A problem Apple didn't really solve by the way.<p>Connectivity: USB? check. USB3? check. VGA out for those conferences? Check. HDMI out /w audio? Check. Audio jack, ethernet, sdcard, lightpeak? check check check check. Tell me when the mac book air doesn't need a bunch of adapters to do more than USB.
higher power USB for charging? Heck, check again.<p>Weight? Lighter than the Macbook air says enough.<p>Battery life? Extensible well above 10H via a laptop-wide sheet. Smart. Paris-New York, no need to charge. Of course, the standard battery isn't a let down either at ~5H real time use. (they're both rated 7h and 14h max as far as I can remember, but don't quote me on that)<p>Now with all that, what more could there be?
Oh wait.. I mentioned a lightpeak port didn't I.. so yeah, a 600gr+ device can be added to the desk while you're not on the move.. bundling a very decent ATI graphic card, a bluray drive, and more ports.

Derivatives is leverage big time, it's speculation, not investing, you can lose much more than you invested.
Diversify and avoiding leverage as a VC would be to invest a relatively small amount
of money over many potential companies.
So can avoiding leverage to conserve your investments work the same way with time?
Leverage as a small company might be like sub'ing out your work to others. I've never read anything positive with that approach.
How about at the personal level of the article - 
some wasteful activities can be avoided but stuff like email is not going away.
So leverage this down time by multitasking. It would take me 4 hours of planning for 2 hour of programming.
While I wade thought these emails I am also going to think about, plan, research, and write down what my 2 hours of programming is going to be.

The unofficial mobile browsers have great JavaScript too.  Consoles have decent browsers with decent JavaScript, and in any case not all sites need to expect console browsers as a remotely common case.<p>You have to draw the line somewhere, and not all sites need to support Lynx, Links, or Mosaic.  I certainly agree that having decent fallbacks <i>for a site like this</i> doesn't require that much effort, but not all functionality supports graceful degradation.<p>These days, browsing without JavaScript seems less likely to indicate an older browser, and more likely to indicate a user with JavaScript intentionally disabled using something like NoScript.  That user may get righteously offended that a document would dare to run <i>code</i> on their system, but that doesn't necessarily make them right.<p>All web features tend to follow a three-step lifecycle: too new to use at all except for demos, stable enough to use with fallbacks for older browsers, universal enough to use without fallbacks.
