3256985,comment,3256317,3256317,3,0,kleiba,,,"I think there's a parallel to hacking though. On our weekend projects, our babies, our github projects we're most proud of, we like to make sure that we get it right: clean code, beautiful abstractions, efficient implementation, etc -- because we, as hackers, get a kick out of that. We have a gut feeling what is the <i>right</i> way to write a certain program. Like a painter knows where to draw the next line.<p>...but does that mean that we do the same in our day to day jobs? The code that you have to fire out to meet next Friday's deadline? The program that will make it into the next product that needs to hit the market <i>now</i>? I'd bet almost all of us know the feeling of, ""ah, if only I had a little more time, I know exactly how to code this the way it should be"". But this is business so (a) the time you need just isn't there and (b) what the heck, you don't care as much about the accounting app your company sells anyway.<p>So, yes, I'm sure that ebook publishers aren't idiots. And they know that ebooks can be done differently from printed books. But they are businessmen, too, and so the question is always: will doing these changes give them more profit? That is, will the additional costs of e.g. moving the glossy-paper pictures from a central position directly to the parts of the books that refer to them result in more sales? Or sales at a higher price?<p>I figure if the answer were <i>yes</i>, the publishers would do it. But as long as they get away with sloppy editing and one-to-one copies of paper prints, why would they?<p>The additional costs are not material costs, but that people have to sit down and make these edits. And that's not just one guy spending half a day to do that.",1321754184
3256984,comment,3256582,3256947,11,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""And with that in mind, maybe games are already doing this.""</i><p>They are. I'm playing the new Assassin's Creed right now, and as you explore the city of Constantinople you'll run into landmarks and people, each of whom have an in-game encyclopedia entry that you can quick-key into. It doesn't have <i>anything</i> to do with gameplay, and is merely there to satisfy your curiosity. The dialogue and story also make an attempt to communicate the political and economic intrigue of the era.<p>That and it takes place in a specific period of history that also touches on many famous people in that era, albeit fictionally. I have to say, every time I play an AC game I end up reading Wikipedia about the real-life people, places, and history that it depicts, because it's just so damned interesting.<p>I can't be the only one. But it certainly beats most ""educational"" games that smack you over the head. ""Now, who can tell me when the Byzantine Empire fell?""",1321754157

3256930,comment,3254691,3256431,1,0,Mz,,,"During a very difficult time in my life, a friend of mine would interrupt my pity parties by listing some of the good things in my life (or insisting that I do so) and then telling me ""now smile"" and telling me what a lovely smile I had.  It did me a lot of good in terms of both helping me get through a very difficult time in my life and also breaking a bad habit/preventing me from getting mired in something bad.<p>My oldest son used to do stuff like this as a child -- get wrapped around the axle about what a bad child he was because I crabbed at him for not doing his chores or something.  He was maybe 14 when we were in the car one day and heard a news blurb about a teenager (14 to 16 years old) being tried as an adult for murder in a bank robbery case.  I turned to him and said ""Killed anyone here lately?  Robbed any banks?  How bad are you really?""  And then talked about, yeah, I really need you to do your chores and I will crab at you when they don't get done because it's actually important to our quality of life, but if your mom bitching at you about not taking out the trash is your biggest problem, then life is really not that bad.  This incident was a watershed moment and he never went back to being so very prone to wallowing in self pity and giving himself such a hard time.<p>So it is possible to do this for someone else even if they don't want to do it for themselves.  You have to be gentle and have good timing and not wear out your welcome (ie don't simply sound like a nag, which is not a positive experience).  But judicious use of such interventions can make a permanent positive difference.<p>Best of luck, whatever the answer turns out to be.",1321752406

Schedules tend to arbitrarily restrict creativity and learning.<p>This means that courses should be designed around the concept of incrementally building something useful.<p>A ""subject"" would not be broken down into one specific topic area, but rather, would encompass a small project such as:<p>1. develop a library that performs rudimentary speech-to-text translation and then create a plugin for {selected open source software} that makes use of this library<p>2. build a geospatial database that stores OpenStreetMap data and then create a rudimentary website that {highlights areas that are not within a 3km diameter of a police station, etc}<p>3. analyse the implementation of cryptography in {selected open source software} against many avenues of attack, particularly side-channel attacks, entropy of random data sources, etc and prepare patches that solve the problems found<p>In the above examples, mostly-complete plugins or websites could be provided to students so they can focus on more important parts of each problem.<p>I feel this would work because each small project:<p>1. allows a great deal of creativity from students<p>2. encourages students to extend themselves throughout and _after_ the small course has been completed<p>3. doesn't force students to move on too early<p>4. demonstrates how to _apply_ knowledge they've gained<p>5. rewards students with something more than a number/grade as they progress<p>6. encourages entrepreneurship<p>n. ...<p>Many of these points are built into Kahn Academy by design. This is why the theory is well suited to Kahn Academy where you can map out skills and ensure you've ticked off dependencies before moving on. Their new grading system (a learning algorithm) helps students move on _when they're ready_, not at some arbitrarily defined point of time.<p>A course would therefore start by introducing the project, providing a demonstration of the expected outcomes and seeding some ideas for how the project could be extended and applied to unsolved problems.<p>Links to Kahn Academy would provide succinct theoretical background. Course material would apply that knowledge and demonstrate how it is used to do something useful to assist with completing the project.<p>Hopefully this form of education builds a desire to learn. Schedules and grading become irrelevant when students are having fun and making progress on interesting problems. Students will prioritise the project over other things in their life that they'd otherwise procrastinate with. The added benefit to society is increased levels of research and development, entrepreneurship and decreased education costs.",1321752168

I wear sunglasses in my profile picture, and I love a bunch of awesome technologies people have created in recent years.<p>The assumptions you make about popped collar programmers are ridiculous. Yes we pick out cool t-shirts and wear huge rubber watches. We don't wear fedoras, that makes no sense at all. But spending money on our appearance because we actually feel good about ourselves has nothing to do with our commitment to robust software as you so childishly remark.<p>Ofcourse feeling good about yourself and having fun using new technologies is something you must not do as a programmer. God forbid you actually use a technology that's brings you out of your comfort zone.<p>Have fun nailing the nails to your NIH-syndrome coffin with your Microsoft branded hammer. You make it seem like these popped collar programmers get hyped for no good reason about some technology and then use it for the rest of their lives for every problem they encounter, but this is where we differ from you. You see while you think it's pragmatic to use the technology you already randomly acquired for everything you see (like it's a good idea to build a blog engine in friggin' .net), these brogrammers actually work on accumulating a diverse toolset from a plethora of sources other programmers are passionate about.<p>While you are busy vomiting over some guys 'Hadoop + Riak + Redis + Clojure-powered blog platform' that same guy has attained the skill and knowledge to build robust scalable websites. And he will be able to host it on open platforms and leverage the knowledge of passionate user communities. I bet he'll do it in the time it takes you to boot up a single Azure instance too.<p>I'll tell anyone. Be that guy. Be. That. Guy. The guy who has fun, the guy who loves his technologies, loves learning new stuff and doesn't give a rats ass if his blog that has 2 monthly visitors runs inefficiently because he had a blast developing it and felt totally awesome when he told his buddies and they thought it was cool too.<p>Oh, and you look totally rad in that picture with the sunglasses, the moustache and the big watch so good for you.<p>p.s.: I develop in Ruby (on Rails) and Javascript (on Node) for a living.

Is one going to go from autism to a deeper understanding of human motivations by playing Skyrim? No. It isn't anywhere near rich enough to do that, and it isn't because we wouldn't like to have characters in a game that rich, it's because we really don't know how to make them. It's all skin deep. Pretty much everything is.<p>Since my thesis is that we don't know how to make highly developed interactive environments that one can learn from, I am at a loss as to why you think I'm going to come up with an example of one.<p>We've invested an enormous amount of money into making things look good. There's nothing wrong with that. But we have, as a consequence, the ability to make something that looks almost photorealistic and <i>looks</i> like the real world, where in fact it's just a glorified toy, and it fools people into thinking we have a lot more power to create games than we actually do. At best we can manage tinkertoys or legos, as in the Civilization or SimCity examples I gave. But how would we build a game to teach History <i>qua</i> teaching History? To actually teach it and not merely allude to it, or merely wrap the game up in the stylistic ambiance? Or merely be a glorified flash-card simulator? Beats me, and I've been pondering the question and watching everybody else's attempts to answer the question for a long time. I don't see any evidence anyone has anything like an implementable idea at our current level of technology.",1321752042

The reason for this is that it has great discoverability: Click on the little pencil and start drawing. Nothing to know, nothing to remember, just start using the program. This, of course is also it's biggest drawback - as the complexity and possibilities of a program increase it becomes increasingly difficult to create a simple GUI.<p>If you move up to something like photoshop you start to reach the limit of what a graphical user interface can deliver. It's hard for a beginner to just sit down and start. There are masks, layers, palettes, and all sorts of other things to master before you can really use the program the way it's meant to. There's still discoverability - you can actually learn photoshop without a manual, just by clicking around. But it comes at a cost: A lot of options are hidden behind two, three or sometimes four mouseclicks. So you have a program that's hard for a beginner, but not streamlined enough for an expert.<p>Emacs is at the other end of the scale. It has basically ditched the crutches that are the graphical user interface, which makes it a great program for experienced users that know exactly what they want to do and how to do it. But it has no discoverability. If you don't know how to perform an action emacs won't give you any clues(1), and it won't tell you what it can or can't do. An often heard remark in regards to emacs is <i>""Wow I didn't even know you could do that</i>"".<p>(1) Yes I know there are MAN pages, manuals, etc. but they don't count.

Antiquated API design by the W3C (which by the way had no reference implementation) shouldn't be the defining factor in how a language works. 'this' and 'new' were brought over to JS so people who were familiar with Java would 'get it'. JS was designed around different ideas before it was mutilated for the sake of superficial familiarity.<p>> If you have to look up ""what is this set to in this callback"" constantly, then you just need to learn the API/language.<p>I assert that good API design requires you to not have to look up things like this. Things that could be unambiguous. Usage of 'this' introduces ambiguity. Not to mention that in an asynchronous programming environment, if you're doing anything non-trivial and you're not copy-pasting $.ajax() code snippets, you want to have named references to things so that closures written inside the scope have access to whatever interesting thing you're working with.<p>var that = this is a huge indicator that API design is wrong, that this is an abomination and that people generally aren't thinking critically about the code they're writing.",1321751800
