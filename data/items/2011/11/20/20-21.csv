I go through similar (if less extreme) cycles, and the depressive state can be debilitating. I looked at this as a serious affliction and set about ""curing"" myself about a year ago. I was ultimately successful after about a few months of concerted effort, at which point I became mediocre and may have blown my chances at moving directly to Stanford next year.<p>I've since reverted (because I couldn't take how bad I felt that I was subjectively accomplishing so little), and am in the process of studying this personality type to try and find a better answer. I think I'll draft an analysis myself in response to Marshall's and submit it if it comes out decently.<p>Out of curiosity (and to satisfy my hopeful hunch), are there many other HN users with behavioral patterns like this? I'm hoping to find similarly impassioned individuals on my way out towards Palo Alto/Stanford.",1321822654

It shows other factors are involved, which no one disputes, but it does not rule out genetics as a factor.</i><p>The core of my argument is that other factors have been shown to dominate underrepresentation for some time. While other factors persist and dominate, it is scientifically incorrect, and ethically irresponsible, to continually make reference to innate differences and outmoded, procrustean interpretations of how talent fits a curve.<p>It is genuinely too early, if not simply too brutal, to claim a group's intellectual inferiority. The evidence is flimsy, the mathematical framework naive, the conceptual underpinnings insufficiently examined, the data is simply not in.<p>Worse, people use <i>tiny</i> differences in group performance as justification for wildly unfair stereotypes, as applied to <i>individuals.</i> Even if those supposed group differences withstood criticism at the level of rigor exceeding that accorded to physics or mathematics, it still would be ethically irresponsible to make it publicly and commonly known, or the focus of so much discussion.",1321822532

It will fall over without one of them.  A moral person's ""own interest"" includes doing things that are consistent with his sense of morality.  Personal liberty and private property rights are essential to allow capitalism to flourish.  Decades of attacks on and marginalization of traditional morality in favor of more contemporary ""social obligations"" (code for ""whatever feels good"") have resulted in capitalism motivated by greed, rather than a more complete ""self interest"" that includes morality.

It was definitely well after the critical period for language learning (which btw, many linguists believe is only a critical period for learning a <i>first</i> language).<p>>for all I know your Cantonese-speaking friends are actually Chinese<p>None of the Cantonese learners I mentioned were Chinese nationals (though 2 are ethnically Chinese).  Even if they were Chinese nationals, it's still far from easy.  Cantonese is more different from Mandarin than romance languages are from each other in terms of mutual intelligibility.<p>My own study history has been French classes with little effect in high school, Japanese classes with much better results in college, Spanish through immersion with mediocre results, many years of living in a bilingual Mandarin environment as well as some classes, and more recently, a bit of Taiwanese, Cantonese and Swedish almost entirely via media until learning enough to try some of it out on people. Taiwanese and Cantonese both have features that are totally alien to me, despite have some distant relationship to Mandarin via classical Chinese.  Swedish is totally out there.<p>I'm 100% sure you can learn languages to a fluent level as an adult through large amounts of exposure to the target language.  I've seen it first hand many times and I've essentially abandoned classes for any reason other than visas in foreign countries.  That said, reading is great!  It's probably the fastest way to build up your vocabulary, even in your native language.  After getting enough listening input to have some handle on phonics, I'm all for reading as much as possible.  Actually I think not doing that is why my Mandarin progressed fairly slowly until I got into... some video games!<p>Back to the topic of the article, I would be amongst the first in line to by a Skyrim-style game for learning Swedish or Korean or any other language I want to learn!

You note his degree--which is similar to so many others--and don't think of it again, unless, perhaps his performance is poor. Poor performance doesn't match what you expect--or, more likely, what you think others expect--of a CS major, so you remember that it was a <i>CS major</i> that wasn't particularly good.",1321819403

Working with hypotheticals and seeing how rules interact is extremely useful, and something I greatly missed in my engineering education where I spent 4 years just watching some TA do derivations on the board.<p>2) Schools don't teach outdated law as the article seems to imply. Sure you read some old cases in the process, but some of the basic areas of the law haven't changed that much! To take the example of Hadley v. Baxendale used in the article, it was true in 1850 that damages for breach of contract are limited to those that were foreseeable by the parties, and it's still true today! When I took contracts, our book started with Hadley, but went on to describe several cases that arose in the dispute between Texaco and Pennzoil when they were both trying to acquire Getty.<p>3) Law school doesn't leave you any more unprepared to practice law as engineering school leaves you to practice engineering. Indeed, law school does a much better job teaching you to ""think like a practicing lawyer"" than engineering school does to teach you to ""think like a practicing engineer."" The problem is that a lot of the courses that teach you lawyering skills are elective, and people would rather take ""law and social change"" or something fluffy like that. At our school we have extensive clinic offerings, and my friends and I are doing everything from poking around in a Superfund site to helping defend criminals. And the professors aren't all eggheads. My tax ethics and business associations professors are partners at local law firms, my telecom and environmental law professors practiced in the field for years before coming to teach, my clinic professor was general counsel at a major corporation, etc.",1321819401
