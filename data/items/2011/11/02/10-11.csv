Yes, it is easily faked. Yes, it isn't representative. Yes, browser toolbar usage is probably declining.<p>However, that doesn't mean that Alexa information cannot be used as an indication of big traffic trends considering there is a difference between absolute traffic levels and relative changes in traffic levels.<p>To give a different example. Let's say that you have a website with decent traffic levels and you collect browser usage statistics (e.g. 50% IE, 40% FF, 10% Chrome). Of course those are not representative for global browser usage. But if Chrome usage doubles for that group, it can be used as an indication for a trend in global browser usage.",1320229078
