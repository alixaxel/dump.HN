3185491,comment,3180369,3184787,1,0,bugsbunnyak,,,"SciPy is not currently starting up. There were other open-source alternatives to Matlab in 1995, but certainly none with the scope and community of SciPy in 2011. That full-spectrum alternative is not Octave, not now or then. R is a very nice statistics dsl with prevalence in publications and thus a trove of code (arguments much weaker at that time) - but there is no PyMol or MayaVi in R for good reasons.<p>For the record, NumPy predates PDL by a smidge, and the existence of PDL is more of an argument against SciRuby, considering the cultural similarity and continued strength of BioPerl. As for C/C++/Fortran wrapping - there's a bit more to it than syntax efficiency, plus wrapping is often semi-automatic and leverages multi-language, science-ambivalent toolkits (ie SWIG or SIP). However, one nice consequence is the fact that via buffer wrapping, the NumPy array has become an efficient common currency for a huge number of legacy libraries.<p>IMHO, the advantages you have cited pale in comparison with the task of reimplementing 15 years worth of work for what is essentially unity gain in code style (+/- 2% depending on your flavor preference). Regarding that code style, you may be missing the forest for the trees: the inflexibility of Python is a small price to pay for community cohesiveness, and the resulting multiplier effect is non-trivial. Put another way, the time I've spent attempting to read Perl code-golf leaves me very leery of Ruby.<p>My basic argument though is not that Python is superior or coexistence impossible, it's that every person-year spent reinventing a mature system that is far beyond 'good enough' is a person-year that could be spent advancing the state of the art in scientific computing by building on Theano or improving SAGE - or preferably, doing real science.",1320209883
