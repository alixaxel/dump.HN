However as their national debt is $15 trillion they aren't exactly a model economy.</i><p>Why are people so obsessed about the debt of sovereign governments these days?<p>Think about it like this: there is (virtual) money in MMO games. Gold in World of Warcraft, ISK in Eve Online, or whatever. In an in-world accounting sense, this money is a debt (liability) of whoever runs the system. But it is ridiculous on the fact of it to worry about the total amount of money in those systems.<p>So why is their this obsession with the debt?<p>The most immediate reason is this gut reflex of ""it needs to be paid back"". But what one has to realize is that, for a monetary sovereign, paying back the debt is just exchanging one type of liability against another. The debt is money that has already been spent. Paying it back does not create new financial assets, it is just an asset swap. Why on earth would that be problematic?<p>The other objection is that the interest paid on debt causes an undue redistribution of wealth. That point is one of ignorance: a monetary sovereign effectively sets the interest rate that it pays on its outstanding debt - that is what the monetary policy of the central bank is about.<p>Seeing the true nature of money is initially scary, and perhaps this is what stops many from a deeper understanding. I can only hope that future generation will make fun of us for the way we are thinking about money.",1322387038

This is a net loss for the Germans.</i><p>There is a lot of truth to that. It's important to keep in mind that Germany as a whole is doing that voluntarily, though. It is a (more or less) conscious political choice to be a net exporting nation, and it was achieved by (among other things) systematically depressing the real wage development in Germany by political means.<p>So the German position is really schizophrenic (and I'm saying that as a German). On the one hand, Germany has for the last ten years given presents (in real terms) to the rest of the world. But now Germans are saying that they don't want to give presents (aka bail outs) to other European countries, even while they insist on continuing to give presents (aka net exports) to other countries.<p>It is a self-contradicting policy.<p>The problem is that Germany - at least the German elite - benefited in the sense that accumulating financial assets against the rest of the world implicitly increases the power that Germany has over the rest of the world. So Germany is in this very powerful position right now, where nobody can effectively challenge the insanity of their self-contradicting policies, at least from the outside.<p>From the inside it is very hard work as well, because unfortunately the media campaigns in favor of net exports have been so effective that most regular people believe in their benefits.",1322386499

3282092,comment,3281697,3281697,8,0,lucasjung,,,"One thing the article didn't mention, which I've been considering in regards to this problem: an RF-based internet alternative would be prone to all sorts of other forms of government interference/monitoring.  The U.S. government already has serious resources at its disposal for the purpose of intercepting or jamming RF transmissions.  For ""intercepting,"" this includes high-power decryption capabilities, and for ""jamming"" this includes noise jamming but also spoofing and signal insertion.  So even if an RF mesh-network of some sort were to be established, the government would be able to:<p>1: Know exactly where every transmitter is.  This means they can find you in meatspace even more easily than they can on the hard-wired internet.<p>2: Listen in on your transmissions without all of the legal issues associated with wiretapping.  To make sure they can do so, they would probably need to pass a law prohibiting the use of many types of cryptography on unlicensed RF transmissions.  Such a law would be much easier to sell to the general public ""because the terrorists could be using it to coordinate attacks.""  If you break this law, expect a knock on your door almost instantly because of #1, above.<p>When you combine #1 and #2, busting ""pirates"" becomes trivially easy: somebody sees a ""suspicious"" file in your transmissions, localizes your transmitter, and a few minutes later you get a knock on your door.<p>There's other stuff, like injecting false traffic, etc.",1322386091

In these kinds of problems, it's acceptable to have a widely distributed system with significant latency between nodes, because even though it takes you a long time to move the data across to another node, it's offset by the time you save in having another CPU perform work on it.<p>The latter is generally what you find in the business and web applications that are generating most of the heat in data centres today. These are things like stats aggregation, building search indicies, or plain old DB seeks. In these cases, it often doesn't make sense to distribute the work out over a connection with high latency, since by the time you've done that, performed a relatively cheap CPU operation on it, and sent it back down the wire, it would have been quicker just to queue it up locally and let the same node deal with when it had some CPU slots spare.<p>In other words the higher the latency between nodes, the less efficient the entire system becomes, and the less economical horizontal scaling becomes. In addition, there's a ton of extra overhead to maintain concurrency when latency is high.<p>It could be great for some niche problems though - like CDN, P2P relays, or local backup for nearby machines.",1322385604

It's been almost a week and I agree with bitboxer's assessment overall.  Most of the ads seem to stay out of the way.<p>Some are overwhelming or at the very least a bit annoying.  The first that pops to mind is space.com - which kept showing a footer ad even though I clicked the ""X"" - but that's only my immediate example because I'd been to that site more yesterday due to the Mars launch than I have in quite some time.<p>I noticed that a lot of newpapers seem to have ads that make me want to turn and run away.  The full page ads with the ""Click to continue"" link at the top right.  Forbes.com comes to mind immediately.  Those ads are repulsive and make me never want to return.  And while on the subject, any site that shows a 10 - 15 second video ad before a 15 second video clip will no longer get any of my attention, links, clicks, etc.<p>If I'm going to continue to try to use the web with ads enabled, I have to draw a line as to what is and isn't acceptable.  I haven't tried bitboxer's fork yet, but it sounds like a step in the right direction.  To take it further, it might be useful (to owners and visitors) to have a means for site owners to find out whether they are explicitly being blocked and hence losing potential income due of obnoxious advertising.",1322384751
