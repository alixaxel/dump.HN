Just recently I had to figure out how to get our staging poles up in a 3ft gap between houses to do a dormer. The only problem is it was about 26ft in the air and at best I'm supposed to have the bottom of my ladder out 9 feet and I can only manage 2 to be able to get past the eave. In the end I had to use 2 ladders simply to get onto my ladder as you have to keep your weight past the centre of balance otherwise your ladder will pull back and then bad shit generally ensues.<p>I have the utmost respect for the keyboard cowboys because my brother is a developer and I've seen how hard he works. Back in the day I used to develop, but I didn't have the interest to pursue it. I know the jobs are hard, and I've seen my brother come home and spend a few hours working on his own code after he's already done 8 hours of company code.<p>I, however, don't have respect for the developers that think their job is the only ""real job"" out there or that they're the only ones who work hard.<p>In my experience I see people across the board who are extremely hard workers from people doing minimum wage jobs in walmart to doctors. I've also seen lazy people across the board from walmart to hospitals. People are people, some are hard workers and some are lazy fucks. It would be nice to see the hard workers in jobs rewarded far more than the lazy, regardless of what job they're doing.",1321102224

I think that maybe you are not getting the same lessons from this article that others are.<p>To me, one of the big take-aways that is relevant to HN is that military service, especially in wartime, gives you experiences that you cannot get anywhere else, and that these experiences prove extremely valuable to veterans in the civilian workplace.  The first part (unique experiences) is not surprising, but the second part (military experience translates well to civilian work) is surprising or even counterintuitive to some people.<p>Another reason why this might seem content-lite to you is actually something you got <i>almost</i> right:<p>><i>I suspect what Dan really learned from the war will be discussed only over drinks with his fellow soldiers and not on any public forum.</i><p>I get the impression that he would be more than happy to share his most valuable lessons with anyone who asks, but the problem is that anyone who hasn't had military experience will not be able to truly understand the full extent of what he's trying to say.  Your statement would be more correct if rephrased as:<p>""I suspect what Dan learned from the war will only be <i>really</i> discussed over drinks with his fellow soldiers and not on any public forum.""<p>The reason being that those are the only people who can <i>really</i> understand what he's saying.<p>You actually demonstrate this effect in action:<p>><i>It doesn't say anything particularly interesting (imo). Other cultures are different and working with a diverse set of people teaches you tolerance? Well duh.</i><p>He learned, from the Afghans, a level of patience that most Americans (westerners in general, really) are simply incapable of comprehending.  He tried to express this, but to you it just came across as a minimally interesting anecdote about differences in cultures.  You can't really understand what he was trying to say unless you have been through a similar experience.  Similarly, the military has a level of racial integration that just doesn't exist in most of the rest of American culture.  He probably <i>thought</i> of himself as being comfortable in diverse crowds before he joined the military, and then he found out what it's like to work with a truly diverse group of people.  He tried to explain this, but to you it just came across as an obvious point about diversity and tolerance.  Again, you can't really understand what he was saying until you've been in immersed that kind of environment.",1321100527

It certainly did a fair amount to prepare him for the LISP course that is the essential first programming course for computer science majors at his university. He took that course during his second-to-last year of secondary schooling, through our state's dual enrollment program for high school students. He also had finished the EPGY C course by then.<p><a href=""http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/cs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/cs/</a>",1321099554

No elections were held in South Vietnam because it was widely known in the American Administration that Ho and co would have won hands down.<p>""I doubt very highly if your notional American militiaman had sworn any oath to the King of England.""<p>It didn't matter. For a subject (and pre independence, the people who lived in America <i>were</i> the subjects of George 3) to take up arms against his sovereign was treason, by the laws in place at the time, and the notions of honor in place at the time. Kings had ""God given"" rights to rule as they pleased.<p>Of course,in practice, rebellions happned all the time, noble or not, legal or not and  if you won, you weren't a traitor anymore. viz the Shakespearean quote about how treason never prospers because if you prosper in treason then you can redefine the meaning to make yourself a hero. The Americans won. So they are ""freedom fighters"". If they had lost they would be mutinous traitors.<p>""in WWII, it was sometimes necessary to destroy entire cities in order to achieve legitimate military goals. ""<p>And it was sometimes necessary to destroy Vietnamese villages to save them. Or waterboard and torture people to get information. Or drop an atom bomb on civilians to avoid casualties to your own armies in ""honorable"" combat against uniform wearing (but stubborn) foes. Use napalm against unarmed villagers. etc etc.  Rendition and torture innocents. Protect mercenaries from prosecution etc.<p>If the people who do the defining of what a ""legitimate military goal"" is , can break the ""laws of war"" at will (the Geneva Conventions, which you quote also ban torture for example. By a strict interpretation, everyone from GW Bush down is a war criminal), and quote ""military necessity"" then they have no meaning any more except as political fig leaves.<p>All your examples of ""dishonourable"" fighting serves to illustrate my point that tactics which are effective against the dominant powers of the day are 'dishonorable' and as soon as they are adopted by them they become ""honorable.""<p>However if it makes you uncomfortable not to think of the US Army as some kind of paragons of honor and virtue fighting the forces of evil, go right ahead.
