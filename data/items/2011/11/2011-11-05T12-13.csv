Those jobs truly are entry level, and will hire people without experience. Once you are there, start building tools on the side to help your department. If you do well, they'll see the value and give you more programming work. If not, at least you now can put real IT experience, including programming on your resume.<p>Admittedly, this is not an exciting path, nor a fast one. But it is an effective one.",1320497955

Now that does't mean somebody else has to compete in the same respect, Microsoft had different focus & vision. They wanted to go the IBM way, consumer & businesses. I feel they have done a good job.<p>Beside they are not thief, its business. Apple products are far more expensive than Microsoft, the difference between 16GB & 32GB iPhones are not justified. People have a notion that Mac OS is far more refined than Windows. Well I feel they are wrong, windows 7 is far more customizable & stable on many devices etc than Mac OS. Apple is a good hardware company, they build brillant product that you can look & feel but they are not good at softwares. Mac OS is an extension of unix under a limited environment where as Ms Windows which was build in house can virtually run on any machine.<p>I am not a Microsoft Fan but using Ms products for quite some time, I always liked Apple's products, I would say Steve just knows how to sell. A good example is the way he packaged & sold the 1st iMac in a translucent box which looked amazing, with the same hardware inside.<p>Now when I started exploring the world of Apple I realized its little too over hyped that what its actually worthy of.<p>If you think about it now, Steve Jobs had more failures than Bill.

Do you want to become a real estate company as well, hire your own agents, pick up the phones, take customers for the visits and so on? Or you need to provide a service that these companies (and some landlords, perhaps) want to use, in the right way.<p>Why would they give you out the exact address? A competing real estate company (not one, three, more) would immediately contact the landlord and offer him a better deal. Why would you list the price correctly, if you can hide some additional fees in the comment, stay 'technically' correct and look more attractive in the search?<p>I work on a service like this, we are quite rich (well, as a company, I'm just an employee), but we really can't do what you want.

3199620,comment,3198646,3198646,3,0,padobson,,,"<i>The idea is that a customer’s intensity of demand for aftermarket goods (e.g. the concessions) provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to pay for the primary good (e.g. admission). If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is positive, a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price (admissions plus concessions) from higher type customers.</i><p>I absolutely love this answer. I think it explains to a T the best way to extract value from a social network - and Zynga is proving it more than anyone.<p>The cost to join a social network is some amount of personally identifiable information. The value you get out of joining is that you will be able to contact, keeps tabs on, and enjoy various types of media with people you're interested in (friends on Facebook, celebs/friends/thought leaders on Twitter).<p>However, the cost to joining the social network is lower than the cost that some people (higher type customers) are willing to pay, so social networks and their app makers seek to extract the surplus by charging for various types of digital content (ironically, sometimes movies - <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/now-playing-facebook-dark-knight-20110308-070056-341.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/now-playing-face...</a> ).<p>Zynga takes this to an even greater level by offering you a chance to play with your friends for free, and then charging higher type customers for additional content.<p>In both of these cases, the value provided to the customer is directly correlated to the number of people using the service (you know, Network Effects, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects</a> ), but to those higher type social butterflies that need to show off their good taste by buying kitten icons or can't watch a movie online without their friends watching with them or need to be able to school their friends at Mafia Wars, they are willing to pay more than others and will pay a great deal more than their friends for a similar experience.<p>One last thought: the ""activities with celebrities"" marketplace is incredibly fertile. Night clubs pay celebs big money if they party on the premises. Celebrity golf events bring in big cash for charities. It seems like Twitter is perfectly positioned to cash in on this phenomenon, and I have no doubt that their are some higher-type Twitterers that would pay big money in a scarcity situation to play Mafia Wars with Shaq.",1320496910

3199587,comment,3196377,3198973,3,0,telemachos,,,"One data point: I was the sole major in Comparative Literature at my undergrad college. At the time, the department had a requirement that you do four higher-level literature courses in two languages that were not English. That meant that you had to reach fluency in two (non-English) languages by the start of your third year. Nobody did it, and eventually (years after I left) the department began allowing people to get Comp Lit degrees by reading works solely in translation (something my professors found hideous).<p>One nice thing about being the sole graduate in your subject? You win all the university and/or departmental awards in that subject by default. Looks impressive (to outsiders) but feels awkward.<p>For what it's worth, my two languages were Ancient Greek and Latin (I went on to study Classics in graduate school), so apparently, you wrote your comment just for me.",1320495631

Yes, the world could have had better technologies if not for Microsoft but you don't know that would have happened. It's always easy to imagine better things but reality is way different.<p>Edit: And I'm surprised by the amount of hate against Bill Gates in HN. We all need to think a minute on what each one of us personally did to make the world better and then opine on Bill Gates.
