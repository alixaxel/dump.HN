If anything, considering the diminishing returns on IQ points or percentiles strengthens the point: by the usual argument that each percentile measures less real difference in intelligence (which I agree with), that means that the change in output is even more astounding! Going up 0.8% of the population yields you 3-500% increase in output, and this is in the part of the population where that IQ change ought to be <i>least</i> important. We ought to see much larger gains going from, say, 91th to 92nd percentiles, with less gains for each step upwards - but we don't.<p>No matter how you cut it, shifting less than a percentile and getting the measured increase is dramatic.

Effectively, everyone shared their TODO list, and from the combined list you could tell at a glance what everyone worked on without having to ask or have status meetings.  (Thus, meetings only existed to deal with actual blocking problems, and remained short.)  Management within the team learned to look at that TODO list rather than asking for status reports; when management outside that team wanted a report on recent accomplishments, they got a rolled-up copy of completed TODO items with a few highlights called out at at the top.<p>I like the idea of having a tool built around the same approach, assuming I've understood it correctly.<p>A few bits of feedback on your launch page: While I found phrases like ""mind-meldification"" amusing, the first instance of such a phrase occurred when you said ""same-pagifying"", and that one in particular didn't so much strike me as amusing as pointy-haired-bossish; I almost closed the page right then.  Also, do you <i>really</i> want to use the politically charged phrase ""don't ask don't tell"" in marketing copy?
