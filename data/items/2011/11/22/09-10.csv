A standard menu would be at the top right of the page with Updates/About/Contact/Support as options.<p>The ""screenshot"" of the product on the top right is confusing.. it looks like clickable UI elements at first.<p>The buy button does not have enough contrast and the desired action is not clear enough. Plus why is the sale price on the button? Was that tested?<p>The fact that this is on sale is not immediately obvious.<p>The screenshot of the product's menu should be next to the mouse, perhaps overlapping.<p>The manual portion is superfluous and should be on the support page or on a separate ""How it works"" link.<p>The background is nice but really distracting.<p>Finally the phalanx of share buttons at the top is highly distracting and might be better placed somewhere else. I would probably put a grey band at the top with the share links on the left and the support/about menu items on the top right.<p>I would also move the screenshot next to the mouse, put the sale price info above the buy button and move the buy button down onto the grey section to provide more contrast (plus I'd try the button in the orange/yellow). The text between sale price and the app store logo should go below the buy button to the right of the other grey text.<p>The copy could also be tightened up.. for example ""Instantly achieve unrivaled precision with any mouse."" is a much tigther value proposition.<p>The grey bullet points should be shortened and more clearly delineated.<p>Finally the FinalTouch logo has too much glow and makes my eyes bug out.<p>Note: I'm not trying to denigrate the owner's website.

You have to watch, as you watch a lizard going by, walking across the wall. You see all its four feet, how it sticks to the wall, and as you watch, you see all the movements. In the same way, watch your thinking. Do not correct it. Do not suppress it. Do not say, ``All this is too difficult''. Just watch; now, this morning.<p>First of all sit absolutely still. Sit comfortably, cross your legs, sit absolutely still, close your eyes, and see if you can keep your eyes from moving. You understand? Your eye balls are apt to move, keep them completely quiet, for fun. Then, as you sit very quietly, find out what your thought is doing. Watch it as you watched the lizard. Watch thought, the way it runs, one thought after another. So you begin to learn, to observe.<p>Are you watching your thoughts - how one thought pursues another thought, thought saying, ``This is a good thought, this is a bad thought''? When you go to bed at night, and when you walk, watch your thought. Just watch thought, do not correct it, and then you will learn the beginning of meditation. Now sit very quietly. Shut your eyes and see that the eyeballs do not move at all. Then watch your thoughts so that you learn. Once you begin to learn there is no end to learning.""",1321954005

I thought it was worth standing up and admitting that these biases are a part of my psychology, and by doing so, take the first steps towards creating a better environment for other people.<p>I was especially prompted to speak up because of the tendency for people in discussions like this to downplay their own vulnerability to such biases.
