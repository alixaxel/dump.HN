They tend to be big and all-encompassing, with multiple science objectives and specialized imagers.  (Not a quick flyby like Voyager.)  Because they need to show science impact, they can't just pack a simple imager and some particle detectors.<p>Right now, the big outer planets mission is Cassini, which has been orbiting Saturn and visiting its moons, which are a varied bunch.  Before that, there was Galileo, which visited Jupiter.<p>For context, I believe it's accurate to say that the era of large ""flagship"" missions was wound down years ago, and replaced by what, at the time, was called ""faster, better, cheaper"".  (Engineers replied, ""sure, pick any two"".)  Despite grumbling, this doctrine pretty much won out for planetary missions.<p>For inner planets, of course, most attention has gone to Mars, using the ""follow the water"" strategy.",1320637593

They would be incentivised to do this, to make more profit, obviously.<p>Seeing as games are being discussed, Nintendo used to do this by increasing the manufacturing cost they charged to make the cartridges (afair, Nintendo had a stranglehold on the cart manufacture), and hence you got situations like where Street Fighter 2 on the SNES was crazily priced - don't remember exactly, but something like 60 in the UK.<p>>Much like iTunes, they're happy to leverage this huge library of ""media"" to boost sales of devices.<p>If they had a device monopoly, they would no longer need the apps to be cheap to boost device sales, which is my point.",1320637313

3204838,comment,3197798,3198497,1,0,akeefer,,,"Sorry for the late reply (didn't see the question until now).  The DCEVM is just a patched version of the JVM dll/so file that allows the normal hotswap mechanism (triggered by JVMTI) to accept arbitrary class changes, rather than just method body changes.  There's no additional mechanism or API, it just makes the already-existing mechanism for hotswapping better.  To install it, you just run the installer jar and point it to your jdk.  To use it, you just trigger a hotswap as you normally would, which generally means starting your program in debug mode via an IDE, and having the IDE automatically swap changes for you as classes change locally.  If you want to do hotswapping without the IDE, that's a bit trickier.  Technically, you can write your own JNI code to directly hook into JVMTI and trigger a hotswap (which is what we actually do with our development platform at Guidewire), but the easiest way to do it is generally just to use the debug capabilities of the IDE.",1320636367

With that plan, (assuming you corrected the problem that most options at pre-public companies are basically revocable at any time.)  you'd end up with a bunch of guys like me;  Sellswords who are halfway to becoming a business people.  And you know?  even if you do keep us for a while, it's not going to be for long;  my personal policy, when working for other people, is to always be looking, and jump if someone offers me 20% more.  Loyalty?  you are paying me 20% below market, how about <i>you</i> show <i>me</i> some loyalty.<p>People like me?  we're probably better off running our own companies.   Really, if you want the skills people like me have?  you are probably best off contracting with our company for the work.<p>The sort of person who likes to be an employee is, well, rather different.  They are usually quite risk-averse compared to someone like me.  They don't want to have to worry too much about money; they want to do the job they are interested in, and they want the money problem to largely go away.   Generally speaking, unless you want the employee to sell or, you know, be a business person for you?   these sorts of people are far superior to people like me, after equalizing for skill.<p>If you want to keep these sorts of people?  offer them raises before they ask.  Remove hassles from their lives.   help them move.  free them from the drudgery of cooking.<p>In short, I think you need to make them feel like /you/ are loyal to /them/ -  that's something they value.   Doing this while remaining, you know, honest can be somewhat difficult.   I dono.  I personally try to continue to give some benefits to ex-employees. I give them free co-location for life.  I am generous in references.   If I have to get rid of someone, I try to find them another job with someone else.    One guy who was a contractor for me for a while who left for a larger ISP, well, he got fired from the new job.  I had already replaced him, but I've been helping him out with his resume and stuff.<p>I think what these people want is to be treated like friends rather than like resources.   Which is kinda interesting, because if you deal with someone like me?  I mean, sure, being friendly is great.   But I'm going to feel flattered, and think of you as a honest and straightforward person if you treat me as a valuable resource rather than as a friend (I mean, in a business context)<p>Google, I think does a really good job of all of that, and now it sounds like they are also doing a good job of making 'the money problem' just go away.<p>One of my employees told me that he was recently approached by a google recruiter.   He said he felt really guilty, like he was betraying me by going to the interview.<p>To me?  his feelings are rather foreign.  I mean, considering the difference between what google would pay him and what I pay him, no reasonable person would criticize him for jumping to google;  if anything the reasonable person would say that he had a right to feel a little offended that I'm paying him so little, when according to google, he's worth much more.<p>But understanding how these sorts of people think and keeping them happy is key to retaining the workers you want long-term.  It's a hard thing for a business owner to do, because hey, we're business owners... if we thought that way, we would never have struck out on our own.",1320636253

I pretty explicitly said I was talking about the common case, which is not ""unemployed and looking for a $10/hour job."" You are talking about a very specific situation which is much poorer than average, statistically speaking.<p>Anyway, though, I suggested that $5000 car (which is a once-a-decade splurge) as a <i>convenience</i>. I explicitly said that. Many people, including me, have made do with public transportation or lousy cars (at a $10/hour job, yes  this is from <i>experience</i>). I still maintain that there are much cheaper options than the ""plasma TV, high-speed Internet, cell service"" lifestyle that was under discussion here. For example, you definitely don't need TV, and if you're looking fo a job and really need a phone, you can get a prepaid one for like $10 without committing to an expensive plan.<p>And it is simply not my experience, nor that of anyone I know (who range from unemployed to poorly employed to very gainfully employed) that hiring managers will not wait a few minutes for you to call back. Has that actually happened to you a lot? I believe it happens sometimes, but again, I don't believe that is the common case.<p>If you really work for somebody that horrible for $9.10 an hour, I would urge you to seek alternative employment at someplace like Subway, Albertsons or Starbucks, where they have similar compensation and in my experience they tend to treat people better than that.<p>Also  and I mean this sincerely, not to be snarky  I would suggest you look at how you approach people, because frankly you come across as rather hostile and negative. I understand you find your situation frustrating, but you need to try to stay positive.

I've left companies in the past for this reason and (as pg had said a number of times) lack of determination to succeed is more important than raw intelligence.<p>I could start a systems startup, but having worked for such a company in the past, I know I don't want to start one, especially at this stage in my career: finding funding (this isn't something you can bootstrap), customer support, doing business development (to find a sales channel) and/or sales/marketing (the sales model is not self-serve) would be what I'd spend huge portions most of my time on.
