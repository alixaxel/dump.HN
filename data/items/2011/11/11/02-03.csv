It says that the players who were spending time stretching their abilities were higher achieves than the ones who simply worked hard. Does that mean the average ones were working tirelessly to perfect their existing skills while the elite were going beyond that and testing their limits? So then were the elites simply satisfied with their current abilities so to speak and simply moving on to more challenging activities while the average ones wouldn't do that until their existing skills were absolutely perfect? I'm tired so maybe Im missing the obvious.<p>I love articles like this. It's just so hard to put the results into practice. I'm a programmer. I admit I focus on improving skills that are in my comfort zone most of the time. It has served me well and I see a lot of improvement in my work. I also spend some time working on things I'm not familiar with or not comfortable with but far less time that that which I already have at least a decent grasp of.

And maybe technically there are more canals than in Venice and Amsterdam, but in reality you'll find that you have to walk quite a bit to get from one canal to the next, where in Venice and Amsterdam they are a defining part of the city.</i><p>I grew up in Berlin, when the wall was still up (it came down when I was in the 4th grade, and we left the summer after I finished 5th grade).  We flew out of the city to spend major holidays with family back in the states, but in the eleven years I lived there, I left the city via ground transportation exactly three times (all for class trips).  Despite hardly ever leaving the city, I regularly went on camping trips with the scouts where it felt like I was in the middle of the wilderness.  I also regularly went on walks through sections of the Grnewald (forest/parkland) near my home, and could get so far in that city noise would completely disappear.  People would get lost in the Grnewald in the winter and wander around for <i>days</i> before either finally stumbling out onto a street, dying of exposure, or being killed by wild boars.  I don't know any other city on Earth that contains such large tracts of wildlands <i>inside</i> the city.<p>As for the canals, they're completely different.  They are best enjoyed via river boat cruises, not on walks.<p>><i>I like kebabs as much as the next guy and it's probably true that you can get the best ones in Berlin, but let's be honest, it's drunk food and often made from questionable ingredients.</i><p>I was way too young to be drinking when I lived in Berlin, but they were still my favorite food.  I've been back since, and have consumed them both drunk and sober as an adult, and still think that Berliner Dnners are one of the best foods on Earth.  I've been all over the world, and I've never had a Dnner Kebab that stacks up to the ones in Berlin.  I've eaten Dnner Kebabs and equivalents (Shwarma, Gyros, etc.) all over the middle east and mediteranean (Turkey, Greece, Israel, Bahrain, Dubai, etc.), places where you would expect the Kebabs to be better, but they're not as good as in Berlin.  The only thing that came close were some Shwarma I bought from a Lebanese cafe in Cyprus.<p>There are some things I don't like about Berlin.  The biggest is that the public transportation is dirty, and in some places unsafe at certain hours.  When I grew up there, the public transportation was clean and safe (as a grade-schooler, I was allowed to range all over the city with my friends, riding the buses and subways with no adult supervision).  When I went back to visit for the first time a few years later, I was shocked at how dirty and poorly-kept they had become.",1320977721

Also,\n>the ratings monopoly is also a govt creation. (Yes, folks\n>could consider other things, but their ratings determine\n>what counts for ""assets"" for regulated entities.)<p>When did I ever say that the Fed isn't part of the government or that repealing G-S doesn't matter?  And the rating agencies were definitely part of the problem.  But here's the problem - your basic argument is that the government promoted subprime mortgages.  For evidence, you cite a document which purports to say that banks and mortgage companies were forced to lend, thus causing the subprime bubble.<p>This idea, of course, isn't backed up by the data (as I've shown).  Now if you want to move the goal posts and talk about G-S, or the Fed, I'm all ears - they definitely contributed to the subprime bubble.  But the idea that the government forced banks and mortgage companies to make loans is just crap.<p>In fact, it is the lack of government regulation that really caused the bubble.  If the Fed had just required confirmation of income, then the bubble would have been stopped in its tracks - but Greenspan refused to make the modifications.  When Obama came in, it was among the first regulations put into place.<p>>Most items in the list in that article have govt's\n>fingerprints all over it, and it's hardly complete. For\n>example, it ignores fannie and freddie, the various\n>efforts to encourage home ownership, and the like.<p>Again, you have not presented evidence that Fannie and Freddie caused the subprime bubble.  They were, in fact, losing marketshare during the bubble, while Wall Street took over the function of securitization.  Are Fannie and Freddie messed up?  Yes, but they didn't cause the subprime bubble.<p>>Are you really arguing that regulated entities don't\n>follow the rules?\n>If so, you don't get to argue that different rules would\n>have made a difference.<p>Of course I can - it's called enforcement.  Some laws are enforced, other are effectively ignored.  So it's a combination of both rules + enforcement.  Witness the SEC not enforcing rules on Wall Street banks.  Just today, a judge rejected the settlement offer from the SEC to Citibank, while pointing out that Citibank has repeatedly broken the law, and yet the SEC had not done anything about it - even though they knew Citibank had broken the law.  Under Bush, the SEC become a toothless entity - it's gotten somewhat better under Obama, but it is still a captured agency in my mind.",1320977711
