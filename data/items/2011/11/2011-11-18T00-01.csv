The original front-end the client was actually layering each stroke on top of each other, so what ended up happening was the client would crash after 20ish minutes of moderate use.  So I fixed that and ended up using bitmapping to handle the screen.  I had a bunch of other features that I disabled for this release [opacity and the undo function] just because they were too buggy.<p>The server's running I believe CentOS 5.6? or .7?  And it's written in Java.  Anywho when there's incoming information it stores the coordinates that are being drawn into a buffer.  If the buffer becomes full then it shoots it out those coordinates. There's also a 50ms cycle that checks the size of the buffer, so even if it's not full, it'll shoot out the points.<p>-edit-<p>I mean, for now the server architecture can handle light load but I definitely plan on implementing a more scalable solution if I get more traffic.",1321576691

3249834,comment,3248963,3248963,3,0,chrisbennet,,,"One secret to having a good developer experience in any company is having a very small decision ""surface area"" for the developer. By that I mean, he/she only needs to talk to 1 or 2 people in order to make a decision. A small company has this sort of environment naturally but a ""big"" company can somewhat duplicate it by having a small team with a great manager.<p>The reality is that large companies tend to have organizational reasons not to hire the sort of people that they <i>say</i> they want. 
For example:<p>They express the desire to hire the top 1% but of course they can't or don't want to <i>pay</i> a salary in the top 1% - perhaps they've never paid that much for a developer or maybe it wouldn't be fair to the less talented or more exploited devs already on the payroll.<p>They <i>say</i> they want ""smart people that get things done"" but they aren't prepared to give them someplace quiet to think or resources they need.<p>Heck, sometimes it seems like HR's job is to keep the best people out. Do they really want someone exceptional even brilliant? ""Oh no, we couldn't hire him, he doesn't have a degree.""",1321574400
