Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in September, he outlined the business planif thats the right term for something that looks decades into the future. If you can reduce the cost of moving to Mars to around the cost of a middle class home in Californiamaybe to around half a million dollarsthen I think enough people would buy a ticket and move to Mars, he said. You obviously have to have quite an appetite for risk and adventure. But there are seven billion people on Earth now, and therell be probably eight billion by the midpoint of the century.

Get to know the political system there, it's ins and outs. Figure out how to hack it, by saying just the right thing to just the right groups. Take lots of acting classes. Get damn good at it.<p>Start out as a Republican, get to be a senator or house member or something.<p>During this time make sure to be slavishly devoted to the military. Fight for veterans benefits, pay increases, increased recruitment. Treat the military like royalty. Allow the military to join public employee unions, strike, take up dues. This will fuel all your political campaigns to come.<p>Then switch to a 3rd party and use your military union backing to run for president. Spend all your time attacking the two parties using the other parties standard attack lines (republicans: heartless, democrats: weak). There's lots to attack on each side, present yourself as the ""3rd option"". Take your existing 10%, then pull in an additional 15% percent (of the total vote) from each party. You'll win with 35%.<p>After being elected, ally with the Republicans to get your pro military policy passed. Ally with the democrats to turn on the fairness doctrine again and support everything the  public employee unions want. Increase their funding so they can give it back to you in donations. Implement a flat tax, remove corporate taxes, and jack up government spending at every level. All your spending will be fueled through the Fed, guised as economic stimulus. Ridicule those worried about the value of the dollar as pessimists and enemies of the state. Convince them a lower dollar will mean more exports and jobs at home.<p>Crack down on the internet in the interests of protecting jobs, preventing piracy, and increasing fairness. Keep control over all methods of communication. Controlling the internet will be key to all other steps, in controlling information, and keeping a consensus in your country supporting your radical foreign policy. It'll also be a key weapon of economic warfare with other countries.<p>Appoint 1 or 2 members to the supreme court and then through an act of supposed foreign terrorism, neutralize the rest of the members. Set up a war against those terrorists, with wartime powers. Resist any acts to appoint new supreme court members. Cancel all further elections until the threat is taken care of.<p>Be a strong and resolute leader. Target China as an opponent since they are one of the biggest threats to US domination. Turn Japan, South Korea, and India into US territories in the interests of protecting it from China. Take down China by pledging support of protecting the rich coastal regions.  Start a war with the communist regime, and take it down. Switch China to the US dollar and establish it as a commonwealth of the US empire.<p>Then take on Russian using economic warfare (force oil prices down to 20/barrel by subsidizing overproduction in the middle east).<p>Take down the EU with your monetary policy. Low dollar means less imports from Europe. Make it against the law for any bank to lend to a foreign government. These small steps will provide the weight to collapse an already weak EU. Eventually subvert and take over the union. Establish the US dollar as the currency in Europe.<p>Invade Mexico under the pretense of stopping the immigration problem. Boycott and blockade Canada until they collapse. Trade policy is the weapon of choice for taking control over  North America. They already depend on the US for survival so selectively cut their oxygen until their governments collapse, and then step in to pick up the pieces.<p>Take over South America by controlling the flow of goods and information. Then install puppet governments.<p>Leave Africa for last. That one can be done by traditional military invasion, preceded by 6 months of propaganda about how horrible it is for those living there (mostly true). Demonize the dictators of each African state, then invade each country one by one in wars of compassion and establish each as a US commonwealth.<p>That just leaves Australia.

I inferred that if it was the case, the price of current products sold on the market should reflect well their inherent value, which I think it doesn't.<p>Money is is too ductile and doesn't involve enough the ""donor"", a bit like ""vote by SMS for your favorite star"". The voting system itself is still not involving enough the person giving the vote.<p>My favorite ""point system"" is ""feet-voting"": the best city is the place where people move to, the best country is the one that people want to go to live, raise their kids, etc. This evaluation was used during the Warring State period in China, and it induces the kings and feudal lords to enforce justice and proper retributions. If not, their administrate will move away. Trying to force them to stay by forbidding expatriation will push them away even stronger. And this voting-with-your-life thing is such a deep decision from the voters that we can trust them to ponder long-term consequences.<p>Granted, this evaluation cannot apply to each and every case, but in the web services it has a clear equivalent in how many users stay on a site and use it.",1321856287

With the window maximized on a 1920x1080, the taskbar is crammed to the left side while the rest of my screen is simply a gaping gray hole.<p>On the task management side of things, I tried to add a task for both members of a team using ""$ @all task description"" but it seemed to just go to my shortlist. It was difficult to distinguish, as a result, between different shortlists and the team shortlist. I was also confused by the presence of a lightning bolt icon next to one of my tasks that I might have accidentally added when messing around with keyboard shortcuts. The icon seemed to have no clear meaning and there was no helpful tooltip waiting for me when I hovered over it. I also wish there was some way to rank my tasks based on their priority.<p>That being said, this actually looks really cool, and I'd love to support it as the kinks get worked out.",1321855541

The same goes for propulsive landing of a rocket for reusability: <a href=""http://www.spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=0&cat=recent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=0&cat=rec...</a><p>Everything at SpaceX is designed with reusability in mind, and every system is highly redundant. And to top it off, they have some of the best, most talented, and most experienced engineers out there.<p>With all that said, the reason why SpaceX will succeed is their culture. Most of the company's employees are young and highly motivated (including myself I guess). When I started my work at SpaceX, one of the engineers told me to prepare to shed some blood and tears as well as prepare for the most stressful yet rewarding work of your life. He was right. There were times where I did not go home for 4 days straight (this was not recommended). They did not asked me to do this. I just wanted to do it. The thing that is cool about SpaceX is that you will do REAL work on you first day, and you will have a significant impact right away. Even if you are an intern.<p>I know a lot people on Hacker News are essentially web programmers (Me too actually. Django FTW). If you guys are looking for a job, they are always hiring. One way to get hired is to start out as an intern (if you are at an intern stage in your life). If you want to actually program the rocket, and got some ROCK SOLID C++ programming skills, then you are exactly what SpaceX wants. So please apply. Space exploration is hands down one of the important pursuits we can have as civilization, so the best need to work on this challenge in my view.<p>Let me tell you, there is no feeling to see something that you designed and built actually entered outer space. I can't describe it. You just have to experience it for yourself. So if you're bored on your current job, look into SpaceX. Plus having Elon Musk as a boss is pretty bad ass. The guys is simply defines legitness!",1321855534

The Telstra technicians flat-out lied about their first no-show to my house, messed up the connection on their second visit, and only get things working on their third visit.  And they billed Adam for each of those visits.  Total turnaround time was almost three weeks.<p>Turnaround time for 18 Mbit cable from Optus in Melbourne?  Two days.  Those guys wanted my business and they hustled to get it.<p>And when I attempted to complain about Telstra's behaviour to the ""powerful regulator"" they threw it back at Adam since pedantically speaking they were my provider!<p>This kind of monopolistic arrogance explains why Australia's fixed line infrastructure is a joke.
