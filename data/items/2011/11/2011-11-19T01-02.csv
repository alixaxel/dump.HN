To the average person, ""tweaking"" means making minor modifications to an essentially finished product. This of course would do a huge disservice to Apple's accomplishments, and I think that's what Gruber is trying to fight, considering Gladwell and Isaacson write for a general audience.<p>To put it another way, it took Microsoft and others several years to tweak the Macintosh operating system, and this despite Apple essentially resting on their laurels until the return of Steve Jobs.<p>There were tons of MP3 players before the iPod, and they were pretty much decimated. iTunes is not just music on the Internet, it is also the first music service that got the music majors and labels on board. Where are the iPod/iTunes tweaks? Microsoft failed twice with PlaysForSure and Zune. Amazon, Google and Spotify are doing interesting things in this space, yet most people are still going to listen to music they download from them... on their iPod.<p>Similarly, the iPhone is much more than a pre-2007 smartphone without buttons, and the iPad is much more than a Dynabook or a pre-2010 tablet with no stylus.<p>And I think you are mischaracterizing his observations about Gates.",1321667950

Now I am the CTO of an awesome company in NYC. People always are amazed that I got to where I am without some sort of formal computer science-type of degree and ask my secret. I always tell them not to underestimate the power of great communication skills.<p>Sure it's very important to have the technical chops, but it's often more important to be able to bring together people from all facets of the business. Solid writing skills are very important in general and, as many have said, programming is a skill that can be learned just like anything else.

3254274,comment,3252469,3253046,2,0,rayiner,,,"You have to put this test in context. It's basically testing how fast you can take floating-point values out of JS objects, put them in vertex buffers, and shuttle them through the JS <-> C foreign-function interface into the GL library. This is pretty much a worst-case scenario for JS, and Opera gets within about 4x of C++.<p>For more complex rendering, JS will be faster, relatively, because the GPU will have to do more work for each batch of vertices you send over.<p>For game logic, JS will be faster, relatively, because going through the foreign function interface is actually somewhat slow. You have to pin GC'ed objects onto the stack, etc. Moreover, calling into code the JIT can't see can disable certain optimizations.<p>If you look at certain FP micro benchmarks, like nbody and spectrum-norm in the Shootout, V8 is within 4x of gcc -O3 on nbody, within 3x on spectral-norm when using gcc's vector extensions, and dead-even with gcc on spectral-norm when not using gcc's vector extensions.<p>The places where V8 still falls down are property access (the prototype OO system forces some overhead) and lack of vectorization. The former can be addressed by using an SoA layout rather than an AoS layout, and if your code is amenable to vectorization you should break out the assembler anyway.",1321665937
