287801,comment,287161,287161,0,0,raffi,,,"I'm in a good position in the job market right now.  Masters degree (soon), security clearance, lots of experience, will relocate anywhere and open source work to prove my credentials.  I'm definitely interested in a startup over a big corporate environment.  Since I'm in the market now (and interviewing)--here are my thoughts on the article:<p>== Work nimbly and hire qualified candidates quickly...<p>I agree with this.  I feel annoyed when I send my resume to a larger organization and don't hear back for a week or more.  Its nice to see interest quickly.<p>== Promote your company's size.<p>Agreed, I've worked in big orgs and even a smaller org (<70 people) still feels big to me.  I've also worked in small situations and loved those.<p>== Prove your company's stability.<p>Please do, I'm willing to take a big risk.  Really I am.  However its hard to bite when its a social network for oak furniture lovers.  Actually, emphasize the ""interesting"" problems your company is trying to solve.  What are the technical roadblocks you're blowing apart that no one else can touch?  The availability of interesting work will help recruit talent.  I realize not everything can be a research problem but certainly there are interesting problems in any tech startup?<p>== Benefits<p>Here are some good things to look into:<p>-- for telecommuters, subsidize their cellphone and internet costs,<p>-- give your employee a computer budget and let them buy whatever they're most comfortable working on<p>-- for those relocating, consider a moving allowance, access to a real estate agent, or at least the promise of someone to pick them up at the airport and show them around for a week.  The third option costs nothing but part time of one of your employees and can make a big difference in their happiness / integration into the team.<p>-- gym membership maybe?<p>-- vacation time... most companies are incredibly stingy on this one...  consider the opposite approach, 4 weeks should be possible.<p>One other option--pay your folks a decent enough salary and give them the option of taking unpaid days off as the tempo of the company allows.  I'd gladly pay for this flexibility so long as I know I have it.<p>-- consider giving all your employees a monthly or quarterly book allowance to buy books related to their job<p>-- consider promising your employees the ability to do their engineering without being bothered with work such as buying print toner or ink jet cartridges.  Those considering the jump from faceless corporation X or the government will consider this a big selling point.<p>== Target beginners.<p>Beginners are nice but in a startup you want some experienced talent on board too, Steve Yeggae calls them seed engineers.  These first engineers define the culture, informal processes, and way of getting things done as you grow into a sustainable business.  Make sure you have the right people in this role.<p>== Use a recruiting service.<p>I've never used a recruiter and I'm a little nervous about doing so.  I like this crop of startup related job sites like snaptalent and startuply.  I like the joel on software job board and check craigslist as well.  I personally stay away from Dice and Monster because they seem synonymous with faceless corporations.<p>== Nice work space...<p>I worked in a loft above a music store in a startup experience back in 2000.  I loved that job like nothing else.  My coworker (a hippy type) painted the walls with flowers.  I remember between living arrangements I stored all my worldly possessions there for a few weeks.  I have happy memories of the place.<p>That said, here would be some nice to haves: office space located in a downtown area (walking distance to restaurants and such) or located in an area near running/biking trails (include a shower in this case)...  a private office for developers would be a big plus too, I can live in a cubicle though.  It doesn't bother me.<p>Please avoid offices located in the middle of nowhere on airport road.  I'd rather telecommute or work out of a dumpster than deal with those.<p>== For what its worth...<p>These are just my 1:30am thoughts on this article.  Good luck.",1219815584

I don't really know what it will be yet, but I want it to involve a web crawler because those are really interesting to me for some reason. For example, The Hype Machine (http://hypem.com) has a crawler that pulls MP3 links from a bunch of music blogs. That is awesome! How does that work?!<p>I found some open source crawlers, but have no idea where to start. I've read some research papers on them as well, but they seem outdated. I'm looking for resources that would help me get started with the most modern approach--if that makes sense.<p>I would really appreciate any helpful resources you might have to share. Thanks<p>I am most familiar with PHP, but I am open-minded.",1219814247

If you're a hacker and you proposed this to your business-person co-founder and they accept then fail them.<p>Many of these terms are reasonable over time but not initially and not for everyone.  For example, agreeing to severance in a company that is not funded is silly (e.g. firing an employee could force bankruptcy).",1219814235

The emphasis of the UI is on advertising / sponsorships, and not on content; for a content-focused company, this doesn't work.  I can't help but think of a tirade that David Cross goes on about Arrested Development where he basically ridicules the network for shortening the length of the show, minutes at a time, in order to increase ad revenue at the expense of the show and its viewers. Techcrunch appears to be doing the same thing, albeit in a different medium.",1219813294
