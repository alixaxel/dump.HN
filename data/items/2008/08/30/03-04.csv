I think newer (last 15 years) tech company's have been able to not offer dividends and still attract investors (even low capex, software co's that don't necessarily need to reinvest), but the types of investors (venture investors) they attract are naturally then interested in capital gains, and thats only achieved by trading that equity.  I could be wrong, but traders tend not to think past the point of their expected holding, and since their only return is on sale of the equity, prefer for that to happen earlier rather than later.",1220068579

290664,comment,289487,290471,0,0,linhir,,,"Well, there are very few risk free returns, obviously. I guess the standard would be US treasury bonds, which don't pay more than mortgages, obviously. But the S&P has an annual rate of return of almost 10% over the last forty years, so if you're risk averse (aren't we all) a good index fund will likely beat your mortgage rate.",1220066959
290663,comment,289487,290370,0,0,linhir,,,"Ya, I would agree with your comment about financing purchases, and I read that slightly incorrectly. My point, even for bill gates, is that if your rate of return on capital, or expected rate of return, is higher than the rate at which you can borrow capital, than you should borrow. That differential is what's important, with the tax break being icing on the cake.<p>And on the handbag question, haha, I think you're likely correct.<p>I am less sure about cars, since if you are going to buy and dump a car, it seems like you should lease it, no? I don't know...<p>I think the other important thing to realize is that the rich aren't, like any large group, unified in their behavior, which is something that article like this always avoid. There is no one way to become a millionaire and there certainly isn't one set of behaviors they exhibit.",1220066859

So you <i>should</i> consider FIOS to be ""sweet"" because it means you can pay less for whatever speeds you have now, not just because it's way faster.",1220066335
290660,comment,290342,290442,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"It is actually much worst than that.  If you exercise your options while your company is still privately held, then you have no way to sell the shares which means that any gain is only a paper gain and should not be considered a taxable event.  This is true until you recalculate your tax return using AMT which you are required to do by law.  Currently AMT considers paper gain from options a TAXABLE event!!!!  So if you are an employee and you decided to leave the company or if you are fired.  You are between a rock and a hard place.  You either walk away from the options.  Or you have to come up with both the money to exercise the options and the money to pay the tax.  And if the company tanks after you are gone, then tough cookie.  You can only write off the loss $3K per year, one year at a time.  On the other hand, if you are a Founder or co-Founder, you get to own shares and not options.  Then not only do you not have to worry about exercising, but the clock starts right away for capital gain.  And if you sell the company in five years, since these are 1244 stock, only half of the gain is subject to federal tax. The last part of the article is actually the most important.  Think about the founders of Youtube.  They were employees of Paypal and did not make a lot of money when it was acquired by eBay.  But they gained experience, credibility, friendship, connection and just enough money to bootstrap their own idea.  It worked out well for them in spite of the inherent pitfalls of owning options.",1220066141

Also that a lot of people don't have a choice over who they can get service with.<p>Right now on my 10/1 cable (thankfully not comcast) connection, my router tells me I've used up about 195gb down and 40gb up for a total of 235gb since August 1st.
