Sorry about the hyperbole.<p><i>Why exactly should a single image on the front site make or break your technical case? Have you considered that this might be an indication that your technical case was extremely weak?</i><p>I agree with you, of course, but I think you're underestimating how important appearances are to these middle-management types. Especially the ones at service-based companies. They will visit the website to research a tool that I want to use, and if it doesn't look professional, it will get rejected regardless of any technical argument I make. This is true for everyone, not just me.",1220126011

291010,comment,290996,290996,0,0,iamdave,,,"Paradoxically, one of the most aggressively (guerilla) simple marketing campaigns runs directly contrary to the whole idea of making a blog entry to try and ""inform"" people on how to be aggressive when marketing:<p>Just do it.  - Nike<p>The reason I say all that: more and more companies are trying to be viral, trying to be guerilla, jumping into social niche markets without really knowing how to target users, then slapping the word ""viral"" or ""social"" in front of it.  Read my words over and over, print them out if you have to:<p>IT'S NOT VIRAL/GUERRILLA/SOCIAL MARKETING JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY IT IS.<p>Hosting a non-conformist event, creating a t-shirt, entering contests, blogging just for the sake of doing them, and then calling it marketing wont work.  These are all organic things, people flock to these events because they are genuinely interested in your message, not the way you convey it.  You should host a non-conformist event because you truly run against the grain, you truly love your work to the point where it's non conformist simply because you love doing it your way.<p>You should create a T-Shirt for people to wear because your company designer is really good at what he does and he wants other people to see his work.  If you're going to slap a corporate logo on there, it shouldn't LOOK like a corporate logo because your designer should have the artistic freedom and ability to stylize it and make it something people actually want to wear.  Folks shouldn't walk around with your t-shirt and simultaneously look like a PR rep.<p>Just do it, but don't do it because you can.",1220125578

Let's see, Tom Anderson created MySpace, did war-dialing in the WarGames times, got access to the Chase bank system (apparently with a default or weak password), told 40 of his friends how to do it, and they all got raided simultaneously.<p>Public figure + black hat hacking in the past = interesting?<p>There's <i>one</i> thing I found really interesting:<p>""One of the reasons Anderson would hack into living room sized mainframe systems was to get access to computers that could run a C compiler to learn programming. There were no open source or free C compilers at the time, and personal computers had very limited memory and processing power, so hackers would try to access them on other systems.""",1220125182

The creative part here is how to train users to use it. But at one hand, they will learn it because they have to. So a formatted text input is pretty good for server side to parse.<p>I saw a video about how a Beijing company use voice and text for translation on cellular phone. A tourist type what he wants to say in English and send the sms to system. The system returns a Chinese text for taxi driver to see. Another system also leave a voice message for listening if it is inconvenient for reading.<p>At the other hand. unless data plan and smart phone becomes much cheaper in developing world.
