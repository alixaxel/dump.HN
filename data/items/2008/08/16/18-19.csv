If you glance at most VCs portfolio you will see that their enterprise focused companies do better than the consumer focused startups.<p>Most entrepreneurs want to create cool products for consumers.

They know how to create beautiful and easy interfaces, and that is part of the reason The iPod and iPhone are so wildly popular.<p>Obviously, copying the Mac OS X design style might not be the best solution in the far future, but for now, as we evolve a new interface lnguage for web apps, it works well enough.<p>Also, I agree that SproutCore may not be the best solution for creating these apps. Cappuccino, by the 280 north guys looks really promising (although I haven't seen much of it).",1218911140

It's basically impossible - there's such a huge time investment that most players are unlikely to play more than one game at a time. Plus, to compete with WoW head on you have to spend their kind of budgets, which is an arms race you would be very likely to lose. Like competing with google, it's best to take an indirect approach.",1218910601

Your comment seems reflective of that belief.  I'll just point out that herding libertarians is not an easy task, and the coalition that is the Ron Paul revolution is already mostly fallen apart.  I wish it would stick around...but libertarians just aren't very strong on the collective effort front.  It was a pretty fragile coalition to start with...many of Ron Paul's supporters had one or more serious concerns about his positions (some touchy subjects: abortion, immigration, gold standard, church/state separation).",1218910022
