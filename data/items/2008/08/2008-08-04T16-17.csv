Honestly, it's not any more useful than the old one. 3G sucks the battery in only a couple of hours. I live in San Francisco and the 3G coverage is so sporadic and unreliable it switches back to edge anyway. I mainly just leave 3G off.<p>The gps is next to useless. It doesn't matter if I'm inside or outside, it never really works. I can be side by side with a Garmin that locates me exactly while the iphone only sees a 10 block radius.<p>So basically, buy an iPhone. I absolutely loved my first-gen. Had it jailbroken for the better part of a year. Edge was slow, but was reliable. The jailbroke apps that the hacker community put together were much better than the crap that's coming out of the App Store.<p>It's a great phone, but 3g/gps isn't the reason why.",1217869097

You start with single-letter passwords, and you promptly find this user's password.  The salt meant that you had to check if each user's password was ""a"" individually instead of checking them all at once -- but if the password function is fast enough and a user's password is simple enough, you'll break it anyway.",1217868915

They didn't need a budget or a strategic plan. They didn't need buy-in from anyone.<p>They didn't have to have their decisions vetted by a management team and a legal team. They almost certainly didn't do any usability testing or write a set of human interface guidelines. They didn't have to make design decisions that they could live with for the next five years, or (as with the decisions made by the designers of the original Mac OS) twenty-five years.<p>They didn't need to make an official announcement, or run a beta program lasting several months so that developers had a chance to have apps ready on launch day. They didn't have to invest in developer training materials or write formal documentation.<p>They didn't have to build an entire app store that was secure, cross-platform, usable by customers, relatively free of bugs, and ready to scale so that it would handle one million users in its first weekend.<p>And, when the jailbreak apps break, the developers don't get hammered by guys like Walt Mossberg, David Pogue, and every analyst and pundit on Wall Street. When end users complain that their phone battery life is too short, the jailbreakers don't need to respond. They aren't obligated to fix security holes or support developers who have problems. They aren't obligated to support anyone. They're open-source hackers, they can't get fired, and they always have the option to say <i>caveat emptor</i> and go do something else.<p>There's a reason why people pay for Apple's stuff.

He   clearly loves most things apple, but he wouldn't hesitate to criticize apple if they do silly things.<p>Its much more convincing to criticize his argument than just him.  He makes a strong point - Software interfaces only are as good as the head guy in charge cares about.  So if the head guy doesn't care much about the interface, the interface will suck even if there are great designers working on the project.<p>I'd say that open source software often has medium to poor interface quality is that making software look good takes a lot of time and has to be done by someone with design talent.  This isn't usually the case - usually the lead programmer decided how it would look from the beginning, or just copied some other software.<p>If anything, open source software is usually decent because they most often just copy some commercial piece of software - which is usually decent.  In the few cases where they get creative with the interface (like the gimp) it can come out half-baked because they don't spend enough time evaluating the usability of the design.

In 2005, without any authority or guidance from Congress, the FCC announced a ""policy statement."" Now, in 2008, it decided that it has the power to enforce the policy statement and announced an ""enforcement framework"" that will be applied to future complaints. Again, all this without authority or guidance from Congress. As Commissioner McDowell put it in his dissent from the Comcast order, ""Under the analysis set forth in the order, the Commission apparently can do anything [to regulate the Internet] so long as it frames its actions in terms of promoting the Internet or broadband deployment."" Can the FCC be trusted with that kind of power?

Basically you use a dictionary file to hash words from the dictionary file and store the plaintext word and the resulting hash together in a file/db/whatever.  After you've hashed every word in the dictionary, you start doing combinations: wordword, wordnumber, wordnumberword, etc...  Of course each time your add another element, you're exponentially increasing the time it takes to generate your rainbow file.<p>Using a multi-character hash is basically adding another element to the password on behalf of the end user.  Basically if we say it takes 100 hours (totally made up number, I suspect it's much higher-depending on password rules) to generate a comprehensive enough rainbow file to find an average password, if you add a 1 character alpha numeric salt, it now takes 3,600 hours to find that password.  If you add 2 characters, it now takes 129,600 hours.  And so on.<p>Using a public username (and having your attackers know that's what you're using) means that you have to generate a full rainbow file for EACH user.  So while it's not as good as a decent sized random salt, you can no longer take 100 hours of work and hope to extract 8,000 passwords from a site's password db/file.  You have to do 100 hours of work PER user, and still have a 30-50% success rate.  So to get the same 8,000 passwords you'd need to do 1,600,000 hours of work (assuming a 50% hit rate).<p>So assuming you personally are not a specific target, the site itself is numberOfUsers* more time consuming to extract X passwords from, than a site that just uses MD5 with no salt.",1217866368

The landlords didn't want to lease us space until we had the money to build out the spaces (typically $10MM per location).  By July 2001 we had more than $1,000,000 in monthly lease payments for spaces we didn't have the funds to complete.  It was a nightmare.  Once we filed Chapter 11 we were able to immediately reject the leases that we had not built out.  By cutting heads from around 60 to 16 I think and keeping only our profitable or breakeven facilities we were cashflow neutral almost immediately.  It took a couple of months and we became profitable.  Of course, it was easy without the leases.<p>At the end of the day, if I knew that I would ONLY have $20MM to build my business I could have done a great job.  The problem was that I thought I was going to have $120MM to build it - I built an infrastructure to support a $100MM business, not a $20MM.  Does this make sense?",1217866020

266390,comment,266333,266333,0,0,pjackson,,,"I used to be an Enterprise architect for a Fortune 500  company. We did many of the things you are asking about. Here are my answers:<p>1. Yes, you can. However, there will be tradeoffs. One important piece of sharing business logic involves sharing <i>instances</i> of running code, not just the logic itself. It's tough to implement a singleton in a set of stored procs. I'd recommend that you leave stored procs for the kinds of logic that you might code into a web service: transactional concerns that have a complicated set of steps.<p>2. Yes, that's a popular approach, and for good reason: the objects you create against the persistence store are sharable at the instance level.<p>3. It will scale less-well than an architecture with a solid middle tier, but it's impossible to put a user-count on it without knowing much much more. If you pick a commercial RDBS like Oracle or Sybase (and many people don't like to do that), you will find that there are a lot of expensive but effective scaling mechanisms to handle this. It's usually cheaper to invest in a decent middle tier, a caching server, and scale that way.<p>4. That's not necessarily true. Portability is nice, but there are many other reasons to pull the business logic out of the database. For example, it's hard (but not impossible) to implement an event-driven system where transactions will fire off other business events downstream when you're using a stored procedure set as your logic layer. You can do it, but you end up with triggers or batch jobs that reduce the real-time processing capabilities of the whole architecture.<p>5. P/L SQL is pretty powerful, but I still have my logic in objects rather than in Oracle. I can introduce caching and other sscaling strategies easier this way.<p>Though I use and like Oracle, I'd steer you away from it unless you have a really good reason to buy it. It takes a lot more care-and-feeding than MySQL, the licensing model becomes oppressive when you start to need to cluster the DB, and experts in the area are expensive.<p>Hibernate is a good framework. Why are you resisting the use of it? If you want to go heavy on the stored procedures, check out the iBatis framework. It's really good at ORM and stored procs.",1217865772

We just do it.  Grab 256 bits from /dev/random (or from your internal entropy pool, if you have one) and stick a salt or nonce onto password you hash and every protocol packet you send.<p><i>Of course, most of them wouldn't waste their time redesigning a password storage system; they'd use Mazieres/Provos ""bcrypt"" and be done with it.</i><p>For a straight-forward ""users logging into a website"", absolutely.  But most people who design authentication systems have more stringent requirements, like ""allow users to authenticate themselves in such a way that a bogus server can't steal their credentials"", at which point things get a bit more interesting. :-)",1217865657
