Maybe push the second line of your logo up onto the first line to compress the header?<p>Also I'd suggest you put some more constraints on the design. Pick three colors max. Also maybe limit font choice. You have at least four fonts (two in the logo, and two more in the text of the page), shifting between serif and sans-serif with all sorts of colors and weights and sizes that all add up to looking like clutter. Similarly link colors seem to be very different (the light green on a light blue background looks a lot different than the light green on the dark blue bg).<p>Font sizes in the three boxes at the bottom are too small. Also, headers on those boxes should be clickable (since there are little arrows on those headers).<p>You could try looking at one of the many CSS frameworks (I personally enjoy Blueprint) to add some cross-platform consistency to line-heights and font sizes.<p>Regarding content: It seems there are two places on the page to learn what ScribbleWiki does.

The fact is, it takes time to build the network effect inherent in business models like craigslist (and ebay, also founded 1995).<p>The current startups trying to tackle these problems all seem stuck in the 'get big fast' mode of the 2000 bubble era companies, aiming for millions of users in a couple years. It ain't gonna happen (most likely). You are most likely going to be growing slowly, and if you really want success in this field, you need patience to whether the storm of not much activity (we're talking years here, I'd say minimum 4).<p>But most start ups usually aren't built for that, they are taking 1.5 million funding, burning through it promising big returns and large growth month over month, and investors get tired of that game real quick if a site is not delivering.<p>I think it's a good opportunity from someone in the hacker news mindset to build something simple NOW, work on it on the side for a few years (4+), and see what happens.

Dell or HP competing with Apple is like XBox or Playstation competing with Nintendo. Nintendo has defined its own space, which it basically owns almost completely.

XP on this machine flies like crazy, and Ubuntu is great. Only Vista can manage to take so long to copy files to and from my USB drive, spend half an hour to empty the recycle bin, or move a file over the network - it's I/O performance is a serious hole-in-the-tub kind of affair.<p>(Note: I'm a Windows guy. Ubuntu is my preferred OS/distro; but I'm on Windows 90% of my time thanks to my job (which I love) as a systems engineer for Windows platforms.)",1219345617

But you can ""go to school"" (the school of hard knocks, that is) to learn those things YC brings too. That learning process takes time - time you may not have.</i><p>I don't fully agree with this, mainly because nobody can teach you business or anything close to business in 3 months. True, YC gives you a gist of how a start up really works and how you need to go through that process but that might not work out for you mainly because there are tons of reasons for success and failure and we hardly know them.<p>To me YC is like an identity, in a world where everyone is same it tries to make you stand out from others. If you want me to compare YC with Hollywood, the position of YC is something like Godfather. Paul Graham is to Hackers what Don Corleone was for Italian immigrants. He pretty much gives you an identity, mentorship and protection for a tiny company share. Think of the Italian Immigrants if they didn't have Godfather, they would have been badly exploited by the system and would have ended up as nobody's. Paul Graham takes the position of Don Corleone and saves Hackers from being exploted in a big bad world of Start ups and Business by being there for you. This is my personal definition of YC.<p>Hence the start of YC Mafia.",1219345571
