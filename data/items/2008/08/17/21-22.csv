What started as a one-man operation in a one-bedroom apartment has grown into a multimillion dollar business with approximately 300 full-time employees.<p>Look at how fucking ugly that first release was, back in 1999. Only persistence and dedication to a vision would have made that company successful, and that's exactly what happened.<p>To all fellow entrepreneurs out there, just release. Perfection may follow speed, but speed never follows perfection.<p>Just a dose of inspiration for y'all :).",1219010376

278639,comment,278501,278501,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Yes, we're in a bubble.  More precisely, what's going on is that the majority of startups, numerically, do <i>not</i> need a lot of money; that is, most of the good ideas out there are best pursued with a small company with few employees, since there is little benefit they could gain from loads of extra cash.  That, of course, is the idea behind YC.<p>But the VCs have loads of money, and they want to be able to use it.  And when you have this situation where there are tons of small startups that need a little cash, they get overexcited, and throw too much money at them.<p>And you get stupidity like this.",1219009980

Look, I enjoy your blog but if HN starts with the NYT, VF, US News, et al posts all day long, this won't be a place you or I want to visit.

Nevertheless, it still seems like the ""pre-packaged fun"" idea holds, as in, when they talked about ""fun"" it meant ""something pleasurable that involves minimal effort""... unless you are actually playing softball in the city. My feeling is that location makes little difference, as long as it's passive consumption.<p>If it's about kids, then, I would assume that the parents are actively thinking about what activities are beneficial, and to a great extent, encouraging the kids to participate actively themselves.",1219008944

If you don't, Streetread is an innovative, ajax-driven, news aggregator for Wall Street - collecting news from over 20 of the leading financial sites as well as all of the stocks you choose to follow. The interface and data available are very complex (jQuery - Drupal).<p>In lieu of user-demand and general sense I've decided to roll out a mobilized version of the site - with surprisingly no loss in features or convenience. Even more surprisingly was that I was able to complete the mobile development and design in two days. Like the rest of the site, it's built completely on Drupal (first complex mobile drupal app?).<p>I'm coming here for the great help and intelligence that defines this community. If anyone is interested in helping to test out this service - I would greatly appreciate it. It seems all of the coding is completely functional; my main concern is device compatibility.<p>To participate simply visit streetread.com via a computer and register a free account (takes 15 seconds). Add a comment to this thread saying ""username: <insert user name here>"". I'll enable mobile access to the account and reply to the comment once completed. You can then visit streetread.com/m/login via a mobile phone to login and begin testing. Please provide as much feedback and information as possible.<p>Thank you very much to anyone willing to help.<p>Mike",1219007046
