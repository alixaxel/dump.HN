But even in Python, you could easily hack together (not recommended) something like<p><pre><code>  list = "", "".join(data.split())

Of course, that's not robust, but the library which is robust is much simpler than the one that requires the use of a C sax parser just to be usably fast.<p>If the argument is that XML is more human-readable, that is implying that it's being human-modified, and then XML creates more work since it's so verbose. If the verbosity is not an issue because it's auto-generated, that implies that it's not being read/modified by humans, and the whole point of using XML in the first place is lost.

Those can be stolen, bought, etc. And I would imagine are less secure than your average secure website. The difference comes when an exploit is found.

My voting location is literally across the street from the Democratic local offices. It makes me very uncomfortable. They always have pollsters doing exit polls and the people in line are almost all Democrats. They are loud, argumentative... It's an all around bad experience.

San Francisco and the Bay Area.<p>We’re a green power marketplace and clean tech network that builds a customer base to buy retail green electricity. Most clean energy companies focus on developing new technologies, but the largest market opportunity is to compete with utilities at the top of the food chain in the retail electricity market. The single greatest opportunity we will ever have to reconfigure the relationship between people and utilities is to capture the surge of interest in clean energy.<p>No existing websites help people find, within seconds, the best clean energy options in their area. We make it fun and easy for people to find and compare clean energy options based on price and customer satisfaction.<p>We’re also building the first national marketplace where solar owners can sell, retire, or donate renewable energy certificates by clicking just once or twice from an email update. There’s more, of course. Apply below to see the demo site and to learn about our business plan.<p>Looking for: 
Lead engineers and designers to join the team as technical co-founders. Founder is a renewable energy industry expert and former engineer (not CS).<p>You are a person who:
Understands and enjoys the social networking world; is willing to develop an interest in auction platforms and commodities markets; leverages open source as much as possible; builds data and API-driven websites; takes initiative and doesn’t require excessive direction; knows and owns up to your shortcomings;  values open communication; and likes brainstorming and working with in small groups.<p>Additional: 
You must have patience. The clean tech community and market, while valuable, won’t hit their prime until around 2012, when one day we’ll look at a spreadsheet and realize the world has changed. You must want to build a viable business, solve technical problems for a social end, value transparency, want to crack the great monopoly of investor-owned utilities...and help solve this climate change thing along the way.<p>Technical requirements:
Current platform is built on PHP, Java and MySQL. From here on out it’s your job to decide coding details and to justify your decisions. You should be experienced and smart enough to both setup the right architecture and to inspire others to join our team. You should care about UI design as much as you do code.<p>Offer:
Equity. A very large target market to attack. A technical challenge that will only grow over time. A crash course in clean tech, the electricity market, and community-building. Opportunity to build a nationally recognized company and make meaningful decisions.<p>Funding status: 
Investors want to see a public launch before considering funding. Help me get to a public launch.<p>Development status:
Moving on from an alpha site to a public beta launch in the next three months.<p>To Apply:
Please send links to your past work, blogs or other writing samples, a resume with references, and, if available, any original graphic or UI design that represents your aesthetic. If we have promising chemistry I will likely ask you to interview with contacts who are engineers who have built successful companies and can judge your programming ability in advance better than I.

The beliefs system itself it resilient to refutation, and can ""self-heal"" if any of its predictions are proven false. While core principles cannot be proven false, they may require some suspension of disbelief from a reasonable person.  By their very nature such sets of beliefs are very powerful, and tend to spread and persist.
