</code></pre>
and<p><pre><code>    a = 1      + 2

In fact I wish Python were <i>more</i> sensitive to whitespace, then I could say my-variable without it mistaking a hyphen for a minus.",1219413499

283668,comment,283639,283639,0,0,gaius,,,"My experience is that the languages are similar in terms of features, but the communities are very different and there isn't much overlap between them. Ruby types tend to be younger, focussed on the web, probably employed as full-time  developers. Python types tend to be older and not employed as developers, but write code as part of their main jobs. Python people often have experienced a nightmare of unmaintainable Perl, that is why there is the insistence on there being one right way to do everything (which is the exact opposite of what Perl people believe). Ruby people (being younger and hence less experienced) haven't, which is  why they talk about expressiveness and do things like monkey-patching. Neither group is ""smarter"" and neither language is ""better"". The choice is a choice of what community you want to join, not a technical one.",1219412892

The good things are multi-line lambdas (which Ruby calls blocks) and loose syntax rules, which I found weird at first but is the secret behind all of that DSL stuff.<p>The bad thing is the cultural tendency of the Ruby community towards monkey patching, which in my opinion trades long term maintainability for short term convenience.",1219412451

283659,comment,283639,283639,0,0,jonhohle,,,"this is never really brought up, but objects in ruby fully encapsulate their instance and class variables. the only way to get at them from the outside is by sending an object a message asking for them (like Smalltalk or Objective-C). what appears to be setting a property on an object, is really calling a method: `foo.bar = 5` isn't directly setting the property, its calling a method named `#bar=`<p>in my opinion, this is powerful and elegant.<p>that being said, i have little experience with python, but what i've seen never wowed me. it seems like it has a well written collection of libraries, but that seems to come from the community more than the language. correct me if i'm wrong.",1219412071

283656,comment,283366,283420,0,0,tstegart,,,"Yeah, if you're polite about it people will understand. I don't think you'll have too much of a problem if you think up solutions before hand. So instead of waiting for it to happen, write down now what you will do, what you will say to people if the wrong script is posted, and make sure you're very consistent about it.<p>Also, remember, if someone's script is posted without permission they might be mad, but there is always the possibility they would have posted it themselves. So every time you're contacted about a script it wouldn't hurt to say: ""We're sorry your script got posted. We'll take it down immediately. A lot of people found it really useful, would you consider putting it back up under your own name?""",1219411822

I don't appreciate being mocked when I'm trying to have a discussion. Compilers also happen to be part of my work, but that's beside the point.<p>Introducing a new scope would, I think, introduce more corner cases than the ugliness of the new syntax. (And I do agree that it's ugly in the context of C++ which already has a function syntax.) Right now, scopes are only introduced inside namespaces, classes/structs, functions, and explicit braces. Having a new scope start <i>before</i> a function and its parameters are declared is counter-intuitive to me.<p>Now, I might actually be willing to take counter-intuitive semantics to avoid the syntactic ugliness, but that's not my point. The point I've been trying to make is that the committee has considered these issues; they didn't blindly make a bunch of decrees.",1219411694

283642,comment,283639,283639,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't think Python lacks much, if anything.  It's a very fine language, with a great community.  Over the years though, I just lost interest in it, and have come to prefer Ruby after having rediscovered it because of Rails.  It's pretty much a matter of taste: I like the syntax and convenience more.<p>One (fairly minor) real world case where the syntax makes a difference is in web templates: you can use Ruby pretty much straight up to do templating, but Python requires more hoops and hacking, due in part to the whitespace issue.  I like the fact that Ruby is flexible enough to be used as-is for templates as well as other code.  BTW, it also needs to be said that that is the <i>only</i> place I've ever noticed the whitespace issue being any kind of problem: it's not the big deal that some python detractors make it out to be.<p>In short: if you're happy with Python...great!  Keep using it, you made a good choice.  If you want to learn another language, pick something a bit further from it... say, Erlang, Tcl, Java, or C, depending on what your needs are.",1219410495
