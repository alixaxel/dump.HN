There's almost no meaning there.  It's just filler.  Other competitors don't have this problem: ""remote procedure call"" directly evokes what's happening (a synchronous call and response); likewise what an ORB does is, in fact, brokerage of object requests.   All you get from REST is that you're sending some ""stuff"" from one place to another, and a vague promise that it's ""state"" (data) instead of behavior.<p>If REST really wanted to pick a good name, wouldn't it involve the notion of ""stateless resources as URLs"" somewhere?  They're kinda the central point.<p>Look: the point here isn't to smack about REST's name.  I don't care what you call it, that's not the problem.  The problem is that a lot of REST proponents actually think that REST invented a lot of stuff (like, heh, representing state) that are just pre-existing good ideas to which it gave a name.",1219082422
