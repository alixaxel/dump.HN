269752,comment,269580,269719,0,0,akeefer,,,"Agreed, static functions are (in my experience) much easier to test precisely because they generally have very explicit inputs and outputs, whereas instance methods are more likely to have ""implicit"" inputs in the form of object state and to have side effects, often in the form of modifying object state, rather than explicit outputs.  My experience is that basically the closer you get to pure functional programming, with no global state and no side effects, the easier testing is.<p>The item about polymorphism strikes me as bogus too.  But then again, I absolutely abhor mocks, because my experience has been that the mocks end up diverging from the real production code and you end up with either tests that don't break when the app is broken or tests that break when the app isn't broken, so optimizing for mocking is a horrible idea in my book.<p>Composition over inheritance is generally a good idea, but it is actually useful for testability, though not for the reasons the author mentions.  Deep inheritance hierarchies make things hard to test because testing a leaf class in the hierarchy naturally means you're testing every other class up the chain, making it very hard to test just the code on that leaf class.  Deep hierarchies like that also usually involve some contract between the different levels that's inherently hard to test for.",1218127388

GNUStep, while a noble effort, is largely a copy of the pre-OSX-era NeXTSTEP API (although I guess technically it's trying to rebuild Openstep, but it seems the history of these projects is so confusing that NeXTSTEP is used interchangeably because it's so iconic), which is literally a decade behind.<p>GNUStep is not seem to be, nor does it seem to want to be, an effort like Mono to create an open Mac OS X platform (at least last time I looked at it, which was late. It also can't use some of the finest decisions that Apple and NeXT made (e.g., "".bundle"", "".app"" and "".framework"" paradigms) because the underlying linux platform is hostile to them.<p>Comparing modern OS X to gnustep as anything more than a historical curiosity shows a degree of ignorance and dismissiveness that borders on flagrant.

I think his point was that you want to separate the code that interprets your data from the code that builds your data so that they can be tested in isolation.  That makes a lot of sense to me.  The ""bad code"" end of this spectrum would be an algorithm in the application logic that can only run when connected to a fully-stocked external data store.  That's not very testable; ideally you want to suck in a ""test set"" from a file or whatever and hand it to the algorithm instead.<p>But yeah, it's not as simple as removing ""new"" calls from application logic; it depends entirely on what you're trying to construct.",1218127066

The argument is that procedural code is hard to test because ... it doesn't have a capacity for overloading in a test?!  It's like the guy has never heard of a stub function before.  Or formal verification. He thinks about testing only in terms of OOP, and hits a wall when he gets out of his comfort range that he <i>thinks</i> is a generic point of testing theory.
