Its simple, our unique knowledge will easily make you good, great, and lots of money."" Its like a broken record if you know to listen for it.",1218740271

I'm on my second Porsche worth of personal money plowed into the thing (ok, second Porsche boxter... I'm probably still on my first, you know, real Porsche.)<p>I dono.  I mean, my company breaks even these days... most of what I've gotten out of it is experience and contacts (and those are worth something... my bill rate as a consultant verges on ridiculous, and I have a book deal.  Pretty good for a Midwestern hick with no formal education.)  I don't regret doing it, but if I had a chance to do it over I'd focus more on being more public (blogging, documenting, etc...)  and less on the actual business.<p>If I could 'open source' my project, I think that would magnify the benefits (that is, credibility and contacts)   But you can't really 'open source' an ISP, which is essentially what I am.<p>So yeah, personally I'd advise you to go for option #2, unless you can get significant investment from someone else.<p>But then, you sound like you started from a different position than I did.  It's possible that because I had so little when I started the credibility is worth a lot more to me than it is worth to you.<p>Also, I have my own conflict of interest... your project sounds pretty cool, and I'd like to be able to use that technology for my own projects, or use products built by other people using that technology.

Newton showed that the apple falls to the ground according to the same laws that govern the Moon's orbit of the Earth. And with this he made the old differentiation between earthly and heavenly phenomena obsolete. Darwin showed that there is no dividing line between man and animal. And Einstein lifted the line dividing space and time. But in our heads, we still draw a dividing line between ""reality"" and ""knowledge about reality"", in other words between reality and information. And you cannot draw this line. There is no recipe, no process for distinguishing between reality and information. All this thinking and talking about reality is about information, which is why one should not make a distinction in the formulation of laws of nature. Quantum theory, correctly interpreted, is information theory.<p>And can you explain all these strange quantum phenomena conclusively with your information concept?<p>Not all of them yet, but we're working on it. With limitation it works excellently.<p>How?<p>I imagine that a quantum system can carry only a limited amount of information, which is sufficient only for a single measurement. Let's come back to the situation of two particles colliding like billiard balls, and in so doing entering a state of limitation. In terms of information theory that means that after the collision the entire information is smeared over both particles, rather than the individual particles carrying the information. And that means the entire information we have pertains to the relationship between both particles. For that reason, by measuring the first particle I can anticipate the speed of the second. But the speed of the first particle is entirely random.<p>Because the information isn't sufficient.<p>Exactly. Its randomness is ultimately a consequence of the finiteness of the information.",1218738394

Neither of the options you have provided would equate to 'giving up'.
So I would give a definate NO to giving up.<p>Treating your project as a research project does not equate to giving up.<p>I don't know enough about this market/competitors/technology/market size, etc to define what you should do going forward.<p>The question I think you should be asking is 'is this a viable business'.<p>I suspect most of the YC community who are telling you to go for it! are potentially speaking from a start-up attitude of 'live the dream' etc. etc. 
They may be right, but not every business is a good business.<p>Your technology might be the best out there, I just don't know. Personally, I wasn't blown-away by the demos, but I'm not saying that to be harsh, just that from my perspective, I'm not seeing your competitive advantage. 
You've put a bunch of work into this, and it may be the best in the market and able to make a significant contribution to the world.<p>Does your university have a business school, or entrepreneurs club or something?
