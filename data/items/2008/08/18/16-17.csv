279393,comment,279251,279290,0,0,ericb,,,"I have nothing to do with the site or author, but I can suggest the following:<p>-Google defaults to under-emphasizing results related to errors specific in newer versions of software. So when a bug in a new release comes out, info is often no where to be seen--it is obscured by older items with higher rank.<p>-Google includes links to both questions, and answers. I only want answers.<p>-Google's results are across multiple pages and obscured in forum discussions. I want one page with all the answers and info.<p>-Google frequently returns results from experts exchange, which involves scrolling to the bottom.  Additionally, I've talked to developers who don't even realize the unobscured answer is at the bottom.<p>-Some code queries do not translate well into regular searches because the characters have meaning.  Off the top of my head example: select * from blah<p>-There is not always a nice centralized place to go to share it with the world know when you have a fix.<p>That said, I'm not sure this site implements solutions to all these problems, but a wiki-type site could.

However, I just don't believe that PG & co are capable of separating the potential winners from the losers based on a short application and a 10 minute interview. So many factors affect the success of a startup and I don't think that anyone can have such predictive abilities based on so little input. Maybe YC knows is good at filtering out the lowest 40% or so, but between the teams that have <i>some</i> viability I believe it's simply impossible to call which will succeed and which won't using YC's selection method.<p>The only way to measure YC's ability in picking winners is to to have PG & co rate a bunch of non-YC founding teams at the early stage of their startups, wait a few years, and see how well their predictions held up against more or less random predictions. The experiment must involve non YC startups is that YC enhances their startups' chances of success, which can create the likely false impression that YC excels at picking successful teams rather than at guiding the teams it happens to pick to success.",1219078647
