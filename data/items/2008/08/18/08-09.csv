At the same time, there could be 400 Lisp postings and then 500 the next month (100 new postings as compared to 14), and that would only be a 25% growth",1219049965

279090,comment,278250,278947,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Let's look at a more complex example. Assume ""page"" is a list of strings. We want to get every word on the page (exact whitespace treatment and tokenizing behavior isn't important; just the gist)<p>Python:<p><pre><code>  (word for line in page for word in line.split())\n</code></pre>\nC#:<p><pre><code>  from line in page, word in line.Split() select word\n</code></pre>\nI think that translates to:<p><pre><code>  page.SelectMany(line => line.Split())\n</code></pre>\nThe Python is a bit confusing; the first C# example is much easier to read. Verbosity is traded for understanding. It is a careful balancing act, but I prefer the balance in C# in this instance. (Don't get me wrong, C# and Python are by far my two favorite languages, I love them both)",1219049784

279085,comment,278927,278927,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The whole intuition thing is rather questionable. You learn how things work and then you get used to them. It doesn't matter much whether it's an apple icon or a start button. Neither shouts ""shutdown!"".<p>It's much more important how much work frequently repeated actions take once you know them. No keyboard shortcut can ever be intuitive in the sense you could have suspected what it does without learning about it. But it's quick and you can remember it. That's what counts.<p>Are regular expressions intuitive? No, but just imagine you had to do pattern matching with a language full of very intuitive words, like SQL or COBOL say :)",1219049058

Also, truth be told, to me it's not a very exciting language - I suspect that a lot of other people interested in 'cutting edge' type of things felt the same way, and the 'staid, solid, enterprisey' crowd was pretty happy with Java, which leaves something of a gap.",1219048508

279068,comment,279044,279044,0,0,cperciva,,,"I think part of the reason for the Y Combinator hate is that the valuations YC offers are so low and it's not clear whether YC significantly helps the teams it funds.  Wait, don't throw those tomatoes, let me explain!<p>The valuation YC offers -- a median of 250k for a two-person team -- would be absurdly high if it was being offered to <i>any</i> team of two recent college graduates; but YC doesn't make offers to just any team.  YC only picks the best teams (about 5% of applicants if I'm remembering the statistics correctly)... and it's not unreasonable to expect that the top 5% of teams are worth far more than average.<p>Similarly, the chance of a YC-funded team succeeding (for whatever definition of ""success"" you choose) is much higher than the chance of a non-YC-funded team succeeding -- but this doesn't necessarily imply that YC is helping the companies it funds.  It might just be that YC is very good at picking winning teams.<p>This isn't to say that YC is making all of its money by taking advantage of the people it funds, though: Simply by selecting those top 5% of teams, YC provides a very valuable service -- distinguishing teams which have a 50%+ chance of success from those with a 5% chance of success, and encouraging the teams with a 50%+ chance, is certainly economically useful; and the profit which accrues to YC as a result of that is not qualitatively different from the profits which any other smart investor makes by figuring out that a stock is undervalued -- in both cases, the investor is doing work to increase the efficiency of a market.<p>The economist in me wishes that we could experimentally separate the selection process from the 3 month YC program in order to determine their relative importance -- but somehow I doubt the YC crew would be interested in running an experiment where they either (a) pick good teams and only fund half of them (in order to determine whether the teams they identified as good were likely to succeed with or without YC), or (b) fund a ""good cohort"" and a ""bad cohort"" of applicants simultaneously (in order to determine if being funded by YC is enough to make anybody successful).<p>(In addition to the difficulty of running such an experiment, the YC crew might not want to have this question answered: They probably don't want to be confronted by teams saying ""well, <i>were</i> interested in being funded at a valuation of $200k -- but knowing that YC thinks that we're a strong team has resulted in us increasing our self-valuation to $800k"".)<p>But in the absence of experimental data, the question remains open, with all the attached room for anti-capitalist hatred: Does YC help the teams it funds... or are they just shrewd investors?",1219047361

I think it's a perfectly fine Sunday night article, given how apparent it is to anyone reading TC's article comments how many people are especially critical of YC companies and YC itself.<p>It's true that YC companies receive more exposure than similarly-early non-YC companies. Well, that's one of the benefits. With YC acting as some sort of filter for minimum quality, blogs like TechCrunch know there's at least something worth looking at.",1219047267
