Generally I can get something working in just a few minutes but then I spend another 5-10 really polishing it up in 5+ small iterations on it (all test driven, so I know my changes still work).<p>Hoff's point was well above that, at the design/macro level. For that I alternate releases between adding features and house cleaning (bug fixes, refactorings, etc). With a sufficiently short iteration time, you can appease both the client/users with new features and the developers by keeping things clean and happy.",1217879962

A good friend refuses to use MS Office for Mac because she is afraid of incompatibilities.  This is rational.

She can't tolerate additional risk in her workflow.<p>Continuing to use her, and Office for Mac, as an example, ""opportunity cost"" means that she can bill to her clients at a pretty good hourly rate, or she can spend her time learning about and deploying Parallels and Bootcamp so she could enjoy OS X and still be confident that her Office documents will be viewable and editable by her colleagues.

It looks like custom software, I can't see any 'powered by' icons or any credits.<p>How many things will you be selling? Also important, do you make it yourself or does someone else make it and you'll be reselling? There are a lot of options for selling on commission (aka Amazon), dropshipping, and the like.",1217877041
