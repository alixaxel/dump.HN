279911,comment,279437,279437,0,0,rmenke,,,"Depends on your expected rate of growth, and how much time you expect each developer to waste in bootstrapping and mentoring.  When you consider getting your third developer, then is the time to start thinking about documentation processes (as in managed and computer-accessible, not Z or UML).<p>Having been the second in a few startups, I can tell you that not having any sort of documentation is annoying. Do not expect anyone to read your code and understand how your mind works: if you don't document, you will have to sacrifice a significant amount of time training the new employee. You'll have to hire during a lull, and in a startup there's never a lull. As usual, Fred Brooks said it first.<p>Finally, Twitter is a good example of what acting first then designing second can achieve: unfixable scaling issues. Don't do that.",1219111090

If the display is large enough and easy on the eyes and the interface simple and intuitive I can imagine a device capturing a certain following. Other things like price of the unit, prices and restrictions on books, and portability will be addressed if the market is there.<p>I remember reading ebooks on my Palm several years ago and finding it a less-than-enjoyable experience.

Make a buyout date and clause. Value the IP based on time, calculate your share and set an end date on your agreementpast which you can demand cash from him for your stake. This way he may have final say on all issues, but if you disagree with the general direction after a couple months you can deal him a punishment by demanding a cash out. It is vital to set said date and amount in writing at the outset.",1219109304

Baen Books has been selling speculative fiction in non-DRMed e-book formats for years and (disregarding the fact that almost all of their stuff is shit) it's done very well for them. Cory Doctorow gives away all his books for free, and it's increasingly a tactic adopted by others in the speculative fiction business; four of the five nominees for the Hugo Award this year were released in DRM-free format (for FREE, even) so Hugo voters could have a better chance of reading them.<p>So, if this is the early stage of e-books, I wonder what it'll look like when the market is mature.",1219108201

I'd be really upset if I got permanently locked out, but all can be reset by phone.<p>- Digg, Reddit, News.YC, even Facebook:  Not important stuff, free.  I wouldn't really care if I have to make another account.<p>- Gmail:  This is the only one which doesn't fit.  However, I use it daily, so I'm not going to forget my password.  On the flip side, if I used it only once a year, it obviously wouldn't be that important to me.<p>Yeah, I know it's not very realistic, and it's probably not something I'm willing to practice myself.
