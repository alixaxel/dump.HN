267465,comment,267170,267199,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"You remind me of Orson Scott Card's essay ""How Software Companies Die"":<p><i>You can domesticate programmers the way beekeepers tame bees. You can't exactly communicate with them, but you can get them to swarm in one place and when they're not looking, you can carry off the honey. You keep these bees from stinging by paying them money. More money than they know what to do with. But that's less than you might think. You see, all these programmers keep hearing their parents' voices in their heads saying ""When are you going to join the real world?"" All you have to pay them is enough money that they can answer (also in their heads) ""Geez, Dad, I'm making more than you."" On average, this is cheap.</i><p>This is not exactly in line with what we're talking about here - the founder type seems less likely to be satisfied in the described situation.

Intelligent people from differing fields getting together will yield creativity on par or better than when everyone from the same industry gets together.  Unless your idea of useful creativity is 500 Bay area companies doing web feed readers from back a few years ago or everyone working on Facebook apps now.  Alot of really great tech ideas don't come from the Bay area.  You may not hear about them, but they are out there.  So maybe your premise should actually be stated as:<p>""if you want to come up with an idea that everyone in the Bay area will like, than you should move to the Bay area.""",1217946087
