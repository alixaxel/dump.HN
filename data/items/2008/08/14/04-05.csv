But it's now sort of frowned upon by educated elites, whereas spending the same amount of money on an imported marble shower is en vogue.<p>Read Bobos In Paradise for a detail as to why.",1218689926

A stifling regiment of ideological political correctness.<p>In current times most young people would be well advised to avoid Universities and Colleges.  After 4 years of classes they come out dumber than when they went in.",1218689913

A large number of people who actually belong in the last category will try to rationalize their theft as ""I don't like DRM"" or ""it's too expensive"" (though his games probably cost half of what they spend on SMS each month) ""intellectual property is fascism"", etc. I'd bet that almost all of them really just want games and don't want to pay for them.",1218689594

275822,comment,275792,275811,0,0,Alex3917,,,"One of my friends was in a full body cast for about four months because when he was in sixth grade someone slid into him while playing baseball and broke one of his legs and his pelvis. My little brother also broke his leg when someone slid into him. Neither has any persisting problems, but a lot of kids do. I have a friend whose legs are different lengths because she stepped in a hole while playing soccer and fractured her growth plates.<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with the article, but also realize that their argument is a straw man. Of course playground equipment that has the potential to give one a scrape or a bruise is good, assuming your kid is one of the ones who gets a scrape or a bruise. If your kid is one of the ones who dies or develops some lifelong problem then it's a different story.",1218688815

275811,comment,275792,275792,0,0,thedob,,,"Let's say that a township little league wants to put its foot down and take the stance that there's no way they'll ban sliding into bases, as that's not baseball, and as a result it just isn't American.<p>The insurance company says that for the little league to get insurance it's going to cost twice as much if they allow sliding. Hence the little league has no choice but the pass on the cost of participation to the parents of the kids in the league. Or...the kids won't ever know what it's like to slide into a base. What an unfortunate situation.<p>The rising costs of insurance are preventing children from getting enough exercise, and hence leading to health problems in the future costing the insurance companies more money in health related payouts. If this is the case, then they should be able to offset any short term liability payouts by the long term gains of a healthier society.",1218687840

More specifically, an entrepreneur who can integrate different fields together to create new field. And at some point you will have to become the specialist of that new field. So you gotta throw away the jack-of-all-trade mentality.<p>I'm a musician too. So let's use music analogue. Good musicians often can play in many different musical styles. (a jack-of-all-trade) However, great musicians experiment with various styles and create new ones. (e.g. Duke Ellington for early jazz) Here's the critical part. Plenty of musicians ""experiment"" but they don't master these new styles or techniques. The work is lost and they will be forgotten. But the one who do master them will move music into a new era.<p>Being a jack-of-all-trade means you can learn very well. So use that ability to learn something very well.",1218687430

The authors target market is not people who are going to steal his product... it is people who can and want to pay for it.<p>By giving it away free and simply hoping people will pay for it, he will go broke fast.<p>He should be happy that people are pirating his game, somewhat, as that creates a buzz that will get people to pay for it who don't want to spend there time messing around trying to get it.  The people who steal the game, were likely never going to pay for it, and they are more like a marketing expense.",1218687148
