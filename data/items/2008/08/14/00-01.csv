275685,comment,275277,275530,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Democracy is neither a means to an end, or an end in itself. It's a form of government. It's not an opinion. Perhaps you meant ""My opinion about democracy: is it a means to an end for me or an end to itself""<p>That would make more sense, but then you would not be talking about democracy, you'd be talking about your own opinion (which you're very well entitled to do)<p>Democracy is just a closer representation of the natural legislature of the body politic than many other forms of government. In fact, true democracies are so close that Hobbesian Law usually takes place, which is why a representative republic is much more tasty than true democracy.<p>BTW, there are no true democracies in the world today as far as I know. Thank goodness.",1218674949

From about 1945 until the 70's, the US had an unfair competitive advantage over the rest of the world: our industrial capacity wasn't blown up. This led to an artificially large manufacturing sector in the US (we were exporting goods to the rest of the world). Once they fully recovered (roughly the 70's), there was no need for this.<p>If you want to bring back the rust belt, you'll probably need to start a large war in Europe and Asia...",1218674607

275666,comment,275277,275277,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Hogwash.<p>Free market regimes that happen to be authoritarian have succeeded because of extrinsic reasons (international conditions), not intrinsic ones (the authoritarian model is fundamentally a better one than the democratic model).<p>During the Cold War, democratic regimes that were not free market (or did not sufficiently recognize private property, specifically private property owned by former colonial powers (i.e., US and Europe)) were consistently harassed or even toppled by the dominant superpower (see Allende's Chile, Mossadegh's Iran). For the most part, those regimes that were toppled were replaced by authoritarian (but free market) regimes.<p>In the last half of the 21st century, being a free market regime was both a necessary and a sufficient condition for survival, whereas being a democratic regime was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for survival. These two facts strongly encourage the success of authoritarian free market regimes.<p>Why weren't there more democratic free market regimes during the Cold War? Well, they certainly existed in Western Europe, but the development story there is complicated by Europe's historically high levels of development (and the Marshall Plan).<p>Why weren't there more democratic free market regimes in developing countries? Democracy is susceptible to populist acts. Much of the private property in developing countries was owned by former colonial powers. A democratic government would be very tempted to dabble in nationalism (and nationalization), risking external regime overthrow.<p>If the West is puzzled by the success of Singapore and China, they should examine the history of their own foreign relations. The West gradually opened up to China as China gradually became more free market, despite the fact that China didn't (at all) open up politically. Had the conditions for Western engagement been political rather than economic, we might have seen a democratic (but perhaps not free market) China.",1218673542

Many of the reasons for it being useful (instrument construction, notational complexity) are no longer show stoppers. Anyone who can create software that makes it practical and intuitive to create good-sounding music using natural 'just' intervals or/and alternative scales could shake up the entire world of music. 'Scala' is a nice tool but it doesn't count. Bonus points for being able to automatically convert existing 12-tone music to just intervals in a way that makes it sound better.",1218672443
