It is not unreasonable for the federal government to control materiel moving over the border. There's not even a ""reasonable clause"" notion here, as a complete and thorough search are asssumed at ports of entry -- otherwise the government would be defrauding the social contract by not being concerned enough about what's happening there.<p>How else would you run a border? Hey guys, what do you feel like showing me that you're moving? This laptop smells like it has encrypted money on it?<p>They're not investigating a crime, they're controlling movement. That's their job.<p>There used to be (and still is, I think) a crime of carrying so much undeclared cash across the border -- whether or not its yours or not. One could argue that the IP contained on a laptop easily could be more valuable than the cash limit, but there are no similar regulations on IP movement. With cell phones becoming e-wallets, seems like it would be easy to walk across the border with a couple hundred k loaded on your cell phone.

A lot of people really like hating Perl.<p>I think it goes beyond basic dislike of the language...that would require knowledge of the language, which is pretty clearly lacking in many of the flames.  I suspect it's often human tribal tendencies.  Rubyists and Pythonistas see another tribe competing in the very same environment with very similar capabilities (because, let's face it, mild syntactic differences aside Perl, Python and Ruby are more alike than they are different when compared to almost any other language), and they also see an opportunity to combine to beat up on a currently larger and older tribe.<p>By the time you've spent enough time with a language to get past identifying with just that one tribe, you don't feel as aggressive an urge to pontificate on the suckage of other languages.",1217889019
266868,comment,266657,266657,0,0,kennyroo,,,"Newspapers are dying because the half-life for headlines today is much, much shorter today than it was in the past and because other options are faster and free.  Today's printed newspaper is by definition yesterday's news.  Who wants to pay for old news? Imagine  a web site that charged for yesterday's news.  Wouldn't it fail miserably too?<p>The problem is that online news isn't really free -- it requires funding from the dying offline business because online news doesn't have a viable business model. In fact, a lot of people don't start with the news provider's site at all -- we start with news aggregators and then do quick dives into provider sites without leaving a trace of revenue in their pockets.  This simply can't last.  The offline business will go broke before the online business can be made workable at this rate.<p>Successful news providers in the future will need to start with a much cheaper cost structure to match a much lower revenue model.  Current media companies may not be able to make that transition.  None of them are moving fast enough, and most won't even acknowledge the simple reality that there is simply no future for the printed daily newspaper.",1217888863

266856,comment,266456,266716,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Your #3 hidden cost is nonsensical in the context of CPAN.  The libraries are Open Source, and usually heavily tested by both automated tests and hundreds or thousands of users, and if you grok Perl enough to roll your own, then you grok it enough to fix a bug in the library.  You'd have ten times the number of bugs to fix if you wrote it yourself, at least I would...maybe you're just that much better of a developer than I am.<p>As for #1...CPAN search works pretty well.  Google can also help.  Obviously every hacker is doing <i>something somewhat novel</i> or else they would just be using existing software...but the point of CPAN is to insure you don't have to do the boring crap over and over again.  Session management?  Done.  Database access?  Yep.  Payment processing?  Sure.  Templates?  Definitely.  Internationalization?  Well, you still have to hire the translators.  Processing and spitting out XML, HTML, YAML, JSON, RSS, etc.?  Of course.<p>So, either you're writing all of this from scratch, or your software is anemic and lacks basic APIs and data export capabilities and interoperability and good security, etc.  I'm sure your app will kick ass when you finish it two years from now.<p>As for 2...does evaluating a couple of competing libs really take longer than writing one from scratch?  Maybe, for some classes of problem.  But there's a lot of stuff that just takes a lot of code to accomplish.<p><i>""oh, I need to master this super powerful technique"", not boring ones like: ""oh, I need to get in touch with the maintainer of this library to implement a new feature I need if he so chooses"".</i><p>I don't even really know how to respond to this one, but I'll take a stab at it.  Is a template engine a ""super powerful technique"" that you're excited to figure out?  Payment processing?  Session handling?  How about a test harness?  Form validation?

266851,comment,266663,266727,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In my physics courses, they used to call these ""Fermi estimates"" because apparently Enrico Fermi was really, really good at them.<p>The point of them is to show you can creatively use what you know to come up with a very quick ballpark figure.  This sort of estimation comes up surprisingly often in real life:<p>1. In physics labs, it was often useful to do a quick estimate of roughly what the answer <i>should</i> be and the likely direction of the error.  That way, if we got something way off, we could check the equipment immediately and rerun the experiment if necessary, instead of going home, analyzing everything, finding out we were way off, and having to go <i>back</i> to the lab and collect everything again.<p>2. When selecting an algorithm, it's good to be able to estimate roughly what the input size will be, so you know if say an N^4 or N! algorithm will work, or if you really need to get it down to linear or N log N.<p>3. When selecting a startup to work at, it's useful to do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of its market size, to give you an idea of what the startup may sell or IPO for and hence how much you can make off stock options.<p>4. When founding a startup, it's good to do a back-of-the-envelope estimate of your costs and potential revenues, to make sure that you're not totally uneconomical.  (This sort of estimation could probably have prevented debacles like AllAdvantage or Pets.com.)<p>5. When investing in growth stocks, you can get a good sanity check by estimating their potential market size.  For example, in 2002 Akamai was trading at a total market cap of $150M.  I did a quick calculation based on the number of computers on the Internet, and figured that the only way they could conceivably be worth $150M or less was if they went bankrupt.  Then the question becomes the strength of their product offering and their capital structure, and both of these had fairly easy answers.",1217887939

266834,comment,266790,266790,0,0,mhartl,,,"Rails bootstrapping is even more complicated than it looks.  As Adam noted, at Insoshi we <i>used</i> to use<p><pre><code>  $ rake install
</code></pre>
The source of this is<p><pre><code>  require 'active_record'
  require 'active_record/fixtures'

  desc ""Install Insoshi""
  task :install => :environment do |t|
    Rake::Task[""db:migrate""].invoke
    Preference.create!
  end

</code></pre>
But in edge Insoshi, which uses Rails 2.1, we switched to a simple script in order to accommodate the new way to handle gem dependencies:<p><pre><code>  $ script/install
</code></pre>
It looks like this:<p><pre><code>  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  # Create some files and directories so they won't be created as root.
  # This doesn't do the actual installation, since that needs to be done as root.
  system(""rake gems:install"")
  # Install the gem dependencies (if any).
  system(""sudo rake gems:install"")
  # Run the main install task.
  system(""rake install"")
</code></pre>
You can see that it calls the installation Rake task at the end.  Why not just put the gems:install task in the Rake task?  This seems like it should work:<p><pre><code>  require 'active_record'
  require 'active_record/fixtures'

  desc ""Install Insoshi""
  task :install => :environment do |t|
    Rake::Task[""gems:install""].invoke
    system(""sudo rake gems:install"")
    Rake::Task[""db:migrate""].invoke
    Preference.create!
  end
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, running all the Rake tasks together like this fails, since the install task relies on the gem dependencies being met, but they <i>aren't</i> met at the time the environment gets loaded.  (If there is a way to <i>force</i> an environment reload inside Rake, that would work, but I don't know how to do that.)<p>So, to ensure the greatest flexibility, maybe standard installation <i>shouldn't</i> be a Rake task.  I admit that feels a bit weird, but unless we can crack the environment reload problem I don't see any other way.",1217887353
