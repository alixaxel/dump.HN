(I suppose it's actually the non-jew who is causing it. That's not a problem for the non-jew, but a jew should not use an elevator knowing it's going to cause someone to violate the shabbos.)<p>That's why they added all the batteries and stuff, and that's also why it's not simply a joke. The ""loophole"" if you will is the non-jew pressing the buttons, and that's fine. Non-jews are not required to keep shabbos, and you'd be all set. But the jew must not cause another jew to violate the shabbos, hence disconnecting from the grid.<p>You might ask: what about lights and stuff that are left on? And indeed there are those who run on batteries all shabbos. But the majority say that the jew is not doing any action by leaving the light on, and it's only actions that are a problem. For example: everyone agrees that it's ok to leave a fire running on shabbos, as long as you don't make it larger or smaller, same with the lights.",1217901339

The point is not that the mathematical expressiveness of the network model is as powerful or more powerful than what you can do with relational stuff.  The point is that the network model maps nearly 1:1 with the actual programming model used to implement the application logic.<p>All that relational goodness does you no good if you want to architect your application using an OO data model in a web application server.

267012,comment,266663,266950,0,0,mstoehr,,,"The solution uses something called common knowledge, which is that everyone knows that everyone knows that every one knows, ad infinitum.  Before the queen makes the announcement they may all know that the other husbands are cheating but they don't know if everybody else knows.\nTo see the difference consider the case where there are only two husbands (H1, H2) and two wives (W1,W2).  So, every man has cheated on his wife, and when the queen announces that a man has been unfaithful, then consider the situation from W1's perspective.  She knows that H2 has cheated on W2, she doesn't know that H1 has cheated on her, and she can't talk to W2 about it.  With the announcement, from her perspective, there are two possibilities (both H1 and H2 are cheaters), or (just H2 is a cheater).  \nNow, to continue we need to think about what W1 will think about these two possibilities given her incomplete information: \nIf it were possible world where (just H2 is a cheater) and H1 is honest, then since W2 would know that H1 hasn't cheated then W2 would conclude that (just H2 is a cheater) since at least one husband had cheated. Thus, by the laws of the island W2 would kill H2 the day of the announcement.<p>Since W1 considers it a possibility that her husband, H1, was faithful, she won't do anything the first day; instead she'll just wait to see whether W2 kills H2.<p>By symmetry W2 will go through the same line of reasoning about W1.  Thus, both will do nothing the first day.  So then on the second day, W1 will realize that (just H2 is a cheater) must be false, since W2 didn't kill H2.  So, she'll go ahead and kill W1.  (Apply the same reason symmetrically to W2).  Therefore, they'll both kill their husbands on the second day.<p>The rest of the details are pretty easy to establish.  The point is that 99 days later all the men are killed.",1217898924
