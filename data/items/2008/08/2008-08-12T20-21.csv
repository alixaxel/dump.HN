This is hardly a ""chemical set"". It sits firmly in ""WTF"" category, <i>especially</i> if you are charged with protecting public safety.<p>Consider the context. An usually large amount of potentially dangerous chemicals in a residential area <i>is</i> an emergency situation. They responded accordingly - eliminated potential danger first, analyzed it second.<p>And before you downmod me again, imagine yourself living next door to this ""chemist"" or sharing a graywater supply with him. Then ask yourself if you still think authorities were wrong in their ""overreaction"".",1218574734

The ""controversy"", if you can call it that, is whether or not it is proper to use ""includes"" with a list that is complete-- everybody agrees that it is the best choice for an incomplete list.  Check your link again.<p>Seriously: if I said ""The science faculty includes two Nobel Laureates"", would you really think that there were only two professors on staff?<p>It's a nonsensical argument at best-- and when folks attempt to use it to argue against common sense (like stating that the United States does not include the 50 States), reason is left whimpering in the corner.",1218573970

The rate of scientific progress is, if anything, continuing to increase. As a society, we are increasingly dependent on science and technology. Science education has long been a priority of the educational systems in most first world countries (for better or worse). And as for ""science at home"", it is pretty hard to argue that it's under attack, a single anecdote about someone in Massachusetts notwithstanding.",1218573279

274440,comment,274016,274165,0,0,martian,,,"Agreed, I started bicycling regularly about two years ago, and it has vastly improved my overall health, focus, and drive. Getting sick in the winter used to be the regular course of things -- I'd be knocked out for about a week or so with a cold or flu -- but the regular exercise and exposure to fresh air has kept me healthy in spite of everything. My productivity is higher, and my ideas more focused. I can only imagine the health benefits that would carry through into old age.<p>There is certainly no silver bullet to living into a healthy old-age, but it seems clear that running, biking, swimming, or any other exercise could only help you. Combined with good diet, social activity, intellectual hobbies, and who knows -- Ray Kurzweil's predictions may come true.<p>While biking the other day I came across this old dude (probably 70 years old) who was also on a bicycle up in the hills north of San Francisco. He was flying down this major hill, pedaling like mad, and the wackiest grin was on his face. When I'm old, I want to be that dude.",1218572555
