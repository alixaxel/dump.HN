289740,comment,289631,289631,0,0,anonymousadvice,,,"I'm not in the armed services - but many of my friends have been, I considered it before health problems ruled it out, and I come from an area of the country where service is extraordinarily common.<p>the rules for joining any military service -<p>1. find a friend who's served in that branch. They can be a good friend or just a friendly acquaintance who wants to help out a potential new member of their branch.<p>however, they absolutely CANNOT be a current recruiter or being rewarded for bringing in recruits right now. Moreso it can't be the first than the second, but either is dangerous. People who have recently honorably left the service are the best.<p>they will give you the straight scoop on the branch, where the bodies are buried, and how to get what you want out of the service while also meeting the obligations and responsibilities you signed up for.<p>the info you can get from Hacker News is good, but it's not a substitute for the real thing unless someone here with Coast Guard experience is willing to take you under their wing.<p>2. get every condition and bonus you want out of a recruiter and your contract IN WRITING. Just like a business contract in the real world, if it's not written down in your contract it's your word against theirs.<p>if a recruiter suddenly starts getting shifty and tries to weasel out of this, find another recruiter. There are lots of them out there, and the odds are good that one of them will give you what you want as long as you're reasonable in what you're asking for.<p>3. understand the phrase ""the needs of the service"" and what it really means. If you fail out of whatever school you get sent to, or otherwise don't meet the responsibilities and obligations of an armed service member in your initial training, you are going to get sent where the service feels like sending you since you didn't fully complete your part of the contract.<p>this tends to hit people who try doing crazy things like going straight into SF or SEAL tryouts without spending time in a combat arms branch, who then become a part of the very, very high washout rate for the tryout for these groups, and then get assigned wherever the service needs new bodies.<p>if you stick with a EE-related rating you should be fine since you already have skills there.<p>4. Remember that you can back out until you've completed all three of signing the contract, taking the oath, and reporting to basic training, no matter what the recruiters tell you. Talk to a civilian lawyer with experience with military law if you need confirmation. You'll have zero chance of ever joining the military again barring a draft if you back out after signing the contract though, and rightfully so.<p>you shouldn't sign the contract or take the oath if you aren't 100% sure you are ready and willing to serve, but if you have a change of heart, the military doesn't need people who aren't truly committed to doing their duty in this era of a volunteer force, so it's better you leave early rather than be a drain on the service.<p>5. Once you have taken the oath and reported to basic training, you are now under the UCMJ, not the Constitution. Adultery is a prosecutable offense in the military and you can still legally be shot by your own officer under a variety of interesting legal clauses if you don't do what you are supposed to in combat, however increasingly unlikely that is to happen in our current time.<p>there's a flip side to that as well. You also have no obligation to follow illegal orders given by your superiors, and in fact if you follow illegal orders (for instance, orders to commit war crimes) knowing they were illegal when given, you are considered guilty, ""but it was an order!"" won't cut it as a justification.<p>6. it's looking less and less likely there will be any significant US involvement in a conflict with Iran, but it's not out of the question Coast Guard boats would be deployed. The US Navy is aimed primarily at blue-water combat, and while it is increasing it's ability to operate in littoral/close to shore situations like the Persian Gulf, it has traditionally tapped Coast Guard boats and crews for expertise in that area.<p>For instance, a fair amount of Coasties served in Vietnam running boats used for littoral and river combat.<p>7. The one thing everyone I know that has served has emphasized to me - remember, when you sign up, you're agreeing to serve your country, not just ride the service for benefits and abandon things when they get tough. And no matter how desk clerk-like your job is in the military, there's a chance you will go into combat, and there's a chance you will die. Anyone who pretends to you otherwise is lying.",1219978156

289729,comment,289487,289706,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> Your mortgage payment on a place is generally not much more than your rent payment would be<p>This is not true in most of the formerly booming real estate markets in the U.S.  My coworker just bought a condo for $500K in Boston.  At 6%, his <i>interest</i> payments are $30K/year, or $2500/month.  My friends are renting a similar place for $2200/month.<p>I've heard it's worse in California, eg. people paying $3500/month in mortgage payments for houses that rent for $2000 or so.  The recent Businessweek article on Merced mentioned homes with $3400/month that the owners walked away from, then out-of-state speculators bought it at a foreclosure auction and are now renting it back to the original owners for $1200/month.<p>> The interest rate for a mortgage right now is a few % points below what the stock market has returned, on average, over the last 50 years.<p>First rule of finance: any truly risk-free profit opportunities will be arbitraged away as soon as large numbers of people become aware of them.<p>That's exactly what happened in the 1990s.  People suddenly realized that the stock market, on average, returned higher rates than a 30-year mortgage, so they took out mortgages and invested it in the stock market.  As a result, the stock market quadrupled between 1995 and 2000.  Then they pulled it out of the stock market and back into real estate between between 2001 and 2005.<p>It's highly unlikely that stock market returns over the next 50 years will match those of the previous 50 years, even with the cratering of the real-estate market.",1219977124

Play with unknown factors (future rent, interest & house prices) and see what you come up with.<p>Mostly it's about even.<p>But just as you say a lot of human elements come into play. People choosing a rental or a purchase choose radically different properties so usually saying 'I would be paying this rent' is meaningless since you would be living somewhere completely different paying different rent. And saying 'I would be saving X' is also meaningless because you probably wouldn't be.<p>I think these usually outweigh the pure financials. many people purchase houses that would have never saved a dime. But of course, that's beatable.",1219976975
289727,comment,289631,289631,0,0,nolanbrown23,,,"I just got out of the Navy as an enlisted Deck Seaman and my brother is an officer and my business partner. My younger brother is also enlisted in the Coast Guard right now.<p>Let me say that it's possible to run a small, single person business while in the military, I did consulting/programming jobs while I was in and it was decent work. I would work while I was off duty and when I was out to sea and not on watch or during working hours. This took a lot out of me but I felt it to be worth it.<p>Before I continue I must say that I'm proud of my service and what I did and the military is a good fit for some people.<p>Let me give you my perspective about the Navy/Coast Guard. It's not fun, fun is rare and always involves a port. I like boats/ships/ocean and saw some cool things out there but it wasn't worth it for me. You spend your time split between watch, maintenance and other work. Coast Guard ships are particularly bad because most are so old, my younger brother's had holes in the starboard fuel tank, fires, parts breaking, terrible living space, etc. (One note about the fire on a ship, it will cause enormous damage and possibly kill crew members and is no joke.)<p>I was one of 3 people on my ship with any higher education in a technical field, many officers outside the academies are majors that don't have good hiring prospects. Because of the lack of ""engineers"" (not meaning in the same way the Navy does), many officers are below par in terms of leadership, planning, logical abilities. That means the people you work with are dumb, unimaginative, and boring and could get you killed. (I came close a few times because of these type of officers)<p>If you go enlisted your life will be run by your Chief which 90% of the time are not good leaders and not fun to work for. You would be under a 1st, 2nd and 3rd class petty officers who range in age of 19-40. These are hit and miss. My LPO/2nd class was great and will work with him any time. My former 1st class was an idiot and got fired from his job because he was so bad. My 3rd classes were 19-21 and acted as 19-21 years do, except they are your boss and you can't tell them to go fuck themselves.<p>As for location, it's possible you stay in the Bay. If you go active then you'll be shipped anywhere including the gulf. (I just got back from there and don't let anyone tell you there are no ships there, there are some and they always get the short end of the stick.)<p>When you join you'll go to boot camp or OCS depending on if you go enlisted or officer. Boot camp sucks, it's not what you think it is. OCS is 3x as hard as Boot Camp.<p>Benefits are overrated, I do get the new GI Bill which is awesome but don't get to use it until Fall '09 when it starts. I'll be done with school by then and so it doesn't help me at all. I'm not sure the benefits you get in the reserve other then I know it's not worth it to join just for them, you need to have a real reason.<p>My email is in my profile if you want to ask any other questions.",1219976798

289711,comment,289631,289631,0,0,jjguy,,,"I was an active duty (fulltime) air force officer, and am now in the USAF reserves.  I say do it.  Some thoughts:<p>1 -- Typical time commitment is 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks per year; no matter how fast your startup is moving, you can swing that.  It's probably a healthy break.<p>2 -- Diversity is good for computer geeks.  Life -- esp a startup -- takes a range of skills.  Life in any of the armed forces will help build your character and experience.<p>3 -- Your enjoyment will be closely tied to your reserve duty station.  There are absolutely places that will suck the life out of you, but there are also places where you will feel like you are in a movie.  I am very lucky to have made contacts during my active duty years that got me a great reserve position.  Take the long view. If you're not happy with your first assignment, talk to people and work the system to move.<p>4 -- health insurance for reservists is usually not effective outside your duty time (1 weekend/month, 2 weeks/year)  note this is a political football; several years ago there was limited coverage for any reservist that did not have health coverage elsewhere.  I'm not certain of the current status, and the coast guard is certainly a bit different than the other services.<p>5 -- the pay helps.  it's not a lot, but nor is it chump change -- esp if you get the officer slot.<p>anyhow, my two cents. good luck.<p>edit -- reading more of the comments:  don't be too scared by the threat of deployment.  (1) I'm slotted in the system as a computer engineer, and engineers don't get deployed.   10 total years in, and never even the threat of time overseas -- and that's during the wars.  (2) deployment builds character, and is reasonably safe given how many people we have over there.  you recall the study from a couple years ago?  you're more likely to get murdered living in DC or Chicago than as a soldier in Iraq.",1219975871

289709,comment,289487,289700,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'll show you the situation. If your mortgage is at 6% (I think mine is just below that) and you're in the 30% bracket (I am around there) you're effectively saving 1.8% in deductions (30% of the 6%) and therefore paying 4.2% interest right? A C.D. now pays over 5.25%.<p>So to clarify the math, you borrow $200k, pay $12k in interest, but get to deduct it and therefore save $3.6k, thus really paying $8.4k in interest (or 4.2% of the $200k).<p>Therefore if you mortgage the house (as opposed to buying it outright) and buy into a CD at 5.25% you're effectively gaining 1.05% interest for free. You're making about $2k a year. Also you're increasing your credit score, which saves you a lot of money in the long run.<p>In your above scenario the guy was saving 30% of 5% (1.5%, or 1500) which would put him at 3.5%. He'd be borderline retarded to pay for the house outright.<p>Much more intelligent (especially for someone my age, who has a good 30 years to worry about retirement, thus reducing the volatility) is to put that $200k into the market, which will probably average somewhere between 7-10% in that time. Suddenly that $200k mortgage turns into a shit ton of money in my retirement account.<p>Also, there's the fact that the mortgage costs only slightly more than renting a similar place (if homes as nice as mine were available for rent, which they generally aren't here) yet in 30 years I have a free and clear home I can sell.<p>In summation, mortgages FTW.
