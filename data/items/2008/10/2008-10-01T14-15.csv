When I started this project I had a large, enthusiastic group of volunteer writers and contributors trumpeting the effort.  That's great.

They're using the platform daily to create original content and build their own audiences.  The easier I make their lives, the easier they make my life.  On the other hand there are a good number of observers with spare thoughts for me.  Sometimes helpful, sometimes not.  Good distinction.  Thanks.",1222871152

Talk ahead of time about what you're making so people are familiar with it at launch time.<p>That being said, here's my quick guide to free self-marketing:<p>trackback > comment > forum post<p>So, set up a blog and start linking to blog articles that are related to your area.  Write something <i>meaningful</i> about what the person is saying and how it relates to your product.  The blogger will probably follow the trackback and read your post, and might decide to write about it.<p>DO NOT just start blindly linking to stuff and creating trackback spam.  Same goes for signing up for forums and creating an ad post.  Nothing looks more spammy than a user account with 1 post saying ""Check out my cool new website!""",1222871062

320696,comment,319706,319784,0,0,etal,,,"It's interesting how the PLT team dealt with this teaching problem in ""How to Design Programs"". The first part basically shows how to write simple Java-like code with Scheme syntax, using symbols and fixed records, and including tests as part of a complete program. Then in the later sections, lists and the more dynamic handling of data are introduced gradually. Aren't PLT Scheme structures way more complicated than lists? Yes, but since simple errors show up sooner with a struct, it seems to be a better way to teach brand-new programming students how to work with compound data.",1222870779

In programing, `=' implies set which really has no meaning in mathematics as mathematics is only concerned about declaring facts which is what the mathematical `=' does. It declares a fact that the indeterminate ""x"" is equivalent to some value ""y.""",1222870750
