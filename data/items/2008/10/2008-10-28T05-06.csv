And while they may have done a good job there, they have failed in every other internet initiative.<p>Microsoft does not understand the internet and has never made any notable internet service. Silverlight? Live? MSN? Hotmail?  All knockoffs. And they have ""failed miserably"" every time.<p>Why would I trust their new internet cloud system when it directly, extricably integrates into all of these other failed initiatives as a feature?",1225173544
346094,comment,344834,346086,0,0,kaens,,,"Perhaps that doesn't make it a ""shit password"", but it certainly is a ""shit password policy"".<p>Regardless, you can't realistically force your users to not have a ""shit password policy"". What you can do, however, is make sure that <i>your app</i> is probably not the point of failure for their password.<p>You can't make the internet idiot-proof, but you can make your apps reasonably <i>malicious-person</i> proof, and it's viewed by some (me) to be close to a moral responsibility of yours to do so - you either already know about, or are probably easily able to learn about ""good"" security policy, and ways to store users passwords and do validation while minimizing the risk of a malicious person acquiring your users passwords.<p>That is not to say that writing your own authentication / password storage scheme is something that you just shouldn't ever do - it can certainly be educational and entertaining - but 9 times out of 10 what you write probably shouldn't be used in production.",1225173525

346092,comment,345226,345820,0,0,grantc,,,"H/w vendors are only cut out if MSFT invents a replacement for metal. Granted, utility computing in the cloud is about squeezing more utilization and value out of a given piece of h/w, so it's not without impact. You might perceive this as a change, but I'd say it's a change in the paradigm moreso than a change in MSFT.<p>Also, people tend to overlook this but cloud isn't really about infrastructure or hosting. Sure those are the current analogs--cloud is about what happens next, and I think it's more about shifting architectural tenets so that we do what works well with cloud scale and lifecycle. When you do those things, other interesting things start to become possible (e.g., in the cloud, it's hard to have misaligned test and prod envs, not the rule like it is most everywhere else).",1225173369

It sure sounds like someone is pushing an anti-standardized-test agenda (not that I disagree with that).<p>But if it is true, note that they're testing highly-gifted kids, who might very well be getting fewer teaching resources now that they would have in the early 70's. American public education at any rate seems to be a bit of a squeaky-wheel-gets-the-oil environment, where if you're not failing tests you don't need any special treatment.",1225172347

346082,comment,345479,345724,0,0,kaens,,,"As an aside, there are multiple popular uses of the word ""work"" - I tend to use ""activity that I do (or am obliged through contract to do) that I am compensated at least partially by money""<p>Work, in the way I use it, neither excludes or includes fun. Whether or not my ""work"" is fun changes from 'assignment' to 'assignment', however it does generally include some activities which I do not consider fun. Luckily, a large part of the non-fun portions of what I do can be automated.<p>For instance, every time I start a new cherrypy app, there's a bit of stuff that I know I'm going to do - create a certain directory structure, possibly a database/tables, put some files in said directory structure, create a python file for the main app, etc.<p>This is boring, but can be handled easily by writing a small shell script that accepts a few options. On my machine, I have a few cherrypy apps that are mounted at any given time. When I create a new app, I just use my little script - and if I tell it to, it will open the file that runs the main cherrypy server on my machine, add the import line for the new app, and add the part to the server configuration that mounts it under a specific URL, by default the name of the apps class.<p>All of the steps handled by the script are generally part of the ""work"" I need to do, but instead of taking 20 minutes, it takes half a second. Granted, not every boring, menial task can be automated away like this - but a much larger proportion of boring, menial tasks can be than is found in other lines of work.",1225172302

Particularly the historic tidbits, which the author uses to put the rules into context.<p>In Venezuela for example, many of our politicians actions can be analyzed and compared with some of the book's stories.<p>I wouldn't be to eager to dismiss it as a Machiavellian Field Guide -although Machiavelli appears quite a lot throughout the book-.

I just screwed around each day, telling myself that the next day would be ""super hardcore work day"" and every following day would have to follow suit.</i><p>I also have this problem. It seems like every once in a while, I get stuck in this weird anti-productivity loop. I know I should be doing things, and I'll tell myself that I'll start in just a little bit or the next day, but end up not.<p>I've noticed that I can put a halt to this process quickly (hopefully this works for other people as well) by forcing myself to stop thinking about whatever it is I'm doing for a while, and do something creative or intellectually stimulating that is entirely unrelated to the problem at hand.<p>In my case, the ""recharge"" activity tends to be one of:<p>- playing musical instruments<p>- reading<p>- drawing / painting<p>- going outside and doing one of the above, or thinking about nature, physics, etc.<p>- studying (as in going through a book that I need a pencil and paper to make sure that I am understanding what's being shown in it).<p>In the case of studying, the subject matter doesn't have to be entirely unrelated to what I'm doing. I've been using Concrete Mathematics for this purpose lately. Studying, however, doesn't help if I'm stuck in anti-productivity mode <i>and</i> feeling like my brain's a bit burnt out though.<p>If I don't force myself to do one of my ""recharge"" activities, I remain in the ""anti-productivity loop"" for a while, at most a week or so.<p>It should be noted that the ""anti-productivity loop"" is a powerful force. It's easy to fall into, and it takes a bit of a force of will to break out of.<p>Perhaps it would be more appropriately labeled ""state of negative-flow"".",1225171324
