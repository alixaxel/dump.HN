(The problem is not passing around these tokens, it's what they actually mean.  POWDER, at best, punts, and is more likely to say something like ""good housekeeping means good stuff"".)<p>The standard is also full of moronic blather like ""Online child protection, as well as the continuation of offline child protection, is a priority for any responsible site or service provider, whether directed at children or not.""<p>Okay - I'm being a bit unfair.  It also has stuff to produce bad results ""Web pages and whole Web sites containing any type of rich assets such as video/streaming video or audio can be tagged with that information using POWDER.

The 'database ninja' way to handle this scenario, is to duplicate these two pieces of frequently accessed data...""<p>Completely wrong. Normalization is a foundational principle of relational database design. Review the ACID properties and any of the textbooks a ""rookie"" DBA read in school and you'll find that optimizing performance for a web site is NOT a consideration in database design.<p>The original article does not even describe denormalization, which has a real meaning and real applications for data warehousing and OLAP -- non-transactional databases used for reporting and data mining. It describes caching, and an expensive and error-prone way to maintain the cache in real time. When rookies do this out of ignorance the database is called un-normalized; doing it intentionally is almost always a bad idea that will come back to bite.<p>The notion that normalized data slows query performance has been debunked so many times that there's a whole literature on just that subject. It's a shame that so many database ""ninjas"" cut their teeth on MySQL, and think that the tricks required to get a low-end RDBMS to keep up with a web server when it's ruanning an interpreted language and SQL written by amateurs will apply to relational databases in general. If a serious DBA trained in Oracle, Sybase, DB/2, or SQL Server were to follow your advice they would be sent back to school.<p>I tried to post this comment on the original author's site but his forum software thinks my browser has Javascript disabled.
