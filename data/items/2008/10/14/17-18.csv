But that's not the problem.<p>The issue is that he, and the economics establishment led by Helicopter Ben, never met a rate cut they did not like.  Cheap money and credit are the fix for every problem.  Today many recognize Greenspan held rates too low for too long.  At the time, Krugman opposed rate increases from those low levels.  He and his ilk fail to see any connection between destructive booms and the cheap credit they promote.",1224006960

You perceive that his motivation is linkbaiting/trolling, it didn't occur to me to even consider his motivation one way or the other.<p>I will say this, though: According to my personal values, if he is wronging people, it ought to be wrong regardless of whether he is wronging the rich and powerful or wronging the poor and helpless.<p>Which is not to say that he wouldn't be burning bridges, but if I were to feel that he was wrong to publish this, I would feel that way on the basis of deciding that he was being mean or petty or spiteful or hurtful.<p>I guess I just don't see the people he is satirizing as perceiving themselves as being hurt by this deck.

Reality generally isn't.<p>Technically, things don't fall down. When I hold a brick above your head and then let go, you shouldn't just <i>assume</i> that you have to dodge. You should take note of all the massive objects in the vicinity and do a calculation using the law of gravitation. You might also do some energetic calculations to make sure that the brick won't just bounce harmlessly off of your head, or come to rest on it like a falling feather.<p>Or, you know, you can avoid thinking at all and just allow the circuits in your brain and spinal cord to get you out of the way fast so that you can live to argue another day. Those circuits embody a relatively crude theory of physics, and their design process didn't make use of a theory of physics at all, but they work to keep you alive.<p>What Krugman is saying is that, while economists would love to develop the economic equivalent of the law of gravitation (and some are even foolish enough to believe that they have) their first priority is to develop some rules of thumb that can tell us when to dodge, when to stand still, and when to wear a hard hat. And that can be used to explain, in simple terms, where the bump on our head came from. (""You stood under a metaphorical brick and failed to dodge in the Keynesian manner."")",1224004215

It's not like you choose which level to stay at. Rather, fulfilling the lower levels enables entry to higher levels.<p>More relevant: Terry Gou, CEO of Foxconn (thank them for your Apples), said ""hungry people have clearer minds.""
