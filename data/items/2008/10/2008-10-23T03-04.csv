Those images exist only to make customers feel more secure, because we've all come to equate security with annoyance.",1224734325

Might as well ask, ""What are the possible colors a site could use and what are the pros and cons in each case?""<p>Sorry for the sharp reply but google, yahoo, whatever - go find examples you like, post them back, and then ask for something.

340884,story,,,4,2,fbbwsa,"Ask HN: How should I approach selling ideas?",,"I find myself in a dilemma that I think is probably the opposite of most HN contributors. I have ideas I would love to implement, but am not a coder. And I have funding, which sounds stupid, probably.<p>I am technically inclined, strong in math and statistics, background in science. Due to research experience in the natural sciences where I had to program simulations, I have basic programming skills to do small things, but am certainly not a programmer.<p>I have a few ideas that I want to implement, and non-family supporters who have faith in me such that they are eager to invest even though I have nothing but a few ideas.<p>I subscribe to the notion that ideas are a dime a dozen and especially in this day and age nobody should really see investment until they at least have some basic proof of concept. This is one of the reasons I refuse to take capital contribution.<p>The other reason is that I have no idea what a fair amount to take/equity to give is, especially considering that these parties are willing to invest on the basis of an idea alone.<p>I have a buddy that I've worked with that I trust to develop, but if I accept contribution, I'd also work my ass off to develop programming chops and contribute meaningfully in that time.  But until then, all I'm good for is:
1. ideas
2. building models/algorithms
3. providing access to capital<p>I hesitate to take investment precisely because I am not a programmer, can't do the work myself, and think that the odds of a successful startup are wildly against everyone and especially me because of my skillset.<p>Yet I really am interested in this space.<p>Am I out of line in my desire to be involved in internet startup space given my skillset?<p>How much money should I be interested in taking and how much equity should I be considering giving up?",1224734210
