I suspect their service has improved somewhat in the interim and they provide more bandwidth than any other shared, managed hosting provider for the price. If you really don't want to manage your own server, they are probably worth looking into.",1223420134

The author is clearly referring to where we were at the beginning of the 20th century w/r to air travel (it didn't exist but was associated with a modern utopia), and where we were at the end of the century. It's a romantic lament, to be sure, but if you actually read the article the sentence fits as a lede.<p>And as a Jew, those epic failures of humanity, to me, provide a stark relief to the promise of globalization afforded by air travel. They represent the breakdown of (slowly) dying nationalistic geopolitics. Air travel was one hopeful cure made ugly in reality.",1223419606

326144,comment,325161,325889,0,0,apsurd,,,"I like where you are going with this. First, my friend and I were discussing this post earlier and he did as well, bring up that the idea that colleges are worth much more than just their functions as businesses. Granted they DO function as businesses, but as you bring up, they are unique in that they invest in cultural and societal advancement and inquiry, things that are quite intangible. So in a sense yes we do have to think about them in a unique light. Secondly, as a person that willingly choose not to go to college (I would have just graduated) I can tell you from experience that it is indeed not so much what you learn in college that is important, but it is the connections and influence if you will, that you get for being affiliated with a ""recognized"" entity. Truth be told, I have submitted a proposal to ycombinator and as an aspiring web developer IT IS PAINFULLY hard to attract and team up with like-minded individuals. So yes, you heard that right, I did not say it is hard to learn how to program, how to run a business (i currently do), hard to pay your bills, hard to grow up and mature, no no I said its hard simply to find people.  So in that respect, I think that is colleges greatest reward. And don't get me wrong, civilization was built with TEAMS, so its a good reward.<p>You can see then how it all neatly comes to fit. The environment you are placed in contains a certain type of people. Colleges help you connect with these people in this environment. It's just so ""structured"" that way. You become connected with mentors (your professors and alumni) and you connect with peers, and you connect with protegees. It's the whole neat, clean package.<p>No it is not impossible to meet and connect with people and build something great (as many have done) but college just streamlines the process.<p>You don't pay to go to college to learn. Just as you pointed out the self-motivated will ALWAYS find a way to learn. And to add to that, think about just how much abstract and intangible things that are SO IMPORTANT to a good life that you can't learn in college, you can't learn anywhere. You have to learn them through your own conscious efforts toward self-improvement.",1223419145

Position's pure designer - i.e, they'd never touch code here. The role would be creating mockups in Photoshop, then handing them off to the developers and working with them to integrate it and such.<p>Thing is, finding decent web designers in the DC/Metro area seems to be incredibly tough. 9 times out of 10 I'd reject what comes across my desk - either they're extremely print-design oriented, they don't ""get"" web standards, or they're unfamiliar with all the current web/startup scenarios.<p>(Ideal candidate would be/have the opposite of all of those, respectively)<p>Anyone got any advice on how to find someone who'd fit this kind of role? Am I missing out on some crucial step? I'm at a complete loss, but there's some great brains here, maybe someone could give me a hand.",1223418987
