The only date I specifically mentioned was 2003, which is when the last Alpha was released and the 64 bit x86 architecture became available.  In 1998-1999 the Alpha was still probably in the lead on all counts except possibly price/performance.  Things move fast in CPUs, and a significant lead one year can turn into a trailing position the very next.",1225338192

348389,comment,348301,348301,0,0,mdasen,,,"Short Answer: No.<p>Long Answer:<p>SimpleDB is based off what every application developer wants to hear.  Put your data here and it will just be available.  No worries, no cares.  For (relatively) small amounts of data, SimpleDB will definitely cut it.  However, SimpleDB also limits your usage of that data.  No nice normalized schema and joins for you.  That makes development time much longer.<p>Of course, if you only have a small amount of data, it's pretty easy to manage MySQL or PostgreSQL.  Database administration becomes hard when you have lots of data.  But this is where SimpleDB just falls flat.  In a single domain (roughly equivalent to a database), you can only have 250,000,000 attributes (cells).  That sounds like a huge number at first, but if you have a table with 10 columns, you're down to 25M rows.  Still, a lot, but not exactly no-worries.  Considering that you'll probably want multiple tables with maybe 100 or more columns, you can see that it just doesn't support large web applications.<p>Amazon has set up an ""infinitely scalable"" database that has hard limits that aren't particularly high.  Open source relational databases are easy and reliable when you aren't dealing with the scale of a Digg or Flickr.  The only reason to go with something less useful (no joins, limited querying) would be to scale better.  Amazon's hard limits on SimpleDB mean that it just doesn't scale.  So, why use something less easy when the benefit isn't there?",1225337462

There is no solution in reasonable time, which is why mwerty brought it up.<p>This whole downvote storm is because your OP was ""CS students love dropping four letters: P, NP, O and N. Whenever I want to judge who was a bit too focused on the surface details of computer science, and too little on the real problems, I wait to see if those 4 letters come up in a sentence."" and there is a crowd of people here whose work on real problems involves those four letters all the time & couldn't be done without extensive knowledge about them and discussing them endlessly.<p>Maybe they don't come up so often when writing cd burning programs or robotics (though I find the latter hard to believe since any planning algorithms should hit up against this quickly), but other people have their own real problems where it does.

For languages with braces like C++, Perl, or Ruby you just hit tab on any line, and it automatically indents it correctly. For languages like Python tab will cycle through the possible acceptable indentations.<p>Other text editors like Eclipse (and I believe vi) will indent correctly by default when you hit enter, but after that nothing is automatic.
