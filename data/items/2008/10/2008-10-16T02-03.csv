334089,comment,333918,333918,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"My first thought beyond ""wow, what total bull"" is that there is a serious philosophical battle that needs to be waged, or vacuities like ""the dignity of wheat"" will persist. Basically we need to get down to things broadly termed qualia - feelings, emotions, ""subject experience"" like color and so on. Daniel Dennett is a good place to start.""Qualia"" is a product of the computation power of the brain. So wheat does not have a nervous system, ergo has no computational power, ergo has no ""qualia"", subjective experience, the feeling of pain and so on. Once we establish all subject experience, all qualia, as a phenomenon of computation then cockamamie like the ""dignity of all living things"" will go away. Which, by the way, a ""living thing"" is roughly when you get down to it a molecule that can copy itself, so crystals are ""living"" too. Shall we now have a discussion on  tax payer money about how much pain a crystal feels when we cut it?",1224125888

334045,comment,333686,333814,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Yeah, it's pretty trivial.  Here's a quick implementation description in CS terms:<p>1.) Keep two heaps, a min-heap for sellers and a max-heap for buyers.  The top of the seller heap is the ""ask price"".  The top of the buyer is the ""bid price"".  The difference between them is the ""bid/ask spread"".<p>2.a.) When a limit order comes in, put it in the appropriate heap.  Then compare the tops of the heaps.  If the prices overlap, send a fill message to the parties.  Pay attention to quantities; you may have to send a partial fill to one party and a fill to another, and then repeat the process with the next order in the order book.<p>2.b.) When a market order comes in, immediately pop the top of the opposing heap and send out the appropriate fill or partial fill message.<p>That's basically it.  Depending on language, you're looking at anywhere from a page to a few hundred lines of code.  An actual stock exchange is a bit more complicated, since it has to handle things like order cancellations, cancel-pending messages, transaction logs, and fault-tolerance, and has to operate on thousands of trades a second with minimal latency.  But conceptually, it's simple.<p>(And if Joshua corrects any of this, listen to him and not me.  He was an actual quant; I just worked at a financial software startup.)",1224122996
