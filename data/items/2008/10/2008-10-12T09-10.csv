(scroll down for the charts)<p>Another interesting question is of course who owns this dept and how much of it is owed to foreigners, because that points to possible ways of silent default ;-)",1223804624

A sweeping statement like ""[The U.S.] is directly or indirectly responsible for every war in the last 60 years"" doesn't even relate to this particular topic.

330213,story,,,2,3,sohamdas,"Graphing: Matlab and others",,"Ever noticed the amazingly brilliant graphs and visualisations Matlab offers? For students and technical people its a sure manna. But along with it comes a heavy price tag.So do you have any suggestions for having such 'high fidelity'[if I am allowed to use this expression] images through other programming languages?Do you know of any such good graphic libraries? How does Matlab do it, can we get any hints from that?
Having such a library and incorporating in standard C,C++ or Perl programs will save the money yet will be a good bargain.<p>Suggestions...<p>Thank You",1223802385
330212,comment,330139,330139,0,0,tdavis,,,"<i>To paraphrase, just because a lot of people are panicking doesn't mean we shouldn't be really afraid!</i><p>To paraphrase, when a lot of people are panicking it's the ideal time to find some fucking spine and <i>not</i> panic.<p>What is panicking going to accomplish? What will being afraid gain you? NOT A DAMN THING! What does <i>not</i> panicking get you? Ask the people who aren't. It gets you lots of money and opportunity. Many people have already made hundreds of thousands of dollars by shorting pretty much any stock possible. Many companies are waiting for their competition to start laying off tons of staff and making deep cuts to spending so they can speed ahead by making smart choices and spending money where it can put them ahead.<p>From: <i>Economy is booming! Credit is free! Leverage everything! Next quarter will be awesome!</i><p>To: <i>Economy is destroyed! Take all your money and put it under your pillow! Sell the house! Expect to be poor!</i><p>Just two different forms of compulsory reactions that have a complete lack of foresight.<p>The act of making good financial decisions has not changed. Minimizing both debt and overspending has always been the <i>right</i> thing to do. I have zero debt and as close to zero excess possessions as is possible without living in a log cabin in the woods. I'm not going to change a damn thing except possibly spend more money because stupid fear-mongering like this will create all sorts of opportunity for people who can see the forest for the trees.<p>Why something like a recession would inspire <i>fear</i> in anyone is a complete mystery to me. There's nothing you can do about it so stop being afraid and stop spreading fear as a viable option. Instead, sit down, take a deep breath, realize that this isn't the ""end of the world as we know it,"" and move on with your life. Jesus, you people sound like a whining, crying broken fucking record. All this recession has caused me to ""feel"" is pissed off constantly.<p>This argument sounds like this, except not hilarious because you're <i>serious</i>: <a href=""http://video.yahoo.com/watch/2184997/6808646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.yahoo.com/watch/2184997/6808646</a>",1223802242

Being a trader, I am trying to develop risk management strategies,my own trading setups, testing them, measuring the analytics etc.<p>In light of this, does anybody have suggestions, if Perl is a good choice of language for such work. If so, then why do you think so? If no, what would you suggest?
What are your experiences? What is your modus operandi? 
Basically, I am looking for some neat tool to run my own analysis, quick development etc.So what suggestions do you have for me?<p>Thanks :)",1223802039
