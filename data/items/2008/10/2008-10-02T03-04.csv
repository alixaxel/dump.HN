They should pay for this by repelling all of George Bushes tax cuts to the wealthiest 10,000 people in america.<p>Privatize the wealth but make the public pay the bill when the bets don't pay off?  Fuck this shit.  The rich that benefited from the deregulation that led to the mess should pay.  There should be riots in the streets.<p>And idiot americans are going to be glued to their TV's, with their brains working the same way they work watching the Brady bunch, while Joe Biden tries not to look smarter then Sarah Palin and thus appear an asshole to the Voting on American Idol part of Americans Brains, while John McCains people play the game of trying to get enough idiots to vote against their economic interests on the basis of identity politics.",1222919778

Buffet is right in getting a guaranteed 10% return on $3B dollars with a potential for upside with his preferred stock, even if you are right in that GE common stock performs badly in coming years. So long as GE is still in business/profitable, Buffett is right.<p>I agree with your last point, I'd actually be curious how many of the vocal ""buyers"" are actually throwing their money down and buying?",1222919335
321392,comment,321235,321273,0,0,gz,,,"Thanks for your response. Sorry if I was sarcastic but honestly that's how it spontaneously came out and certainly it's nothing personal. My point regarding the $25K was that some people may be concerned about your ability to raise capital so perhaps this is something you should address (otherwise put: why crowd-sourcing in the first place?).<p>If your idea is fully developed then I misinterpreted the following statement on being stealthy: ""I don’t want to build up one idea, just to iterate and have it be something totally different.""<p>I am looking forward to the blog post about your entrepreneurial skills. One more thing: you could perhaps say much more about your idea without revealing what it is: eg, how big of a market is it that you are entering? How many competitors? How are you differentiating yourself? How long will it take? What will your sources of revenue be? You get the gist... give potential investors more info so that they can place an educated bet.<p>Good luck.",1222919095

I was 17 or so and exposed to this crazy highly dynamic programming environment. Unlike anything we youngsters had worked with before.<p>If I remember correctly we got two kinds of development hardware from Apple. One was a fat Quadra ('040) with an ARM NuBUS card and the MCL development environment. It got us started with code although there was no device to run this on.<p>Later on we got a Newton prototype. Real hardware. It was very bare. Basically a PCB with the LCD/touch display on top of it and connected to another Quadra with a flat ribbon cable. I remember we could run the real NewtonOS on that. The prototype was called the 'Bunwarmer' I think.<p>The Newton was awesome. Too bad it was killed.",1222918899

From an article on bloomberg:<p>""The arrows provision seeks to reverse an anomaly in a 2004 law that created the 39 cent excise tax on the weapons. Intended the levy more expensive arrows, the tax also applies to arrows used by Boy Scouts and other youth organizations that cost about 30 cents a piece.
