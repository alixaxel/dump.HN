That's not ""normal""- that's the person that has the Dr. Phil intervention on Oprah.""<p>The debt of our federal government is different than the 70k credit card debt of a person who makes 100k in two ways that somewhat cancel.<p>First, the interest rate that the federal government can get is remarkably low.  In fact, if we include inflation (which seems to be hard to peg right now), I would almost venture to guess that the interest rate might be negative.<p>On the other hand, it makes me uncomfortable that people compare the federal debt to the GDP because the GDP is a sort of total income for the nation.  What ought to matter is the relevant part of the income of the federal government.  I haven't found good data on what this income is (anyone?) but I think it is on the order of about 3 trillion.  It was about 2.5 trillion in 2006 according to Wikipedia.<p>Anyway, if we wanted to compare the national debt to consumer debt in terms of a debt load, this is about like having a person who owes about three times his annual income on a mortgage.  There are still two main differences.  One the one hand, there is no home that this mortgage has enabled us to enjoy.

Check the Hadoop article that was posted here not too long ago.<p>It will let you scale the work over many nodes in a fairly linear fashion.<p>You might not even have to go that route if you properly shard your data among your computers. If you store user profiles based on locality or the like, the work is guaranteed to be local. Also, you can try segmenting your users based on general factors that group them (a course version of your matching algorithm) to preserve locality.",1223496331

It has been working great, but since we are pretty early, we aren't getting crazy amount of traffic either.  Our web app is basically a social network, and there's a matchmaking algorithm which could potentially become a bottleneck (think Match.com or eHarmony's matching system).<p>Given that, and as we are growing about 25% every month.  I am just curious on what kind of scaling issue we should be worried about?  Are there any best practices in both back-end / database design to accommodate future scaling issues?<p>I read database performance is usually the bottleneck for most web apps -- and since our matching algorithm does hit the DB pretty hard, what kind of things I could do to improve DB performance and scale it accordingly (besides the obvious, e.g. caching and index).<p>Thanks for any advice!",1223496107
