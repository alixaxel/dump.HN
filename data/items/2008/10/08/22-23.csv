Each platform has its own design philosophy, and I find it engaging learning each platform's intricacies, and coming to understand the psychology behind each platform's demographic.<p>I believe the greatest measure of an application is the user's productivity, and I believe most of that productivity is inherent in the design of the user interface.  The users of each platform have different expectations of their user interface, however, so I believe it's my duty when developing cross-platform applications to be mindful of these expectations.<p>The work may seem unglamorous to most programmers, but if you can't get the human half of the interface right, any gains on the computer half of the interface are moot.  That being said, I think most YC hackers do have an appreciation for this logic, it's just that client software is overkill for their requirements.",1223505268

Which is good, because I let it disrupt me less and am less likely to disrupt other people because I don't want to wait for it to unfreeze and then another 30 seconds it takes me to scroll through my contacts list and then thumb the fucking thing and then click on call.<p>And, shit, I don't even use it for email because it sucks for that too. I can't search. I have 5 email accounts for various things and I have to click 15 times to check them all, instead of a single view like the blackberry. Oh and I can't search. I mentioned that. Did I mention that? Yeah, I can't search. And when I click on a message I have to wait for the fucking webkit view to load before I can read it. I can't copy and paste addresses, I can't forward emails as sms's, I can't save attachments. SO awesome.<p>So yeah I use it for everything but email and the phone. And maybe SMS messaging too I do a lot less of because it's another slow cumbersome process that zaps the joy out of semi-realtime conversation. I love it when it craps out, and how it can't send in the background and those wonderfully stupid chat bubbles. I am not 12 years old.<p>So I don't really use it for anything other than browsing the web, tracking poker stats and playing Wurdle. I love Wurdle. I can play it until my thumbs cramp. I hope those guys make millions.<p>So yeah the iphone is the greatest piece of something alright.",1223505226

If I had an app that took a minute to load the first time over the web, I'd seriously consider just targeting the client and getting more bang for the buck.<p>The reason some folks stay on the web is that people don't want to wait to use anything. If you can show them a working app they can play with in under 5 seconds, your click-through and sales go up.
