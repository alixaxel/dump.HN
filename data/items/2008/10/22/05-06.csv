339786,comment,338890,339746,0,0,Dobbs,,,"You just managed to prove that you have no understanding of what Open Source is actually about.<p>The entire purpose of open source if you go back to the origin is about the Freedom to build upon, produce, and learn from other's software. Stallman was frustrated with the printer at the lab because he couldn't fix a flaw that he had previously fixed on a earlier printer.<p>With hardware if their is a flaw or it just doesn't quite meet the need you have then you can take the design and fix the flaw, or build upon the base to get what you need. That is the purpose of Free, Open Source Software and Hardware.<p>Open source has little to nothing to do with being free that has been a side effect of giving the source away, why charge for a product if anyone can build it themselves?",1224655066

A single client only has to send each unique block (over all files on all computers on the account that use the same encryption key) once to the server, and that block is shared across all files on all computers on the account. The results: backups are faster because less data is sent, costs are lower because less storage space is used and less bandwidth is consumed. (Mozy told me they don't do compression.)",1224654799

339778,comment,339661,339769,0,0,orib,,,"Hm? Why would you think that?<p>Did you realize that your master/ branch is just one such long-running branch, and one that's not special in any way other than being the default for some commands...<p>As far as multiple committers on one branch -- well, you can do it, but with 'git rebase' and friends, it's just easier to do your own work on a short lived branch off your primary branch, and just merge in stuff as you get it done.<p>It's not that git makes it difficult to do it compared to other version control systems; it's just that it's a nicer workflow if you use short-lived topic branches to do development because you don't to worry about what other people are doing until you decide you want to take a look at it and merge it in. The short-lived private branch + lots of merges workflow is just easier because it prevents interruptions in your workflow.<p>As far as emailing patches, it's a matter of taste. It's certainly easier to make sure all changes get reviewed if patches are mailed around, because people tend to read their mails. Personally, I just use a post-update hook to mail out a list of changes for each commit, and review them later, since it's always relatively easy to back out or fix a patch -- after all, it is a version control system.",1224654065
339777,comment,337828,339253,0,0,jonnytran,,,"Yes, absolutely!  Doing customer service is a great idea.  Many problems (esp. usability) stem from the fact that the people making the product don't empathize with the people using the product.  It's just like when developers eat their own dog food, the software almost always ends up being significantly better.<p>I actually have asked multiple times to work in different departments at my day job to get a better sense of how users use the stuff I'm making.  I feel it's necessary to do my job well.  _Necessary._  But the culture just isn't open to that I guess.  Short of quitting, I don't see it ever actually happening.<p>I completely agree with you about compensation.  At a big company, the bonus I get has no correspondence to what I actually do.  I wonder if it would work out better if profits were broken down by product, for example.  Then, if you worked on a given product, you get a cut of the profit for that product.  At least then, the profit from big hit products wouldn't be split among everyone in the company.",1224654033

339770,comment,338958,338958,0,0,pauljonas,,,"A great deal of misunderstanding about H1B and outsourcing...<p>Perhaps I will be down voted for dissenting, but I do write from personal experience. I've seen thousands of jobs outsourced, and contrary to the wisdom expressed on internet forums here and elsewhere, H1B is a prime facilitator of moving work offshore. Entire support/application teams relocated, but supplanted with a liaison team of slightly more experienced non immigrant visa workers brought on shore to work with business units.<p>It's had a direct effect on wages and opportunity, and a big cause of why American students decline to pursue computer science degrees. Sure, there have been winners and survivors, but the average wage / contract rate for a programmer is less than it was 20-30 years ago. Worse, opportunity has been snuffed out — 20 years ago, corporate jobs would go in search in-house looking for anyone who wished to step up and learn the craft, applying their business knowledge. Now, project work is simply delegated to offshore vendors.<p>I have no gripe with bringing in the best and the brightest from abroad. There should be no restrictions in that regard. And for many reading Hacker News, it is all about that. However, the bulk of H1B is allotted to entry level programmers that could have easily been filled by Americans, who could have the choice of a better career path alternative. I know, because I was the guy who had to train those guys who were flown in from India, and I would quickly determine that the extent of their training was reading a manual on the plane ride to the U.S.. No problem, the offshore vendor marketing representative would shrug, we'll send another guy tomorrow.<p>Many posts in defense here of H1B will cite 1s and 2s but corporate outfits use up hundreds (if not 1000s) of such slots. My past experience in Arizona, working for American Express, Honeywell, APS (power company) I can attest to thousands of positions filled by H1B that used to be manned by employees and on-shore contract workers. Most all of those positions are not the ""best and the brightest"", but imported entry level workers.<p>Then we consider that our reservation systems, utility company billing systems, charge card systems, claims adjudication are staffed predominately by foreigners. In a few years, the Americans who serve as subject matter experts will step aside and the expertise will be entirely with the offshore vendors. Now, I not going to invoke nationalistic appeals, because I do believe it should be a meritocracy, and some of the rhetoric I hear from xenophobic protectionist interests is simply sickening.<p>And yes, I've experienced difficulty in finding work in spite of my degree and qualifications. Or have seen my consulting rate / salary depressed because of H1B. I've retooled and work now for less than a third of what I made in the corporate world, as a web developer for a non-profit now — I've been blessed with a spouse that makes double that as a registered nurse. Soon, due to her having health issues, I may need to seek a better paying gig(s). My inbox does occasionally see a recruiter solicitation, but the rates/salary offered are a joke.<p>Furthermore, the adage that a company cannot find qualified help needs to be qualified with ""cannot find help at the pay / rate being offered"" — I could go on in this post with detailed occurrences but will cite just one that is emblematic of the issue. A colleague at a past work contract needed to hire a GIS developer and had a candidate in mind. But he could only offer a temporary 3-6 month contract at a rate less than market value. Still, his preferred candidate would have snagged it if there was some guarantee of full time employment at end of the ""probationary"" period, or an increase in rate or a bonus paid. None of it was to be forthcoming, so it was settled that an H1B candidate got the job.",1224653026

I published it through CreateSpace, so it could be found on Amazon; it's online at Scribd at <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/3319195/gstepl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/3319195/gstepl</a>.<p>I still write, though I haven't written anything as ambitiously. My start-up is one that focuses on creative writers who want to learn to write at a more professional level, so it lets me get away with doing both. And I'll probably be writing something for NaNoWriMo in November: if I like that, I'll spend a little bit revising and seeing if any publishers are interested.<p>The two things go nicely together, because with literature you get used to putting things together haphazardly until they work: hacking gives you a more utilitarian approach to doing things.
