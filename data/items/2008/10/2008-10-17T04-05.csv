We all know that if the US announced ""hey, you're right, we're just here for the oil, so we're going to redeploy to cover what we need and let you take care of the rest"", they'd be running troops into Iraq as fast as they could get transport from the Russians. (They really ought to have some ability to project force.) Then we'll see how Euros run an occupation. Most folks think that Germany is the most brutal, but I've got my money on France.</i><p>You're right, except I think the EU would look at the half dozen or so barrels of oil that would be left over once the US had covered what it ""needs"" and think it wasn't worth it.<p>Sorry, couldn't resist.",1224218180

They they're about triggering an inevitable shift.<p>Depending on your assumptions , the US, China, India & Europe get close to par with each-other (in terms of GDP) . sometime before current Grad Students retire. Could be 5 yrs, could be 40. Equally importantly, a lot of mid sized economies close the gap between them & the whales.<p>The assumption that economy size translates into military & political power makes sense. By that measure, the US already feels bigger then it should. The EU is a terrible mechanism for validating that assumption. China for all it's faults is not very assertive on the world stage. Neither is India. (Russia is  similar to the US in this sense. Their assertiveness means they feel bigger then their GDP should allow)<p>The current non-US big fish (India, China & Europe) are just not converting GDP to militar/politcal power very well. But the raw ingredient is already there. China & India as manufacturers may even be able convert money to power at a better rate then the US<p>Public opinion in the US & elsewhere is currently that the US backed financial theories are to blame for the situation. The US's military/political methods are even more unpopular. Fair or not, Georgia/Russia isn't getting much worse press the Iraq/US - even in the countries officially aligned with Georgia/US. & Russia's Putin doesn't have a good name.<p>This sound familiar: <i>you can have us or the russians/chinese. The euros are wimps. You'll take us because the alternatives are worse!</i> You hear it & elsewhere. 30 years ago those held sway. These days less.",1224218054

IMHO the most popular languages on the web are PHP, Perl, C#/VB.NET and Java; and Python is more popular than Ruby (at least according to the TIOBE index). But Ruby definitely has the most hype :)<p>While GAE has a lot of problems, Google did the right thing releasing it in the language they are most familiar with. Python is extremely easy to pick up and feature-wise it's comparable to other dynamic languages like Ruby. I'd rather Google spend time working on the features GAE is still missing (background tasks, SSL, datastore stability, etc), it just gives more value to the platform than supporting additional languages.",1224217772

335284,comment,334506,334750,0,0,gcv,,,"Very interesting. A couple of questions for you, in no particular order.<p>1. Have you used libev? I read that it's comparable, and in some ways superior to libevent, but I'm not sure why. I haven't found much documentation, though. Do you know if it also has some kind of HTTP server built in?<p>2. If I understand libevent correctly, it just uses a highly efficient mechanism to watch the file descriptor corresponding to a server socket (epoll, kqueue), and when data comes in on the socket, it runs a handler. If the handler is small and efficient, then in theory it will run faster than code which has several listener threads because thread context switches take time, and because it becomes more difficult to take advantage of the CPU's cache. Is this really still true in e.g., recent Linux kernels with NPTL? Also, would you run two libevent app instances on a two-core CPU?",1224216385
