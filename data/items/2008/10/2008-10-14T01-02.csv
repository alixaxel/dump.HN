Obama built a powerful organization during the primaries (he had to) and they've kept on building. I wouldn't be surprised to see Obama ahead of his polls by three or four points in the final counts.<p>On the ""should be"" line, let's just reflect for a minute that America, after 8 years of a ranch farmhand, is about to elect a black technocrat with a Muslim name as POTUS.

331826,comment,331493,331790,0,0,robg,,,"I think Palin is a big part of that dynamic, especially after the Paris Hilton line of attack. Say McCain had picked Romney, they could have been hammering away at the experience card on both foreign and economic policy. By picking Palin, McCain basically killed the experience campaign, especially when she started blathering in uncontrolled settings, and they've gyrated around ever since trying to find a compelling narrative without sufficient knowledge or experience to address the economic realities. As evidence, independents now break in a big way for Obama where they weren't prior to Palin.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear - Palin got the ball rolling downhill, after an initial and short bounce. The economy kicked it that much further.",1223948304

The possibility of his winning an economics Nobel have been rumored for years. The interesting thing to me is that, when reading his columns, I often get the sense that Krugman doesn't really <i>believe</i> in economics.  He talks a good economics talk, but he hasn't internalized its lessons.  He's like a brilliant Christian apologist who doesn't believe in Christ.",1223948211

331823,comment,331493,331789,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It's probably a lot of things. Some of it was that McCain (as with Obama before him) had gotten a short bump from his convention. So he was a little higher than he should be for a brief point there, as all politicians usually are after their party's convention.<p>Palin energized the base at first during the convention, and certainly got a flood of media attention, but then she scared off moderates, especially the women she was hoped to bring in. They've overwhelmingly decided she's not fit to be President (the numbers are so big that even a very significant % of people who will vote for them think that).<p>Then there's the economy. It's pretty easy for the Democrats to point out that the Clinton years were very good. Taxes on the wealthy were higher than they were now, we had a budget surplus and national debt was under 5 trillion. Now we have a huge budget deficit and the debt has more than doubled.<p>In fairness, that's probably an oversimplification, as it's not all Bush's fault. But we Americans pretty much blame or credit the President, and, by extension, his Party, for everything good or bad.<p>So Obama's same message of McCain = Bush grew in effect. Then there were the debates (2 Presidential, 1 VP), where public opinion polls all concluded that Democrats won. Plus McCain's erratic behavior in choosing Palin, suspending his campaign, and introducing a new and not very conservative or detailed plan to buy up mortgages at a debate. He's giving off one signal after another that he's the inferior candidate.<p>So it's been more or less a symphony of destruction. Just one mistake after another on his part, combined with the economy.",1223948174
