322944,comment,322807,322807,0,0,halo,,,"I think this article uses flowery language that makes it difficult to understand what the author really means, but if I understand correctly (and that's a big if) I agree completely.<p>I think the core difference is this: jQuery is seen to be a 'JavaScript framework' when in actuality it's a library to make DOM manipulation easier. Of course, there's a few helper functions thrown in to do common things that are otherwise difficult to do due to browser bugs or poor vendor support, but that's incidental to its true goal which is DOM manipulation. The thing is, it just so happens to be that the clunky DOM manipulation is probably the biggest single weakness of in-browser JavaScript and jQuery addresses this problem extremely well - which is what has caused jQuery to be a runaway success.<p>That brings us to what jQuery is not - it's not designed to be an all-encompassing framework designed to hide particular problems of the JavaScript language away from you. It's not really about encouraging programming 'patterns' - even if you're writing all your DOM work in jQuery, you still need to write plain JavaScript. This is different from Prototype or Mootools who try and add features to the JavaScript language itself. Any criticism of jQuery should bear these goals in mind.<p>Looking at the success of jQuery, perhaps a single all-encompassing JavaScript framework which tries to do everything is a bad idea. Perhaps the correct answer should be to have (at least) two distinct frameworks with distinct goals: one for extending JavaScript the language and one for manipulating the DOM. Too many of the frameworks attempt both yet perfect neither - perhaps if extending JavaScript is a worthy goal then perhaps library developers should accept that jQuery now dominates the DOM domain and let people use that and work on a new library that can work hand-in-hand with it.<p>Disclaimer: I'm as biased as hell. I like jQuery, I don't know that much about Mootools, I know enough about JavaScript. Take what I say with a huge pinch of salt.<p>N.B. I think, but not certain, that the author misunderstands the jQuery plugin architecture. I don't see why you'd write anything that was called anything via 'jQuery(domId).pluginName(""methodName"", [arg1, arg2]);' unless you explicitly chose to - it is a bit ugly and I wouldn't recommend it. You call a plugin just like a native object - jQuery(elem).pluginName(args). Writing a plugin for jQuery is the same as writing a function in native JavaScript - you can use jQuery.fn.pluginName = function(params) { } to write a plugin that doesn't access anything internally - jQuery.fn however is simply an alias for jQuery.prototype. I /think/ jQuery.extend is used to add an element to the object so it can also access privately accessible functions (I'm really not certain though). <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring</a> has more info but is a bit ambiguous in places.",1223060190

322942,comment,322630,322630,0,0,webwright,,,"Software is software.  Monetization is monetization.  Distribution is distribution.<p>Whether your app is installable or web-based is immaterial.  The questions you need to ask are ""is there a need?"", ""can I reach an audience?"", and ""will they pay for it?"".<p>Web software has clear advantages-- lower support costs, no platform issues, easy to push updates, easy to charge recurring revenue, etc.  All this means that you can build and operate your business with less cash.<p>The killer problem with software (aside from building something people want) is distribution.  Assume that you can't/don't build something so freaking earth-shattering that people can't stop talking about it.  How do you reach your buyer?<p>The iPhone phenomenon is so amazing because it solves that problem for app developers.  The web can solve that problem (for web software or installable software) if a lot of people are searching for what you offer (and you're good/lucky with SEO).<p>I guess (in short), Shareware and ""freemium"" aren't that different.  Installable / web apps aren't that different. If you can find a need/niche, go for it.<p>(note: our software has an installable and web component and we see very little drop-off when people realize they have to install something)",1223060013

322929,comment,322630,322630,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"><i>Can I make money with shareware?</i><p>In short - hell, yes.<p>><i>In 2008, is it too late to start writing software, actual installable software, and sell it on the internet?</i><p>Hahahaha .. funny. Of course, not. Here's some anecdotal and motivational evidence for you:<p># Project 1 - a software to deal with file transfers - feeds about 10 people for past 10 years. 3-4 major competitors of the same level and in the same niche. End-user oriented, effectively outdated at the moment, but still selling well due to a market inertia. The program itself is about 3-5 months of work to write from scratch (e.g. by just looking at the screenshots and a feature list).<p># Project 2 - network sniffer application - brings about 800k a year in sales. Oriented on professional market, sales cycle is outsourced to a dedicated company and so it the support.<p># Project 3 - a remote computer/desktop access app. I don't know exact numbers, but they are in the range of #2.<p>These are not, of course, very typical, but they all are single-developer projects. Moreover their success is a result of persistent focused effort rather than a fad or a blind luck. On the other hand if you work on a project in your spare time, it's not unreasonable to expect 10-30k a year. Assuming you are catering to a general home user crowd and your app in fact works and doesn't look like crap.<p>Also, if you investigate shareware development a bit you will see that there's an established and mature ""shareware support"" ecosystem. In a simple case you just write an app and other people will gladly do the rest - anything from creating a website and producing boxed version of the app (i.e. ""publishing"") to payment processing and a front-line support (i.e. ""e-com""). Some care is needed dealing with these guys though, because frequently they rely on ignorance of the developer to milk him out of disproportionate % of a revenue.<p>Good luck, dude. You asked a great question and the answer is that the shareware is very much doable and it is in fact less delusional get-rich scheme compared to web-2.0 craze.",1223059266

The basic idea is static force to keep something from falling but that does not mean it's takes any energy.<p>So, can you get a stable orbit that includes a single strong deflection in the direction of the earth?  It's probably close to impossible due to targeting issues but in theory I think you can.<p>Now as long as what's doing the reflection is not moving there should not be a significant exchange of energy between the two objects.  Just lift on what's doing the deflecting and if there is some drag you could probably add energy from the tower to the satellites even as they provide static lifting force.<p>Ok, well to lift something you need some extra force extracted from the orbiting satellites, but the energy to do the lifting is not taken from the orbiting satellites it's taken from the elevator / what's moving the car and you can just try an lift the ground when not lifting the car's weight.  So, you could build an elevator that picks up car from the ground to above the atmosphere but the car is not going to have much orbital velocity as it's not at a Geosynchronous altitude.<p>PS: I really like the idea of a space elevator but 32,000 miles is a long way and would take a lot of vary strong stuff.<p>Edit: As to the orbital train idea think about removing the track and extending the train the full orbit.<p>Edit2: Now to get some orbital velocity you could magnetic car that get's lift and energy from the moving rail to get into orbit.  You  would want to get into orbit before reaching the station again but you could do that with less than 3G.",1223056803
