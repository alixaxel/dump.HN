320797,comment,319920,320052,0,0,wschroter,,,"At Swapalease we tried different offer combinations on our payment page including price ranges, price/offer packages, and free trials.  Pretty much every price and feature combination you could think of.  The point was that we needed to actually put those offers out there in order to understand what the market was truly ready for.  When we ran surveys we basically got ""we want to pay nothing"".  If we had gone off that feedback alone, we would have had a completely unrealistic idea of what the true price points would be.  Instead we settled on $99 because we found that when an ACTUAL customer (not a survey responder) went to post their vehicle, that was the price point that had the highest take rate.<p>In regard to HOW we did it, we simply posted the pricing on the payment page.  Prior to the payment page you only had to list your year/make/model to start your listing.  We then tracked the number of people who went to the FIRST page (year/make/model) versus the number of people who went to the payment page (where the offer was presented) and got a sense for what offers had the highest conversion.<p>If you put in your year/make/model the idea is that you have interest.  So theoretically the same person interested in listing their vehicle for free and the one listing for $500 are going to click to the next page.  If we had presented price on the first page we would not have known whether users were bailing on the price or their intent.",1222876700

320790,comment,319582,319854,0,0,Flemlord,,,"I didn't say Glass-Steagall being repealed was responsible for everything that was wrong. But having it in place would have kept our institutions smaller with fewer entanglements, therefore fewer firms would be in the ""too big to fail"" category. True, it would have prevented a few of the mergers that are happening now but they may not have been necessary. Once you eliminate the problem of one institution bringing down the entire financial system, the existing bankruptcy courts are a better mechanism for unwinding bad assets.<p>> ""Many foreign countries never had any law like Glass-Steagall in place and they don't seem to be suffering the same problems. As logic tells us, the current crisis seems to be orthogonal to the presence or absence of Glass-Steagall.""<p>I don't buy into that logic. Just because every financial system in the world hasn't failed due to too much deregulation, doesn't mean deregulation is bad or not the cause of our current crisis. There are a multitude of things contributing to the current problem, but excessive regulation and checks and balances aren't one of them.<p>We don't necessarily need to reinstate Glass-Steagall, but we need a modern-day equivalent. We need to ensure financial institutions can fail without jeopardizing the entire economic system. I'm personally in favor of something along the lines of the DoJ anti-trust mechanism, with an independent body that analyzes financial mergers and assets from the perspective of whether they are dangerous to the economy and citizens. On the other hand, I don't feel that our current DoJ is working very well so maybe that's not the best idea. I'm open to suggestions.",1222876211

My article, although a bit unclear, was not wrong.<p>Taken right from the FDIC website at <a href=""http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insuringdeposits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insuringdeposits/</a><p>""The basic insurance amount is $100,000 per depositor per insured bank. Certain retirement accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts, are insured up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank.""<p>They further describe:<p>""You may qualify for more than $100,000 in coverage at one insured bank if you own deposit accounts in different ownership categories.""<p>They then describe what the different ownership categories are:<p>""The most common ownership categories are: Single Accounts, Certain Retirement Accounts, Joint Accounts, Revocable Trust Accounts""  (obviously this is not a complete list)<p>And lastly, single accounts were described as:<p>""These are deposit accounts owned by one person and titled in that person’s name only. All of your single accounts at the same insured bank are added together and the total is insured up to $100,000. For example, if you have a checking account and a CD at the same insured bank, and both accounts are in your name only, the two accounts are added together and the total is insured up to $100,000.<p>Note: Retirement accounts and qualifying trust accounts are not included in this ownership category.""<p>So what this all says is:<p><pre><code>  You may have a total of $100,000 in your combined Single Accounts (checking, savings, etc)\n  You may have a total of $250,000 in a qualifying IRA.\n  You may have a total of $100,000 in a trust.

Simple example: mobile operator (owning the identity and bank account info of the phone owner) could act as identity provider for online micropayments and charge them to the subscriber's mobile account. I could go to my friend's, see an interesting CD, scan its barcode with phone's camera, be redirected to Amazon immediately and pay without entering credit card details, using my mobile phone account -- all in couple of clicks, on one device.<p>I would not bet on mobile growth, I would bet on mobile shift. 4 times 2 minutes spent with surfing the web on iPhone on the go could be oh so much more rewarding (in terms of revenue attracted) for any internet service I am using, than 8 full hours in front of PC.",1222873540
