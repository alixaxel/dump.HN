Otherwise, if the experiment is repeated a sufficient number of times, the chance that Benzene causes cancer in low doses is statistically irrelevant.<p>Our points are the same:  it is not generally known whether cancer can actually be caused by low doses of Benzene, so it is detrimental to freak over sensationalist articles like this one.<p>Also, it is especially distasteful to frighten people by claiming that there is some measure of truth (""science"") in these inherently unscientific claims.",1222889295

That should include me being able to be exposed to new ideas, new people, new opinions, and likewise being able to express my ideas and my opinions.
