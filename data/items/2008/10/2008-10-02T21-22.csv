322150,comment,321531,322069,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"I sort of know what Buffet means. It's like in the late 90's with regards to Long Term Capital Management hedge fund:<p>""At the beginning of 1998, the firm had equity of $4.72 billion and had borrowed over $124.5 billion with assets of around $129 billion. It had off-balance sheet derivative positions with a notional value of approximately $1.25 trillion.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management</a><p>Eventually most of this was lost within a few months of volatility caused by events not taken into account by its computer models, and the fund was ultimately liquidated, losing its investors much of their $1 Billion investment.<p>The fund used models determined by some of the smartest around including economics Nobel prize winners. This team background then enabled them to raise a lot capital, which was subsequently extremely levered.<p>From how I understand it, another problem of LTCM (besides for the flaw in the model not taking into account an extremely rare occurence) was due to the fund venturing into different types of trades that weren't fully thought-out once all the arbitrage opportunities ran out in the program's designated purview.<p>Another aspect of Buffet's hesitancy with ""black box"" trading can be found in this hedge fund manager's interview: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=310284"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=310284</a>, that is, the programmers doing the modelling generally have the same type of educational backgrounds and thus the trading patterns and performance of their 'boxes' are all similar, thereby giving none a competitive advantage over the other.<p>At the end of the day, simplifying things, is it better to trust a brain and its computer extension or just a brain? In Buffet's case, being the equivalent in investing of grandmaster Garry Kasparov in chess, he sticks with his brain. Anyone else might want to run with the computer if they can't get shares in Berkshire Hathaway. I think LTCM were just very unlucky and a bit reckless, but could have done very well, if only they had more conservative exit points in winding up the fund.<p>But, the main gist of my previous comment was that it didn't add much to the thread in terms of discussion, but rather just brought a point in the article to people's attention. And just from that, I couldn't see all the mod points justified. I guess this goes back to my style of modding which is: ""I'll mod this up or down, but only if it's under or over valued."" ;)",1222981633

322147,comment,321531,321531,0,0,kul,,,"I’m irritated by this knee-jerk anti-bailout reaction (”$700bn to the fat cats!”). Check this diagram from the BBC (<a href=""http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45062000/gif/_45062415_wall_st_bail_plan_466_2.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45062000/gif/_45062415...</a>)<p>There is no $700bn going into some Wall Street bankers pockets. First off, $450bn of this bailout money is conditional.<p>Also, see that arrow pointing from the Banks to the Gov’t? That’s a stake in the banks being given to the taxpayers. So you’re not just losing money, you’re gaining an asset, and the chances are, at a very good price.<p>There’s a chance the US Gov’t could end up making a profit out of the situation when the housing market recovers, which it inevitably will. This credit bust is definitely a mess, but this doesn’t mean there won’t be any credit in the future. We need to think 5-10 years into the future. Things will recover, they always do.<p>The closest thing to this I’ve ever studied were the currency crises that happened in Asia in 1998 (indeed they were my savior in my final international economics exam). The big lesson I learned was that self-fulfilling prophecies can occur in the markets. If everyone loses faith in a currency, then it will crash, even if nothing has fundamentally changed.<p>The same thing can happen with banks. If we think some are going to fail, sell its shares, then we can help make it fail. So to counter-act that you need some pretty aggressive action, and even if it isn’t perfect, people are misunderstanding that doing nothing could be much, much worse.<p>If this credit problem is not solved and confidence restored, then it is easy for the effects to spill over to the main economy. The worst would be for otherwise healthy firms to stop receiving credit, be forced to lay people off in a downturn, add to unemployment, and then just make the whole macro condition worse for everyone. Credit plays a vital role in smoothing out consumption and investment cycles - so the banks that facilitate this and are otherwise healthy need to be backed up.<p>That's started happening in the UK (<a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3123736/Banks-turn-the-screw-on-businesses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcr...</a>).
