348008,comment,347162,347982,0,0,unalone,,,"Of course you're <i>allowed</i> to call it literature. I was giving an argument as to why I don't think it is, in the hopes that perhaps people would read what I said and change how they think about literature in turn.<p>It's possible to determine aesthetic quality, but no measure is by any means accurate. However, aesthetic is absolutely present. The easiest way is to determine how things sound when spoken aloud. There's no ""formula"" to it. It's entirely a matter of personal taste. However, Steve Yegge is not somebody who writes for the sound of his language. He writes to express ideas. Is it worth reading him? Yes. Does his writing have aesthetic merit? No, and he doesn't care, and swombat probably doesn't either. As I first said: I didn't post that to try and be a writing nazi. It was just something stewing in my mind, and I wrote it down as a response to something small that swombat wrote. I upvoted both swombat and the story itself: this was not meant to be an assault on either.<p>If you don't think there's a such thing as aesthetic in writing: read Joyce. Read Nabakov. Absolutely read Beckett. All three are writers with immediately identifiable styles, and each one certainly has a powerful aesthetic about his writing. ""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins."" There's a coupling of ideas (light/fire, life/loins). There's the name Lolita itself, which Nabakov expands himself in the story's opening paragraph. It flows. It spikes in the beginning, stretches out in the second and third phrases. These are all things that you can discuss. Compare that to ""I write a column for computer programmers called ""Stevey's Blog Rants."" The second is informative without any styling whatsoever. And there's nothing <i>wrong</i> with that. It just isn't literature.<p>Narnia almost certainly <i>is</i> better written than Harry Potter. Don't take my word for it: read both. Narnia focuses on its language much more than Harry Potter. That's not saying Rowling writes without meaning: I wrote a minor dissertation about the first line in <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> once, because I thought it was interesting and because I like picking things apart. Harry Potter has moments where it sounds beautiful, but those moments are few and far between, and Rowling does resort to clichés rather often. That doesn't make Harry Potter bad: I think that it defined a generation, <i>my</i> generation, and that the final 200 pages of the final book move me like very few things in writing do - that despite its lack of emphasis on beautiful language.<p>My credentials? I write. I've written since the sixth grade. I've gone to programs where I learn how to write. As such, I've developed informed opinions on things. My opinions are better than many people's opinions, because I've taken time to think about what I mean when I say things about literature. Most people don't think about how they define the term. I do. Therefore, I already know what I think about this.<p>I'm certain other people have other opinions, but they haven't responded yet. Why would <i>you</i> call Yegge's article literature, if you do? We could talk about that, and chances are both of us would learn something new in the process. I don't want to dictate literature and its definition: I only wanted to start a discussion.",1225313892

348006,comment,347675,347719,0,0,frankus,,,"At the risk of running afoul of Muphry's Law, your example needs double-quoted strings and curly braces (or your identifiers need to be moved outside the quotes and concatenated in).<p>At any rate, a downside to this approach is that you can't easily add a class or target (or any other attribute) to the A tag (at least in your simplified example).<p>Of course you could have an optional named parameter that would allow you to pass them in, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    function user_profile_link ($user, $attrs) {
        return build_tag('a', array_merge(array('href' => ""/user/profile/{$user->profile}""), $attrs), $user->name);
    }

    function build_tag ($tag, $attrs, $content) {
        array_walk($attrs, create_function('$value, $name, $list', '{$list[] = htmlentities($name, UTF-8) . ""=\""" . htmlentities($value, UTF-8) . ""\""";}'), &$list);
        
        return ""<$tag "" . join(' ',  $list) . '>' . (($content !== '') ? htmlentities($content, UTF-8) . ""</$tag>"" : '/>');
    }
</code></pre>
But trying to do method-chainey sorts of things in PHP quickly runs into the language's clunky syntax, not to mention keeping track of exactly what level of quotation you're at, and so on. This is one of the reasons I like Ruby, as this kind of stuff is much more natural. Something like this:<p><pre><code>    def build_tag(tag, attrs, content)
        attr_string = attrs.collect { |name, value| h(name) + '=""' + h(value) + '""' }.join(' ')
        ""<#{tag} #{attr_string}>"" + ((content != '') ? h(content) + ""</#{tag}>"" : '/>')
    end
</code></pre>
Both of these are probably a little denser than a sane person would put into production code, but the Ruby example is much more human-parseable to my eyes. (I'm using rails helper 'h', which could easily be defined in PHP as well).",1225313721

I noticed there was a Moleskine section, and since other folks seem to talk about them all the time (many in this thread), I decided to see what the big deal was. I flipped through a couple of them, and they didn't seem to be any better than any other notebook. They were also much more expensive. Are they just popular due to their marketing? They market themselves as being the same notebooks used by Hemingway etc., but that's not true. And even if the notebooks were used by smart people, so what? You aren't going to write like Hemingway or paint like Picasso because you use the same paper. So what's the deal? Is there something better about them that make them cost so much?",1225313558

One other explanation:<p>Where there are strong knowledge-based economies, there's a need to delay childbearing until one has the necessary education to be economically competitive.  This results in low fertility rates, and it also results in high education levels.  High education correlates with a liberal political orientation.  Therefore, liberal political orientation correlates with delayed childbearing and lower fertility.<p>or:<p>Where there are large numbers of skilled immigrants, people tend to lean liberal, as the cultural melting pot ""desensitizes"" them to new ideas.  This exchange of ideas also spurs a bustling idea marketplace and healthy startup economy.  This, in turn, results in higher levels of income inequality, which means that people have a large incentive to play the lottery and delay childbearing until they've had their shot at the big bucks.  Therefore, liberal political orientation correlates with delayed childbearing and lower fertility.<p>or:<p>Smarter people tend to be educated.  Educated people tend to be liberals.

347967,comment,347162,347945,0,0,unalone,,,"I hold very specific definitions for terms. For me, literature is defined by aesthetic quality, and that is measurable. The rhythm of the sentences, the flow of the actual <i>sound</i> of the language, and the conciseness of the language... all of that is what makes writing literature to me.<p>But I use literature as a very specific phrase. I don't hold it to encompass all of writing. I use it to define a very particular branch of writing: the sort of writing that has an emphasis on language. However, I don't dismiss things that I don't call literature, either, and I don't hold literature necessarily on a level above everything else, either. For instance: I think that the <i>Narnia</i> series is better-written than <i>Harry Potter</i>, and that it's a more literary series. However, I think that Harry Potter is a better story, and I think that it has more about it that interests me than Narnia. I think the characters are more interesting, the arc of the story is more powerful, and I think that Rowling singlehandedly changed the face of the ""children's literature"" genre. If I were to pick which of the two series to keep and cherish for the rest of time, I'd go for Harry Potter.<p>So, as I said. Take what I said precisely for what I said. I'm not dismissing Yegge's article. I'm just saying that I take the term ""literature"" to define writing that is memorable for its aesthetic. Steve Yegge is an interesting writer, and at times he's compelling, but he is not particularly good with using the English language. He isn't bad, he just isn't good.",1225312165

347933,comment,347810,347810,0,0,iigs,,,"Been doing a few interviews lately. Here's my take:<p>The following things values are logarithmic or exponential (depending on the case), not linear:<p>1) Page count -- One page isn't a hard limit anymore. Your resume has to go through keyword systems and spends most of its HR/recruitment life as a .doc file. The computer doesn't care and you're not getting graded on making it an appropriate length.<p>2) The value of the words on each page -- Make your first page count. I try pretty hard to read the first page or so but start to lose interest as things progress. If the resume reads like a monotonous diary of your activity over the last two decades, nobody's going to be able to tell which words they should read and important stuff will be glossed over.<p>3) The age of the experience -- If you did something really excellent more than five years ago, definitely include it, but you should allocate more space to more recent experiences. If you have three bullets each from your last three jobs and eighteen bullets from the fourth most recent, you're going to look like you have no career inertia or that you're just looking to park. If you have ten years of experience you can skip the details of what your college jobs were -- if they're in field include enough information to show how your career arc builds, but recruiters won't care about individual accomplishments.<p>4) Accomplishments, not tasks -- Your most recent job or two should show a few tasks but an overwhelming bias toward things that you <i>actually did</i>. A list of tasks you were charged with just shows what you didn't like doing enough to continue doing it. The balance should shift as the experience ages -- maybe 20/80% tasks/accomplishments in the first job, 10/90% over the next few, but blending back to 50/50% or even lower as the experience ages. Again, the older or extra-field ones should be especially short.<p>Personally I try to walk the walk on these points, and I also maintain a couple different versions of my resume. The version that I put into the job sites has a ""products used"" section near each job to pander to lazy recruiters who put ""solaris"" into the search box when they need a UNIX system administrator. I generally do not prefer to use these resumes after making contact with the recruiters, because no human cares what versions of SQL server I touched at a job five years ago.",1225311114
