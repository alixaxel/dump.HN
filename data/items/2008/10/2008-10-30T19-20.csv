Consider rewording.<p>The vast majority of MySQL deployments conceal the MySQL connection handler from end-users --- in the vast majority of deployments, it's the web app stack talking to MySQL, not the client. Virtually all security testing of MySQL is done to that service model.<p>""Partitioned"" MySQL is a totally different service model, where the attacks aren't simply string escapes or column truncation through HTTP post-args, but arbitrary SQL syntax, arbitrary MySQL commands, and the MySQL network protocol itself. That service model has received <i>very little</i> security testing. Some data points for context:<p>* The second model implicates vastly more MySQL code, which has to be bug-free for this to be safe.<p>* No major database has survived intensive post-auth security testing; Litchfield's results on Oracle --- a database that got millions of dollars of security attention internally --- were all post-auth; that testing happened after he (presumably) beat the crap out of Microsoft SQL Server.<p>* Even if you ""partitioned"" MySQL into multiple running instances of mysqld running under different UIDs in different filesystem paths --- which is not what this article is implying --- a vulnerability in that MySQL code still gives an attacker code execution on your database server, which would be a game-over problem in a commercial app.",1225396551

Energy independence is a fine issue, but I believe that the new government should pay as much interest to the real advances in science that are coming.<p>The internet has opened up a new frontier for science. Not the little toys that allow you locate your friends on your mobile phones, but the more fundamental changes - milions of people can work on the same thing at the same time, knowledge can be available to everyone at no cost, communication can happen globally without any problem, and hardware is cheap and fast.<p>What this means is that humanity is about to make a new intellectual leap forward. It's not there yet because the tools are not yet available that actually allow it work efficiently, but facebook and future generations of such connectivity tools will make it possible.<p>When these methods are applied to biology or robotics, the combined intellectual avility of human beings made lead to some type of exponential effect that will finally allow us create things that we cannot dream of yet.<p>We are standing on the chasm of the unknown. We should be forging forward, looking for new things, not focusing on that that we know.<p>It's an adventure like the adventure of first flight.

Depressing, huh?<p>Also, I know this is likely not what you want to hear, but it doesn't get any better after your PhD. If you're lucky, you'll get on tenure track and work your arse off for the next 5 years in order to (maybe) get tenure. If you're not so lucky you'll be fighting for post-docs on the type of projects you're talking about. Hopefully there will be only one post-doc, there could easily be 2 or 3.<p>My take is this: Under no circumstances accept the status quo. I've seen so many graduate students spiral into depression because they stuck at it. I know I did, and I stuck at it because of some weird obsession with how I was perceived in the world (by my parents, my old friends, whatever), and because I didn't spend enough time asking myself: What makes me happy? How do I want to live my life - and I don't mean ""I want to be a scientist"", I mean day-to-day, what do you want to be doing?
