344104,comment,343549,343929,0,0,unalone,,,"It depends on what you mean by first-rate. I mean, developing the sorts of things the parent mentioned requires a lot more talent than writing an app. But, to be fair, that requires an incredible amount of skill. Most people, including bright and capable people who work hard to learn, won't ever do something like that. But I agree that the people at Facebook, if not all revolutionary and brilliant, are all pretty damn good at what they do. Beyond scalability, too: Facebook has got more small little quirks that go towards usability than any other site that I know. Then they make a redesign that renders all those small quirks pointless because the new layout is vastly easier. Then they introduce more quirks.<p>The first time that I wrote a long message and saw the message window expand, I jumped with excitement. It was pretty awesome to find a new feature one day that I didn't expect and never would have thought to ask for.",1225003069

344101,comment,343693,344088,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"It is my unsupported opinion that economists have Bush fatigue just like everybody else, and are eager to see the regime of permanent deficits and trillion dollar wars out on the streets. Obama does appear at times to be thoughtful, and his advisors are centrists. I think economists are hoping for a second Clinton, which would certainly be better than a third Bush. I hope they are right.<p>It is my unsupported opinion given my anecdotal interactions with people that the following quote is the explaining factor of The Economist piece:<p>'Either way, according to the economists, it would be difficult to do much worse than George Bush. The respondents give Mr Bush a dismal average of 1.7 on our five-point scale for his economic management. Eighty-two per cent thought Mr Bush’s record was bad or very bad; only 1% thought it was very good.<p>The Democrats were overwhelmingly negative, but nearly every respondent viewed Mr Bush’s record unfavourably. Half of Republican respondents thought Mr Bush deserves only a 2. “The minimum rating of one severely overestimates the quality of Bush’s economic policies,” says one non-aligned economist.'<p>On that, I whole-heartedly agree with them.",1225002761
344100,comment,334355,334355,0,0,tom8williams,,,"I agree totally about starting up something in a down economy.  It's a great time to test the waters, position yourself for growth and then scale like crazy when the economy thaws.  No good surfer ever catches a wave while it's breaking...by that time, it's too late and your eating coral reef.  Good surfer bob up and down watching the horizon for the good wave... the big one.  They see it before it ever starts to break and they're paddling at just the right time to nail it.  Such is the start up entrepreneur in the bad economy.  My company, InnoGage, will be able to weather this storm in the higher ed market, but we will be positioned for the global economy when it thaws.<p>Tom Williams\n<a href=""http://blog.innogage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.innogage.com</a>",1225002708

Technicalities aside, most places consider health as part of the suite of public responsibilities.<p>Does a significant portion of the opposition to the public assuming responsibility for health also oppose the public assuming responsibility for education? I ask because it seems a close parallel.",1225002605

344096,comment,343435,343591,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Also bankruptcies count into your average return of x% if you're tracking the market as a whole. 3 companies will go bankrupt (-100%) but 1 that grossly outperforms the market (+1000% in a few years, for example) more than covers it.<p>It's an average, that's what averages do.",1225002377

I loved the ideas in it - last I tried however I wasn't able to make changes and refresh - I had to restart the app to see changes. Interestingly (and nicely) it ""compiled"" the changes up front, telling me of any errors. That part was nice but having a F5 refresh/change cycle for web apps I think is expected now.",1225002330
