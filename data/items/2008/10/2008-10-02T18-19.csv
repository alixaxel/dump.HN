Unless careful action is taken, I think all the signs point towards a decline in America's ability to project its power.

Right, I agree about this. Bots are not a concern since the tracking is via javascript that will filter every kind of bot unable to run javascript (for now 100% but I guess at some point will'll start to see this kind of bots).<p><pre><code>    > As for monetization: your target audience is fairly narrow, though if you cleaned it up somewhat, it could not only serve the needs of a given web-strategy team (who'd like the real-time stats), and it could be an effective alert method for folks who don't have that built in.

Exactly what we think is that for this for succeed we basically need a way to have more or less the same kind of user base as feedburner.<p><pre><code>    > (If it were me, I'd sell to interested parties.)

I think we'll go for this option even if it is a bit sad.

This is an important point as well, for example AFAIK Analytics does not give any public API in order to get information about the number of pageviews/visits a blog is doing. An opt-in stuff in the preference (again feedburner alike) may do the trick along with some kind of widget to show how much visitors you have and even real time logs to your readers.<p>Thank you for the feedback",1222971427

I think I understand what you mean, in the pratice we did the following: from one hand we tried hard to make real time logs even if time consuming <i>useful</i> because you just see patterns that are not visible via analytics.<p>Another feature is adsense click tracking (only PRO for now), this makes
you able to check who is clicking on your site/blog, so if you are running
an AD-founded site you know if traffic from google is paying your bill
more compared of other referers and so on.<p>On the other side we added a small section of history in LLOOGG, this
works for the free accounts too, basically you can see over the time
unique visitors, page views, returning visitors, with simple graphs very
similar to the ones of feedburner. You can select to view history stats
by day, month, year and if you want to use or not a logarithmic scale.<p>After one year we are pretty sure that the product is useful, our main concern
is if it is useful enough for the target audience to pay for it, and even if so,
how many free accounts we need to run in order to be able to get 1 paying user? Will this single paying user pay for all the free accounts we need to get it? We are not sure the answer here is yes. To this add that we are in Italy and here to setup an way to allow US people to pay is not that simple. And no, Italy is not a good market for paying products, people are not comfortable paying for online services for a lot of reasons.<p>Thank you for the feedback!",1222970903

I don't think it would need to run all the time, though. Something like polling once every ten minutes, checking more often if the position is actually changing, throttled down to e.g. once an hour if it's in the same place as the last two polls, might be enough.

Working on some of the projects I've had I've came to have a deep running disrespect and disgust of Blizzard and its owner Vivendi.<p>Blizzard has used its hammer numerous times on many people.  Some small, some big... specifically calling to mind Blizzard vs. BNETD.  What's unfortunate is that Blizzard is actually winning these arguments and its leaving us with precedence that EULA > The US Constitutions....  If anyone would take the time to read the EULA for World of Warcraft you'll find that some of the claims in it are completely outragous.  More or less, if you do something that Blizzard doesn't like, you're liable to have to pay Blizzard for it.<p>I'm the kind of person who likes to have fun and use my imagination when I play games.  I'll agree that I think it can ruin the game experience when players exploit to benefit themselves, but suing them for it just isn't right.  It is the fact that not only did I risk getting my account banned but doing things like WoWGlider and writing programs that gave you advantage could also risk major lawsuits that I left WoW in the first place with the ambition of designing my own game where I could have fun with the game world and not have to worry about getting sued.  I'm proud to say I made it decently far (though never got close to completion).<p>Personally, I view Blizzard as more ambitious than the RIAA at pursuing copyright infringements, and most of the infrignements Blizzard pursues aren't infringements at all.  A lot of what Blizzard goes after are competitors who make money off Blizzard's product while not reproducing or redistributing their product.  I just can't coprehend how Blizzard ever has justification to claim copyrights when a person or team, using their own knowledge and skills, writes their own programs from the ground up to alter the game's performance while not directly modifying any part of the game.    In the terms of cheating, its justifiable to ban users breaking the policy, in terms of ""3rd party servers"" its justification to fix your own holes and make it harder to do.<p>At this rate, Blizzard's next EULA will say you can't install or play any other video game on the machine that WoW is installed or you'll have to pay three months subscription on the spot.",1222970702
