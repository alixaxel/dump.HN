Both in terms of finding customers who are good from a revenue-per-effort ratio, and also customers who will help you develop your product in interesting ways (e.g. in ways that might be applicable to a broader market). Often, finding a great customer is an essential first step toward building a great product, because they can work with you to help you <i>understand</i> the sort of product they need (and by extension, the sort of product a broader class of attractive customers requires).",1224215828

First, i live in Sydney, Australia and I have been trying to start a company for 3 times while i was in grad school and now working full-time. Each of those time, I found it really hard to start something while working as full timer. I found myself and the team totally burnt out and things are just not moving as fast as we want. And, as a result, the idea just never become reality. I still learn something out of those fail-times though.<p>But now, i am really determined want to make it happen. I am thinking of quitting my day job by the end of this year and take the plunge even though i haven't got a clear sense on what i wanna do and whether the idea might works or not. Somehow, i have the funny feeling that i would be able to survive. Well..the scary feeling is still there. :P<p>Another thing, regarding co-founders, of all those 3 attempts to start a company, i always had partner (not necessarily motivated one!). But, if i take the plunge to start-something up, most of my friends are not ready to take that risk yet either financially or commitment wise. So, i'm thinking i might just do it by myself.<p>The business is not necessarily web-start-ups that might take few months to develop and takes time to attract users. If i quit, i definitely need business that is more revenue-driven to survive as i only have 6 months saving.<p>Now, the question is, what should I do to improve my chance of success despite the situations (sole founder and inexperience)?<p>Thanks!",1224214891

Instead of blundering through a variety of worse-than-modern technologies they should jump directly to current tech; instead of discovering how to build a power infrastructure they should learn from the leaders, etc. The closer they get to ""caught up"" the more they can contribute to advancing the wave of human progress, and the more they will also slow down.<p>If China's GDP increase was on par with the US's, something would be very wrong with China. (Developing countries that aren't increasing their GDP or even see it decrease typically do have something very wrong with them.)<p>(A lot of people seem to make this basic mistake. A developing economy has a lot of low-hanging fruit, long-gone in an industrialized country.

Homer designed ""The Homer"". Herb expressly told the engineers not to tell him what Homer was asking of them -- just to do it.<p>With Perl 6 that's not so. Larry and Company are a group of very smart, talented, and dedicated developers who are working daily to create exactly what they think will make an awesome programming language...

And we're not arguing that you should be subservient, but we'll get back to that bit of projection a little later.<p>We don't argue that it's right, but let's look at the alternatives.  China?  Russia?  The EU?  No one?  Yeah right.<p>Speaking of the EU, we've seen them in action.  It's not clear that they're the best of that sorry bunch.  We all know that if the US announced ""hey, you're right, we're just here for the oil, so we're going to redeploy to cover what we need and let you take care of the rest"", they'd be running troops into Iraq as fast as they could get transport from the Russians.  (They really ought to have some ability to project force.)  Then we'll see how Euros run an occupation.  Most folks think that Germany is the most brutal, but I've got my money on France.<p>As a superpower, the US is basically a resource.  Whenever something big needs doing, the question is ""how do we get the US to do it?""  If you don't like that deal, find a better one and take it.  We won't be offended.<p>We don't want you to to be subservient.  That's how the alternatives work.  (Yes, I'm including EU and subdivisions.)  Instead, we think that your responses when you ask us to do something should show some class.  They should fall into two categories (1) ""thank you"" with as much ""how can we help"" as you can afford and (2) ""on second thought, don't bother, we'll do it ourselves"".  And, we should hear the second a lot more from the EU.  After all, 500M people and more GDP than the US should allow you to do most things on your own.
