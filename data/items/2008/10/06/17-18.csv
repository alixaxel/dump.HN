We got a local marketing firm to donate some strategizing help. We wanted to set up an infrastructure for each team that they could potentially build around. And it worked out really, really well. I know that some of the DreamIt companies ended up getting quite a few people from these partners companies to be on their boards.""<p>Having people on the board of directors of your company from the local accounting and marketing firms? That's just really weird.<p>A board position is certainly not something to be handed out lightly, should reflect the ownership of the company, and definitely not something you're ""lucky to have people on"".",1223315762

Over the last few years people (especially in the US) have been borrowing like crazy based on the value of their homes. These were inflated because of banks being willing to loan to people that really couldn't afford it, thus driving up the price. A simple but vicious circle that ends the day someone yells ""the emperor has no clothes on"".

""That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot.""<p>My primary bread-and-butter language is Javascript.  When done ""right"", Javascript is a very expressive functional/prototypal object oriented language with a lot of very interesting features.  If you can do it in lisp, you can do it in Javascript: <a href=""http://foohack.com/tests/ycomb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foohack.com/tests/ycomb.html</a><p>I've seen in myself and in coworkers, the best Javascripters know at least a little lisp, and as their lisp skills increase, so do their javascript skills.  I suspect it would have the same effect on Ruby or SML or Erlang programmers.<p>Their attitude towards boilerplate code tends to change as well, and they begin seek solutions that are as concise and expressive as possible.<p>Lisp is unique because it effectively has no syntax.  You write the abstract syntax tree directly.  By removing the scaffolding, Lisp exposes the programmer to the fundamental nature of any programming language in a way that no other programming language does.<p>That's why C and Lisp are the best languages to learn, as early as possible: if you know these two pretty well, you're in a good position to master any language you might come across.<p>Misc is a promising cousin of Lisp: <a href=""http://will.thimbleby.net/misc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://will.thimbleby.net/misc/</a> I've played with it a little, but not enough to really have a strong opinion of it.",1223312959
