323802,comment,322542,323738,0,0,13ren,,,"I definitely agree about the right and wrong thing - but what's the most effective way to deal with it? I've been in this kind of situation before, and it was profoundly upsetting for about 6 months, and it's still a negative thing, years later. I did not deal with it well. My interest is in learning how I could deal with these issues better next time - without people hating me, and me becoming bitter (er, <i>more</i> bitter).<p>It's easier to see it in another person (e.g. Thom) and therefore learn about it, than in oneself. So...<p>The only way I can see for Thom to have gotten through this, was to have made similar speed improvements to his own code (even if it meant getting someone else to do it for him, if he wasn't an assembly hacker). Then, whether he sued Katz or not, he would have won, and been happy. If you stop users from getting a better product, and you won't supply it yourself, they won't like you one bit. I don't think people's good opinion should matter to me, but it really, really does. I really don't like it when people are angry with me, even when it's their misunderstanding. I like fan mail.<p>There's a tendency in everyone to think that because you were the first to do or find something, that it somehow belongs to you... Many people think of Microsoft as inventing the computer and the internet - because Microsoft brought it to them. It's as if the delivery guy somehow created it! Prometheus gets credit for fire (but he stole it!) I strongly have these feelings myself, and there are good justifications for them (in motivating people to find stuff, do stuff, be first) - but it's just not true, in a philosophical sense. When you're first, it's partly a blessing. You can't claim 100% responsibility for the opportunity that came to you, or for the existence of the thing that you found. You can claim preparedness, recognition and acting on it. Thom had an opportunity to create Arc - and he did. Then Katz came along with speed improvements - round 2.<p>I believe that thinking purely in moral terms doesn't always give you the best outcomes, as in that saying ""would you rather be happy or right?""<p>We can't stop people from abusing our trust - but do we have to become victims to it, so we have no choices in our response to it? Or does our universe of options contain paths that lead to outcomes we'd be happier with?<p>I'd like to learn how to handle this kind of situation better next time - so I'm also interested in how Google will handle that open source copy of their PageRank patent... I think they'll handle it adroitly, in a way I could learn from... (maybe offer to employ the guys?  or maybe just ignore them, if they don't get anywhere?)<p>BTW: I think PKarc was the copy + improvement; PKzip was a complete rewrite, and non-infringing. Not just alleged, but ""proven"" in court.<p>(I hope the different threads of morality, ownership and how to best handle it are not too intertwined in this rambling comment - I've tried my best to untwine them, but I'm very tired, and don't think I've succeeded).",1223175385

I've thought of walking away many times since in my opinion dealing with dishonest people is not worth it.  I haven't signed anything ever with them.  It's all been on good faith.  I've been doing work on their servers and checking it into their repository I'm not sure what that means.

My degrees (3 of them and an ABD) are generally from working class type schools. I went to a private high school (almost entirely because the public school system failed me miserably) which was classed as a ""hockey school"" (Loyola High School, Montreal) and the neighborhood rival to a high school that educated Canadian prime ministers (Lower Canada College). Somehow I got a pretty good education - I think that it was at every stage, better than the elitist track. Like the old Hertz commercials - ""we're second, so we try harder""",1223173194

People who go to Philips Andover and then onto Harvard may be liberal in their politics but are very neo-con in their classism, even if they didn't start out that way. I don't remember what essay it was, but I vaguely remember PG writing about people in Boston trying to become ""Thurston Howell III"" and this unfortunately transfered over to much of Cambridge.",1223172731

The founder has lied to me several times, gone ballistic on me and is one of those ultra paranoid crazies.  If I knew this about him when I started I would never have worked for him. I've been promised a large amount of stock months ago and haven't received my stock agreement yet.  We now have a well known investor that has just agreed to invest.  Over the past few months I've been told ""hey your stock agreement is coming"".  Then the other day I get handed some paperwork to sign: NDA and contract.  They say ""sign these and you'll get your stock agreement"".   The problem is that the contract is outrageous and takes away every right I have.  Clearly I'm not going to sign it.  I just want to know what's in my stock agreement and they're telling me ""hey that's up to the investor and his law firm"".  My lawyer is saying ""don't sign anything until we see what's going to be in that stock agreement"".  So we're kind of at a deadlock. Advice?",1223172723
