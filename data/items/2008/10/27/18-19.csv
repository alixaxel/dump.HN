345398,comment,345126,345126,0,0,dmv,,,"The motorcycle screw reminds me of a similar problem solving lesson I have learned from experience, which may resonate more with those less mechanically inclined.<p>When moving a large object (especially a couch), remove everything you can (that is intented to be removable) from the object (legs, pillows) and the path (doors come off hinges easily).  The set up and tear down (in testing terms; in practical terms, it is reverse order) steps seem like potential wasted effort, but taken as a mandatory step are constant time.  Iterating through the things that need to be removed to achieve the goal is linear, with potentially exponential cost (you get tired).  Like what everyone is saying about burn rates in a recession: in hindsight, few regret trimming too early and plenty regret trimming too late.  Few complain about a move made too easy.<p>In theory, this is a straightforward argument that any sufficiently intelligent person could read and practice.  In practice, it is not until at least your third move that you pause during the move to question why the plan is ""let's just try it first"" and ""it is not too heavy"".  But you never see a professional piano mover iterate. This is not a comment trying to propose a solution.

But hardware cache friendly algorithms have good locality. This means that once they pull data into the cache, they do everything to it that they need to before it gets kicked out. Cache unfriendly algorithms continually kick out and pull in the same data.<p>The simplest example of this is iterating over a two-dimensional array in C. Since C stores arrays in row-major format (the rows are contiguous in memory), you want to iterate over the rows first, then the columns:<p><pre><code>  for (i = 0; i < ROW; ++i)\n    for (j = 0; j < COL; ++j)\n      matrix[i][j] = 0;\n</code></pre>\nThe opposite will result in many more cache misses:<p><pre><code>  for (i = 0; i < COL; ++i)\n    for (j = 0; j < ROW; ++j)\n      matrix[j][i] = 0;\n</code></pre>\nIn the second case, in the inner loop the column is fixed, and it's the row that is changing. Since a two-dimensional matrix in C has contiguous rows, this means that each load in the inner most loop will probably result in a cache miss. In the first case, since the inner loop has a fixed row, and is iterating over the columns, the memory being accesses is contiguous, so it will consume all of the data on a cache line before kicking it out.",1225132787

345354,comment,345268,345268,0,0,nradov,,,"Establish a customer / supplier relationship between teams that build libraries and those that consume those libraries to build applications. Treat the libraries as separate internal products with a defined release schedule and version numbers. Require any library API changes which could break backward compatibility be delivered in a release with a new major version number, along with documentation.<p>It also helps to organize your source code repository so that every developer can check out all the code across your entire organization. Then when a library developer refactors something she can immediately see if any dependent code will no longer build or fails unit tests. Google does this, at least for the majority of their Java code. I saw a presentation from the Google Collections developers and they explained that working that way made it fairly easy to revise their API.",1225131681

If you want to do it yourself you'll either have to put together your own system (that is EASY to use - trust me that is essential) or invest in a commercial package. That can be expensive - so it might be cheaper to seek professional services.<p>If iti s only a small company you <i>might</i> be ok just keeping a general book (income, outlay, expenditure etc etc.) and keep all receipts. Then at the end of the financial year take all that to an accountant and pay him to get it all written up and submitted. That is how it works in the UK (and probably costs around £400-500 depending on the amount of work involved) - I dont know if that is the case in China but it is worth investigating. Usually there is no formal requirement for a small startup to keep regulated books - just to have some form of accounts the tax man can request at any time (it;s more complex than that but, meh, essentially all that ya need to know :P)",1225131419

Simple logical way to look at this:<p>1) You need more customers, visitors, users,etc.\n2) Google often drives them to you. The higher you are, the more of them you see.\n3) You apply SEO tactics to increase ranking\n4) More people come, you've achieved your goals.<p>Now, doing this alone doesnt mean anything:<p>a) if your product sucks, you can be number one on google.  odds are, you still wont go anywhere.\nb) if your support sucks, the people you convery will leave.\nc) if you cant sell, these people will leave after talking to you.<p>Hope this makes sense, just giving a balanced opinion.",1225131405

345339,comment,345242,345267,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Hey,<p>Well my personal circumstances are by the by: they were an example :D\nMy point was really more that you should try to talk to people with experience (face to face, not just here). A half hr to an hr conversation will probably get quite a lot of stuff straight.<p>Considering your situation it's a bit hard to give advice. Do you actually have a product to bring to market? Are you at a stage where you a) need funding or b) can begin to sell. With my startup I worked with a team of friends for about 2 years before we formed the actual company. We all had day jobs or university and so we worked in our downtime bringing our idea into fruition. Now we have an almost marketable product and are at the stage where funding is essential: so recently we took the step of forming the company and searching for funding.Until now it was an unecessary need.<p>If your not selling or bringing in cash for funds then I would advise avoiding forming any legal entity. The only thing I would say is that it might be worth signing some kind of partnership agreement between you and your friend. I'm sure things will be fine but if you fall out (it's so easy) it is best to know exactly where you stand in terms of what individually you can take away (ideas, code, etc.).<p>As to the final part of that post - regarding getting out if the startup fails. That is incredibly country specific. You will need to get some advice: either from a lawyer or from a public body (if they exist) as to your exact options.<p>In the UK you could, for example form a Limited Liability Partnership (where if things folded you only have a small personal liability) or an full on LTD company (where there is no personal liability). I <i>assume</i> similar entities can be formed in China (though I DONT KNOW).<p>I think the best advice is to hunt for someone locally who can tell you your options in that case.<p>If your entering into contracts with other companies at this stage (note not <i>just</i> selling - actual contracted agreements) then you DEFINITELY need to consult professionally. It shouldn't be too expensive and is worth it. If your obtaining funding and are presented a contract ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS take it to a lawyer before signing. :)<p>Good luck!",1225131004
