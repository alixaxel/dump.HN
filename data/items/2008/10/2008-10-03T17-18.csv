Not only because it tracks my time working, but just knowing it's own makes me less likely to waste time online - because I know at the end of the week I'm going to get an email saying ""Hey Sid, we know you spent 8 hours in front of Google Readers.""  My first week I think I spent 1 or 2 hours in RescueTime (tagged ""navel gazing"") but part of it was useful, I was tagging stuff!<p>The news filter feature is killer.

Are the members put into MingleWeeks manually or is it by some sort of automated algorithm? I'm assuming the latter.<p>I couldn't find anywhere on the site that says how long it takes to put those groups together. I think you need to set some expectations as far as that goes.<p>So I created an profile and answered some questions about myself. Now I'm waiting for MingleWeek to begin. I didn't pay and I only spent a few minutes so it really doesn't matter if it takes a few hours or days or weeks for MingleWeek to start. If it never starts I'm only out my small time investment.<p>If I paid on the other hand, I feel like I'm in limbo with no idea of when I'll see results or if anything is even happening. Sure I can continually update my first impression but I'm not likely to spend any more time until I know whether it will ""pay off"" or not. Does that make sense?",1223055417

Now, I have yet to work the math on this one but, rather than a 32,000 mile long elevator why not try sticking something from the equator to just above LEO, and using a series of orbiting satellites (or a cable around the earth) to keep it up (you would need to deflect them).  Granted you still need to add orbital velocity but if you can get a useful amount of mass stable at that altitude you could build a pair of them to safely get something into orbit using a long rail gun between two of them.<p>I don't think it's stable but if you wanted to move a huge amount of mass out of the gravity well it might work.",1223054340

One of them is a good looking smart phone...the other one isn't even a phone. Apple has birthed a whole and completed creature, beautiful to behold. Google meanwhile has conjured up a spirit, or a virus that can latch onto any form. Google is hoping that android sticks around and reincarnates into various physical form factors which will one day out number or out-slick whatever any one single manufacturer can come up with. (Like the Nokia Morph!?) If successful it can be eventually be embedded to whatever device replaces the cell phone one day.<p>Not that many people on the planet knows what Symbian is either, but that's okay with Nokia Ericsson et al.",1223054311
