It's one thing to be faithful to a set of teachings and it's another to believe a particular set of statements to be literally true.</i><p>I understand the wish to be diplomatic & uninflammatory. After all, a lot of wars have started over these kinds of things but.. I think that statement doesn't make much sense. I think that making that statement is confusing religion with scripture. If you take Christians as an example, many do not believe various elements (eg Adam & Eve) to be <i>literally</i> true. OK. I understand.<p>But all that means they are essentially reading a different text. One is reading a history & rule book. The other is reading a book which contains high level principles in the form of stories, some of which may be based on real events. There are lots of variations.<p>What they have in common is that both are receiving information from a divine, supernatural (unless you do semantic cartwheels) source. Both believe this information to be definitively true. To me (an atheist) the distinctions seem less significant then the commonalities. The religious have a source of information that I do not have.<p>The words faith, belief, god, religion etc. are very hard to generalise. But the idea behind them is often simply information",1222747142

I no longer use them, as their services are so incredibly bad that they add negative value to any project that involves them.

The real issue isn't that people want some source that's capable of counting votes accurately.  The problem is that the machines aren't necessarily counting all the votes; having some open source software laying around somewhere doesn't guarantee that the machines themselves are running audited and trusted code.  How can anything other than a physical, tamper-resistant audit trail help make vote tallies trustworthy?",1222746649
