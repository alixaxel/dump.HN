This approaches (-0)/0 = 0/0 but simplifying the limit given an answer of -1. So 0/0 is completely dependent on the characteristics of the convergence and had no meaning in isolation. In fact, the field of real (and complex) numbers does not even include 0 in the multiplicative group. Therefore, dividing by 0 is nonsensical as it has no inverse as it is not in the multiplicative field. According to the basic axioms of groups theory, given a field <i>F</i> with <i>a</i> the identity of the additive group in the field and <i>b</i> some element of the multiplicative group, it can be proven that mul(a,b) = a where mul is the multiplication operation. This explains why 0 times any other number is 0. If you would like a copy of the proof, just drop me an email.<p>Sorry for the rant, math major.",1222646293

Just use whatever you use on a desktop to minimize niggly almost-the-same-but-not-quite annoyances between them, and you'll be happy.<p>Personally, I like Debian Testing on my servers -- it's reasonably recent (as opposed to Debian Stable, which gets hopelessly outdated quickly), has no releases (instead it just stays up to date as you update stuff) and is rock solid for me, but it's more a matter of taste than anything else.<p>Besides, I like Debian's attempts to mostly stick with Free software in their base distro. While I'm not a fanatic, I like knowing that what I use is open source, and that I can fix it and debug by hacking it up (and occasionally have) if it breaks on me.",1222644886

317909,comment,317155,317907,0,0,defen,,,"I actually don't have any interest in or experience with poly relationships - I was merely asking as a rhetorical question.  But everything you said makes sense - being able to designate a single person to make those kinds of important decisions is extremely useful.  It would be very good if those rights/responsibilities could be unbundled from marriage.<p>Where it gets more complicated is in things like the tax code - it seems advantageous to society to offer tax breaks to married couples, with the idea being that this will help them have more resources for raising children.  Of course this is predicated upon the notion that a husband-wife team is the best way to raise children (which I happen to believe).  If gay marriage is strictly equal to straight marriage, those sorts of policies would seem to disproportionately favor gay couples (who tend not to have children) over straight ones (who generally do).",1222644643

317907,comment,317155,317893,0,0,mdasen,,,"Because both the government and corporations don't want to be giving you plus your 7 wives/husbands benefits.<p>You shouldn't be limited to one partner in terms of love/sex/living together/whatnot if you so desire.  Why the hell should I care?  But let's say that your job offers healthcare for you and your partner - if you have 18 partners, that's a hell of a different cost from one partner.<p>Likewise, let's say that you slip into a comma.  Who has say over that feeding tube?  That's already complicated!  Let's say I'm some rich jerk trying to skirt the inheritance tax.  Well, spouses are one way around it.  Well, clearly my kids are also my spouses!  Who gets to visit you at the hospital and who doesn't?  Well, spouse 1 says your friend Joe should come, but spouse 2 hates Joe.  Does it work by majority voting?  What if they can't find all your spouses and you're dying and Joe really wants to see you?<p>So, if you think of marriage as the government telling you that you can only love/have sex with/live with one person, it seems oppressive if you desire something else.  If you see marriage as this standard government contract that says you are allowed to designate one other individual for partner benefits, hospital visitation, inheritance, etc. then it makes sense.<p>The problem is that our society equates marriage with love/sex.  Marriage should probably be seen as a contract.  As such, you can see how it wouldn't really work to designate 6 people as having the right to determine whether you stay on life support.  Yes, you could simply create individual contracts specifying everything that marriage entails, but that's tedious, expensive, prone to error and requires everyone who deals with you to have a lawyer to interpret that agreement -  and they're not going to want to spend hundreds of dollars for a lawyer and tons more in liability to interpret your individualized contracts so they'll just deny you.  Marriage is a standard convenience contract and shouldn't be confused with love or sex.<p>//I'm really interested to see if you disagree with this or how you think things like benefits/hospital visitation/whatnot should work in poly relationships (yeah, sociology student ;-))",1222644095

Assuming CoolTech isn't subsequently found to cause the sudden onset of rickets in its users (or whatever), the market for [stuff that stuff that satisfies the need for cell phones] is still saturated.

317902,comment,317170,317807,0,0,etal,,,"A worthy aim, but the whole idea of the ""law"" is Norvig's implied definition of what market penetration means. If 75% of the people in the world have never owned a smartphone, then doubling the number of smartphone owners is a big accomplishment, and doubling it again means you've introduced 100% of the world to smartphones. The number of phones you've <i>sold</i> is not the concern, it's the proportion of people whose needs have been satisfied. (At least, that's what Norvig cares about.)<p>Without going down the route of identifying a new market, once more than 50% of the population in question has had its needs met, that market is mature -- its growth has reached a point of inflection, and no amount of pushing on the part of the existing industry will make the product continue to change lives at the rate it used to. The opportunity that was there has already been identified and seized.<p>Now, if everyone in Finland has a personal cell phone, and another 25% also keep a separate cell phone for business use, it's suddenly worth redefining what the market is. Should the industry try to double market penetration of business-only cell phones, now? Why isn't one phone enough, and could a new product meet these separate needs better? Or alternately, some people keep two phones with different plans, and switch between them to keep the total bill down -- breaking that confusopoly is another business opportunity worth identifying, but tracking units/plans sold instead of actual market penetration by population will mask it.",1222643154

Take a number, e.g. 5. 
Then take a small number, like 0.1. 
Add 0.1 to itself, and repeat, you'll eventually reach 5.<p>But if you take 0, and keep adding 0 to it, you'll never reach 5. So no amount of 0's will go in to 5.<p>That logic breaks down if you do 0/0 though. My students never picked up on that one but they believed me!",1222643145
