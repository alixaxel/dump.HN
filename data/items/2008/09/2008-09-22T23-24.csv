All they got where 3 bulbs, but they still seemed pretty pleased. More persistent then door to door mobile phone guys.<p>I guess this is like a super simple case study in carbon trading, pitfalls & all. How many credits should these guys be getting?<p>In my case, I probably would have replaced those bulbs anyway. In other cases, the incentive can be weirder. For one thing, There's a double jeopardy going on here. 1. Individual feel-goodness of the guy who traded in his bulbs 2. Individual feel-goodness via the carbon market.<p>Both are getting credit here. I feel like I'm lowering my emissions. But since those credits have been sold, someone else is emitting them in my place. They do the equivalent of taking my 100W bulb & plugging it into their wall with the fuzzy feeling that even thought they are emitting carbon, it is being offset. We are both claiming credit.<p>That's before the perverse incentives kick in. Why should I pay $8 X 10 to bulb my house with low watt bulbs when I can pay $0.50 X 10 to do so with cheap bulbs & call in these guys?",1222127923

However, the replies that I got did nothing to really answer it; it was just handwaving.<p>That was ten years ago.  I understand Lisp systems quite a bit better now, but I maintain that it is a valid question.  Why?  You have made the point that C programs can be built to rely upon dynamic libraries, and indeed they can, and this is similar to Lisp programs relying upon the Lisp runtime.<p>However, C programs can also be built statically, and not have to rely upon additional libraries being present.  This is not only possible, but fairly common, especially for simple programs.<p>If a Lisp novice is trying to build, say, ""Hello World,"" and expects a static executable as a result, why is that so much to ask?  In fact, it is a lot to ask of Lisp, but if you are new to Lisp, you are not likely to understand why.<p>I wouldn't expect a novice C programmer to write ""Hello, World"" such that it depends upon dynamic libraries; moreover, a novice ought to be able to stay busy learning C and writing ostensibly useful programs for quite a while without doing dynamic linking.<p>Unfortunately, it seems that too many Lisp novices don't get the answer that you have provided (which is quite a useful answer).
