And I completely agree with you, it must be laid back and natural to be effective. That was our goal from the start for Socialbrowse: not to change your browsing behavior, but to enhance the way you already browse, and improve the sites you like to visit.<p>Socialbrowse is realtime, but doesn't require your attention. It's like a human powered RSS stream, so you can pick and choose which links you take or conversations you participate in. Or you can choose to ignore them completely if you're busy. We developed Socialbrowse to be there when you want it, but not to interfere when you don't. That's why it feels very non-intrusive, yet when you take it away, the web feels lonely again.",1220637211

Right now they're attempting to shut out competitors in a slew of fields at once. Apple has usually done very well at this in the past. However, they launched three things in one (three things, right), and each one has had a set of problems on its own. So it's become noticeable that Apple's products aren't entirely flawless.<p>I got myself an iPod Touch, and while I'm pissed off at the things that aren't working, and the lagging bits, I at least have some perspective. I know that I'd take the Touch over any other MP3 player in existence, and that includes the 1.0 Touch. I gained more than I lost.

296068,comment,295674,295674,0,0,pmsaue0,,,"For 3 years I worked on a startup that built SMS applications.  Although we did not work with MMS, I am very familiar with the struggles regarding carriers and just getting set up.  Ultimately our startup failed - our costs were just too high, our slice of the pie was too small, and to reach the volume that we would need to become self-sufficient would require a bigger financial investment in advertising than our CEO was able to acquire or willing to make.  Anyway....<p>I read over a long email string that I had with reps from several carriers regarding setting up direct relationships with them.  At the time, our company was working with the carrier aggregator (middle-man) mQube - they were then the best, but we wanted to cut them out of the picture.  If you don't already know this, carrier aggregators are essentially the gatekeepers to the carriers, and if you want to do ANYTHING substantial, you need to go through an aggregator.  The alternative is to have direct-binds with the carriers themselves using lease-lines or special relationships.  Through my correspondence, direct-binds are no longer offered, therefore it is pretty much impossible to become an mQube (Verisign became an mQube late in the game only by purchasing mQube).  The next problem is that mQube's UI and customer service is pretty horrible, and you have to go through it if you want to get your program brief approved.  Getting your program brief approved will most likely be your biggest challenge, and program briefs are like $1000/mo at least.  The different carriers have different requirements, etc.  You'll probably have to peruse and follow something like this: <a href=""http://www.mmaglobal.com/bestpractices.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mmaglobal.com/bestpractices.pdf</a><p>We spent months trying to convince mQube that we weren't going to spam people and that our app was legit.  We were a non-subscription based service that supplied information/content only when a user initially requested it.  That type of application is in the VAST minority of SMS apps, as most out there are horoscope type subscription services that people have trouble opting out of.  In short, you are always going to be playing the carriers' game, and you will probably never win or even break even unless you have BIG BUCKS.<p>In Europe and Japan, if I remember, and it may have changed, there is only one cell provider ie Vodaphone, and it is much easier to get things done.  The CTIA has the potential to create some standardization, but I don't see that happening.<p>Best of luck",1220635536
