296992,comment,296895,296968,0,0,notauser,,,"There is some confusion about just how illegal it is in the US. The EULA does not permit it, but that isn't the same thing as it being against the law - especially since the EULA is presented post-purchase. (This assumes you bought your copy, of course.)<p>Still, until judgement in Apple vs Pystar (which is slightly broader) it would be better not to assume anything. Common law systems can produce some funny results and special cases. Just because you can drop a Ford engine into a Toyota without fear of legal action doesn't mean it carries across directly to software.<p>Being able to use software you buy however you wish with very little fear of inciting legal action is a great argument for adopting Linux, of course :)",1220731098

Mac OS X offers the power of Linux with vastly better user experience. OS X lets you do all the powerful *nix stuff but at the same time saves you from having to hunt for drivers and do tons of configuration. There's definitely something to be said for Linux, but time savings isn't one of those things.",1220730304

There's more than just power metrics.<p>The 'Mac aura' is a big part in why Apple has been so successful. I've never understood why people tend to downplay the 'aura.' Most of us find meaning in design and aesthetics. I know I do. I made the switch to Mac after 18 years of using Windows, and every extra penny spent was well worth it; and I can speak for another 20 I know that have done and feel the same.<p>I've seen many comments here that express the same sentiment in the article. And it's funny, you'd think those that are trying to build a strong user base by providing their users with the best product experience possible (mostly UI focused) would see that there's great importance to be found in aesthetics.<p>By dismissing the 'aura' and being 'hip' you neglect a big part of what makes us humans. We all want to be cool, and we all want others to admire our design choices, at least most of us do -- a majority not accurately represented by this community. And from a purely business standpoint, positioning your product to appeal to this part of the human psyche can reap huge rewards. If you can fulfill those wants, people will pay.",1220729302

I followed some of the advice on the balsamiq blog (http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/?p=198). My projected ramp up is as follows:<p>1. Set up a beta test with about 30 users. This has started to die off a little so I'm going to try to get users motivated with number 3.
2. Contacted bloggers in the niche I'm targeting (Information Security) and the people hosting the platform I'm using to promote the site on launch.
3. Set up a competition for beta testers with £100 for the first to reach 100 posts/comments.<p>Is there anything else others would recommend? Have any HN users had any similar experiences, if so what would you do?",1220729128

-Windows Vista is not bad, my next Laptop is with Windows Vista. Windows Vista only works bad on old hardware/software.
-I have worked on Mac OS X for 4 months, I will not buy a mac soon, here is why:
Mac is cool for new users, it is easy to use. But if you are a good Linux/Windows user, you'll find that Mac OS X is a loss of time. I can do things faster in Linux and Windows.
For documents presentations, spreadsheets its pretty much the same for Mac or Windows because they both use Microsoft Office. I personnaly prefer Microsoft Office than OpenOffice. For internet browsing they all have firefox, so pretty much the same.
I don't know what you call exactly light programming. For Web Developpement I think it is pretty much the same, for Programs I love Visual Studio and I hate Mac OS X SDK Developer (or something like that) so that gives you my opinion.
And I think dual boots are stupid, I prefer one perfect OS, so I'm not buying a Mac to put Windows on it.",1220728077

However, the biggest problem I see is reinforcing - concrete performs very poorly in tension without steel (usually rebar) reinforcing, and in general is not allowed by most building codes.  One solution would be to have the robot build a double wall that effectively acts as formwork for the real structural wall in the resultant cavity.  The structural concrete would have to be poured after reinforcing is placed in the cavity, and structural continuity would need to be achieved by the rebar connecting to rebar in the foundation as well.  The other approach that would work better for the robot would be a radical improvement in concrete technology that would boost the tensile strength without the need for rebar - that would be ideal.",1220727945
