When it bust altogether, I pretty much forgot about computers.<p>I reached 14, I lost my brother, and as I watched my family crumble I turned to drinking and smoking weed. Yes, at 14. I hung out with the wrong crowd, I did things I shouldn't have and I spent my school time living up what was deemed the ""ideal"" social life by my peers.<p>A year or so later I got really in to computers again. I started making web pages; I got a new (old) desktop which I tweaked up and geeked out on. I progressed from HTML and CSS to PHP (and yeah, I know that PHP has a bad rap amongst most hackers here, but I like it), spent all my time in IT at school etc. I gently progressed in to a real computer nerd.<p>Looking back now, I can honestly say that the time I ""wasted"" messing about with computers, teaching myself how to code, etc.. they were the best of my teenage years, and I have no regrets on how I spent my time. It is who I am, I enjoy doing what I do. I wouldn't change for anyone.",1222361818

I started Siliconverge (http://www.siliconverge.com) - a Digg like social news site for Semiconductor & Hardware industry a few months ago.<p>The site is catering to very niche market. I am doing this in the part-time because I strongly believe that this site will add tremendous value to lives of people from Semiconductor industry. I'am a Chip Design Engineer and feel the pain, and see tremendous value in this service.<p>Semiconductor/Hardware people still visit 10 different news sources on the web to read news - the typical traditional way. And there is no service for this industry, which provides similar experience the way Siliconverge tries to provide.<p>Now, my question is - how do I build the community around this site? As we always know, these services don't add value unless there is a passionate community behind it.<p>All kinds of inputs/suggestions/feedback will be highly appreciated.<p>In general, this question applies to all those people, who want to start such niche news sites using Slinkset/Pligg or so.<p>Creating such sites has become very easy now - but what about building the community, and hence the potential business around it? Any thoughts?<p>Aditya,
