1) what would I do with the avatar I would create? you mean for a new logo? or as an avatar? or just stick it somewhere??<p>2) the site should have shown you musicians in your town, if google could't find you by IP address, than it would show you everything. Or were you saying that it wouldn't show you this or next weekend because of the 'next' buttons not showing up?<p>Hopefully I'll be able to get 'date ranges' going in the next few weeks, but if you select the 'day' from the filter, it should give you the shows in your area.<p>Thanks again for the comments.

This is not important, but you are not being careful to properly center align stuff. Like the ""Next 30"" button<p>5. The difference in your font sizes on the sidebar is too large.

Inform me first.<p>9. Your favicon colors suck. No seriously, those are very dull colors<p>- Now here are some things you should do<p>1. Go to one of the online avatar creators and make yourself a vector avatar with big ears. It will give your site a more friendly look<p>2. Drop that big-ass adsense banner, it makes your site look cheao<p>3. Change the color scheme slightly to a more appealing color. Mixing gray and brown is not good<p>4. Importat: When I search I want to see the artists I searched for in the middle, not some features artists. Show more results in the middle, the sideways display is a bit strange<p>5. Explain what the map does, I could not figure it out.<p>6. Clicking next did not work<p>-- Things you did good<p>1. Nice page after the front page<p>2. I like the photoshop work<p>3.
