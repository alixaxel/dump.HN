Like, for example, the Pandora iPhone app. It's the one iPhone app I use on a consistent basis, and is worth its weight in gold. How much do they charge for it? Nothing. That's nice and all, but they should split it into ""free"" and ""premium"" versions (a la Twitterific from IconFactory). Most people would just use the free version, but as IconFactory proved there are plenty of people out there who'd support the app by purchasing a premium blend.",1222605032

If no deal goes through, you wasted that effort. Why should you be forced to make that upfront investment at this point?<p>As I said, I know it is easy to talk...",1222604796
