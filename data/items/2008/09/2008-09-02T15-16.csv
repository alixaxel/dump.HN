Interfaces and Mix-ins are ways you can deal with this in a ""noun-oriented"" way.  (Templates can be used like this as well.)<p>However, if you just need a function specific to two types, why not just define a function for those types?<p>In Smalltalk, you'd just use a block with no arguments and hopefully write Unit Tests to cover type inconsistencies.  This block would have to sit around somewhere in a method where it is defined, however.  Or, you could implement the #value:value: message somewhere and pretend something else is a code block.  (There is a similar mechanism in Python, but I can't recall it.)",1220371190
