To suggest that this type of belief is simply a meaningless may in fact be correct, but it leaves a big part of the equation blank.<p>It's like answering math questions without showing your work.

Glad to see that they're different.<p>That's great that VTiger was offered with a good license, but I don't think the intentions of forking sugar were the best.  Their licensing may have caused some issues, but now GPL3 has cleared most of those.  If Zoho's products are superior why continue to offer VTiger, which is primarily Sugar's code?  Why not just open source ZohoCRM and unify things together?  Granted, that is much easier said than done.<p>Sure, most people haven't woken up to the power of UI.  Think of the poor souls still on SAP or Great Plains or whatever CRM you can think of.  There's no doubt Zoho is proven.  Microsoft is also proven, but the way they execute on products isn't exactly the best.<p>Zoho Creator is very nice.  The app store launched this week via web 2.0 expo is pretty cool.<p>Adventnet(zoho,vtiger,etc.) is a hell of a business.  I just challenge you guys to do something truly different to shake things up.  You're right, 12 years has afforded you to do things like Zoho, so take that juice to kick it a few notches up. Best of luck.<p>-jlb",1221859903

While we may have been greedy before, banks and other financial institutions thought that the profits from structured products would never end. Sadly, not only has the market for these items run out, those that are still in the system almost brought it down.<p>Many people are excited about the government's recent announcements concerning their plan to take these products out of the public system, but my gut says that we still have more trouble coming. It may not specifically be another failure, but the events of the last year and a half (and specifically the last six months) have not fully run their full course through the markets, i.e., we will still see a recession.",1221858932

309480,comment,309214,309214,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"For what it's worth, I worked in television while in college, running the tape machines, and various behind the scenes stuff. From the perspective of TV stations, a new spot can definitely go online within 24 hours (usually less).  The actual time is generally already bought and paid for months in advance...<i>but</i> there's always time available for the right price.  Anytime you see an ad for a show or movie or event for the station itself (e.g. ""Watch Friends every day at 6 and 8 PM""), that is a spot that is for sale, for the right price, until the day the spot runs.<p>Here's how it worked from a technical perspective ten, or so, years ago, when I worked in the industry:<p>Ads come in automatically via satellite twice per day, in big batches of 20-40 spots.  They are automatically recorded onto a single tape (a computer was put online for this a few weeks before I left the station--it was a different ad distribution company, I believe, and so only a few ads were running off of this system, so I'm not deeply familiar with it, but it was <i>fully</i> automated, with no human intervention required to go from ad network to air).  The single tape was then processed by a tape operator (me) onto individual tapes, and labeled with a barcode, for use in the master control automated tape loader.  Turnaround time was usually an hour or two from the usual spot feed, and the spots were usually airing by the next day.<p>When an ad had a mistake, a special feed would be scheduled...sometimes within hours of the mistake being found and the ad producer being notified.  A new version of the ad could definitely be online the same day.  With the automated computer system, I suspect it could be replaced in minutes.<p><i>However</i>, spot production is a somewhat different story.  Depending on the size of the production, it could take weeks to schedule all of the pieces to fall into place.  That said, with enough money and enough muscle (which Microsoft has in spades), a large scale production could be done in days or even hours.<p>To put things further into perspective, the station I worked for (WB 39 in Houston) also had a production division, and would occasionally make spots practically in real-time for local advertisers to tie into ongoing events like Rockets games.  Adding running commentary of the game to spots, by the usual spokesperson for the company (like Mattress Mac), was a reasonably common practice.  If Microsoft <i>really</i> wanted to change directions fast, they could do it.  It'd cost them two or three times as much (if they were a normal customer...though their agency may have eaten some of the cost just to keep MS happy through these trying times and the perceived disaster that is the spots they'd already produced), and the agency would have to re-schedule other customers productions (or pay lots of overtime), but it could definitely be done.",1221858855

309478,comment,309214,309214,0,0,unalone,,,"It's not exactly fair to call John Gruber a ""Mac fanboy"" and dismiss him at that. He's got a point with his postings: Microsoft touted Seinfeld for a LONG time and then dropped him after two weeks. They announced this not from the ad firm they hired but from their PR department, which is indicative of the fact that this wasn't a decision straight from the firm. That all leads to the conclusion that Microsoft is slightly panicking. Considering how adamant Gruber is AGAINST things that Apple does that he DOESN'T like, I think it's fair to say that he has a reputation for being fair-minded. And, you know, if a ton of fair-minded people like one product (Apple), perhaps there's a logic behind their liking it. You never know. It's possible. ;-)<p>As for your saying that this is good because it can't be understood: I'm going to call BS. Being deliberately vague never works for anybody. The ads WERE understandable (hey, guys, Bill Gates is pretty cool, and we're not a faceless empire!), so your point doesn't quite work, but things that you can't understand are either things you can LEARN to understand or they're poorly done. Simple as that.",1221858675
