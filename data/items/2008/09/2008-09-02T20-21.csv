<a href=""http://www.soundproofingcompany.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.soundproofingcompany.com</a><p>To soundproof, one needs to viscoelastically damp the walls, windows and door, and seal all of the cracks.<p>Additionally, he should lock the door and never let any other member of the household in.

You will have to fight with your spouse on this issue, too - but it is a fight worth winning. They will want to make it an ""office/guest room"" or ""office/sewing room"" or ""office/hobby room"". You will have to argue, under threat of divorce, that your office is going to be an office slash nothing. If the spouse doesn't want to go along with this, get divorced now, it will save you a lot of trouble.<p>Spousal support, by the way, is essential in establishing your own practice. Spouses can kill the whole deal. Your spouse may have married you when you were a rising star associate at a big name firm - and they may be attracted to the status that conveys. Working out of your spare bedroom isn't going to impress your spouses' friends. If that is an issue, divorce now rather than prolong the agony.<p>The Spouse will probably want to decorate your office too, with a lot of useless fru-fru from some overpriced designer store.

Fails in RaphaelJS, apparently Facebook and probably more. I'm unsure why.<p>* The download bar is interesting and different. Opens a bar at the bottom, defaults to Downloads in My Documents. Can drag elsewhere when done.<p>* It includes sleek a Firebug-esque tag inspector. Right click and inspect element.<p>* Scrolling up doesn't work on my trackpad. Middle clicking and scrolling up/down doesn't work. I hope this is fixed soon<p>* The drop-down search bar is neat. Press Ctrl+F to open it. It doesn't work in textareas.<p>* You can hide the bookmarks bar via Ctrl+B.<p>* You can drag tabs in and out of the window to form new windows. There's also a lovely animation when you move tabs around.<p>* There's a task manager for Chrome alone - right click on the main bar and click task manager. 'Stats for nerds' for more info which takes you to about:memory - also shows you memory usage for IE and Opera.<p>* You can add keywords in the search bar by going to Options, Manage and changing the default keyword.<p>* Passes Acid2 test. On Acid3, gets a respectable 78/100 on the JS tests, but has a few rendering bugs and linktest failed. Both tests are currently getting hammered - I'm not sure whether this changes the result for the latter.<p>* You can resize textareas using the bottom-right hand corner<p>* It includes a spell checker. You can't seem to add new words to it though.<p>* It supports other search engines other than Google out of the box. It asked me what default to use on startup. It imported my info from FireFox.<p>* On clicking a link it only changes the status bar to indicate you've done so - other browsers make it more obvious.<p>* Source is available at <a href=""http://dev.chromium.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.chromium.org/</a> - seems to be largely BSD licensed.

""It seamlessly and quickly imported my bookmarks and passwords from Firefox."" Every browser should do this. And I believe most popular ones do.<p>5. ""I love the 3D, industrial Chrome icon and logo."" Okay. But seriously, if the logo is one of the top things you can say about a browser, the browser might be in trouble.<p>6. ""You can open a window in incognito mode, just a right click."" Incognito is fairly neat, but really, it doesn't make a huge difference to me. I'll never use it.<p>7. ""A quick right click on any area of the page and selecting 'inspect element' allows you to see the code behind it."" As you say, Firefox has this. One thing that might make this better, which I haven't checked, is if it shows the _actual source_, rather than a reversed-engineered source based on the DOM like Firefox does.<p>8. ""On startup you can set it to open multiple homepages"" Firefox also supports this. Not a new feature.<p>9. ""Choose a new tab and you get option to select from your most visited sites."" I do like the visual representation -- good feature. Perhaps other browsers haven't done this because they haven't had Incognito? This feature might actually necessitate Incognito.<p>10.
