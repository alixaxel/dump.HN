Reading other people's code is great advice in the long term (like, Norvig's ""Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"" long term), but you generally need to put some real time into it before it becomes rewarding, so it generally isn't very helpful when a deadline or sudden bug is the problem.",1221101707
