300742,comment,300541,300690,0,0,ardit33,,,"That's trivializing a not so simple problem.   In a pure market, with no regulation whatsover, anybody could just stick an high power antena on it's roof, and bam, they have their own network.<p>But, also spectrum is finite, especially on what we can use with the current technologies.  If everybody puts it's own high powered antenas, it would just make everbody's service unsuable.  And taking out your competitor, ment to just place a bigger antena.<p>Also, high costs and barriers of entry don't just come b/c regulation.  There is huge capital costs to build a infrastructure  (towers, technology, etc.)  Look at Wimax, (which has less regulations than cellular telephone) where two companies had to merge in order to make it feasable.<p>What I would like, is option 2. The goverment makes sure there is fair competition for services, and where a carrier shouldn't lock your devices, and not allow you have your own apps and services in your phone.<p>If you look a classical use of goverment regulation:  Road traffic, traffic lights, rules etc.  In the early days of the car, none existed, and it used to be every man for each own.  Result was lots of accidents, traffic jams  (deadlocks everywhere), making cities almost too chaotic.  People driving without knowing how to really drive  (accident rates where very high).  Regulation brought some control to the chaos, where it made roads usable, traffic flowing, and make sure only people that know how to drive, drove.<p>But, regulation can also go too far, but making things expensive, excessive tickets that serve only to make revenue to cities and states.  etc.<p>And yes, I have real life experience with this.  I come from an ex-communist country, where twice in my life time goverment basically ceased to exist  (once in 90-92, and once in 97).  It was everybody on it's own, and it wasn't pretty.<p>I remember my favorite TV channel went off air, b/c one their competitors decided to erect a bigger antena, and use  the same band.<p>Overegulation is bad, but under regulation is surely aweful.  And I lived through it.  Most of you probably just dream about it, and think it is cool, but it is not.",1221079440

300727,comment,300485,300513,0,0,rcoder,,,"The Java protection model is in many ways less strict than the process isolation model exploited in Erlang. Giving each programmer responsibility for their pool of classes may sound like a good way to limit their ability to damage the rest of the system, but as long as anyone else is dependent on the stability of their API (and the absence of unchecked runtime exceptions), a single bad line of code can easily bring down an entire system.<p>Also, while it may technically be a ""functional"" language by virtue of disallowing destructive update of values, it really reads more like a scripting language. Variables are dynamically typed, and the functions only have an arity, not a signature.<p>Programmers used to the expressive type systems and polymorphism of more ""academic"" functional languages like ML or Haskell, on the other hand, would probably chafe at Erlang's lack of support for any abstractions other than forking and message-passing.<p>Real rocket scientists, on the other hand, would probably like Erlang, since the semantics of the language are simple, and its fault-tolerance and concurrency features could be well-suited for high-availability systems like mission data collection. (Its lack of hard real-time features make it a non-starter for actual avionics.)",1221078080

This is one of those.  Here goes:<p><i>1. Upgrade Test::Unit - What, you aren’t testing? You should be testing all the fucking time (TATFT).</i><p>Except when you're coding.  And then you shouldn't be doing anything but coding.  Sometimes you just gotta crank in order to make any real progress.  It's a lot easier to test once you have something to test.<p><i>2. Try out some TDD - Test Drive Development (TDD) makes for better code.</i><p>No.  Define your target.  Code to it.  Deploy.  Then test.  Lots of quick cycles blow away few slower ones.  Just code with your pedal to the floor.  Test time is the time for testing.<p><i>3. Upgrade your fixtures - I’m not sure I can advocate this approach due to the fact fixtures actually do provide some use.</i><p>Just because something provides <i>some</i> use doesn't mean you should use it.  Get a good IDE or text editor, a good work area, and a little gray matter; that's all you need.  Otherwise, you risk getting caught up in all your cool tools, an easy mistake to make.<p><i>4. Install (and learn and use) a SCM - The benefits of having code in some form of repository hugely outweighs it not being there.</i><p>Uh, I'd love to argue with this one, but I won't.  Good advice.  Either get some kind of repository or learn to walk on eggshells.  Your choice.<p><i>5. Investigate Continuous Integration - ...makes automating your tests to run at checkin next to trivial.</i><p>Making checkin trivial is not a goal while coding.  Getting something done IS.  Anything that is not coding is not helping you make progress while coding.<p><i>6. Know your code - It is one thing to write your code, but it is another greater thing to know your code. Four automated tools...</i><p>""Know your code"" & ""automated tools"" are mutually exclusive.  See my response to #7 below.<p><i>7. Automate your deployments - Automation is your best friend.</i><p>Wrong.  This is EXACTLY to opposite of #6, ""Know Your Code"".  Automation takes you out of the very trenches you have to be in to get to know your code in the first place.  The dirtier I get, the better I know my code.  (For further reading, Chapter 3 of Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston.  Woz (my hero) totally immersed himself in his details without crutches in order to know them as well as anyone ever has.)<p><i>8. Collect some statistics</i><p>Code now, get something working, and worry about analyzing it later.  Again, anything that isn't ""coding"" is slowing you down.<p><i>9. Read other people’s code - You want to be a better developer? Read code. Read bad code. Read good code. Read your code. Read my code. Code reading is a skill that many developers skimp on.</i><p>I have NEVER liked this advice.  Why?  I've never found it the least bit helpful.  Either I didn't understand the code or it sucked so much, I was too ill to work the rest of the day.  Better: find something cool (on the outside) and figure out how to code it yourself.  Ask for help or suggestions if you need it.<p><i>10. Blog about it</i><p>If you have time to blog, then your project isn't big enough.  Code now, deploy, and blog later.  Frankly, I don't want to read about your ""adventures in development"" until you're done and have something to say about your (completed) work.",1221077329

300714,comment,300312,300403,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Beyond a certain error rate, you will definitely end up with bad data. The point is, with error detecting or correcting codes, you're introducing redundancy by encoding the information into more bits than minimally required to represent that information.<p>The simplest form is adding a parity bit, which allows you to detect (not correct) up to one bad bit. (so, say 1/8 bits or 12.5% if you store a byte of information in 9 bits)<p>Using R-S codes you can crank up the number of bits used for encoding, which also drives up your error tolerance. Plus, in addition to detecting errors, you can even correct them. So it doesn't matter if some bits come up bad (or missing) - the redundancy is spread equally across <i>all</i> of the transmitted/stored bits, so it's irrelevant which bits suffer from the failure.
