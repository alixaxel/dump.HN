311843,comment,311674,311674,0,0,gruseom,,,"I like his distinction between fundamental dislikes and competitive disadvantages - sort of essential objections vs. accidental ones.<p>But a lot of the accidental objections seem not really to be about what they claim to be. How many people have <i>really</i> hit a roadblock because of a missing library? (I know I haven't. If I did, I'd probably just write it.) How often is the ""libraries"" objection made without mentioning any specific missing libraries? At least 90% of the time. Probably at least 95%.<p>So I think one needs a third category: the pseudo-accidental objection. In other words, to some extent ""libraries"" is just the ""it's too slow"" of this decade. I don't know if it makes much sense for the community, such as it is, to put a lot of effort into addressing these, since the objections will just shift to something else. I'm not going to write a library I don't need.<p>But I'm all in favor of the Lisp community getting its act together and answering real objections (or rather, addressing real problems) and especially being helpful to beginners who want to get started.",1222130906

You shouldn't know about static and dynamic linking, interpreters and compilers and other under the hood stuff to write simple lisp program (or even quite complex) and show it off to your friend without installing whole lisp implementation (maybe emacs with slime too?) on your friend's computer.<p>Why lispers are so elitist? Lisp is good not because it is the hardest language to learn, it is actually quite easy to pick up basic stuff, lisp is good because it is very powerful. Why make it harder for novices to try this language? This is not the way to develop the community.",1222130752

We want to eat at home, but we really don't like the process of cooking every day.<p>So, we cook once every 4-8 weeks.  We purchased a freezer that we put in the garage for $3-400, and we do all of our meal prep at once.  We buy all of our ingredients in bulk at Costco or the local Farmer's market, and then we prep 30-40 meals in one day.  So, all we have to do for each meal, is thaw the package the day before, throw it in the oven or in a pan the following day, add a salad, and you're done.<p>It takes a lot of planning, and it takes a while before find a set of recipes that freeze well, but after a year or so of doing this, we pretty much have the list.  We're at the point now, that my wife pulls 8 or 10 recipes from the database, she puts the ingredient list together, we go shopping on one day, and asssemble and freeze meals the second day.  It's about 8-10 hours work for both of us, and it cuts down 1-1/2 hours of meal prep and planning every day for 4-6 weeks.  Along with the recipe in the database is a label with cooking instructions that gets printed out and saran wrapped to the package.<p>If you Google for this, it's called ""Once a month cooking"".",1222130158
