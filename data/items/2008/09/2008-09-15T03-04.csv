304296,comment,304050,304280,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"The 30s were more regulated than today in many ways.  It was illegal to own gold.  What and how much to farm was ordered by the federal government.  Labor laws and interventions were extreme.  If you traveled back in time to the 30s to participate in the economy it would seem almost fascist/socialist.  This is why the depression lasted so long and got so severe in America.  Other countries suffered similar initial setbacks as the US, but recovered far more quickly.<p>It is a ridiculous myth that Hoover was laissez faire.  He intervened massively in the economy and FDR merely continued his policies.  There's little FDR did in his first year that hadn't been drawn up by Hoover.<p>> regulation and oversight prevent swings<p>The housing crisis is the direct result of a deliberately orchestrated policy to subsidize housing.<p>The root cause of bubbles is monetary policy, anyway, not regulation.",1221450977

I don't know anyone who wishes they were was worse at the high jump. That's not a reason to devote more school resources to it.<p>This is a question of priorities. There is not doubt that handwriting is now less important then it was 15 years ago. That should be reflected in the school curriculum. There's room for debate on the issue of how much.",1221449849

304280,comment,304050,304146,0,0,raheemm,,,"I would beg to differ - recent bank failures are a result of the free market running amuck on easy credit and dumb investments (home loans without income verifications). The 30s were a lot less regulated and the great depression was a result of a free market moving without any government oversight or interference (Hoover responded to the crash by proposing to let the free market sort itself out, which in turn lead to a vicious run on banks.)<p>There is a fine balance between free-market economics and regulatory oversight. Bubbles will take place regardless of the level of regulation. Too much regulation can make small business life a pain, but regulation and oversight prevent swings and spectacular failures like the ones we are witnessing.",1221449213
304279,comment,304249,304259,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"Well like I said, I live in a small town with lots of bored college students.  It's easy to get support from:<p>* Local historical society, has a ton of info and is only too happy to share (""Youngin's these days don't care!"") etc. etc.  Excited that young people will be researching the town's history.<p>* Local newspaper, willing to let us have the entire newspaper archives in exchange for digitizing it for them.  At the end of it we will have an entire searchable DB of hundreds of years worth of plot and character info.<p>* Local newspaper, willing to give us free press because it's more exciting than printing about Sherrif Farmer's dog or whatever else they fill up space with<p>* Local college students and student associations (engineering/nerd school), bored to tears with Nerf Wars or whatever else it is they do on weekends and are willing to do insane amounts of work for even a modest reward<p>* Local college is based around a historical person and is only too happy to learn he is a major character in the plot, instant writeups from student journalists and support/goodwill from college staff, invaluable help from professors<p>* Lots of bored CS students with nothing better to do.  There's plenty of bored website designers and so on, and enough really competent people that we can roll out a small voip network or build a few robots into the landscape (trapdoors in abandoned buildings and whatnot)<p>This is, I think, the recipe for our success in a small college town.  I would not take this route at all if you're trying to hit some urban area (from your initial post it looks like you're doing it as marketing, so quite frankly I wouldn't recommend doing any of this if your intent is to reach large groups of people).  I should also note that this is just a side project (and a long-term one at that), I expect to take a few years planning before I actually do it (I have a startup that requires all my attention in the meantime).",1221449133

There's certainly a tradeoff there still, because on one hand, there's some form of editorial control (unlike Windows or OSX), but on the other hand, it's as close to transparent as possible, and is there mainly to preserve quality.<p>I look at it kind of like the salary cap in the NFL. On one hand, it means some players aren't making as much as they would be if it were lifted a week ago. On the other hand, it means all players are making far more than they would if it were lifted a decade ago.",1221449072
