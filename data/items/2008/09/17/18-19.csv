I've been interested in the internet ever since the first dial up connections came to my town(i was 11 then i think) but because I went to a residential school I didn't have a lot of access. Now that I've finally got time(and a lot of it) I am gonna start pursuing web dev.<p>Now for the question part. I've been learning python since past 2 months and have picked it up quite well. I plan to start with some framework for server side now(probably Django). I have very less knowledge of HTML so I plan to learn that next and then learn Javascript for client side stuff. Am i on the right path? Any suggestions and recommendations would be appreciated.\nThanks",1221674926

She's bitching a bit about Dan Fagan (a repub. commentator in AK) in the one email, but everything looks pretty personal.<p>I have a work and personal account... 99% of the time I manage to keep my personal account personal-- occasionally I don't.  I'd be stunned if there weren't occasional transgressions on this front in any governor's office.  I'd expect that security tightens up a bit in the Executive branch.<p>(disclaimers: I lived in Alaska until 2 years ago and know how utterly wrong the national media is about what goes on up there.

Pop wisdom says with enough eyes and with low enough operating costs there will be some way to make it as a company.<p>But there has to be an inflection point somewhere. Look at youtube, they will never be in the black (taken on their own).<p>So either they turn a profit, and this piece of wisdom is strongly reinforced. Or they go under, and entrepreneurs and VCs lose a certain glint in their eye. Or they get bought... and probably no one's mind is changed.",1221674645
