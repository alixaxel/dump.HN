There isn't really a reason for the US President to handle healthcare or education when the states can do it (which most of them already do).

Some top-notch Manhattan doctors won't even take insured patients-- cash only. As more doctors opt out of insurance, we're headed toward a three-tier healthcare system, with the uninsured at the bottom, the insured in the middle, and the very wealthy (self-insured) at the top.<p>The interesting reversal is in the fact that, decades ago, the AMA spoke out against ""socialized medicine"", fearing that, if doctors became government employees, their compensation would decline.

Usually, being passionate about something, means it is closely related to your own needs.<p>Approaches to building the actual website vary greatly.  Some people prefer writing detailed specs first, while others prefer a prototyping approach -- to start working with a tangible product sooner and get feedback early.  I prefer the prototyping approach for new websites.<p>When you start the actual development, focus on the core elements first (e.g. Digg couldn't function without it's core news algorithms and digg tracking, but did not need other peripheral features to move forward).  I also like to work out my database design and user interface (screen mockups) early in the process.  37Signals recommends rough sketches and HTML mockups at the outset in their ""Getting Real"" book.

One is ""should I build just a minimum set of features and then add features slowly, or should I first draw up a design that includes every single feature I think we might eventually want?"" The other is ""should I build a site that works well for only one user -- probably myself -- or should I design with the assumption that there will be a lot of future users?""<p>These are important and controversial questions with answers that depend on the circumstances. The general approach advocated around here tends to be ""start small; don't build things you aren't sure you're going to need; launch your site as fast as you can with the minimum number of features and don't build more until you're sure that users are interested and that they want more."" But that approach is tuned for certain problems -- specifically, it's tuned for bootstrapped startups that are exploring new classes of application that might or might not have a market. One might argue (I would) that the <i>majority</i> of problems are well suited to that strategy, but no doubt there are some problems where other strategies are more appropriate. (e.g. you're designing a site for the Olympic Games, which will have relatively few users for months, then have thousands of hits per second for two killer weeks, then have a much smaller number of users going forward. You're not going to get to iterate the design over and over after the Olympic opening ceremonies; you have to plan ahead and build all the features you want, in a scalable fashion, in advance.)<p>Your question is related to the problem of categorizing software development processes.
