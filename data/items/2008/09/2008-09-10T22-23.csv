You write your program using an event model, where the events are IO related (you select events based upon file descriptors being ready for reading and/or writing) which (in my opinion) make for easy programming of network based daemons ( <a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2007/03/08.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2007/03/08.1</a> ).<p>The general method appears to be, write the program using an event model, then create a thread per CPU, which each thread waiting on epoll() (timeouts optional).",1221087219

Fifteen years ago we used to buy stock photography CDs for $3-4K each. It was either that or pay a photographer to shoot each image on spec.<p>The internet changed the rules on that business and now I pay $10-$20 an image and an infinitely larger range to choose from.
