Aside from Microsoft.com/MSN, which don't really count, MySpace uses it (though they upgraded from ColdFusion, which wasn't much better) and Plenty of Fish, the web's largest dating site, uses it too:\n<a href=""http://www.plentyoffish.com/about_team.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plentyoffish.com/about_team.aspx</a>\nThese are probably all larger than the most successful Rails sites.<p>- ASP.NET MVC isn't a horrible programming model.  Forget the abomination that's normal ASP.NET with its funky events. If you've used another MVC framework like Rails or Cake, you'll feel right at home.<p>- Microsoft's startup program gives startups the early software for super cheap: <a href=""http://microsoftstartupzone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microsoftstartupzone.com/</a><p>- It's all about getting v1 out and releasing early and often.  If your team grew up on Microsoft, are you really going to make them all learn a new framework?  If you do it right and prove out your idea, you can always rewrite later.",1222051717

310758,comment,310563,310563,0,0,SarahToton,,,"This is a great post because  it helps evaluate the very different goals of various organizations. That is, it shows that the ""products"" of large institutions (government, higher-ed, corporate firms) are not necessarily those of smaller businesses (start-ups, boutiques, small non-profits). It also helps us consider what exactly ""failing"" is (it has very different meanings if you're a hacking in your free time or applying for a CS PhD, even if the output is very similar).<p>So, in short, one man's ""useless paper,"" may be another's inspiration. I'm not saying all products are the same, but it's important to evaluate  context and think carefully about the complexity of a product's ""worth.""  I mean, finding value (or being able to extract value) from ""junk"" is a goal for most entrepreneurs.",1222051605

It is still a group of people.<p>Take some activity we might consider disgusting -- like chopping down a productive fruit tree, or shooting a milk-producing cow, shitting all over the people who give you 30 percent of their sales and help make an economic engine that feeds you, etc -- it is not disgusting if a robot does it.<p>If a tree-harvesting robot cut down productive fruit trees instead of the pine lumber, we'd say, ""Hey, broken robot there -- fix it.""  But if a group of PEOPLE did that, we'd call them stupid and disgusting, and be fearful of what they were doing to the economy.  If they formed an LLC and did it, they would be stupid and disgusting.  If they formed a cult and selected a guru and did it, they would be stupid and disgusting.<p>""Apple"" is just a name for a bunch of stupid and disgusting people.  They could dissolve the corporation, and they would still be a few tens of thousands weirdos, with a creepy turtle neck wearing ""design guru"", and probably be trying to sell you overpriced crap that you could not modify, based on a subtle implication of elitism if you joined by buying.<p>I think the only reasonable phone to consider at this point is the OpenMoko.  Unlike Android, it's here now.  People are doing stuff like <a href=""http://www.neopwn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neopwn.com/</a> with it.<p>Unfortunately, as near as I can tell, there are simply no cellular providers that meet basic standards of reasonable behaviour, such that I would sign up with them.  They all seem to be run by people like axod, and probably think it's OK to have sex with children as long you form an S corp hire yourself to rape them, to insulate your soul from it like a kind of ethical condom.",1222050901

Awesome interviewer, and an awesome hedge fund manager.<p>It's hard to read as an entrepreneur because I think there's a difference between financial people, such as hedge fund managers or venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs.<p>Most entrepreneurs that I know are highly optimistic, and almost willing to look beyond risk and uncertainty. Of course, that's not to say entrepreneurs are stupid with risk, or don't take calculated risks. But I would say investors are much more risk-averse.<p>What I took away from this article: the housing market was too good to be true. You took Triple-A credit, and stuck it in the same pool as Triple-C credit. And you bet on the whole thing. I think that was pretty risky, and maybe it would have worked out if you rolled the dice a few more times, but most people just can't afford these houses. And now we're seeing the burst.<p>I suppose it's a bit sobering to read. It reminds you not to be stupid about risk, but definitely take risks. I better just stop there ;)",1222049444
