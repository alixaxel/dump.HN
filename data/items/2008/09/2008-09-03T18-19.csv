I was wondering what the big deal was over the weekend (I didn't get a chance to read anything about it until Tue), but now that I've used it, I think it's going to be amazing.  Either a) other browsers will speed up and clean up to match it (unlikely due to backwards compatibility with extensions) or about 6-12 months from now it will be my only browser (it is already my primary browser).  Same thing happened with Google search, Google Maps, and Gmail.  I'm not an uncritical fanboy but I've been here before.",1220468177

The article at drama20show (which thamer links) looks on the surface like the kind of pedantry that tries to show how smart you are by showing how dumb everyone else is.  By this narrow definition that limits the OS to just the kernel, neither Windows nor Linux are OSes.  They each <i>include</i> an OS, but they also include one or more desktops and standard applications.  Actually, the fact that there exists a distinct word for the kernel - that would be ""kernel"" - is probably evidence that there's a basic problem with the narrow definition.<p>BUT ...<p>This is all just another pointless semantics argument.  It fails to see what's really going down here:  Google wants folks to write their applications for Chrome.  Not for Windows.  Not for Linux.  Not for Solaris.  For Chrome.  That's the point.
