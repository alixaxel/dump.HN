308860,comment,308555,308555,0,0,bokonist,,,"The other day I had a crazy realization.  If you add up the actual labor time required to create a lifetime's worth of standard goods and services, you get something like 5-10 man years.  You can do something ""worthy"" that makes humans more productive, but since we are already so productive it doesn't make a huge difference.  The $64,000 question is, if technology has increased our productivity so much over the past 50 years, why are we actually working more hours, and liking our jobs less?  Why aren't we all retiring at 30 to do what we love?",1221793074

If you want to get around the type system it has untyped{} code blocks, casts, and the ""Dynamic"" type, all of which throw type safety over to the runtime interpreter.",1221793007
308858,comment,308848,308848,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"The fundamental mistake for these ads is simply that computers are a tool. Nothing more, nothing less. Microsoft wants to associate themselves as the tool of choice behind these supposedly famous and important people and their work but quite frankly that's bullshit. It's trying to capture the essence of Apple's <i>Think Different</i> ad campaign (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oAB83Z1ydE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oAB83Z1ydE</a>) but fails miserably. What made Apple's ads work was that they didn't bother talking to you about computers. They know it doesn't matter what computer you use, you just need to know Apple.<p>Saving the environment, broadcasting yourself, campaigning for candidates, being a movie star, teaching children in Africa, all of that could be accomplished with either a Mac computer, Windows computer, or a Linux computer. Other than telling you that these people are PC it doesn't do much in helping you understand why Microsoft is even relevant in any of the situations presented.<p>At least in the current ads Apple explains why their product is better based on features, simplicity, security, and functionality. Microsoft's ad just made me feel like it was empty and soulless, reinforcing what I have always associated with the Micro$oft brand.<p>PS: offtopic, Discovery Channel's <i>I Love</i> commercial is wonderful: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BxymuiAxQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BxymuiAxQ</a>",1221792994

They just come out and say ""IBM products are good."" Also, IBM doesn't sell much to consumers, so they don't need or want to sound cool.<p>Microsoft is doing something different. And while all different is not cool, all cool is different. It's at least half way there.",1221792931

308847,comment,308509,308663,0,0,bporterfield,,,"Actually, ActionScript can be an extremely elegant and powerful language, when coded ""correctly"". The vast majority of Flex developers come from either a design or Java background, and as a result you find that most ActionScript RIA code adheres to strict application frameworks, static typing, etc...and rarely takes advantage of the interesting parts.<p>ActionScript has first-order functions, allows for dynamic typing, and utilizes class as well as prototype inheritance, even for built-in classes. This means you can do neat things to the prototype object associated with any object - even the Function object itself.<p>Just because the majority of people developing in ActionScript don't utilize the functionality doesn't mean it doesn't exist! Take a minute to look into the language yourself - you might be very surprised.",1221791636

308845,comment,308334,308827,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"It's difficult to do real FP in Python, though. Its lambda operator is crippled (one statement only), and it doesn't have tail call elimination* . Still, you can try out some functional ideas in it pretty easily, such as the map and filter functions.<p>* What tail-call elimination basically means is that when you call a function, but aren't waiting on its result as part of an expression at the current level (the difference between ""1 + f(x, totalCount)"" and ""f(x, 1 + totalCount)"", the language realizes that it doesn't need to keep a placeholder for doing stuff when that level is done on the stack. Therefore, calling a function in that manner can be used for (potentially infinite) looping without just piling more and more on the stack and eventually filling it up. If you try doing that in python, it will eventually blow the stack:<p><pre><code>  def houseOfCards(x):
      if x == 0:
          return ""done""
      else:
          return houseOfCards(x - 1)

  >>> houseOfCards(10)
  'done'
  >>> houseOfCards(100)
  'done'
  >>> houseOfCards(1000)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
    File ""/tmp/py21945wPg"", line 5, in houseOfCards
  RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></pre>",1221791554
