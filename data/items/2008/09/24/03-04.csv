313160,comment,312849,313043,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Microsoft negotiates terms with licensed developers on a case by case basis. It is practically unheard of for an Xbox developer to deliver the game that was agreed upon and face rejection. Before a game is released to the market, Microsoft performs a battery of certification and pre-certification reviews to ensure quality and platform consistency. I can't comment on Nintendo or Sony's practices, but I'd assume they are similar.<p>Xbox Live Community Games is much more similar to Apple's App Store system in that anyone can sell a game. Unlike Apple, we'd happily allow anyone to produce a game which is a direct competitor to one of our games. Check it out when it launches with The New Xbox Experience later this fall.<p>Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft on XNA Game Studio, but do not have direct knowledge of or involvement in the developer relations or certification processes. Additionally, Community Games is currently in development, so anything I said above is subject to change.",1222228344

But I write this as my ignorance might be helpful insight.<p>I thought justin.tv was this site that tracked a guy named Justin 24/7.  I seemed to recall him having a camera crew with him all the time, and that was the shtick.  I had heard about them from the early days of this group, and I think had read about the camera crew and such on some web site.<p>So when I saw this post, I read through the comments and was confused about the ""stop worrying about copyright law"" statement.<p>I decided to check it out.<p>Now, looking at the front page, it seemed like either I was completely mistaking justin.tv for another web site, or it has changed it's goals, or the 'follow justin around' was a publicity ploy to get attention, and that indeed could be one of the 'channels' I see on the front page (""create your own channel"").  (if the latter is actually correct, kudos to a great ploy as the name stood out to me)<p>Either way, I still didn't really 'get it' from the front page.  It looked cool, and I was able to surmise what was going on from all the activity (there was a video of someone playing doom) that it was about video sharing.<p>I finally found the 'about us' section which turns out to be brief bio's of the founders and key employees.  And there was a guy named Justin who looked like he might have been the guy who had the 24 hour camera crew with him.  But his Bio didn't refer to this.<p>So perhaps I was imagining the whole thing.  That's cool.  I've done it before.<p>But if not, and the 'follow justin' thing really happened, then at least mention it somewhere so a out of touch lad like me doesn't check himself in somewhere.<p>But I still don't know what makes justin.tv special.  It's description is ""Justin.tv is the leader in live video and the place to broadcast and share video online.""  I thought that's what youtube was.<p>So it justin.tv the more hip version of youtube?  Or, as I think about this more, is it the word LIVE that separates it from youtube?  Are all the feeds 'live'?  Like in real time?  If so, that should get a bit more attention than some text at the bottom of the page.<p>And so as I review the front page, indeed it looks as though the video on the top could be live.<p>And the video on the bottom are highlights.  Aha.  Previous recordings.<p>Ok.  Now I get it.  That's pretty cool.  How about we rewrite the description to be ""Justin.tv streams LIVE video."".<p>But seriously, it took me a while.  Live streams should have an icon in the bottom right that say ""LIVE!"" that doesn't get into the recording.<p>The concept of 'time' should be more involved in the navigation + searching.  The front page should be like TV guide, and I can click on a row, at the 'current time', and see a live recording of that channel.  As it plays the TV guide scrolls to the left slowly to mark the passing of time.  The length of a show is depicted with width, and I can click anywhere to see the past.  And since it's realtime let me sort the channel rows by poularity, ratings etc.<p>Sorry to be out of it.  I'm a little surprised it took me so long to get the 'live' part.",1222228297

313153,comment,313025,313061,0,0,shiro,,,"Agreed.  Emacs is intuitive in a different way than those flashy GUI apps.<p>One thing I really love in Emacs is that every text is basically displayed in a buffer, regardless of it being editing text, external program output, file listing, menu items or completion candidates.  It means you can use common editing commands (incremental search, region selection, copy&paste, etc) uniformly to navigate those information.   It's all text, so you should be able to do so.   Then I turn to a supposedly intuitive GUI app that shows a menu with 100 items and I'm just lost since I cannot regexp-search through those items.",1222227763

Using these basic tools, you can mix, match and customize until it does what you need for today's project, no matter what language or OS,however many files, script languages, build tools, etc.<p>At some point it becomes clear that emacs is actually a programming environment for text editing with emacs lisp in the position of universal configuration, scripting and compute language. If you can think of something you want to do with text,files or code (albeit limited to an ascii interface) you can either find it in the extension community or you can quickly bend emacs to do what you want.<p>My learning curve was approximately two years to feel very competent, five or so to feel like a power user, and then 8 or so to feel make it do most anything.",1222227574

You want to normalize a table so entities can have more than one address? Build an addresses table crosswalked to entity id and let the new code use it. Once you're happy with it you can drop some columns, but if you need to roll back, you haven't thrown anything away.<p>To me the difference is like that between hiring a hooker and charming a cheerleader.
