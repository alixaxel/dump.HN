314144,comment,313551,313551,0,0,denglish,,,"I think everyone agrees the status quo for most companies isn't working. The hard question is how do you change it? Simply 'challenging' your workers is not really enough (although a good start). For smaller innovative companies there isn't a lot of bureaucracy yet, and the chances are the founders have had a direct part in hiring all the staff – with a vested interest in picking the top quality people they can. And with top quality staff of course you naturally give them the freedom and flexibility to be as effective as they can.<p>The problems I believe starts when the company is much larger. The bureaucracy kicks in and each line of management struggles to work out what they ‘control’. Large bands of like minded ‘productive’ workers congregate which is great, but large bands of ‘we don’t do much around here’ workers congregate too.<p>Ricardo Semler (Semco) had an interesting strategy for dealing with this that I think would be interesting to see IT shops try. He broke his company up into many autonomous cells all less than 100 employees. He also stripped the management and kept a hierarchy of only three layers.",1222293163

But I'm also very interested in django, a relatively new thing for me but it sure does look promising and worth my time to invest further.<p>I tend to choose php because I know it, I know it is well supported, it scales without large problems, I can configure it and optimize it without a problem.<p>While django is very fast in terms of development time, it's a challenge, probably good for my career if I can add django/python developer to my CV and it has a great community.<p>But I have doubts for choosing django... For starters, I don't know if it's 'economical' to choose django in terms of performance. Does django beat pure php in complex sites pageviews? In other words, do I have to scale faster with django then with php?\nWill I be able to find additional programmers if my website becomes a success? I live in Europe and I don't have the impression django/python developers are common here (prove me wrong!). How is the support going to be? I'm always surprised to see very old php4 code runs fine on the newest php5 release, but I heard djando changes quite often and you have to re-write code if you want to use a newer release.<p>Like I said, I don't have any real-world  experience with django, so I'd like your advice/thoughts on this.",1222293090

314140,comment,313482,313700,0,0,akeefer,,,"I agree with the programming/computer science distinction; in my experience the skillsets are fairly disjoint, and having a CS degree (or knowing what school it was from) bears very little correlation to someone's ability to code.  Honestly, having an MS or a PhD often has an inverse correlation to someone's ability to code, since it probably means they're more interested in the theoretical side and less concerned with the practical side (though I don't think that's true for a BS).<p>I have, however, found that a college degree in general, regardless of the field, is often a good proxy for someone's communication skills.  Someone with a degree from a ""good"" school is, in my experience, more likely to be a clear thinker/writer/talker that someone without a degree or with a degree from a middle-tier school, regardless of their ability to code.  I don't want to hazard a guess as to which way the causal arrow points there, but it's definitely a pretty clear trend I've noticed from interviewing several dozen candidates over the last few years.",1222292833

But actually on reflection I think there are a couple of very good side effects to come out of this:<p>1. The most dangerous time to speed / stop heavily is in or very near an intersection. Giving drivers more warning may actually encourage them to use the actual intersections more safely.<p>2. Traffic is considerably congested by the stop start nature of intersections. If this helps to more gently control cars passing through in both directions, it may considerably speed up everyone's trips (even those that slow rather than speed - keeping in mind they can then still hit the green light at say 2/3 speed rather than zero.)",1222292270

Various ""protect the little old ladies from being taken for a ride"" laws make it more difficult for individuals who aren't worth millions to participate in private investing.  At least, that's the case with corporations.  With an LLC and proprietorship, I guess it's more like a personal loan and all of the legal stuff that surrounds personal loans would apply.  Presumably you plan to, or already incorporated.  As you've noted, spending a couple of hours with a lawyer is probably a wise investment.  Just a phone call to a startup-focused lawyer will get you a few minutes of free advice on what you need a lawyer for (the better a lawyer is, the more likely they are to try to avoid doing extraneous work for you--they may charge twice as much, but they'll put in significantly less billable hours).  Surprisingly, perhaps, raising bigger money from angels (who <i>are</i> high net worth individuals) can be less legally complicated, and the boiler-plate stuff that YC provides will probably do the trick.",1222292119
