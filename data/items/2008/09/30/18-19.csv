Admittedly, those two people are hardcore linux geeks from the local LUG, and even they admit that they are putting up with some annoyances that many people would not deal with.<p>Nevertheless, I can remember thinking ""what kind of massive nerd, with way more money than sense, would have a unix server at his fucking HOUSE"" back in 1995.  I now have a platoon of linux machines in my house.  And, openness does generally win in the end, even beating security, useability, and aesthetics.<p>I am going to hold on to my current phone until I can justify the cost of an OpenMoko.<p>Now, if you want to make a game tied into the next blockbuster movie and plan to sell a million copies next month and none afterwards, you probably should not invest in the OpenMoko.  But if you are thinking in longer terms, I think it is the way to go.<p>Consider this proposition: you are talking to a courier delivery service (think FedEx or UPS but a smaller regional company).  They want to replace the handheld package scanner / data entry thing their delivery drivers use, the current ones cost them $500 per device plus the integration and central servers.  They want to invest in something that allows their drivers to fetch more information, such as traffic information and the dispatch messages they currently get by phone or radio, and have it integrated into the hand held computer.<p>You can't offer to save them a lot of money by writing an iphone app, iphone apps don't have access to the SMS messages among other things.<p>I'm not sure if you can do it in Android, I'm going to guess yes though.  I looked through the SDK reference briefly, and the fact that you had to write in Java was not good, and I wasn't sure how to get access to the SMS functions or call log or stuff like that.<p>But I know you can do it on an OpenMoko, because you have access to everything.  I don't need to learn an SDK, the same APIs I use to program on linux are there.  And if the project is big enough to justify a special production run of an OpenMoko with some kind of proprietary RF added and a bar code scanner, the OpenMoko's hardware is open too.<p>Now, presume that I don't have the deal above in hand, but I am thinking there is a 10 percent chance I can get it in the next 2 years.  If my cell phone breaks, am I going to buy an  iPhone or an Android ?  No, I'm going to make a long term investment and get an OpenMoko.",1222801129

319892,comment,319706,319870,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I'd recommend OCaml over Haskell for real use, actually. Where Haskell is experimental (<i>""[...] Haskell has a sort of unofficial slogan: avoid success at all costs.""</i> -Simon Peyton-Jones, <a href=""http://www.techworld.com.au/article/261007/-z_programming_languages_haskell?pp=10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techworld.com.au/article/261007/-z_programming_la...</a>), OCaml is intended to be a <i>practical</i> multi-paradigm language, building on new ideas from SML. It has some faults (it's somewhat painful until you understand the type system, and the language seems to be all but designed to give a terrible first impression), but it's a very powerful language. It's not good as a glue language, but for stuff involving heavy numeric processing or complex data structures (e.g. compilers) it really shines. I think it's an excellent complement to Python.<p>IMHO, the best English-language book on OCaml is _Developing Applications with Objective CAML_, a French O'Reilly book. There's a free, complete translation available online (<a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a>). I haven't read _OCaml for Scientists_, and I found _Practical OCaml_ by Joshua Smith to be a <i>huge</i> disappointment, FWIW.<p>_The Little MLer_ is a pretty good book on ML's type system. If memory serves, everything but the last chapter would also apply to to Haskell, though you'll have to transliterate syntax.<p>Haskell is a really fun and mind-blowing language, and it will teach you a <i>lot</i>, but I haven't found it to be a practical language. (To be fair, you might feel otherwise. This book looks quite good: <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/</a>) You could probably get a lot out of see-sawing back and forth between Haskell and OCaml, switching when you get stuck with one or the other. They have a lot of common concepts, but they take them in different directions.",1222801100

319863,comment,319582,319718,0,0,swombat,,,"The problem with the bankrupcty solution is it encourages companies to remain secretive about their bad debts until the very last minute.<p>This discourages companies, particularly banks, from trusting each other.<p>The problem we're having now, which is also the problem that brought the Great Depression, is lack of trust. Banks won't lend to each other, or to other businesses, because they don't trust that they'll get their money back.<p>Saying that we should let the banks go bankrupt at their leisure is just letting this problem of trust fester for the next few years and resolve itself one bank at a time, slowly. While the problem is correcting itself, the market doesn't allocate money where it's needed because of the lack of trust, and everyone suffers. The total cost of that is much larger than a trillion dollars.<p>At the other extreme, you could just nationalise the whole banking system. That's a better option, but still not ideal, because governments suck at running businesses, and this would also be less efficient in allocating capital where it's needed (the primary function of banks),<p>So, somewhere in the middle lies the compromise. How can we get the banks to start trusting each other again and yet not nationalise them? Well, one way is to offer them a kind of ""knife armistice"". Bring out your knives to the police station, hand them in, and we'll let you go free. We'll even give you a water pistol as a compensation prize.<p>Don't be fooled into thinking that just because the bailout bill doesn't put the CEOs of banks in prison, that it will not be followed by further regulation. For better of for worse, tighter regulation will be on its way. But that's a separate debate that's not tied to the bailout. The purpose of the bailout bill is to resolve a crisis right now, not to make long term fixes to the system.<p>Banks are special types of companies because of their effect on the economy. You might let Enron go bust, because after all that's unlikely to cause widespread damage to the entire world economy. Let the banks go bust slowly and painfully, though, and every business pays for it. Calling for ""Bankruptcy not bailout"" is terribly short-sighted.",1222799309

319855,comment,319582,319801,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"I am still a little confused as to what exactly is causing this crisis.  I looked into the whole sub prime Fannie and Freddie thing and I found some surprising things.  The first thing I found was that poor people get home loans through mechanisms other than sub prime lending.  They go through the whole Ginnie Mae umbrella, where all the inner city HUD and FHA stuff is handled, along with rural housing, housing for native americans and there is also a special allowance for veterans of the military to cover them under Ginnie.  All of these groups use mechanisms OTHER THAN SUB PRIME!  Or rather, sub prime or not, these people have loans that are guaranteed EXPLICITLY by the government, unlike the loans backed by Fannie and Freddie which had IMPLICIT guarantees.  How can Ginnie Mae be sound and Fannie and Freddie be such basket cases?  Even if 100% of the poor people defaulted, Fannie and Freddie would be untouched.  Another question is, who, exactly, was using these sub prime mechanisms that Fannie and Freddie ended up backing?  The auditors are claiming that they were primarily used by people making between $40000 and $150000 to afford mortgages that they would otherwise be denied.  But something is out of place.  Why would the middle class be defaulting at such a high rate?  There is some money missing here.  I have yet to get a really complete understanding of what went on exactly.  After reading through all of the financial info, I am left even more confused.<p>Is there an economist on Hacker News somewhere that can explain these inconsistencies to us?  The only thing I could come up with is that these people wanted to live beyond their means.  My quandary is that I have either severely underestimated the number of middle class Americans who want to live beyond their means, or overestimated my capacity for financial analysis.<p>And yes . . . it could be both.",1222798775
319854,comment,319582,319833,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Edit: I've put a lot of work into the comment below, so I would appreciate if you'd read it and respond to it. I know it's harder to discuss the specific provisions of Glass-Steagall and its affect on the market place than just saying ""oh, the Glass-Steagall repeal is responsible for everything wrong"". However, if people are going to cite the argument so often that it becomes the commonly accepted viewpoint, then it ought to be incumbent on them to UNDERSTAND it. Anything else is hand-waving.<p>I hear this a lot, too, but it's hard for me to see how the Glass-Steagall Act repeal had anything to do with the current crisis. In fact, deregulation seems to have mitigated the damage. The reorganization of Bear, Merrill, Morgan, and Goldman would have been impossible were the Glass-Steagall Act still in full force. They would have all gone bankrupt or had to be rescued by the government. Many of the entities that are in good financial shape are the large financial conglomerates that would have been illegal were G-S still in place. Customer bank deposits provide a stable source of funding when lenders are skitish. Reducing the supply of capital in an embattled industry would be the height of stupidity.<p>Many foreign countries never had any law like Glass-Steagall in place and they don't seem to be suffering the same problems. As logic tells us, the current crisis seems to be orthogonal to the presence or absence of Glass-Steagall.<p>Mcardle also had a wonderful post FACTUALLY summarizing the provisions of Glass-Steagall and its relation to the current crisis:<p><a href=""http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/clear_as_glass_steagall.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/09/clear_a...</a><p>I also addressed this issue on my libertarian blog a while back:<p><a href=""http://distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/09/22/the-end-era"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distributedrepublic.net/archives/2008/09/22/the-end-e...</a><p>A large problem during the Great Depression was that the United States had laws that artificially limited the size of banks (see ""Unitary Branching Laws""). The result was that institutions in the United States had smaller financial cushions in crisis time and were more likely to go under. The United States suffered a FAR higher rate of bank failure than other countries, and states with unitary branching laws had higher failures than those without.<p>So I know blaming the Glass-Stegall repeal for our current problems is popular(populist) wisdom, but it seems to me that popular wisdom is, as usual, wrong.",1222798769

While Nader is much less respected than Stallman, the magnitude to which their respective fields are ungrateful for their respective contributions is about the same. Stallman's contributions I would argue are much bigger than Nader's.  Come on he invented the OS that is now the basis of the majority of internet business.  I think he deserves a little more respect for that contribution. If Nader had done something equally big in his work of keeping rogue corporations in check, we would have gone on a more Canada-like path than the Reagan-led path of decline that we did go down.  Free Software has become a major force that continues to grow and improve our lives.  Nader's contributions were not lasting, and have mostly been reversed by decades of corporate think tank astroturfing and lobbying that has whittled away the rights and protections of individuals.",1222797769

(I've found this useful for regression testing and performance in the past on a mostly readonly site).<p>At the least, it would seem to require a storage snapshot (db+backend storage) timed with the beginning of the log capture, so to get correct responses.<p>The test could then consist of checking all HTTP responses are the same, and that the db+storage has changed in the same way in the test env as it did on live.<p>With our current setup (mysql+webdav storage) this seems challenging, particularly since both of these are very large.<p>Is anyone aware of any tools or work in this area?",1222797706

The act was put in place in 1933 to prevent the ""too big to fail"" problem with banks that led to the Great Depression. In general, we've had a Republican congress for the last 8-10 years that has been slowly deregulating the financial services industry.<p>Staying on a gold standard would have prevented the crisis. The gold standard was eliminated by Nixon in the 70's. In general, there were many checks and balances in place that had to be removed for us to get to where we are now.
