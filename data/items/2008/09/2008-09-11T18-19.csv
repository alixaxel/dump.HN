They're not.<p>They're run by execs who know they won't still be working there in 5 years and who get paid mainly in stock options. (That's how most public companies are run). The incentive of the people who run the company is just to maintain what little they can for as long as they can, and they're actually doing a pretty good job of it.<p>With the possible exception of suing actual customers, they've done a fantastic job of maintaining the status quo just long enough for them to cash out their options every year for some amount of profit.",1221156413
