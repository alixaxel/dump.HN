Wow, Safari before the huge JS upgrade beating Chrome on the Windows platform!  The SunSpider suite shows Chrome to be around 40% faster than Safari and 25% faster than Firefox 3, but on par with Safari 4.0 and only a tad faster than Firefox 3.1.<p>In fact, the only thing that shows V8 as being so amazing is Google's own test which is basically a lot of recursion (akin to Microsoft's surveys that show people love Vista).<p>Google has a good product, but it isn't an order of magnitude better than what exists today and is on par with what is coming in the future.  Heck, pull a nightly of the new Mozilla TraceMonkey engine and you'll see that TraceMonkey handily beats V8 (after 2 months of development rather than 2 years).  Oh, and Chrome isn't in production.<p>Different processes will be game changing.  V8 just won't be.",1220561947
295190,comment,295068,295173,0,0,mixmax,,,"What Google is doing is commoditizing the browser in order to make the web more accessible - and most importantly more like an operating system by including a (supposedly) superior javascript engine that makes it possible to create real apps in a browser window.<p>The financial interest of Google is not to make money on the browser, but to change the game and move as many apps on to the Internet and away from the computer as possible. This is where their strength lies, and they know it.<p>In my opinion this is a genius and bold move to which Microsoft basically has no countermoves. If they play along and get better javascript performance in IE apps move to the web, if they don't IE will fall behind firefox and chrome. Either way Google wins.<p>They don't care about making money on the browser. They care about moving everything into the(ir) cloud.",1220561891

They should license it, then they could get the revenue they need to be a serious competitor to IE. As it is, nor matter how good technically Chrome is, it will be a curiousity. Without revenue from licensing you can't play with the big boys. ""Open source""/free software sounds good in a college sociology paper, but sucks as a business model.

Synchronizing graphics context accesses is another PITA, which may be avoidable here.<p>2. Resiliency: a single bad plugin or V8 bug need not take down the entire browser.  Just a self-closing tab.<p>3. Security.  (not in this version of the browser) The supervisor proc may be able to set per-process access controls (e.g. RBAC) to keep the tabs in check.  E.g. keeping activeX in control, while allowing the in-house controls to function with as much access as they need.<p>A lot of OS functionality is process based, and using them allows for a lot of open space for new possibilities.",1220560386
