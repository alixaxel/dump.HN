But can you say the same about cellphones?<p>It seems to me that cellphones are much more narrowly defined and used. Some are fashion accessories, some like the Blackberry are like a communication utility.<p>But none are a generic computing device, and I don't think they'll ever be. So it is easy to imagine the cell market being dominated by the most shiny thingy.<p>You could even say that with Vista's DRM, even the PC is heading that way, where the open platform will eventually be relegated to a niche enthusiast market.<p>People like us will pay a premium to get a PC as open as one anyone can by today.",1221767910

308489,comment,306381,308228,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's the Internet.  When in doubt, assume sarcasm.<p>The point has already been made that the vast majority of ""small to medium businesses"" do not need scalability (not even a little bit--90% of those businesses could be hosted on a $10/month shared hosting account and never have a performance problem).  So, we're talking about a <i>tiny</i> subset of an extremely cost-conscious market.  Not only that, for the small businesses that <i>do</i> need scaling (the Twitters and the Justin.TVs), the vast majority of their scaling problems cannot be solved by adding a few applications like memcache and a pre-tuned MySQL to the distribution.  Your application has to be built to scale, or you will not scale.  The tuning of MySQL is trivial (and case-by-case specific, to boot...there is no way to say any particular MySQL configuration is good for all high performance use cases that balances all of the usual tradeoffs, and as much as there can be such a configuration the one provided by most distros is already pretty close to it).<p>You could ask me how I know, with some confidence, that web scalabilty for small to medium businesses is a bad business idea, or I could just blurt out that my first business built web scalability products for small to medium businesses.  It took me seven years to figure out that they don't have any money, <i>and</i> that they don't know enough to know to look at the niche solutions for their problems (they call Cisco, or F5 if they're really on the technical ball), so when they do spend money, they're spending it with companies that provide a huge range of products that are sort of ancillary to the task at hand...and also happen to have a few items in their product line that can sort of address the problem, if you squint right and send them enough money.  Not that I'm bitter.  (Seriously, I'm actually not bitter.  Just amused when folks take the ""pick a problem that <i>you</i> have, and chances are others will have it too, and <i>there's</i> your perfect business idea!"" to an extreme that doesn't quite mesh with reality.)<p>There may be the seed of a good idea in there somewhere.

When you get ubiquitous and fast internet on the mobile device (not some bizarre spotty coverage), then things will change. Maybe Europe is ahead in regards to that, but in the US, I don't see that happening very soon.<p>Edit: oh, and also the processor speeds.

While the account is plausible enough on its face—and, if true, highlights the special vulnerability of such password reset mechanisms for public figures—there are also some reasons for skepticism.
