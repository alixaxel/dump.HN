The market could be a lot bigger if it were easier to find one's way.<p>Your first sentence deliberately ignores my main point which was of course that Linux by and large doesn't care if you're a little too intimidated by the range of choices to try something new. In fact I would go so far as to say if you're a person who likes to have everything spoon fed to you and is not comfortable and/or does not enjoy doing some research for yourself when you encounter issues, then you actually are better off sticking to Windows or possibly a Mac. Linux helps those who help themselves.<p>> And what about most of us who are not acquainted with anybody that uses Linux on a regular basis?<p>a) Local Linux user groups.\nb) Distro forums.\nc) Mailing lists.\nd) Google.<p>I also mentioned that these days, the choice for a newbie wanting to try Linux in general terms is pretty much made for them. You ignored that bit too.<p>> If their goal is not being popular, then I would say they are succeeding.<p>I never said their goal was not being popular, this is quite obvious to anyone who actually read my previous reply rather than skimming over it and trying to twist it into something that could be used to reinforce their existing beliefs.<p>What I did say was that many distros see popularity as a low or non-existent priority when compared to others, such as quality of implementation.<p>Debian has often gotten flak in the past for its long release cycle. If Debian devs are asked when the next stable Debian release will be ready, the usual answer is ""When it's done."" (though this is changing somewhat now) When the quality is assured, then it's released.<p>It's not released when the marketing department says it should be just because they are trying to hit an artificial deadline imposed by some middle manager who's more interested in his coke and hookers.<p>From the sound of it, I would recommend that you stay as far away from Linux as you can. You do not seem to have the required mind set that would make it an enjoyable experience for you.",1222729069

There is a shortage of viable uses for credit.  There is huge overcapacity in retail, housing, etc.  People who can't reasonably be expected to pay back loans can't get them right now.  Which is basically a good thing.  Businesses can't get loans to expand because nobody in their right mind thinks many kinds of business SHOULD be expanding.<p>The macro-economic conditions are driving the markets, not the other way around.  The financial firms are suffering because the REAL economy ran out of greater fools and hit its maximum tolerable debt load.  The real economy is not shuddering because the masters in Wall Street can't grease the wheels; it's the other way around.",1222726477

You're talking about the initial version of it, which I thought was absolutely horrible. The version that was voted on today seemed quite a bit better (more oversight, some limits on executive pay, not all the money is paid out at once among other provisions...), but I just think that the core of the bill is simply not a good idea.",1222726335

318916,comment,318595,318870,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The issue is that from my understanding, it's a really bad bill.  I think it shows a striking lack of character to vote for a bad bill because it happens to contain some earmarks or other terms you (and your biggest contributors) happen to like.<p>The older I get, the more I realize that character in politicians is far more important than ideology.  Decent people can disagree on the right way to solve the problems our nation faces, including this (very large) one...but lining the pockets of supporters at the expense of everyone else in the nation, particularly those least able to protect their assets, strikes me as a despicable and crassly self-serving act.  The only way to a solution that most everybody can agree on is to honestly discuss the issues.<p>With a bill named ""To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide earnings assistance and tax relief to members of the uniformed services, volunteer firefighters, and Peace Corps volunteers, and for other purposes"" that hands $700 billion (actually more...) over to a fellow who'll be doling it out to all of his old buddies from the finance industry with no oversight, we've already established that no sane discussion can take place.  It's classic doublespeak on the order of the best the Soviets and Red Chinese ever came up with, and that duplicity in and of itself is enough to disqualify this bill from consideration by honest folks.<p>This is actually a prime example of why I genuinely like Ron Paul.  I disagree with him on some major issues (immigration and abortion being the biggest), but I know where he stands, and I know he believes in what he says and acts accordingly.  I think I'd like to see a lot more of that, from any side of the political spectrum.  But, it seems like crooked Republicans get voted out only to be replaced by crooked Democrats.  I'd be happy with a batch of honest Democrats or a batch of honest Republicans, but it seems the only way to keep them close to honest is to keep churning new people in, keep the parties roughly in balance, and keep them at each others throats so they can do the least amount of damage possible.",1222725947

Instead, it diverts resources away from more productive sectors and by fuelling consumer spending it exacerbates America's economic imbalances. Eventually, there will be a price to pay.<p>Also, I'm not sure that predictions of problems equate to knowing what to do to best wind down the current mess.  You're right (elsewhere) that some things need to go under.  However, I think the point of the 'bailout proponents' is that more will go under than otherwise needs be without it.<p>Of course I guess we'll really never know for certain in any case, as it's impossible to know what would have happened otherwise.  We could have no bailout and massive failures just as we could have a bailout and still have massive failures.  Or no massive failures in either case.",1222725769
