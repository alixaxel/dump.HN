If you put some commercial numbers on that problem, you'll see it's a lot harder than it looks.<p>Satellite launch failures alone can cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars -- and that's not even touching the issue of revenue lost to the broadcast company who bought the thing (and waited 3-4 years to see it constructed and launched).  Although awful regulation has played a role in preventing launch vehicles from becoming a truly commercial market, The Man hasn't been the only issue keeping launch costs high -- this stuff is hard!",1222657073

318038,comment,317962,318027,0,0,orib,,,"Induction isn't the core of it. The idea is that you try to find counterexamples in science, and you <i>don't</i> have proofs in the general sense. Ever. The best you can say is that ""If I guessed right, then I have math that worked out."" Nothing more. Mathematics allows a definite ""This is a solution that exists to this problem."". In Science, you can say that a solution exists to a problem, but that's not the tricky part -- the tricky part is figuring out the right problem to solve.<p>Science is effectively an attempt to reverse engineer the universe. Imagine that you were given a clock by a client. A very ornate clock that he doesn't want you to take apart. Then he tells you he wants you to make schematics for the clock so precise he could put together a precise functional duplicate. But you're not allowed to take it apart.<p>I would say that does not that count as mathematics, although mathematics would certainly have a use as a tool to prove that the behavior is correct in all observed respects. But you could probably find a new minute difference in the way the hand moves, and that would blast all your carefully crafted mathematics to bits.<p>I'm not slagging on mathematics, and I'm not trying to glorify science and say that one is a more powerful superset of the other.<p>They're both very useful and very tightly intertwined disciplines, but they're also very different. In a way, you could say that math is the study of solving problems, and science is the study of finding physically meaningful problems.",1222655678

Now what if you were to count every number between 0 and 1? Would it still be infinity?<p>I've always thought in degrees of infinity, but either way its still not a number.<p>If you kept the degrees of infinity separate, you <i>could</i> divide 5 by zero and it would not be the same as dividing 4 by zero.<p>If you wanted to play with limits, you could say the limit of 5/x as x approaches 0 is infinity, but we don't really have a name for what x/0 would be.

318025,comment,317549,317549,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"This also goes back to pg's article on where you live and what defines ""power"".  In the past 7 years, I've lived in the following places and definitely have seen what constitutes wealth/doing well:<p>Cambridge-  Definitely education, but in a weird place.  I studied for the summer at Harvard.  Everyone was unique, some cases weird, but absolutely brilliant in their specialty.  It was about being the best in their area of study.<p>New York/Northern NJ-  I grew up here, and this is where I was before going back to Boston.  It was about more traditional routes of money, and nothing earth shattering.  You were a dentist, a doctor, or wall street trader.  There were some celebrities around too.  It was all about the traditional path.  Go to a private high school, go to a good college, get the right internships, slave away 9-5, then become rich via Goldman Sachs or something.  Boy did I break that mold...<p>(Went to Boston College next, but not adding that in since Cambridge covered that area well enough)<p>Miami-  Now this is interesting.  The whole Miami Vice attitude you see is 100% real.  My thoughts on this area are indicative of it as a whole, NOT the technology sector, which is flourishing very nicely down there.  Success was measured by how nice your material possessions were.  Lamborghinis, bottles of Cristal, and overpriced penthouses.  Most money here wasn't really earned, but through family inheritance or foreign overseas money.  Yes, drug money still powers part of the town.<p>Silicon Valley- This can include SF, even though my experiences are from living in Palo Alto.  It's all about what you're building, who you're going to help, and what the ""delta"" is.  How were things before hand, and how are they once you're done?  No doubt money is important, but it's a by product of the previously mentioned statement. In my 5 months here, I've met the founders of insanely successful companies, billionaires,etc.  Honestly, you wouldn't know it, if it wasn't for the companies they founded.  Everyone is also willing to help out here.  In short, wealth is valued by what you have created and the people you help achieve that same goal.",1222654512
