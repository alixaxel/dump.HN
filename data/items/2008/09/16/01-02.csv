305315,comment,305191,305191,0,0,rrf,,,"I agree that personal incentives are part of the problem.  I’d also suggest that going public is another significant part of the problem. The public company becomes beholden to its shareholders and is pressured/incentivised to continually deliver growth in the value of the company or dividends, often in mature markets, which in turn can lead to the implementation of riskier strategies for delivering growth.",1221529965

From the early 80's to the present, individuals, pension funds, and endowments moved savings from bonds and savings accounts into the stock market.  I believe this reallocation caused a one time run up in stock prices.  In the process, people grew so used to price appreciation that dividends disappeared.  Since, traditionally most of the value of owning stock comes from dividends, I expect stocks to under perform until dividends return.",1221528708

Would it be possible to still make the creation of new 'Cligs' more streamlined, with the option to sign up later to retrieve/view stats? Just a thought.<p>API still important, if not critical, in my eyes.<p>If you havent already, I would do a benchmark of Google Analytics and other free analytics companies and try to see what are the important metrics. ""Hits"" doesnt really cut it if your differentiation is analytics.<p>Anywho, Good luck.

305287,comment,305191,305191,0,0,bokonist,,,"Cuban's call for more regulations displays some naivete about how Washington works.  Lobbyists from big companies have no problem twisting regulations to serve their own interest at the expense of the public.  For example, read about how easily Fannie Mae pushed the right buttons in Congress to manipulate regulations in their favor: <a href=""http://billburnham.blogs.com/burnhamsbeat/2008/07/fannie-maes-gol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://billburnham.blogs.com/burnhamsbeat/2008/07/fannie-mae...</a>. This happens again and again, thanks to the actual mechanisms by which Congress works.  <i>Government's End</i> by Jonathan Rauch and <i>The Triumph of Conservatism</i> by Gabriel Kolko are great treatments of the subject.<p>The real solution is that we need someone like Mark Cuban to start a competing stock market.  He could create listing requirements that would include mandatory rules such as 1) requiring that companies only pay dividends (instead of doing stock buybacks 2) CEO's must get paid based on how the company does for the decade after they leave 3) all shareholders must either vote for the board members or hire a proxy voting firm, etc. etc.<p>I don't know what the exact rules would be, but I'm sure someone could design a set of rules that would be both less obtrusive and more effective than our current regulations.  If the rules are designed well, this new well managed market will give investors higher returns.  That will force the existing markets to shape up or lose their investors.",1221527729
