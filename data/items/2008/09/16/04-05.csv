305434,comment,305191,305389,0,0,bokonist,,,"If you go by the dictionary, there's no difference between lobbying and corruption.  Of course, there is also no difference between <i>voting</i> and corruption, which is the inherent problem of electoral democracy.  The founders made a huge design flaw by not adopting the Venetian and Athenian system of using lotteries to select office holders.  Read Nick Szabo on the subject: <a href=""http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/03/unpredictable-elections.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/03/unpredictable-elect...</a>   Also, read the Rauch book I recommended before.  Rauch worked for years for the National Journal, which is the magazine that ends up on the desk of every Congressional staffer.  His description of how government really works matches my experiences in Washington perfectly.<p>Lobbying works on two fronts. First, is the appeal to public welfare.  In the 1980's the interests in favor of creating Fannie Mae appealed to the dream of home ownership and the idea of making homes more affordable.  They convinced Congress that a quasi-public company would make interest rates cheaper and housing more affordable ( in the short run this is true, since with implicit government backing, they could borrow more cheaply).  Later in the 1990's Fanne Mae convinced Congress that in the goal of opening up home ownership to more people, they should lower the down payment requirements.  Again, there is the appeal to helping the poor achieve the American dream.<p>Of course, the lobbyists are also looking out for their own self-interest.  Lowering the down payment requirements would help them sell more loans and make more money.  Perhaps the lobbyists were being cynical about the benefits to the poor.  Or perhaps they believed their own marketing and genuinely believed it was win-win.  It doesn't matter, the effect is the same.<p>The second part of lobbying is the campaign contributions and the golf games.  This provides the Congressman the personal incentive to support the lobbyists' plan.  Most of this happens right out in the open - the days of passing around suit cases full of cash are over (although if you want to read about those times check out Caro's <i>Master of the Senate</i>).  The amount of the contributions is not enormous, but in an election every bit helps.  It's enough money that the Congressman will try to find away to help the lobbyist if he can.<p>The end result is disastrous.  By having the implicit government backing and by lowering the down payment requirements, Fannie Mae was able to make massive number of irresponsible loans  Its managers made tens of millions.  Then the whole thing crashed and the taxpayer is now  footed with part of the bill.  But no Congressman will pay any price for the debacle, so they never learn the lesson.  Most voters won't even know who is responsible.  And the general voting public has no ability to vote out the members of the banking committee - voters can only vote out the member of their own district.  Of course the voters of that particular district don't want to vote their particular Congressman out.  If they did, they would lose the earmarks that come from having a senior Congressman.  Thus, there ends up being no accountability. Congress ends up with a 98% reelection rate and a 20% approval rating.<p>For the Congressmen involved, it is just a case of good intentions gone awry.  In fact, I actually think Congressmen genuinely believed they were doing the right thing when they created Fannie Mae.  Righteousness has an amazing ability to align itself with self-interest.<p>I find it amusing when people subscribe to the ""throw the bums out"" theory of politics.  If you've every worked in Washington, you realize that the people running the show are generally no worse than anyone else in the country.  Most are pretty decent, a few are rotten.  The real problem is the incentive structure of our current political system.  The only solution to fixing Washington is major Constitutional reform.",1221540335

305429,comment,305191,305403,0,0,helveticaman,,,"The question is not one of doing better, but of inevitability; for a company's stock to be worth anything, it has to pay profits out to the stockholder. This can mean dividends or an eventual lump sum when the company winds down. The problem is the latter never happens because companies never want to admit they are dying. On top of that, every company dies; just in 2006 the oldest company in the world, Kongo Gumi, went under after operating continuously since 578. The stock price is, in theory, the net present value of the stream of earnings its bearer will receive. So if no company will ever pay significant monies when it winds down, that leaves dividends (edit: now that I think about it, getting acquired counts too).<p>I have no evidence to show dividend-bearing stocks outperform their counterparts, but my point is that those counterparts are overvalued. If a company will never be bought, will never pay dividends, and will never wind down operations rather than face bankruptcy, the net present value of its stock is therefore 0.<p>*<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kong%C5%8D_Gumi</a>",1221539843

They happened like clockwork, every 20 years, during 19th century America, a period where there was no safety net and no significant government intervention in the economy.<p>I'd attribute bubbles and meltdowns to flaws in humanity itself.  They happen because people have to make investment decisions in the absence of perfect information, using thought processes that have evolved to take into account peers' opinions as much as hard factual data.  Inevitably, some of those decisions will be wrong, and that wrongness appears as a large number of firms going bust at once.<p>The way to avoid financial meltdowns is to make every human a God.

As consumers, we chase the best deals. Would you go with banks who only let you borrow a tiny amount in line with your credits on strict terms? Of course not, not when you can flip for a quick 100% gain within the next 6 months. We go with the most outrageous deal and lenders in turns have to create more outrageous deals to compete.

Basically, it's a way to enforce some basic code review practices without requiring one of your senior developers to be able + willing to read over your junior devs' code.<p>The whole point of programming is to automate those tasks that can be automated, right? So, let's automate the first-pass stage of a basic security audit as much as we can.<p>To your specific points:<p>* Parameterized queries are available in some cases, as you said, but don't work when you have to build some portion of the query (sort order, grouping, etc.) at runtime. Static tools can help flag such dynamic values as being tainted or clean, as well as help insure that resulting queries will be well-formed.<p>* All that's necessary to extend your type checking to the database is to enforce the same level of discipline you do for built-in API functions. Just as static analysis tools need a signature for primitive functions provided by the runtime platform (syscalls for C, primitive library functions for PHP, etc.), your static checker could ensure that queries which used stored procedures checked at least the asserted type signature of those procedures. (SQL is pretty type-savvy, and most stored proc authors should be able to trivially provide type sigs for their code.)<p>The advantage to using Haskell for all of this is twofold:<p>* There are excellent existing parsing and graph algorithm libraries maintained by the Haskell community<p>* Working in a strict, pure functional language makes you think in terms of mathematical theories, rather than stateful effects, which in turn tends to result in better, more deterministic code<p>That being said, I think you could use OCaml, Lisp, or any number of other high-level languages to similar effect. The uniquely math-oriented world view of Haskell (and its implementers and users) does tend to lend itself to just the kind of defensible reasoning that you would want from a security-focused static analysis tool, though.",1221537664
