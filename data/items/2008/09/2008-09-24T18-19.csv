Computer programming, I find, is more about structuring and designing a program.  Computer science is more about algorithms and fundamental limits of computation.<p>That's not to say they don't overlap in theory or in practice of either.  However, the opinion held by one depends on the work (or play) that they do.<p>If you mostly build blogs, consumer apps, desktop apps, scripts, then you spend most of your time structuring programs, and occasionally have to delve into algorithms.  I suspect you don't think a CS degree is required.<p>If you mostly do computer vision, AI, image processing, databases, networking, then you probably spend most of your time fiddling with algorithms and less time structuring and designing programs.  I suspect you're more likely to think a CS degree is required you do.<p>Not that one is better than another.  Just different experience in what one does with a computer gives different perceptions.  Game programmers seem to break the mold.<p>And if you do scientific programming, you think CS and programming is a tradesman's job, and your program is one long main() nested 11 levels deep with if/else and case statements.

People are using Twitter and Facebook to reduce the amount of time they spend with people whilst trying to stay in contact with people. My girlfriend uses it and I want to block the damn thing because she'll spend an hour on that 'keeping in touch' instead of us going out for a meal with the people we're trying to keep in touch with.<p>People went from keeping blogs to using twitter and now instead of making a post or two they'll make a couple of microposts. It's completely, inherently moronic. I contend that people using these completely unneeded services are far dumber than the people clicking google ads.<p>I have little doubt there are people who've spent months worth of time on Facebook when they could have used that time to actually be with family and friends.

But if you're sure you want to do the deal, the main thing you have to figure out is how much of the company your new investor will own, and how much of it will be owned by you and your partners.  If you're not already incorporated you'll need to do that, and you can probably just include your investor as one of the founding shareholders (perhaps the only one who doesn't need stock vesting).  If you are already incorporated, you can start with an angel financing doc from YC, and run it by a lawyer to make sure your case isn't special for some reason.  If you're not sure where to find a lawyer, you should ask some startup founders you know personally -- this probably isn't a complicated scenario, but there's nothing like incompetent legal help to make a simple scenario into a gridlock.",1222281429

As you stated, most hackers who didn't would ignore any requirements and apply because they wanted to work on posterous.<p>Here are some of my own personal opinions on hiring / schools / etc.<p>Which school you graduated from and rank is rarely even discussed when hiring coders with a few years experience. After 2 years no one will ask you where you graduated in your class. After 8 years no one will care where you went to school, other than possibly as a plus. It's not a decision maker at that point. What the applicant did between graduation and applying to the job is really what matters. This seems to be different for other areas of study (and graduate degrees of course). But this is my experience with coders (bachelor degree holding computer scientist and the like). Both hiring and being one.<p>An individual's family situation, both financial and otherwise, can effect their decisions on schools. Some oft overlooked hackers went to state or local colleges for reasons outside of their control. An example - I knew someone in high school that got into MIT and Northwestern (Chicago area). They ended up cranking through the local college (Northern Illinois University) in 3 years instead. His family had a business and he had to be there to run it. After he finally found someone to manage the family business he ended up being successful and promoted up the chain in a huge company. There are plenty of opportunities outside of the norm.

And Qt? Why hasn't OpenOffice worked seamlessly from day 1? Or at least day 5? Why don't Apple embrace the huge community that worships their products, instead of becoming the next Microsoft? What have they got to loose?<p>If getting my favourite Linux apps to run on my MacBook had bees as easy as apt-get, heck, even as easy as under Windows, I'd still use Mac OS X.. now it's running Kubuntu, and I'm regretting not getting a ThinkPad.<p>I'm disappointed, I REALLY wanted to like MacOSX.",1222279421

If you're also using your left hand to press Ctrl (whether on CapsLock or at the bottom left of the keyboard), you're mangling your hand. That's why there's also a right Ctrl key.<p>FWIW, I sometimes use Page Up/Down and the arrow keys while just reading, but tend to use the Emacs-style navigation shortcuts while actively editing. C-v never made sense to me, either; I'm guessing it's just historical.",1222279308
