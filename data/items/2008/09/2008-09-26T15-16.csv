316183,comment,315909,316151,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"This only works out if there is WAGE inflation.  It is very possible for inflation to run rampant while nominal wage growth trails far behind.  This is probably the most likely scenario.  Have fun paying off your devalued debts with an income of $0, because you're unemployed.<p>In the intermediate term, asset deflation will probably be the dominant force, even if consumer staples continue to inflate somewhat.  The very high general inflation is in store for later.",1222444689

In college this was largely the same, but I managed to learn a few study habits. I still don't recall an iota of what I learned via mechanical study, though. But I always aced the programming courses and could probably still write a few lines of x86 Assembly if my life depended on it.<p>I vehemently refused to learn standard study habits necessary to excel in school, but it wasn't because of sheer laziness or something, I just knew that such a habit was by and large useless to actual learning.

There was never a substantial fund; insurance premiums were simply deposited at the treasury.<p>If a few more large banks fail the treasury will have to come up with the money to cover.  Odds are low that the usual customers for treasury debt will want to help (China, et al), so the Treasury will have to collude with the Fed to print up the money to cover.  Which means inflation.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that in the event of bank failure you have no legal guarantees of a timely refund from the FDIC.  They may take many months to reimburse you.<p>In any case, there are much safer ways to store your money than at a bank.  Directly own equities, such as GLD and currency ETFs.

The question is whether there will be a significant inflation at all. I doubt it, since lot of assets were burned recently in the market drop so there is actually missing liquidity. US could easily face the problem of deflation rather then inflation in the near future.
A well balanced portfolio of your investments is the best what you can do in long term. It is hard (if impossible) to time the markets. A well balanced portfolio generally means: 60% equity, 30% bonds, 10% alternatives (including gold).",1222442901
