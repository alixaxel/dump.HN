It is empowering to ""know how those things work"" from first principles, but as time progresses, the volume of such knowledge grows towards and beyond the capacity of the courses that convey it.  Universities must then (as they are now) make a delicate balance between covering fundamentals (which most practitioners consider too ""academic"") and preparing graduates with skills that they can immediately apply in practice.  Many graduates seem dissatisfied with the balance that universities choose.",1203648931

121016,comment,121003,121003,0,0,pg,,,"You can see two spikes in unique visitors due to Arc here:<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/images/news.yc.1year.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/images/news.yc.1year.png</a><p>There was a spike in Jan when I said Arc was imminent, and then another when it came out.  But if you squint your eyes and look at the whole curve, the underlying growth rate seems pretty constant.<p>In other words, while it's true we've been getting a lot of new users lately, this probably would have happened anyway.<p>What to do about that growth is another matter.  I think a lot of users are alarmed at the sight of fluff links on the front page because they remember what that meant for other sites in the past.  But the current fluff link (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=120816"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=120816</a>) was submitted by a long-time user, and there are no signs of statistical weirdness in the votes on it.  I.e. statistically the users who upvoted that story are no different from the ones upvoting the other top stories.  So at the moment I'm still hopeful that the bad signs are false alarms.<p>I have a hunch that the way to fend off the hordes of 14 year olds is to keep up the quality of the stories on the front page.  Then if they come across this site they'll decide it's boring and leave.",1203648734

120999,comment,120816,120990,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I've been meditating about this over the last couple of days, and I'm pretty sure there are three stages in the life cycle of social news site discussion quality.<p>1. ""You're wrong because"" (intelligent arguments)<p>2. ""You're wrong"" (no reason given, baseless opinions)<p>3. ""You're a fag"" (ad hominems)<p>Of course there will always be some of each in any given stage, so the way the community reacts to comments is probably almost more important than the comments themselves. Good users will put up with stupid links, but they'll leave if it becomes clear that their contributions aren't being valued and they start to feel alienated from the community.<p>Up until recently the discussion quality on news.yc has been in stage one, but I feel like it's been drifting toward stage two over the last couple of weeks. I'm especially worried as we get closer to the deadline for YC apps, since quality always goes downhill during those periods.",1203647509

Perhaps there could be some kind of difficulty weight a user inputs when they submit a story.  More demanding stories get a 10.  Cartoons get a 1.  Then give more weight to upvotes on the more complex stories.  Obviously, this has the potential for abuse with folks misrepresenting the complexity of their article.

120996,comment,120857,120857,0,0,gcv,,,"All the time, believe it or not. For example, in one class, I learned about garbage collection algorithms, which I used to explain to a coworker why he was seeing a certain memory usage pattern in the JVM. I'm also glad I learned about DFAs and NFAs in my theory of computation class, because they come in pretty handy for figuring out some problems. My favorite incident was when the same coworker was suggesting project ideas, I used Turing's halting theorem to show him that his idea was impossible.

120992,comment,120843,120977,0,0,wallflower,,,"I've been working on a big project involving Adobe Flex for the past year. Before we started the project, they brought in Adobe trainers for 5-days of on-site, slightly-better-than-powerpoint Flex training. Too much information - from one topic to the next. We all knew no Flex. Theoretically, we could have learned Flex from the online tutorials but after the recovering from the deluge of 5-days of Flex we could claim plausible knowledge. Then, we sat on it for 4 months - no flex. Of course, not until we started trying to develop UIs using Adobe Flex 4 months later did we start to learn (painfully). But the training got us started.<p>The point of this little story - get help, ask questions (hacker personalities are problem solvers and love to solve problems), but get started. Training and mentoring can help bootstrap it. Ask a friend who is a programmer to help get you started.<p>You seem like a good writer - why not write a blog about learning enough about programming to build your own web application?",1203646664

120990,comment,120816,120981,0,0,pg,,,"Yeah, this is worrying.  A crap link and a crap thread, and it's number 2.<p>The fundamental problem on any site like this is that it's so easy to upvote lightweight stuff.  When a link sounds like it's going to take a while to read, people say ""maybe I'll read it later,"" and never do.  And since they haven't read it, they don't upvote it.  Whereas e.g. a cartoon people know will only take a few seconds, so they click on it.  And if they like it, they upvote it.  Sounds harmless enough, right?  And yet repeat and the result is a disaster.<p>What is the solution?  The Right Thing would be to somehow scale votes by how easy/hard it is to vote on something.
