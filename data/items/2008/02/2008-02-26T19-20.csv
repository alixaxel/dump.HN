This is well documented in research. Still, I have to question why you would prefer to be 'rich' in a place without running water rather than be 'poor' in America (where the poor people only have one TV and have to drive used cars).<p>Of course, there are a lot of people worse off than my above glibness suggests, and I think we should definitely be doing all we can to help those people out, but don't try and claim being poor in America is somehow worse than being poor anywhere else just because people like Warren Buffet live here.<p>""Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with people getting rich.""<p>The fact that you called Warren Buffet an asshole shows that you do. If you knew anything about the guy, you'd know he doesn't rate anywhere on the asshole scale. My guess he is just a soft target because he happens to be so rich that he is a statistically anomaly.",1204055979

- someone to help do PR & marketing materials
- couple more LAMP programmers<p>We can't pay with cash, so how do we find people who are willing to take the risk?

So give yourself an interesting challenge that can be overcome with the tools you want to learn.<p>If you're using automated tools along the way (installers, package managers, code scaffolding), consider doing what the tools do for you manually.
