121791,comment,121788,121788,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"This is a perfect example of where the theory/practice divide comes back to bite us.  In THEORY enforced entropy, scheduled changes, ""blind"" passwords that don't echo back a character, etc. all make our users way safer.  In practice, most of the time they just piss them off and the users just recycle the same ""entropic-enough"" passwords on all sites, which they rotate through whenever bothered to do so.<p>Users haven't read the security texts and, if they have, they probably don't care.<p>Which isn't to say we SHOULDN'T design systems like that, it just means that we shouldn't be surprised when users circumvent our well-intentioned password policies.",1203735550
121790,comment,121175,121564,0,0,h34t,,,"What an amazing story... this is the first I've read of it. It doesn't much to do with my argument, though. Even though I haven't talked about this much here, I personally believe that persistence is one of the most important ingredients in doing <i>anything</i> important. But it's not a holy grail to be worshiped at all costs. You can't make a general rule called ""never give up"" if ""giving up"" means ceasing the cooperation of a team for a particular purpose. That would be a stupid rule; it would lead to all sorts of irrational results. Imagine a VC firm that decided to never give up on any of its startups, ever. That sort of policy would fly in the face of all general knowledge about how the world of startups work.<p>Offering an anecdotal example is very problematic. What about all the other folks who were working on making blue LEDs whose, inventions had no chance of competing with Nakamura's? Because of the survivorship bias, we don't hear about <i>them</i>, yet they are just as important to understanding the dynamics of reality. After his invention was released, are they supposed to continue on the same path? Of course not. It doesn't mean they give up on life, or on themselves, but it does mean that they give up on a mission that they had committed themselves to for some period of time.<p>I'd <i>never</i> say that a founder should listen blindly to colleagues, and <i>certainly</i> not to me(!), in deciding whether it's worth continuing. These are complex decisions that need to be made carefully.<p>In short,<p>Success requires persistence,\nbut persistence does not imply success.\nMost stories of success will be stories of persistence,\nbut not all stories of persistence will lead to success.<p>And many stories of success will include ""giving up"" on previous projects/companies before finding success in a new one.",1203735306

Use the tools that get a specific job done the fastest.<p>Anecdotal evidence: back in 1998 I insisted of doing websites in Vi and Photoshop. Refreshing a graphic layout would take me an hour, slicing pictures, measuring pixels and editing the corresponding HTML. Along came a demonstration of Macromedia's Fireworks and Dreamweaver where the guy on stage did the same thing in under 5 minutes. While the generated HTML wasn't as ""pure"" as my hand edited code it was close enough to realize that I was wasting major time with my existing method.<p>Never looked back being an tool atheist...",1203735176

This is brutal considering it's hard to automate, and according to Joel Spolsky, one of the first jobs a startup hands to a dude who works on an hourly wage.<p>Then there's the larger cost of turning users away.",1203735084

121778,comment,121137,121603,0,0,h34t,,,"Ah, thanks for the clarification -- our thinking has a lot more in common than I thought. FWIW, I'm no economist either. I did major in Political Economy for a short while, but that just means that I had enough time to gobble up some conventional thinking on the matter (including that strict definition of raw materials) -- if I judge by my classmates in those courses, my studies are certainly no <i>guarantee</i> that I understand anything at all about the real world :-).<p>I don't have a lot of time right now, but in brief -- I like the way Warren Buffett puts it when he mentions that we're all indebted to the ""ovarian lottery"" for much of what we have in life... if he'd have been born in some poor African country, there's little chance he'd have had the success he has, because they don't have ""raw material"" (in your sense of the word) necessary to take his talent and create wealth out of it.<p>Also -- you're perfectly right that a lot of the conflict in a place like the Congo <i>is</i> caused by conflict over raw resources. I was using that sort of example to show how an abundance of raw material doesn't necessarily lead to wealth ""in general"" for the country; it can actually have the opposite effect.",1203733904
