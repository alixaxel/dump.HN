124312,comment,124226,124226,0,0,cawel,,,"I also have the feeling Iskold is wrong in several places.<p>The one thing he got right is the GMail case, where big companies are ""ready to take a loss to kill the competition"" (as said by dkokelly).<p>His tale about the DVR implies that if it's free, it's going to work. But consumers still have the ability to figure out which of 2 free products is best. Free does not preclude quality. Same rules as before apply.<p>His tale about startups worried about not being funded is far from convincing. VC's will always fund bright, innovative, potentially profitable startups (with the freeconomics model or others).<p>His tale about advertisement is not clear. If your ad-sponsored business is going well (during an economic downturn), there is an argument for advertisers to focus on you, and not others that fare less well.<p>His tale about complex transactions is wrong. Paying only for what you use is far from a bad concept: it creates several types of demand among your consumer-base. And it seems to work, as several European low-cost airlines showed during the last years.",1204070062
