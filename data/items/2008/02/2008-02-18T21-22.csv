118419,comment,118312,118312,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"Some of these really sound nitpicky. The ""Read More"" links shorten a page so users can browse quickly through articles and see which ones they'd actually like to read. Sure, some sites don't need it, but its ok on other sites. Now, the splitting into multiple pages like NYT or Tom's Hardware, yeah thats annoying as hell.<p>If fonts are too small, your browser has a enlarge text function. Generally 8pt is small but OK and mostly readable. Any smaller (I doubt any site uses smaller) is a little un-userfriendly.<p>“Let’s treat the mobile web as a separate entity.” -- OK I take issue with this one. Of course you have to treat it as a separate entity. Have you ever tried to view ""real"" google on a Pocket PC? Its too big. The mobile version makes it easier to see. Same goes for many sites. Mobile versions of sites ARE functional.<p>“Let’s care about low bandwidth!” -- Well I used to think it wasn't important, until I realized that AOL dial up service actually still exists....<p>“Let’s read out loud the URL on TV.” -- Most people won't go google  some unknown site on their own. If the TV tells them to visit the site though, theres a better chance they might.<p>“Let’s tell everyone Firefox is the better browser.” -- Firefox 1 WAS more secure than IE6. Right now however, I think the difference between firefox and IE7 is negligible enough... so whatever.<p>Overall, I think this article was written with too narrow of a scope.",1203371873

118388,comment,118106,118367,0,0,marvin,,,"Long post ahead.<p>It's not really that hard...maybe Emacs isn't for you, but I was in your place just six months ago, when I started my CS studies and heard that Emacs could make your life easier. I am still a newbie, but I have started loving the editor.<p>Here's how to learn.<p>You  <i>need</i> a good cheat sheet, printed and preferably taped to your monitor. You don't need the most arcane keymappings, but you'll need document navigation, search/replace, the escape commands (abort, save, quit), set mark/region, kill and yank (cut and paste, that is). And maybe after a while a quick reference on how to create and kill buffers. I am sorry I have to present it like this, but the keybindings are IMHO the best thing about Emacs when you're a newbie. Don't use the arrow keys! I know that sounds rather ludicrous, but it will save you hours of hand motion in the course of a year. And if at some point you miss a document navigation mapping, it is likely already included in the standard distribution and hence only a web search away. Try for instance <a href=""http://astro.berkeley.edu/~robishaw/comp/emacs.crib.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://astro.berkeley.edu/~robishaw/comp/emacs.crib.html</a>.<p>Actually, you could probably manage it with just document navigation, kill/yank and save/quit. Those will teach you how to hate your mouse. I love it when there's something I can do exclusively in Emacs, because it is so much easier to get my thoughts into bytes. I don't have to worry about any stupid motoric kung-fu. My hands never leave the keyboard.<p>If you're a newbie, Emacs won't serve you well for all kinds of work. I still prefer Eclipse for Java stuff, because it has a much gentler learning curve for getting debuggers, auto-complete, inspectors and syntax checking in order. You can do all those things in Emacs, but you have to be a lot more dedicated than I have been thus far. For scripting work, however (and that includes just about any Python work et. al.) it is glorious.<p>Emacs' revered customization won't be of much value to you when you're a newbie (you have to download an emacs lisp file just to change the editor's colors, for instance), but hopefully such details will keep out of your hair until you are familiar enough in the environment to tackle them. My Emacs looks really pretty now, so you know it can be done.<p>Getting the book that was mentioned seems like an excellent idea. I have been wondering myself whether there was one. Good books make learning a hell of a lot easier than scouring the web.<p>Good luck to you, I hope you find a solution that makes you happy :)<p>[Actually, now that I come to think of it, it would be nice if someone made an Emacs distribution with tighter integration to the windowing system. With menu-bars for most of the commands, easier configuration dialogs and all that stuff. Maybe most emacs developers don't care for these things, but it is very intimidating to have to look up every unfamiliar keybinding on the web. Just pulling down a menu and reading it would make the editor much less intimidating. I think the reason most programmers scorn Emacs is that it frightens them, just like LISP.]",1203369435
