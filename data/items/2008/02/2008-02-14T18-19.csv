116001,comment,115800,115891,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"Good idea, but how about instead of posts costing you karma, spam costs you karma.  Then if your karma goes negative, you cannot post until it becomes positive again.  That way it doesn't penalize new users with low karma, but it will only take two bad posts to render a spam account ineffective.",1203015371

115996,comment,114846,114846,0,0,oditogre,,,"Varies by how long I've been awake.  5 - 6 hours on weeknights.  8 - 9 on weekends (but the entire 'day' - from time I woke up on Friday to time I wake up on Saturday, for instance - will be longer than 24hrs total).  I can get by on 4 or 9, but usually less than 5 for 2 days in a row or more than 9 under any conditions and I feel like hell all day.  When I have extended periods (more than 5 or 6 days) where I have no particular reason to get up at a certain time, I fall into a sleeping pattern essentially the same as the '28 hour day / 6 day week'.  My sleeping habits have been about the same since puberty, and my mom's are about the same as mine (my dad sleeps about 9hrs a night).",1203015192

1) Install Macports from macports.org, and open the box icon that ends in .pkg.
2) Open the terminal.
3) Paste [touch .profile].  Don't paste the brackets, just what is inside.  press return.
4) Paste [open -a TextEdit ~/.profile], press return.  A text file will open.
5) Paste 
[
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH
export DISPLAY=:0.0
]
in the file.  Save it and close it.
6) Paste [. .profile].  Press return.
7) Paste [sudo port -d selfupdate].  Press return.  The computer will ask you for your password; give it and press return.
8) Wait for about three minutes.  The terminal will act weird and will be busy updating macports.  When it's done, you can use macports by pasting [port search sbcl] to search Steel Bank Common Lisp.  You can install by pasting [sudo port install sbcl].
