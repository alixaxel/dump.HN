There probably won't be a huge difference between most databases, if used effectively.<p>If you have special requirements, such as true isolation in transactions, be aware that this is ""leading edge"" for SQL Server 2005, and probably for MySQL. On the other hand, Oracle has been doing it for years.<p>If the data is being streamed in, and timestamped, and stored, you may want to just hold it in memory (32 Gigs holds a lot of data) or write to flat files. For simple data types, that are used in a predictable way, not much beats well-written custom code.",1203220338

117325,comment,117127,117321,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"The pairings that are made today would be best to apply for future cycles later in the year. Most people here you talk to will at best end up as an employee in your eyes, it's going to be hard to treat them as equals when most people are just throwing out soft skills they want filled.<p>My partner and I have known each other since high school but he went off to college while I went into the military. After reconnecting we've been working on small projects on and off for the past couple cycles to learn each others quirks, styles, and most importantly trust.<p>And after attending our 5 year high school reunion it's really surprising that people we haven't talked to in awhile turned out to be doing very similar tech things as well, even if they're not in the area. It surely doesn't hurt to look up Facebook some old friends and see what they're doing or what they're working on. Maybe some hate big corporate culture as much as we all do here.<p>A better way would be for people to list out their work experiences or market they're analyzing for their startup.<p>For example, one of the failed ideas I was researching for was event planning and building an evite competitor. After 4 months I dropped it but I've kept plenty of notes about trends, other websites, feature lists, specs, and so forth. If anyone wants to discuss it feel free to get in touch with me at alaska.miller@gmail.com. I also worked at a big corporation working with CMS tools, search tools, publication, enterprise software for PLM processes. If you want to build software to optimize those fields, again, get in touch with me.<p>Likewise my current idea is dealing with Flash video and Flex environment, and accessibility. If anyone has experience with that, please email me.<p>Start emailing people and sharing with them your ideas for feedback, then ask them for another referral to someone else you can talk to until you've literally have no one left to talk to. I've been keeping track of all my conversations and people of interest in iCal and 37s Highrise and building my business network. I'm also inviting local people to lunch to pick their brains.<p>But it's completely youthful naivety to think this is the right way to cofound a business together.",1203219925

117317,comment,117118,117313,0,0,curi,,,"That was a brief summary and one can say it more carefully. Most importantly, immorality is not a boolean thing. If you aren't accomplishing a goal, it'd be an improvement (more moral, a better way of life) to either change your approach, or change your goal. It is less moral (a worse way of life, immoral) to continue with a lifestyle that is failing by its own criteria of success and failure.<p>That needs the caveat that we only mean goals you actually intend to accomplish. We don't mean vague goals, and we definitely don't mean the sort of goal you would be happy to partially achieve -- in that case, the real goal is just making progress towards ... your ""goal"". (It's the same word, but it's a different concept than the one I mean).<p>Back to your points, you say that even if you fail by your own standards, you might help others, and the net effect of your life may be positive. That's absolutely true. However, it'd be even better (more moral) if you did the same actions,  but had wiser goals, which those actions were achieving. Then you'd help others, but also consider your own life successful.",1203218576

The downtime's effect on your site's reputation and income can be much more damaging than the 10% discount will fix.

117313,comment,117118,117190,0,0,lg,,,"It's funny that you think a lifestyle is immoral if it doesn't accomplish its own ""internal goals.""  I think that's wrong, and not just in pathological cases.  I might be an ultracompetitive misanthrope who lives to be on top (gordon-gecko-ish capitalist).   But the way I get there (startup? investing?) might end up helping lots of people; maybe helping them surpass me.  Was I immoral, because I didn't accomplish my goal to be number one?  I'd rather have more of those people than more couch potatoes complaining about the immorality of powerful people.",1203218230

117310,comment,116929,116929,0,0,ggruschow,,,"Skip both of them.<p>Just use memory with a (very frequent) periodic write of the entire dataset in a file named after the time you saved it.  Just write/read a block of memory (big array) to/from disk in a file named after the relevant time.  What's better is that modifying or accessing this data is normal straightforward memory accesses - very likely less work than writing SQL queries and very very likely easier to unit test.  So this should not only be faster, it should also take you less work.<p>You probably only care about ~10,000 US stocks & bonds, maybe 50 numbers per, all of which are represented well by a 64-bit double (most probably fine in a 32-bit float... yes even US bond prices - they trade in 32nds - binary works fine). 10,000 instruments x 50 numbers x 8 bytes = 4M bytes.  All 3 dimensions could increase by an order of magnitude and the answer would probably remain the same or very similar.<p>You mentioned two requests, and a primary goal of SPEED.<p>1. Data for a stock/bond - it's in memory.  Heck, there's a good chance you can fit the entire current dataset in your CPU cache.  You just can't beat that (well you don't need to - put down that VHDL tutorial).<p>2. Data for a certain day/time (across a bunch of stocks):  Just read the file off disk for that day/time.  Even if this isn't immediately up to your needs, normal optimizations should buy you tons of performance here - buy RAM and disk mirrors.  The data should be contiguous on disk, so you should have very minimal seeking (which is normally the speed killer).  You could come up with something that beats this by pulling out fewer than all the stocks at once, but your complexity would skyrocket.  This will should at least beat most setups with MySQL or SQL Server 2005 without a metric ton of tuning.<p>I'm guessing you forgot to mention that you need a time-series for price and volume information (if only for a graph to throw up alongside some boring numbers).  Consider just handling that separately, especially as all the other numbers you're interested in don't change anywhere close to as often (and those that do are based off the price/volume and can be trivially calculated on the fly).  Some headaches to watch out for though: if you try opening 10,000 file handles at the same time, something's likely to get mad at you.  Also note that if you're thinking of opening and closing 10,000 files a lot, you're likely going to be sending the disk seeking around like crazy updating meta-data on disk.",1203217909

Some code that I've inherited was truly atrocious and much of that ended up rewritten, but other had been impenetrably  dense. Those I had a mind to leave alone simply because I feared breaking the existing code.  Usually we ended up ""putting up dikes"" around it and then clean it up piecemeal.  Sometimes it is difficult to tell highly tuned and optimized code from a seething pile of cruft, but  a quick run with a profiler against some performance benchmarks usually settles that question.<p>Oh and by the way, yes there is some code that I've written that I am somewhat proud of even if I recognize some of its shortcomings and ugly warts.",1203217674
