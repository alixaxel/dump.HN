O yeah, since we're talking about government controlling most of the resources and distribution, you can probably kiss your rights goodbye too. It's not like this hasn't been done before with disasterous results... there's a reason China changed economic systems...<p>""most people either are stupid and/or can't change""<p>doesn't it make sense then for the system not to reward them for their behavior; and instead to reward people that can change and work both hard and smart?",1204051754

Just recently I took over a project with a .cs file called ""ToStrings.cs"".  It was the file in which all the ToString() overloads were stored.  It contained probably 100 or more.  The author's closing comments, though, are unfortunately spot on:<p>""In a production environment, this might be too strange looking for some teams.""  If I replaced all the ToString() overloads with some kind of ""nicer"", but bizarre-looking solution, my coworkers, I imagine, would be less-than-appreciative.

Absolutely awesome (and inspiring, given that we are in the 100-300 signups per day camp at RescueTime).<p>I would throw in my omnipresent ""think viral, if you can"".  Viral stuff doesn't easily translate to all businesses, but I literally know 3 or 4 guys who have gone the ""build it and they will come"" route with blog widgets and facebook apps.  If you build a blog widget that people want, you can pretty much just sit back and watch customers accumulate (not that you SHOULD).<p>Of course, monetizing businesses like that is another story.  And because it's so easy, it's crowded as hell.  But if you can add a sprinkle of virality (like the ""Proudly powered by Weebly.

124023,comment,123880,123880,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I don't think there's a ""hard and fast"" rule you could apply here, it would have to depend on the service. I'd probably do something along these lines:<p>* Warn the user with as much notice as possible that they're over or close to the limit of their downgraded plan. It should be painfully obvious to the user that they're about to lose their extra privileges and data. (a red bar with warning always displayed along top of site, for example)<p>* On the day of the downgrade, send them another email saying the changeover is imminent.<p>* Actually don't downgrade them for a couple of days, but keep the message up.<p>* After those couple days, do switch over, and don't allow any write accesses other than deletes until the user has cleared the excess. Make sure your app handles this gracefully. If your app is mostly write once, read many, then put random data over the limit (their most-used files?) into ""holding"" where they can't get to it until they delete files to get under the quota. (and give a hint that they wouldn't have this problem with the more expensive account type)<p>* If they don't clear out their stuff after 2-4 weeks, just automatically delete enough data to enforce the quota. Email them a final warning a few days before the deletion.<p>But maybe that's just me and my naturally customer-friendly point of view. :)",1204050993

That way you would be able to change the colortemperature of your lightning source, and get a really cool way of lighting up your office or home.

If you had any clue how money is introduced into the system, you'd be outraged that banks had the nerve to try to pull such a scam at the expense of the general population.  Yet it's been going on since the Medicis and nothing much has changed, even to this modern day.<p>Meanwhile we've created unprecedented wealth over the last 50 years, and yet while being obsessed with money, every person and company, big or small owes the banking establishment tons of money which we either must pay off by assuming more debt - or by handing over the stuff of our production - as is happening now with the housing industry and foreclosures.",1204050645

124013,comment,123265,123971,0,0,raganwald,,,"There are so many answers! Here are a few:<p>The article does not claim that (1..100).inject(&:+) is great. It claims that it is a totemic example of Ruby code.<p>There is nothing that technique X can do that technique Y cannot do given that X and Y are both Turing Equivalent. Of course you can write a library function to sum numbers. Do you also need a library function for the product of numbers?<p>If so, you now know of a salient difference between the two approaches. One needs a function for each thing you want to do, the other gives you some pieces you combine in different ways to do what you want. Is one better than the other? That's up to you to decide, you are the programmer. Ruby lets you write your program either way.<p>Now, Symbol#to_proc doesn't, in my opinion, add what I would call power. That's because you can always use a block or a lambda wherever you would use a symbol. But I may not have written the article well: the powerful and dangerous feature in Ruby is not Symbol#to_proc, it's <i>Open Classes</i>. Symbol#to_proc is an example of something you can do with an Open Class. Something else you can do with an Open Class is Hash#to_proc. Something else is Object#andand, a low-rent version of the Maybe Monad in Haskell.<p>I consider Open Classes to be powerful and dangerous. Am I advocating them? Of course not, it is up to you to decide whether they are a good idea or not. What I find interesting about them is that Rubyists are pushing the language in new directions with them, like Symbol#to_proc. The idea of a language growing from the fringe is also powerful and dangerous. The fringe is an uneducated, seething mass.",1204050515
