122862,comment,122268,122534,0,0,inklesspen,,,"That's actually a pretty ugly error by Pylons' standards. Normally a _very_ useful debugging console gets presented to the devs, and the public gets a standard (but customizable/replaceable) error screen. What happened here is that the exception happened again while trying to process the error (syntax errors in your base-level code will do that), and the Pylons exception handling gave up and rendered this error.<p>I don't know offhand exactly what produced that error message, as I've never seen it in my Pylons apps, but I'd suggest it's probably from paste.exceptions somewhere.<p><a href=""http://pythonpaste.org/module-paste.exceptions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pythonpaste.org/module-paste.exceptions.html</a><p>EDIT: I realized that the reason I never see this is because Reddit uses flup's SCGI server, while I use a mod_proxy-based approach. So that exception-formatting code is probably in flup somewhere.<p><a href=""http://trac.saddi.com/flup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.saddi.com/flup</a>",1203908211

122860,comment,122819,122819,0,0,makecheck,,,"This article mentions very little of what could actually be wrong with a Ruby implementation (I recall one point about how Ruby on Rails tends to guide developers toward particular solutions).  It describes mostly problems that are completely independent of Ruby and would happen in any migration.<p>Theirs failed because they didn't plan well.  And some of the ""work"" they mention to undo the migration isn't unique to Ruby either (e.g. obviously in any new system, if features are added that aren't in the previous system and users/data grow dependent, you might have to retrofit your old system with the new features before you can smoothly move back).",1203907316
