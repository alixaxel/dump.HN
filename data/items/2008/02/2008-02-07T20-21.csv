111384,comment,110992,110992,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Ph.D., Electrical Engineering, Cornell<p>(also B.S., Physics, Case Western Reserve)<p>I had one formal course in software: Motorola 68k assembly language programming, in college. Three months of super-tedious review for the slow students (""this is a hexadecimal number"") followed by perhaps one month of interesting new knowledge (""this is a stack frame""). I never tried to learn programming from a lecture course again.<p>I self-taught my own way through ArsDigita's web programming curriculum in the late 1990s... reading Greenspun's stuff was what convinced me that software was actually worth doing, and the reading list was great: SICP, <i>Learning Emacs</i>, Fogel's CVS book (hey, that's all they had in the elder days... :), <i>Internetworking with TCP/IP</i>, <i>SQL for Smarties</i>, Tufte, etc.",1202417800

My brother has been married to an Australian and they had to move to Australia, since she couldn't get a working visa in Denmark. He is an engineer, and she is a lawyer.<p>1 and 5 are somewhat countered by the high wages, but you are right. Because of the progressive taxing you end up paying 65% in taxes if you are a high earner. This is only for personal income though - if you keep your money in a holding company the tax rate is comparable to the US.",1202417443

111372,comment,111100,111236,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"If your language doesn't support anything but toy apps it quickly evolves to be optimized for building toys.<p>If the first Arc apps had not been full-featured Web apps, but had instead looked like examples from SICP, everyone would be complaining that the language was only good for computing Fibonacci sequences and writing interpreters for itself.<p>OTOH, you can't expect a new language to immediately offer the library resources of, say, Perl.<p>So the plan for Arc's early days seems to be similar to what the <i>Pragmatic Programmer</i> guys called the ""tracer bullet"" approach:<p><i>Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It simply is not fully functional. However, once you have achieved an end-to-end connection among the components of your system, you can check how close to the target you are, adjusting if necessary. Once you're on target, adding functionality is easy.</i><p>On day zero, Arc let you construct and deploy every aspect of a useful software system (a web app)... but it took a very narrow and direct path to that goal: emphasis on tables, no Unicode support, borrowing some functionality from an existing Scheme environment, etc., etc. That is what PG was trying to convey in his announcement: the strategic plan for Arc's early days is to work on designing a complete skeleton, but not add a lot of flesh.",1202416842

The footnotes would outnumber the paragraphs if not the sentences.<p>Should I link to Alan Kay every time I discuss objects? How is that different? Or for that matter, if someone discusses the signal-to-noise ratio in programming language idioms, must they mention a post I wrote that was popular at the time?<p>And FYI, I have written about Blub and linked to Paul's essay as well as written about Blub without linking to Paul's essay.
