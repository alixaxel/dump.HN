109219,comment,109155,109155,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"verdict. the idea is good, but i think
 you can improve your description and make it more interesting. 
the second improvement is the layout. just by having another digg layout you are putting yourself in a ""us-too"" category. 
an interesting layout would be to have stories placed randownly as squares (like modules) and instead of having them placed from top to bottom you could be creative and increase/dedrease the font size of the letters as it gets more/less votes.

While it has a good community to encourage you and cheer you on, there isn't a sense of urgency to do things nor an easy way to share with people where to go about doing it.<p>Mobtropolis can geolocate photos and scenes, so once someone has done something and posted it, you can see where most people have done it.  Gives a good clue as to where to go do it.",1202150085

109215,comment,109155,109170,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"Of course the obvious solution here is to sort them differently. You don't have to reject anything. Just sort the front page by popularity instead of ""hotness"" and give a link to recently popular. (on a side note, picking someone else's nose is listed 3 different times in the first two pages with the same photo). Or, you could make the top of the page a ""Most Popular of All Time"" box and the start listing the ""hot"" ones under that.<p>Your first thought may be that many of the social news sites sort by recent activity by default. And this is true, but they also have users that check back several times a day. Your site, while interesting and promising, probably will not have that kind of user. Maybe once a week or even once a day.<p>Or another possibility is what I did on my site (ratemystudentrental.com). Sort by what is most useful to first time visitors, but then once the user logs in, make the home page sort by recent activity.<p>Also, while I do think this is a pretty cool idea, I have two other criticisms.<p>1) The design leaves much to be desired. I thought I had been redirected to some static placeholder page, or maybe some subdomain of your blog when I first clicked the link. This is also partially due to the fact that your homepage redirects to mobtropolis.com/scenes/hot, instead of just giving me mobtropolis.com.<p>2) This would be way more freakin' sweet if it integrated with Facebook. You could have an app that pull my ""adventure/dare"" pictures into my Facebook profile. You could also allow users to determine the difficulty of each challenge and give awards to users who compile the most difficulty/popularity points by proving they've accomplished those challenges with photos.",1202150014

The Heros of the Land of Light did hold council, and after many a deliberation decreed that the Battle was to be met with full conviction and the aid of Macro Expansions. And the Battle was fought for twenty and three days and on the morning of the twenty and fourth day, the Beast was slain by a mighty hero of the Light, whose Karma was without parallel - Sir Paul Graham, Marshal of the Closure, General of His Magesty's Symbol Tables, Diviner of the Continuation, and all other Titles held and to be granted by Our Lord Almighty - Lisp - and His Son Who Walked On Earth - Arc.

Of course the experience of using C++ is different than using C++ with knives, that's trivial, and I'm not saying that they are the same language or environment. My point is: the original argument makes the same trick, by making a modification to the language / environment that makes it very unusable... my extension of the argument to blood and knives it's just a way to show that the original argument is using exaggeration.<p>Everything else equal, the shorter program wins.

[1]<p><i>Life experiences</i> is a fuzzy and abstract phrase -- ""challenges"" or ""unusual experiences"" would be better, and a specific mental image like ""strange foods"" or ""something you've never done before"" would be better still.  <i>Document</i> is an abstract phrase -- what you really want to say is ""describe"" or ""photograph"".<p>The help page... is not much help, I'm afraid:<p>""Mobtropolis is a tool to find, map, and share interesting experiences in the local world around you through peer pressure and simple game mechanics.""<p><i>Peer pressure</i> and <i>game mechanics</i>?

""Take a bunch of pictures and share them with the world.""
