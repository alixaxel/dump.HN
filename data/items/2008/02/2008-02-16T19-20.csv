It's the same thing there.<p>It's the anonymity. Combined with a 95% male audience.

117087,comment,116929,116929,0,0,henning,,,"If speed is the overriding concern, see if you can use Berkeley DB, which has ACID transactions and blows away all relational databases in speed. It sounds like your data model may be simple enough for it.<p>You should also consider a mix of both; you could use BDB as a kind of cache used for rapid delivery whereas, say, the relational database could be used for non-time-critical processing and storage or something.",1203190470
117086,comment,116768,116985,0,0,palish,,,"Hackers don't tolerate bad behavior.  They avoid communities that accept mean people (unless they are also mean).<p>Paul probably only visits Reddit to read comments about something he's done. I left the chatroom #lisp because of the assholicism. (Leaving was an excellent decision. Everything about Lisp can be learned from CLHS, SICP, On Lisp, gigamonkeys.com/book, other books, and Google. It takes patience, but you'll learn far more than by asking someone.)<p>Communities are a source of power - if you've built a strong one, you can usually get rich. But they require huge amounts of time. Unless you're working toward a specific goal, it seems best to be a lone wolf (or part of a small team) and to operate without considering what everyone else has to say, or to offer you.<p>I learned to program almost exclusively by asking people and experimenting. It was a mistake to ask people how to do things. You can learn orders of magnitude faster by reading manuals and books than by trying to get someone to help you. Hacker culture isn't necessary, except to feel good about yourself, which isn't necessary. John Carmack knows so much because he spent most of his time in quiet isolation, meditating on problems, not hanging around communities.",1203190470
117085,comment,116768,116985,0,0,yters,,,"I think it's pretty hard to remove nastiness from competition, since it's such an easy 'win.'<p>On a tangent, is competition necessary or even beneficial for progress?  The world today seems to be founded on this idea, but things would be much different if people didn't believe competition was important.  Competition makes products ego based, and I don't think ego based products are the best.  People have to aim beyond themselves and the felt needs of others to make something truly excellent.",1203190161

117083,comment,116929,117081,0,0,kogir,,,"If you find a legitimate bug in SQL Server, you can open a support ticket, and Microsoft will fix it.  Frequently these fixes will make it into the next service pack, or if they're severe, a Windows update.  This is all at no (extra) cost to you.<p>In speed tests I've seen using ODBC be as much as 10x slower than npgsql in talking to PostgreSQL.  I didn't look into why, and just used ADO.Net.",1203189866

117081,comment,116929,117063,0,0,dfranke,,,"> If you go with MySQL or PostgreSQL, be prepared to fix bugs in the ADO connectors from .Net to the database.<p>Likewise for SQL Server and ODBC, but then the bugs are in SQL Server so you can't fix them.  However, .NET has a perfectly good ODBC client library.  Use that, not ADO, to talk to MySQL.",1203189590

That's advice I've heard a lot.<p>The final note about Reddit seems to say the opposite: ""The Reddits pushed so hard against the current that they reversed it"". That is probably incorrect. They found a local maxima in the trend for social news before others spotted it.<p>This doesn't really repudiate anything you say in the essay. But people shouldn't get the idea that just because there is resistance, they are doing something good. There needs to be a reason why the critics fail to see the light for you to claim you're working on an overlooked problem.<p>The trick here is that while you're working on it, you don't know if it something that needs to be solved.",1203189529

117073,comment,116929,116929,0,0,dfranke,,,"It sounds like your dataset will fit comfortably in memcached.  Run that on top of whatever DBMS you trust and whose SQL dialect you prefer to work with.  For me this means Postgre or Oracle, although MySQL 6 looks promising and I might have to drop my grudge against them once it's released.  SQL Server 2005 is very buggy and sooner or later it will bite you in terrible ways.<p>Bear in mind when you take this advice that the DBMSs I dislike the most are also the ones I have the most experience with, so it's possible that Postgre and Oracle are just as bad, and I just haven't discovered it yet :-)<p>Don't store technical indicators in your database; compute them on-the-fly.  Memoize them if necessary, but it's probably better not to since I don't think you'll be CPU-bound and the added latency will be negligible.<p>If you're dealing with live quotes, don't store them in your database.  Just keep them in memcached and re-fetch them if your server goes down.  Do all your DB writes at once, at the end of the day after the market closing bell.
