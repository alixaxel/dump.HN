Shifting where some of the computation takes place can help you get over some serious scaling problem.<p>Case study from past experience: imagine a nested commenting system such as this. Imagine it with 10x the data and 20x the usage. By switching from building everything on the server and sending a massive html file, one could simply request a json file on load and then build the comments dynamically on the client. An architecture shift such as this would result in a serious improvement for network bandwidth, cpu, and ram.",1202500645

112278,comment,112199,112231,0,0,DocSavage,,,"You'd also want to differentiate types of challenges and solutions by whether they were using base language, base lang + libraries, or anything available to language.  I think its different saying I can solve a challenge with a little hacking in a language, and saying I can solve a challenge importing a nifty library then use a few DSL commands.  On the other hand, if we're just trying to gauge productivity using a language, the ease of incorporating open source solutions (even written in other languages) should be important.",1202499592

Aside from the stupid notion that complex == funky GUI widgets, it dismisses not only great AJAX frameworks but the Adobe Flex rich internet app building tools.  Heck, with Adobe AIR you <i>are</i> making a desktop app that can live in a browser <i>or</i> the desktop.  Rich text box controls?  How about embedding FCKeditor, YUI's editor, or any of the other AJAX text editor components.<p>""And then you have to host this. Once you grow big, you will need a full time system administrator to manage all of this, the way Fog Creek and 37Signals both do.""<p>Right.

It's the only language I've used in which I found static types to be worth it (I don't count C, as its type system is badly broken, and iss only there to counter some of the language's runtime limitations).<p>If your problem can be presented as advanced data structures, it's really the right tool for the job. Unless if your problem is purely functional, then maybe in Haskell would do better, but we're talking about a pretty narrow niche.<p>When you design an application, you can generally shift complexity from the algorithm to the structuring of data, and vice versa. It's better to put complexity into data, as they're easier to debug, and that's even much truer in OCaml.<p>There's one very cool feature in Haskell that ought to make it into OCaml, though: classes (which are almost unrelated to the homonym OO concept).",1202498148

112261,comment,112215,112250,0,0,pchristensen,,,"For practical purposes, I agree with the original author that there are things that can be done on the desktop that can't be done on the browser, but not the other way around.  This is just a simple extension of the fact that the user has the same computer and the same internet connection, but in a browser-based app, you don't have access to all the computer's resources.  Therefore, you have less overall power available and there are things that theoretically can't be done.  If you have unlimited bandwidth and transfer speeds, then there is no difference.<p>And there's nothing you couldn't do with a desktop app, if for no other reason that you could ""Greenspun"" a full browser into your desktop app to include anything that theoretically couldn't be done without a browser.",1202497996

112252,comment,111956,112219,0,0,iamwil,,,"Given the scenario you've mentioned, sure, it doesn't make sense at to use something like erlang.  This scenario is where a job takes longer the more you split it up.<p>So it would be kinda like if I was a rolling a 10 meter (radius) snowball up myself and it takes me 1 hour, but if I split up the job amongst 9 other friends to get another 10m snowball, it would take each of us 1 hour instead of just 1/10 of a hour to roll up a tenth of that in volume (a 4.6m radius snowball)<p>But if it doesn't take longer to do 1/10th of the job if I split the job up 10 times, then erlang would be a good fit.  There are problems that cater to that, and those that don't.  Pick the problems that do for this technique.  These are the embarrassingly parallel problems that I mentioned earlier.<p>So yes, just because you have multi-core, doesn't guarantee speedup.    However, if the speed of a single CPU caps or slows in the future, and the number of cores increase on a chip, then us programmers have better have a good way to take advantage of that in our programs.  Erlang and its actor model is one way.",1202497400
