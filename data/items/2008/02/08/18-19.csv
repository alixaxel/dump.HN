112249,comment,112109,112109,0,0,showerst,,,"I think as opposed to looking at how your hosting should be structured, you need to pay more attention to how your application is structured.<p>As carpal said, where are your bottlenecks? Is your app structured with one Web server talking to 1 or more replicated database servers, or multiple 'App' servers that can all take many requests or ... ?<p>In my (rather limited) experience the most common scaling problem for apps is database performance, so it may be in your best interest to get a host where you can change your DB config to up the (rather conservative) default resource limits. (And make sure to take a good hard look at your indexing and queries first)<p>If you're having RAM or CPU problems, you may just need a beefier server, and if it's bandwidth or IO then perhaps a scalable service like AWS may be a good solution.<p>AFAIK The key for most small growing apps is structuring so that your bottlenecks are linked to sharded databases, so that you can just throw more hardware (virtual or physical) at the problem when you hit some limit of users, possibly even on the fly.<p>I think i may be wrong about this now, but at least from early trials it seemed like most people using S3 and AWS were using it more for backups and backend processing/data mining, not on the fly work, due to data integrity concerns.<p>I'd also recommend eventually moving to a more full-featured host, once your business can sweat the $300-500/server a month fees you'll run into with a host like Rackspace.<p>Having great backups and the ability to get someone on the phone at 3am with no hold is essential when your server the only thing paying your bills =P.",1202496954

(I'm not sure whether or not it would allow Arc at this point, since widespread use is a criterion for inclusion -- but there's nothing stopping someone from writing the programs for comparison.)<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?t...</a><p>Note that the shootout compares code size using gzipped size -- which should be even more generous to Lisps than PG's token count, due to the easily compressible parens.  However, Lisp and Scheme actually do quite poorly by this metric, even ranking below some statically typed languages, while Python, Perl, and Ruby do particularly well.  I'd love to see where Arc would rank, considering that it was designed with brevity in mind.",1202496591

See if I write a program in C (which for some mysterious reason doesnt use threads) and run it on a single core and it runs in 1 sec.

112214,comment,112129,112129,0,0,paulgb,,,"I wrote a few projects in OCaml, and it's a great language <i>if</i> it suits the problem, but it can get in the way otherwise.<p>What it's great for is anything that involves the manipulation of lists or trees - one of my projects in OCaml was a simple computer algebra system, and OCaml was <i>great</i> for that. I had previously written a super-simple interpreter for a made-up programming language in Java, and in comparison OCaml is <i>way</i> more expressive for that type of project. I also wrote a fractal renderer in OCaml and found the expresivity helpful, although the library support was not great so I ended up writing my own bitmap library. It's also nice to be able to break out of the purely-functional paradigm, because there are times when a problem is better suited for imperative programming.<p>Another project I did in OCaml was a web proxy, and it turned out to not be a great idea. The libraries were confusing and in the end I wished I used python.<p>So it really comes down to the project. OCaml is very cool conceptually, and it is great for certain tasks, and not so great for others. (For what it's worth, I've only been using OCaml intermittently for about a year, so I am no expert.)",1202493988
