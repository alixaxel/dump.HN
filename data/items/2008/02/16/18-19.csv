I should have looked more into PostgreSQL, but didn't.<p>In your case, it sounds like MySQL should work just fine. For fast response times, just partition the data across a lot of cheap servers that can keep it all in RAM.  This approach lends itself to a free database.  That said, speed will be affected much more by what pre-processing you do before inserting the data (to optimize lookups), and how you design your schema than by your database vendor choice.<p>If you go with MySQL or PostgreSQL, be prepared to fix bugs in the ADO connectors from .Net to the database.  I've used PostgreSQL with .Net and npgsql needs some work.  Perhaps MySQL connectors are better.<p>I'd start with PostgreSQL or MySQL and only switch to SQL Server 2005 if you run into problems.  The switching cost won't be that high if you don't use stored procedures and stick to using ADO.Net generic functionality.<p>Microsoft has been a great partner and their licensing model hasn't caused us any problems, so don't be afraid to go with them if they're the right choice.  You'll take some heat for it though ;)",1203188164

Why shouldn't someone say ""I'm not likely to get accepted into YC, so I'll spend my time working on my good idea instead of filling out the YC application form""?",1203188063

117056,comment,116976,117045,0,0,cperciva,,,"Such statistics are useful because they give people insight as to how likely they are to be accepted, and thus whether it's worth applying.  Just as the OP was wondering about his chances of being accepted as a sole founder, I can easily imagine someone thinking ""gee, I'm 30 years old... there's probably no point applying... but I have a PhD and pg's statistics show that applicants with PhDs are far more likely to be accepted, so maybe I should apply after all"".",1203187182

117046,comment,116973,116973,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Somehow I don't think it's that important anymore. The service seems to be far more important. But it probably depends on what kind of application you are building. Here's my take.<p>If it is a once-in-a-while application, then memorable is good. If it's daily, then it doesn't matter. This is because users will rely on the quickest path from recall. Anything that is written to long term memory will be quick, and anything you use on a daily basis will fall into this category.<p>I would say news.ycombinator.com isn't the most catchy name, but it doesn't matter because I access it regularly.<p>instantdomainsearch.com, however, is good because I use it once in a while. simpleweather.com also.",1203185149
