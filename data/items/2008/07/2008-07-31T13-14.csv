I'm working on something cool that attempts to solve problems 1 and 2, plus what I think is currently the biggest problem with email (and every other form of messaging): incredibly lousy interaction design. I'll launch it here in a few days; I'm eager to get feedback and maybe some technical help from the community.",1217512740

Erlang is designed for cluster environments, and the cookie method is lightweight and good enough for that sort of environment.<p>If you want better security, unfortunately you have to roll it yourself. You could write a message router that tunnels Erlang messages over TCP, and apply some sort of authentication process to that.<p>Erlang applications that are exposed to the Internet do not allow Erlang connections from the outside, but rather implement a custom socket protocol and only use Erlang distribution internally.<p>I hear that they're planning on adding better security in future versions, but I don't know any details about that.",1217512456

Instead of ""don't do dull work"" (which might translate to ""don't do what you are asked to do""), I say you do the stuff you hate as fast as possible.  Engage it with zeal, and get it the heck over with as soon as possible.<p>If you avoid doing stuff you hate, the cloud of having to do it lingers over you; you are not really avoiding it, you are prolonging it.  Just get it over with and move on.  You'll deliver it on time (or earlier), and will have gotten past the hurdle.",1217512386
