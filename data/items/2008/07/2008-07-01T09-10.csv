232833,comment,232622,232815,0,0,joshuaxls,,,"I agree wholeheartedly with pretty much everything you've said here. There is no magic ""Vim cheat sheet"" for new Vim users. To understand the power of Vim, you have to understand the power of its parts. It reminds me of playing with K'NEX as a kid: you either learn how to build magnificent things by learning how pieces combine to form powerful designs, or you blindly follow the built-in diagrams for prefabricated creations (not really understanding how they came to be) and then dump it a few days later out of boredom.<p>That said, I up-voted this submission solely because it's showing off Vim. That's what I try to do with the programmers I meet -- evangelize about Vim.<p>I'll never forget the first time I saw an ancient Vim user hacking away at code. It seriously <i>blew</i> me away, and I knew that I had to learn it. Via a combination of :help and O'Reilly's ""Learning the Vi Editor"", I learned. Four years later (and that's young for a Vim user), I'll never look back.<p>Point being: you can't learn via a cheat sheet. Dive into Vim, starting from the basics.",1214905337

Its too much about the business/marketing/lawyers etc. That's important, but they need to find a PG equivalent who will get his/her hands dirty in the product and technology aspects. I've given this feedback to some of the VCs who are involved with the program.<p>BTW, the people behind the program, especially some of the VCs, are great. So with a few tweaks, I think they are in good shape.",1214904414

And depending on how I pack, and if I don't buy a new bag, I'd have to use a sleeve, which would either count as my personal item (then what happens to my purse? :( ) or would go in the carryon, which is my main problem anyway since I hate taking it out in the first place.<p>Also I wonder if this would apply to any electronics one would be dragging through security, not just laptops. I'd like to keep my wii in my bag because it's one less thing to pull out and repack.<p>Ughhh headache :( This just hassles the people who fly a lot, nobody else.",1214902856
