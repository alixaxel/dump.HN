Furthermore, you get the added bonus that if you set things up right, you can have very similar environments on your desktop and server.<p>And even on your desktop, there are good reasons to have more control than Apple might allow you to have.

Hard to ignore big flashing lights that say the build is broken or large burn-down charts that show the iteration is off the rails.<p>But if you can't get all co-located, or if you're forced to have a team that's too large, or if your Product Owner is actually a committee of seven, etc -- there are good reasons for using some kind of tool on occasion.",1215964324

Most hot web services work only because they are 'free' for most users, scarcity doesn't help Youtube, Facebook,or Twitter.  Think about all the pain caused with every Twitter outage.  The early adopters simply get the 'I've been here longer than you' status when you display publicly how long they've been involved with your service.",1215962980
245158,comment,244826,244971,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"There is a moral statement to be made about sexual equality, but it is not the same statement that is made about income or intelligence. Various political groups find it useful to conflate the following types of equality:<p>1. Equality under the law/Equal rights as humans -- the law should treat men and women equally. ""It is wrong to punish men more severely for crimes than women.""<p>2. ""Societal"" equality -- the attitudes and viewpoints of mainstream society should consider men and women to be equal. ""It is wrong to believe that women should have children.""<p>3. Statistical equality -- men and women must be statistically identical for a politically useful class of statistics (e.g., intelligence). ""Anyone who speculates that women are not as smart as/have different variance/etc is a sexist.""<p>4. Equality of outcome -- men and women should achieve the same outcomes, for a politically useful class of endeavors. ""Professors in every field should be 50% male, 50% female.""<p>#1 and #2 are moral questions, #3 is a scientific one. #4 is a consequence of #1,#2 and #3. The moral statements are hardly rubbish, they are perfectly legitimate moral claims (I even agree with #1). The bullshit is trying to claim that 1 == 2 == 3 == 4.",1215962967

VersionOne (paid only)
Jira (paid only, needs plugins)<p>Banana Scrum is free and looks good. It was talked about on HackerNews awhile back.<p>After experimenting with lots of this software, my team has reverted to the whiteboard for Iteration Goals, and sticky notes for the iteration's tasks. We've found that you can't beat the tactile qualities of post-it notes.<p>Items in a software package can be easy to ignore if you don't manage it closely. But if you look at the whiteboard and see more sticky notes in the ""pending"" column than there should be, you instantly know something is wrong and can dive in.",1215962814

245152,comment,245087,245087,0,0,felixmar,,,"The ""white bicycle"" concept dates from 1965 and was proposed by Provo, a Dutch counter-culture movement. In a manifest (see <a href=""http://www.gramschap.nl/provo/chrono/prpk5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gramschap.nl/provo/chrono/prpk5.jpg</a>) they announced that they would place a white painted bike in the city center of Amsterdam which would become public property. The goal was to counter pollution of the city but it was also a statement against the increase of consumerism. After they placed the bike it was immediately confiscated by the police because it didn't have a lock.",1215962620

Herb Sandler (of moveon.org) is the example given and a frightening one at that. He's a hard leftist, and is using his personal fortune to fund propaganda operations.<p>I always wondered what would happen to the dead trade of journalism once newspapers were gone. I guess I know now. The mild constraints that the marketplace put on pinko media owners is finished, replaced with direct orders from the Sandlers.",1215962447

I switched blogging software so that I could have out of the box Disqus integration.<p>I hope they take their competitive advantage (they're just <i>a little bit better</i> than the alternatives) and sustain it.<p>FriendFeed and others are catching up, but I suspect with their heavy hitting VCs guiding them, they'll stay ahead of the pack.<p>I particularly like their open attitude about downtime and service quality. When they screw up, they post about it on their blog, apologize, and explain how they're getting better. This appears to be one item in the recipe for success.",1215962400

I suggest that the Internet boom would have created three families of tools fo rbuilding web applications:<p>Scripting (Perl, PHP, &c.), C++, and Microsoft.<p>Which one do you think most corporations would be using?<p>I agree that giving shit away isn't a source of revenue, but it can be a good way to play defense. In Sun's case, Java seriously hampered Microsoft's vision of the Internet future. If there was no Java, I believe Sun wouldn't exist today, because Microsoft would have taken 100% of the market for corporations creating public-facing web applications.<p>Sure, Sun's in rough shape.
