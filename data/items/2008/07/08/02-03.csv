I do find myself using it on many of the little pieces of code I write before I ever try to integrate it into the full app. It is just a lot faster to verify each little piece separately does exactly what you want and then connect all the pieces together, than just manually starting from the beginning of integration and seeing how far it makes it before a bug takes halts the progress. Working this way when you integrate the pieces it is awesome to find that most of the time it works all the way through the first time.",1215485951

I'm not saying he's innocent or anything, and clearly murder is a bad thing (which sounds trite and insensitive), but it just seems like a really bad move on his part.

Being convicted is only part of the process - there's appeals, and appeals, and more appeals.<p>And again, apologies if I sound insensitive.

239448,comment,239323,239323,0,0,bporterfield,,,"Very interesting post.<p>To the point that levels of complexity can be hidden by an external production pyramid:<p>Encapsulating complexity through a 'pyramid' of vendors is the evolutionary norm for all complicated systems. ""I don't want to harvest vegetables, boil down some bone to make chicken stock, collect herbs & spices, throw it all in a pot and simmer for 4 hours - I'll just go to the store and buy some soup instead!""<p>This has always been the norm in software as well. From bits to file systems to grep and on and on, software is always built on building blocks that abstract complexities. We're starting to see this with software at levels that ease the burden of maintaining entire systems or networks(Amazon & Google,etc).<p>However, these abstractions away from complexities do not ease the burden of creating new software, just as lacquer and wood providers do not make it any simpler to create a warehouse that produces pencils. You can have all the supplies in the world but won't succeed until you know how to put them together, and in general putting them together in an efficient, useful manner is the hardest problem. There's no barrier to entry when it comes to providing a new web app - all the technology exists already, and is fairly well maitained! The barrier to entry is in combining the technology to create something new that is needed. Which brings me to my second point -<p>Regarding the articles conclusion: You had me till the 'out of the crisis'. If I follow correctly, the argument is that we should charge a fee for utilization of the utility that is software, not for the bits themselves. What this means is that I'm going to pay a cent every time I use my web browser. But this also means that my web browser creators, and, well, they're gonna pay .5 cents each time the browser is used for whoever provided the C++ libraries(or whatever it's built in). Who in turn is going to pay .2 cents for each use of....and so on. If the plan is to create a system that facilitates a broadening or evolution of the ""roots"" or building blocks of software, this will never work.<p>Here's why I'm not going to pay for the roots - we're already at a point in software where the 'roots' I really need are built, open-sourced and free. Or close to free. And for the components that aren't readily available - I simply refuse not to build them.<p>It's not that there's no incentive to provide more roots, it's that I don't want to pay for their use each time my software runs! Screw that. I'll spend an extra week implementing it myself, bugs be damned, and I'll collect all the revenue!<p>At least, that's the way the thinking usually goes.",1215484065

It also routinely used in custom network protocols, e.g. IPC or RPC ones. Anyone outside of the XML fanboy club is aware of these things :-)<p>File format wise, it's hardly a rocket science too. When developers re-implement something, it's only natural to recycle an established implementation element. Changing it <i>just</i> for the sake of being different from another vendor is frankly quite dumb.<p>So I'd be careful with bold ""rip-off"" statements.

239445,comment,239276,239391,0,0,neilk,,,"Pickle, Marshal, and JSON are all ways of describing the kind of data structures used by Perl, Python, Javascript, and so on. They are way more flexible than Protocol Buffers -- you can have arbitrarily nested structures of arbitrary length. The format of the messages are basically self-describing. By which I mean that if they want to put an array there, they just put a '[' in and away we go.<p>I think XDR describes fixed-format structures. I don't know anything about DCE.<p>As described above, Thrift is a clone of Protocol Buffers.<p>Thrift and PB are a lot like XDR or god forbid, CORBA, but with a few twists. They define message templates for how to parse and emit relatively simple binary structures, which are then compiled into RPC clients and servers. PBs are cross-platform, at least by Google standards: they work with both C++ and Java very well. So you get the speed and convenience of making RPC calls with binary data structures in a mixed C++/Java environment.<p>But the best thing about PBs is that the message structure can evolve. If a message suddenly has a new field the receiver can't use, the receiver doesn't panic or read in garbage, unlike many other binary formats. So you can upgrade clients and servers in a gradual manner, without any downtime. This is what makes PBs especially suited to cloud computing.",1215483881
