A highly monochronic culture would be Germany; things happen one at a time, from start to finish, where a new thing starts.  A highly polychronic culture would be a lot of latin cultures, where whatever is most important that second takes precedence, no matter when you started it (this is usually determined socially; family>customer, for example).<p>Most cultures are more complex than that, though.  Japanese business tends to be highly polychronic in the planning stages, where a consensus must be reached and all the time in the world is taken to reach it.

If you don't believe that the market needs a central technician for it to run properly (I don't, but I'm in the minority), then I'm pretty sure a modern economy could be run on currency backed by almost any commodity.<p>What most people fear and distrust about fiat currency is putting one legal monopoly in charge of such an important part of the economy. It's too much power. A gold-backed currency takes that power out of the hands of any one man.<p>I advocate that we should use whatever currency the market chooses.

253662,comment,253456,253601,0,0,nickb,,,"OK... there's a bit of comparing apples and oranges here. Macintosh is a proprietary <i>hardware</i> platform and MacOS X requires it to run. You can run Windows and Linux on the same hardware because both of them support it and VM software easily uses hardware facilities through virtualization. VMWare and Parallels do not emulate everything.<p>So it makes sense that you can't run MacOS X on non-Apple hardware since it was never meant to do that. On the other hand, Apple supports Windows XP and Vista on its hardware and have written a ton of drivers to do just that. Linux folks have done the same and they have written drivers for Mac hardware. Sure, there are such things as Hackintoshes but they have a ton of issues (sometimes fans don't work. graphics doesn't work, drivers missing etc).<p>For Apple to do what you want, they'd have to license VMWare and other VM vendors internal Mac specs so that VMWare can emulate those on a machine that doesn't have them.

Why not just keep Rubyforge central?  It's worked well so far.<p>A few reasons.<p>Foremost is this idea of an ""official"" RubyGem.  What does that word mean?  It means that if I disappear, so does my project.  If I lose interest, my project dies.  With larger projects this doesn't happen so often.  It would be hard for Rails or MooTools to just vanish.  But for smaller projects, which are legion, this is a constant.  People lose interest - often right when you become interested.  Let's call it Defunkt's Law.<p>Defeating Defunkt's Law is one of the primary motivations behind GitHub.  Let the Internet decide the 'official' version of smaller projects.  If you Google 'mash' and my version comes up before mbleigh's, guess what?  Mine is the official version.  We have all these tools for deciding what's good content on the web, why not apply them to code?<p>sr's git-wiki is a great example of this.  Google ""git-wiki"" and al3x's version comes up - a fork with distinct features.  The market has spoken.<p>It's true that within GitHub, finding the ""blessed"" or ""official"" or valuable fork is not the easiest thing in the world.  But we're working towards this goal - which project in this tree is the most interesting?  Which is clearly a feature fork?  Which are just impulse forks?<p>While entropy can seem scary, we believe the future of development is distributed.",1216761224
