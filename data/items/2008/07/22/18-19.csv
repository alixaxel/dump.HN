Among people who use them, I suspect that the next major predictor of success would be adaptability. Confirmation bias is the opposing force: once we form a model, we are biased towards it, and tend to overlook contradictory evidence.<p>One tactic that increases adaptability is not forming a model until you actually have to; this avoids confirmation bias.<p>You're also right about the nature of the test: as an experiment, it does show that presence of generative models predicts success.
