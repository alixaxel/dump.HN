244929,comment,53327,53327,0,0,jdavid,,,"So I thought I would update this post.<p>I am now living in the bay area and here are some hard numbers<p>our 3brdm is $3350 a month, and it fits 4 people snug but comfortably. So that is about $1200 a bedroom.<p>Internet is included, but you might expect to pay a bit more than $50 a month.<p>food well, eating at Mel's Dinner will run you $12 for a meal, and about $2.50 for a drink, and another $2 for tip, or about $17 for a dinner meal. Milk is between $4-$8 a gallon, and ground beef is $3 a pound.  Cereal is about the same cost, and Starbuck's Coffee,  is the same price in SF as it is in MKE or Chicago.  Bagels at Noah's will run you about $2.50 for a bagel with cream cheese, and lunch will run about $8 a person without getting a drink.<p>You will be using a laundry mat, and it will cost you $2 a load to wash, and $1-$2 to dry them, so $3-4 in total at the brainwash laundry mat.<p>Beer is about $5-$6 in most of SF, but last night I was in the mission drinking micro brews for $3-4 a beer. On another occasion in north beach I paid $11 for a beer in a plastic cup.<p>The AMC theater on VanNess is $10.50 a person and matinées are $8.50 a person.<p>The bus will take you anywhere for $1.50 a trip, with a transfer that is good for ~2 hours+ depending on how the driver tears the transfer ticket.  The BART is about $5 to Berkley, or SFO and a bit more if you want to go to Freemont or to Palo Alto, etc..  CalTrain is a bit more expensive and runs about $10 for a trip between Sunnyvale and like SF.  Taking a cab between the Mission and say ""the Richmond"" will run about $10-20, and where I live its about $10.<p>Oh, parking is a bitch.  Expect to pay $200-$400 a month more for rent or a separate parking space.<p>Living in SF you will also save money for heating and cooling costs, because the weather is so temperate.<p>There are at least 5-10 tech events a week, so you will have to choose wisely which ones you are going to go to and  during the week its not pleasant getting between Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, and Mountain View and SF proper.<p>Living in the Mission is probably the cheapest and has the best transportation options for a tech entrepreneur, but pacific/laurel heights and the richmond have their advantages too.  potrero hill is a great area but pricier than others.<p>if you are going to try to save on rent by being a bit farther out in the city, make sure you are near a bus line that runs regularly, at night many of the buses really reduce their schedule, but for example lines like the 38 will run fairly late with 7 min intervals, and then 20 min in the late night.",1215928415

244923,comment,244826,244916,0,0,tx,,,"It doesn't work. It's enormously difficult to construct a solid study with one properly isolated variable that's the subject in question. Even much, much, much easier tasks as exploring effects of smoking have been done over and over again, only to be declared invalid by yet another variable not accounted for. Statistics is hard to get right, this is why there are so many jokes about it. And trying to come up with a ""proof"" of <i>anything</i> by separating everybody into just two groups is idiotic.<p>Yes, it makes one feel good about oneself, and can score you some votes if you're a politician, but it's a waste of time - it doesn't prove anything and only reminds blacks and women that they're ""in a group"", i.e. must be different by some criteria. This is what I call ""recursive racism/sexism"".<p>It is not OK to say ""first black president is a great achievement of America"". The real achievement would have happened if nobody even noticed the color of his skin, you never heard of CNN anchormen talking about Bush's eye color, haven't you?",1215927907

244916,comment,244826,244891,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Breaking things into groups allows for contrast, and to discover patterns. Instead of a program which might allow a small proportion of students to better at maths (with better teaching perhaps), this could lead to an improvement in the mathematical ability of 50% of the population. That has huge economic and societal implications.<p>The worst thing about breaking things into groups is members of groups other than the target seem to be simply blind to the importance of it.",1215926978

So the use of the name Apple for a computer company doesn't in any way restrict other companies from entering that market. But naming something after the offline function that it implements - that does affect other companies trying to enter that market.<p>I.e. if instead of Apple they'd chosen PC Computers - it likely would not have been a valid trademark.

It's the most usable and creative city on the planet and big part of it is the perfect grid system of its streets and subways. Wayfinding and transportation is a snap and there's an art gallery, museum, school, park or something else inspiring on practically every corner. Heck, even the libraries are awesome - the main branch of the ny public library is so beautiful that they film movies and host weddings in it, and its backyard is Bryant Park, which has its own website and been carpeted with free wifi since before it was cool.<p>The effect of combining a quick and easy to use public transporation system with an amazing amount of technical and artistic talent is that it lowers the activitation energy of participation to almost zero. You don't have a good excuse to not check out some cool new gallery, exhibit or user group meeting, or simply hang out with a friend on short notice, because the cost in time and energy is as close to zero as you can get.

244909,comment,244826,244891,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Why do we always break ourselves down</i><p>Identity politics. Follow the money. If you can get a person in authority to declare, ""We are all equal, given 'fair' conditions,"" then you have an opportunity to make the following argument:<p><pre><code>  1. Men and women are equal, when society treats women fairly.
  2. Men and women make different incomes.
  3. Therefore, society is not treating women fairly.
  4. Corrective action is needed.
</code></pre>
This is a standard move in identity politics, and you will see it whenever two groups are different. Different people = different outcomes. But the vast bulk of people, including scientists, have been trained from birth to say, ""All men [sic] are created equal"".<p>Once you decide that society isn't treating a group fairly, it is time to correct that.

244896,comment,244259,244760,0,0,tortilla,,,"Actually if it weren't for the actions of Fannie/Freddie, the mortgage crisis would have needed to be dealt with sooner. By F/F taking on all the toxic loans that the mortgage banks wanted to dump, they allowed the problems to increase in size and scope thus prolonging the bubble much longer. All this quasi-government intervention does is to distort the true market. I want transparency in government and I want it in business. When you allow these mortgage banks to fail on their own (no safety nets), you clear the system of inefficient players and allow the market to adjust.<p>I'm all for free enterprise. You take risks, you make some smart moves, and you profit. You take another risk, you make some mistakes, you lose, and you can start over (and learn). You don't keep doing it like these banks did (I don't even know if you can call them mistakes, more like reckless disregard). Like degenerate gamblers who got their line-of-credit extended, they double-downed and lost.<p>Think about it, the average US citizen's safety net is quite small. Get sick, get dropped by insurance, lose your job and you're basically on your own. We're told to buck up, stop whining, take responsibility, and work harder. Fine, but don't tell me these companies need our sympathy and help. They profited handsomely during the run-up by making risky loans and lobbying for tougher bankruptcy laws.<p>There's no easy answer. Bail them out, the dollar plummets and the economy goes to shit. No bailout, the financial market freezes up and the economy goes to shit.  I'm leaning towards no more bailouts. At least then we might be able to address the root cause, which I think was reckless risk taking and financial engineering, with the perpetuated belief that the US government (tax payers) would be the ultimate safety net.<p>Here's a good link regarding what the mortgage market might look like in the near future:
