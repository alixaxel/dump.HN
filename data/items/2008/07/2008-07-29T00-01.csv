For example, if your pop-up blocker had any intelligence to it, one approach might involve building the equivalent of adblock for IE, which I suspect would sell about as well as a popup blocker pre-builtin.  Then again, I'm not sure how much of a company one could expect to build around a simple pop-up blocker, so calling yourself a company is a bit of a stretch -- it's really just a hobby.<p>No need to apologize for being a tool, this is the Internet and it is assumed.",1217293144

259866,comment,259257,259818,0,0,newt0311,,,"Correction: Nifty unnecessary hack. Why not just write a function which returns another function that performs the SQL statement? That is <i>almost</i> but not quite exactly what the decorators do and it would accomplish exactly the same goal without clobbering python syntax. An even better solution would just be a function that executes an arbitrary SQL query. That also has the benefit that it can be easily wrapped and easily debugged unlike the current mess.<p>examples:<p>create_sql_function(query): return a function that executes query.<p>execute_sql(query): execute a query.<p>Usage:<p>foo = create_sql_function('SELECT a, b FROM bar;')
zzz(self, c, d):

259858,comment,259756,259835,0,0,william42,,,"The flaw in the system isn't that The Godfather was bumped down.  The flaw is that people are rating the Godfather down to the point at which it changed its ranking with respect to other movies.<p>And you're right, it's not a major flaw for a movie ranking system.  But let's suppose something similar to the IMDB system(which would be an approval/range voting system) is used in an election, and the first place gets President, the second choice getting Veep.  With an election, you don't have real-time rankings like IMDB, but you have something similar--polls.  And that's even worse, since there's a few points of inaccuracy.  Strategically worded polls could change the results of an election.",1217292046

It's not like the author was comparing Cuil to Powerset, for example, and illustrating how Cuil failed where Powerset succeeded.<p>Sure, the service seems to have a ways to go. Fine, and there's nothing wrong with saying so. But the title is the worst kind of armchair quarterbacking, all criticism with absolutely zero objectivity.<p>I'd say the author has shown us how NOT to write a review: failing to compare Cuil to other startups competing with Google and failing to suggest what they ought to have done instead.",1217291010

I would call it a minor blip. I mean, ultimately the system recommends what movies to watch. If someone isn't going to watch the Godfather now that it's ranked #3 instead of #1, then the person is flawed, not the system.<p>Otherwise, this was an interesting post. I have been astonished that TDK is #1. Didn't realize people were also downvoting other movies to keep it there.",1217289985

If he has really good skills in a priority area and if purposed country has a lack of qualified workers in that area, he has a chance to get a work permit. In this case all depends on his skills. And it's not ""pessimistic"" point of view, rather it's realistic.<p>Actually I don't know much about NZ immigration policy, but in some countries(CZ for example) you can find a job on the spot, in other countries(for example in Australia) you have to prove your skills via some tests and only <i>after</i> you have appropriate number of points you get a work permit.",1217289972
