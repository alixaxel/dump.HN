251198,comment,251141,251165,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I think it's okay to be disgusted by what spoken of somewhere, and aware of the harm it can potentially cause, yet guard fiercely the ability to say it.<p>I don't think freedom of speech should be axiomatic, though. Firstly, I take a realist stance -- it isn't treated that way by the world, there are some things you could say that would make your life much worse. Second, it seems that freedom of speech is a good heuristic due to how awful the alternative is: forcibly inflicting silence on people. But there are many degrees between speech and glorified, internationally accessible scum, and that's often what ends up on the internet -- I'm not sure it deserves much more glorification.",1216540100
251197,comment,250704,250946,0,0,swombat,,,"See, even the idea that original ideas are not original is not original. If only Borges was around to help guide us, we'd probably found that Nietzsche got this idea, in slightly different form, from an 18th century academician, who in turn was able to lift it from the writings of a Russian monk, who in turn found it in a little-known greek play.<p>From André Maurois' preface to Borges' Labyrinths (about Borges):<p><i>His sources are innumerable and unexpected. Borges has read everything, and especially what nobody reads any more: the Cabalists, the Alexandrine Greeks, medieval philosophers. His erudition is not profound - he asks of it only flashes of lightning and ideas - but it is vast. For example, Pascal wrote: 'Nature is an infinite sphere whose centre is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere.' Borges sets out to hunt down this metaphor through the centuries. He finds it in Giordano Bruno (1584): 'We can assert with certainty that the universe is all centre, or that the centre of the universe is everywhere and its circumference nowhere.' But Giordano Bruno had been able to read in a twelfth-century French theologian, Alain de Lille, a formulation borrowed from the Corpus Hermeticum (third century): 'God is an intelligible sphere whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.'</i>",1216540086
251196,comment,250797,251168,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I don't see how. I presume mice only register changes in position, and not changes in orientation.  That's all you can measure with a ball so I presume that's all that is measured with optical mice.  So if you were for instance to hold the top of the mouse in place and rotate the rest of the mouse around that point, you would definitely register a change in position with the optical sensor, and I don't know how you would do this in software.  So the mouse won't ever behave exactly like it would if the sensor were at the front.",1216539975

251194,comment,250930,251107,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"What do you mean by ""scientific""?  It seems like you mean ""propositional"".<p>""Ice cream is nice"" is not nonsensical.  It falls into a category of utterances that actually say something about the speaker rather than the thing indicated.  ""Nice"" is shorthand for ""deemed by the speaker to be of high value"".  It can definitely be true or false.  However, due to the clever formulation, if I disagree with you, and say ""Ice cream is not nice,"" I'm not really disagreeing with you, but rather stating something about myself.<p>That's not to say that there's no such thing as nonsense statements.  But, to the extent that you're really doing philosophy and not just making word salad, philosophy has no place for nonsense.",1216539879

Maybe I'm being closed-minded about child pornography, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.  At any rate, vaksel, you're totally right.  May I add that freedom is not about being able to say what others want you to say, but being able to say what they <i>don't</i> want you to say.

251192,comment,250704,251144,0,0,jerry5,,,"Just put the offer on ycombinator's - or another reputable entity's - web site for everyone to see. However the ""call me"" part is half joking; while I have ideas to tackle some of those problems, especially the economic foundations of them, they are not amenable to funding by ycombinator or similar entities. The smaller problems being purely practical such as not being - or wanting to be - in that funny country of yours over there, the larger ones being that it's a contradiction in terms to use an old economic model (invenstments, corporate structures, sell-outs) to create a new economic model. Look at the file-sharing example quoted: A P2P network technology, even one that created economic benefits for its participants, such as musicians and listeners, would never get VC funding since there's no central entity to siphon the profits off.",1216539818

The scrolling and the keyboard will get fixed.<p>...One thing I thought was especially strange about the keyboard was the arrow keys (from the ""More OpenMoko Train Wrecking"" video, showing off the Qtopia interface).

251189,comment,251065,251158,0,0,rahulgarg,,,"Well actually one of the reasons for the slowness in the video (disclaimer : dont own the phone, basing slowness on video) is because its processor is very slow. Its using a 400MHz ARM9 vs lets say 400MHz ARM11 on Nokia N95 or what is rumored to be 600MHz ARM11 in iPhone.<p>edit : That should mean that the N95 has at least twice as powerful processor as freerunner and the iphone maybe even 3x faster processor. IMO the processor chosen was just plain wrong given the goal of producing a smartphone. They should have chosen a faster SoC and forgone the GPS and accelerometers.",1216539386
251188,comment,250704,251126,0,0,swombat,,,"Oh, for sure, and to be fair, my response was not meant to be a rigorous logical statement, since it was in response to a jest about Sandman comics :-) However, I felt there was some truth to it so I defended it anyway.<p>I'm quite comfortable with the idea (original or not) that opposing concepts can both be true simultaneously. Your opposite generalisation does sound very interesting too. I'm going to write it down in my little idea notebook for further thought some day :-) Thanks!<p>(Thinking about it now, putting both these statements together appears like it could well need to a very interesting Borges-like story)",1216539340

Well, since I am responsible for all of OpenMoko's various problems, I am going to make the executive decision that it is beyond my ability to fix it, and abandon the project altogether.<p>Your attitude may be correct, but it is not helpful.<p>There's no reason to expect that someone who is knowledgeable in human interface design, or graphic design, or workflow, should also be capable of patching a system themselves, let alone dealing with the process of submitting patches.<p>Whether you like it or not, criticism does drive development in user interface in open source projects. The programmers build something, users say, ""this sucks"" -- but the really helpful users say, ""this sucks because ..."" -- and then while a handful of people (like you) tell those users to get bent, other programmers go out and fix what the users are complaining about.",1216539303
