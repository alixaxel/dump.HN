But I didn't originally set out to make Voo2do into a business -- the only way I get money for it at present is through donations.  Are you saying anyone who wants to build and offer a web application should form an umbrella corporation for that?  What about non-web software?  Where do you draw the line between ""personal experimental project"" and ""entity that needs a state-sanctioned organization around it""?",1216321555

You can learn enough Perl in a week to write neato sed/grep/awk type programs and shell script tupe stuff to outfit your command line however you like.  Also... it's a good investment because your tools will run on any platform.  You can soak up a measure of Unix culture as you go and you'll pick up a swiss-army-chainsaw that you can use when your usual dev tools don't cut it.<p>Going up to the next level in Perl has a larger learning curve than you might expect... but the ""low hanging fruit"" are very easy to get the hang of.",1216321213
