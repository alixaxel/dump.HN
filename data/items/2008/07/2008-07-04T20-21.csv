First you need to understand that JavaMail is 'cross-platform' in the sense that it's for any hypothetical messaging system, not just email.  So it has layers and layers of lame abstractions.  Lots of configuration needed to do the simplest things.<p>That's one of the worst examples, but my overall feeling is that dynamic languages on the JVM aren't worth it.

236523,comment,235942,236421,0,0,tx,,,"I honestly don't understand your ""religion"" line towards Stallman's position. Yes, he's been consistent and kept saying the same thing for years, that's the only grounds you can base your analogy on.<p>Free software is a wonderful thing and keeping a source code ""secret"" or patenting stupid shit like ""single click buy"" is indeed evil, what else you want to call it when closed-source systems are forcing the entire world to reverse-engineer their file formats, communication protocols, etc. How many programmer-hours have been wasted re-implementing JPEG compression, TCP/IP stack, XML parsing, etc etc etc?<p>Tell me, how is it NOT evil to hold font-rendering patents forcing the entire non-Windows (or OSX) world to stare at fucked-up unreadable fonts? ... and at the same time borrowing anything they want from OSS community when they feel like it (look! there is ""etc"" folder in windows/system/drivers!) How is it possible to look into SCO vs Linux case and not call Microsoft's envolvement ""evil""? If not evil, what is it then?<p>Moreover, the modern history of computing is actually proving that Stallman's views make perfect sense, even from commercial perspective: look at Adobe, who's actually being forced to open-source because they suddenly realized that this gives them an edge over Silverlight. Just compare that to Macromedia's not so distant dreams of selling crazy ass expensive ""Flex servers"". Or look at poor Opera fighting against the whole world's efforts of improving FF.<p>Even your own examples of better software don't apply. On features and flexibility alone, OSX can't hold a candle to even (!) Gnome and wins user's hearts purely on looks. What's more important, however, is that OSX itself is a giant example of open source (BSD) taking over commercial (Windows) with a for-profit company cashing out in the background - I still don't understand why OSS community lets Apple to get away with it: they took all they wanted and haven't given much of their own stuff back. Majority of code you get installed with OSX isn't written by Apple, yet they get to charge you for it. So don't use OSX as an example of successful closed-source product because it isn't.<p>Also, look back in time: open source systems have been innovating and are responsible for nearly everything we see around ourselves: languages, compilers, internet itself, the list is huge: commercial and closed-loop development hasn't produced anything with an impact, merely playing ""catch-up -> copy -> resell"" game.<p>You're an intelligent guy, you like to speak your mind directly and I enjoy your blog. There is probably something in your argument that you just can't get across.",1215203339
