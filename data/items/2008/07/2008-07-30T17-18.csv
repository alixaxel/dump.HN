262019,comment,261727,261819,0,0,briansmith,,,"""The strong guarantees of a language like Haskell mitigates the risk and so ensures a less dramatic drop.""<p>Haskell's strong typing <i>may</i> help prevent some bugs, but Haskell's evaluation model means that even a slight change (literally one character) can change the performance characteristics of your program, in space and time, by orders of magnitude. Because of that, I've found that Haskell programs require <i>more</i> testing than Python programs, to ensure there are no edge cases that have space leaks.<p>I am a fan of Haskell for some classes of programs (like compilers and inference systems) where you can spend a lot of time perfecting a strongly-typed data model that is fairly unchanging--one where ""Big Design Up Front"" makes sense. But, I cannot say that Haskell's strong typing is always a net plus when the data model needs to be frequently updated. In Haskell you often have to write extra code, or code that is more abstract in order to get programs to typecheck. Then, you still have to write almost the same kinds of unit tests that you would have to write if you were using any other language. With Python or Ruby you can skip the type system workarounds, which often means you have less code to deploy. I am a big believer that less code == better code.<p>Dealing with ugly code is part of being a good developer. I believe you should leave ugly code around until you need to change it. When you need to change it, you can rewrite it to make it more beautiful, but only if that beautification facilitates the improvement you were originally tasked with making. But, it is usually a bad idea to go around tidying up code for the sake of tidiness.<p>Also, think about this: if the original code is really unclear, then what confidence do you have that you understand it well enough to rewrite it correctly; if the code is clear enough to be easily rewritten, then why does it need to be changed?",1217437485
