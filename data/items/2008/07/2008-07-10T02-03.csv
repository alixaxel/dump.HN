Its a weird paradox, but its true<p>Case in point: Halle Berry - she is one of the hottest women on the planet, but is often single.<p>There are two possible reasons for this, firstly men just assume that she is not single, as a result of her looks and status. Secondly, perhaps some men are intimidated by her looks and status and simply dont approach her as a result. In regards to celebrities, it seems that this can happen often.<p>Either way, Being good looking != being instantly attached or approachable.",1215657864

I say no because it would be illegal, but if it weren't illegal then I would gladly do it (as an evil telecom). So the government then goes to court to compel me to do it. I go to court and put up no defense and I lose. Now because the government has a court order mandating that I allow them to wiretap, if I do allow them to wiretap then I cannot be held accountable.

241945,comment,241702,241702,0,0,time_management,,,"These websites exist to solve people's problems in dating, and dating problems are like depression in that there are so many causes that it's impossible to find a single cure.<p>The bureaucratic categories that people have to box themselves into for many of these websites are not very useful. For example, ""Christian/Protestant"" and ""Atheist/Agnostic/Other"" are enormous categories. Instead of equality-matching over these bureaucratic buckets, a better matching question might be something like ""Do you meditate?"".<p>Dating ultimately comes down to interpersonal chemistry, which is very subjective. By contrast, online dating often comes down to objective criteria like race, age, and religious affiliation, which simply aren't usually relevant in predicting whether a match is possible.<p>If I were to build a dating site, I would:<p>1. Unapologetically make it a niche site for intellectuals, targeting people from solid schools and graduate programs. This is a group of people who (1) tend to prefer each other, and would pay a premium for an elite dating site, and (2) tend to have difficulty in dating that is not due to personality problems.<p>2. Use Amazon book-recommendations style comparisons to define a metric for ""similar tastes"" in books, movies, and hobbies, then match people based on that. My site would be AI-driven, because while interpersonal chemistry is really difficult to nail down, one can probably get closer by using similar artistic inclinations than by assessing people according to bureaucratic categories.<p>3. Concentrate on building a real off-line community, with meetups and speed-date events, which the dating site would supplement. This would implicitly imply that the site would be focused on a few major cities, at least when it started.",1215657408

In fact, the fact that they're publicly traded means they're exposed to shareholder lawsuits if the shareholders decide that the people in charge aren't doing their duty to represent them. Especially by, say, wasting a bunch of money on legal bills to fight the government.<p>I just can't envision running a corporation in a world in which you could be penalized for complying with the government.
