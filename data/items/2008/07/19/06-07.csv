250543,comment,250507,250507,0,0,maximilian,,,"The whole gentrification argument doesn't really hold well with the definition of gentrification.  Plus, I don't think that link-sites other than digg will get really popular with the general population.  I guess reddit could, but definitely not smaller sites like this one.  Gentrification usually means restoring an old shitty/ghetto neighborhood and making it nice and desirable.  I think this is a repost too..",1216450124

250539,comment,250131,250402,0,0,aneesh,,,"Agreed, but that's not my point.  The article claims amazing percentage growth, and then uses that to say that if Apple keeps growing at this rate, Microsoft should be scared.  It's ridiculous to expect long-term growth at this rate.  Maybe the next couple quarters, but not the next couple years.",1216449163

I know that in China it can, in theory, if you're Chinese, but mostly they are looking for people <i>spreading</i> subversion rather than reading about subversion. I've heard in the Middle East it is more economic restriction than cultural restriction -- VoIP services are blocked so you have to use the phone company's long distance services.<p>What's to stop you from running Tor all the time, or proxying through your VPS or someone else's VPS? (though I guess it would be annoying to have your connection always slowed down by tunneling it around the world) I used to have a webproxy running on my VPS, let me know if you want me to start it up again. And the google keyword ""start using cgiproxy"" is good if you're in a pinch.",1216448996

The only thing that separate us from other problems solvers is that we do not mostly using software.<p>If you cannot see the relation between this problem and how software can help solve it, then I suggest you look again. Even a self-centered hacker could see opportunity here.<p>In all fairness you have submitted 4 articles in the last 70 days i do not know how much that says about the ""HN for the rest of us"".<p>If you want to see less articles as this one make it to the top, then be my guest and SUBMIT.",1216448658

Only some nabors and friends know about it, and about 4-5 people know how to unlock it(it doesn't use a key, it has a metal detector and a fake door bell, you put a bolt on the metal detector, which is hidden, and pres the fake door bell, and it opens, then open the door). You don't know it's there if you look at the outside of the door, you just see a standard lock. Its actually not that secure, anybody that knows how it workers can open it, we only use it if we are outh of town for more than a day, most of the time there is at least one person home. If the power goes down, you have to wait for it to come back. You can get in from a window if that happens and unlock it from the inside. It's not a problem from the inside, you just pull the lock.

I am using PyScripter and I am pretty satisfied with it.<p>Previously I used Eclipse + PyDev but found it pretty slow and sometimes buggy. The debugger used to hang a lot even for simple python scripts. I switched to PyScripter and found it way better than any other free IDE available.<p>PyScripter is perfect for me in all sense except for debugging. The debugger is a bit unstable and does not work well with django.<p>Few days back I tried WingIDE. Being a Windows user I have a few issues with its look & feel as it is in GTK but prolly a *nix user feel will feel more comfortable with it than PyScripter. I've found its debugger better than any other and works for django perfectly. Stability is also good. I think it is worth the price.",1216447335
