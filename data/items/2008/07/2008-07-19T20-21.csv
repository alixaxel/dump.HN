The goal seems right -- making sure that the product is built with the customer in mind -- but from what I've seen the best case is when the technology group can internalize those needs and make the right product calls, rather than having a completely different org. This is particularly the case in a startup.",1216501104

250873,comment,250824,250859,0,0,jm4,,,"Yeah, that's what I was getting at. As soon as you need any persistent storage you're chained to BigTable. That leaves a lot of code that needs to be rewritten if you need to move to a new storage model.<p>This isn't unlike the storage problems PHP had quite a few years ago. There was a separate module for every database that was supported and they lacked consistent naming conventions as well as consistent functionality. It was literally one set of functions you used to talk to MySQL and a completely different set of functions for PostgreSQL or SQL Server. This is still reflected in the documentation: <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/refs.database.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/manual/en/refs.database.php</a><p>For a long time there wasn't a common wrapper for all of these modules so if you started with MySQL and needed to move to Oracle or something you had to rewrite a bunch of code. I had to do that once and I never used PHP again.<p>It seems that's where we're at with App Engine and BigTable. I'm sure there's going to eventually be something equivalent or some sort of abstraction, but I wouldn't want to be holding my breath.",1216500367

250871,comment,250824,250824,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"It depends on what you want to do with your startup.  With App Engine, you're limited to Google's sandbox, that means that third party libraries can't be installed, and Python has many, many third party libraries that make a developer's life so much easier.<p>The initial example was PIL, or the Python imaging library, that a lot of web developers use to resize images for their sites.  App Engine didn't support using PIL because it was a third party library, and when enough developers complained they opened up the API that's used for Picasa's web albums.<p>Another issue that you might run into is merchant accounts and libraries for credit card purchases.  You can't use them, and as of a month ago when I was looking at GAE, there was no solution.",1216500122

I have worked in C# as a matter of profession and I would consider myself at least respectably familiar with .NET.<p>That being said, it appears that if I want to seek any meaningful employment in my area, I'd better learn web development. Furthermore, I'm just plain curious. I actually have some side projects I've always wanted to attempt to implement, and it would require (on my part), some web application development.<p>I'll admit that I am something of a dichotomous programmer. I'm usually either doing rapid application development in C#/.NET, or I'm tooling around with a disasm'ed binary.<p>For the purposes of web development, I'd rather the experience (for the time being) be more like the former.<p>What kind of tools/frameworks would be best for getting me off the ground in web app dev? The only language I know that I believe would be relevant is that I can hack perl. I do know HTML/CSS and have, IMHO, made some nice looking albeit simple web sites.<p>So, where do I go from here and what do I learn?

250856,comment,250704,250793,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"That's true, but I hear what mechanical_fish is saying, too. I suffer from much the same problem: many elements on the list are things which I have thought about to an extent that I've worked out every single step needed to make them work. The problem is, I haven't the time to pursue everything I would like to.<p>Let's take the ""simplified browsing"" problem, for example. I worked phone technical support for an internet service provider for a while, and it wasn't long before I saw the need for exactly such a thing. But, it runs deeper than just web browsing and email: there is a huge, absolutely massive number of people out there that need a simpler computer. They don't understand things like firewalls and security, and aren't inclined to ever understand them.<p>The solution? Take a Linux distribution and hack it heavily; simplify the desktop layout, hide all the settings, and set it up so that immediately after booting, a full-screen web browser appears. The web browser defaults to a very simplified portal page; the user logs in to their ""computer"" exactly once (on the portal page), and from there they have access to simplified email (which, for example, doesn't have things called ""Reply to All""), chat, word processing, and other services.<p>Thing is, the previous services that have tried to create such a thing have done it wrong; they tried to release their own computer, hardware and all. That doesn't work, at least not now. This would work though because you could sell a CD which would make the installation process a breeze. You wouldn't have a huge initial development cost for the operating system; a good Linux hacker could probably make the necessary changes very quickly.<p>After, say, 6 months of development by a few people, and with the aid of a crack marketing team, you could start distributing copies of this thing for around $75. You'd be tapping in to an under-served market not just of senior citizens but of every average family that's frustrated at using their computer.<p>You could even build in a secure remote desktop protocol for the operating system, and make tech support -- if you wanted to offer it -- the easiest it's ever been.<p>So, there ya go. Probably a hundred-million-dollar idea, with most of the framework. Lots more details, too many to list here.<p>Got time to build it?",1216498679

It could have devestating effects, but the idea that it's caused by us, is not backed up by evidence IMHO.<p>There is a whole raft of evidence showing that co2 is released <i>because</i> the earth is hotter. There's evidence to show the 'green house effect' doesn't really do much. There's evidence to show direct correlation between sunspots, and the temperature on earth.<p>To label people 'denialists' and 'intelectually lazy' is offensive. Of <i>course</i> we shouldn't use so much oil. We should be more efficient. But the reasons for blaming humanity for global warming are shady.

250849,comment,250824,250824,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Not sure what you mean by lack of proper database layer.  The AppEngine datastore is a different beast than the usual SQL relational database, but it still has reasonable queries, sorts, etc.  (Better than Amazon's simple DB IMHO.)<p>Main issues for a startup using AppEngine:<p>1) Quotas.  Until they let you pay-as-you-go, AppEngine isn't really production ready.  There are file # limits and quotas you may trip, depending on your target market.  Google says they'll open things up by the end of this year.<p>2) Processing issues.  AppEngine isn't a good platform for CPU-intensive processing apps.  Transcoding videos, for example, is kind of a no-brainer for Amazon EC2 versus AppEngine.  I think the AppEngine team is working on background processing systems but nothing is public yet.<p>3) HTTPS.  There's none right now.  You can use Google authentication, so that's one workaround but this is a deal-breaker for a number of possible apps.<p>These are the main ones that jump out at me.  On the positive side, I think it's awesome to outsource significant infrastructure issues (servers, DB) to Google.  I've got too much to code as is, so I'd much rather delegate the chunks I'm not as competent or interested in.<p>I'm not as concerned about lock-in, although I understand how others may take a different viewpoint.  Also, tethering yourself to Google may have some repercussions if you are trying to get acquired by one of their competitors.

Thought out prior to making rash decisions like buying dedicated servers from Joyent at a high cost, you could possibly save your company quite a bit of cash.<p>However, I do agree that Ruby (and Rails) needs to get its act together. Sure, its never going to be the best, but the ease of development and deployment and (etc.) makes it very, very hard to turn down.<p>BTW: 25 servers to service up to 400 images per second is inaccurate. It only took them 8 asset servers to serve that amount of images. Even so, that is pretty ridiculous.
