251663,comment,250704,250980,0,0,LarryV,,,"These tools are great and I love DabbleDB.  But I think the powerful version of these same concepts is a 'Data Repository and Reporting' service.  A service that lets you suck in data from many sources (csv, Web Feeds, Database Queries, Emailed Reports, SMS, mailing lists, etc).  It would not be scared to hold all this data for me and keep it secure (and would charge me for usage so that people with lots of data pay their due).   It would then give me a very flexible ""Crystal Reports 2.0"" meets DabbleDB interface to relate, dedupe, create conflict rules and schedule data refreshes.    It would then let me create beautiful reports that can be embedded in a CMS, emailed, published like a Google Doc and versioned.   If anyone is working on something like this,  I have lots of ideas of how it should work that I would be happy to share.",1216587580

251658,comment,251574,251574,0,0,SirWart,,,"Ugh, this article is full of misconceptions about quantum mechanics.<p>Particle wave duality: Particles are not either particles or waves depending on how you measure them. A more accurate description might be quantized waves, but really calling an electron a particle or a wave is applying a faulty analogy to them.<p>This experiment will prove something new about entanglement: Scientists have already sent entangled photons and demonstrated quantum cryptography over long distances through the air. 144 km is the current record.(<a href=""http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607182</a>)<p>Quantum cryptography will make things more secure: Public key encryption is actually really good and you can make things arbitrary secure by changing the key length used (You can make accurate predictions about how long and how much money it will cost to break a given key length). People talk about quantum computing blowing open public key encryption, but in reality that just isn't going to happen. (see <a href=""http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2008/03/quantum_progress.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2008/03/quantum_progre...</a> for a good discussion of that). Quantum cryptography also has a ton of other practical limitations which means it will probably only be used by people who don't understand public key encryption (right now there is no known way to route photons or repeat them so not only are you limited on distance but you have to trust every node that the message passes through for the actual communication to be secure).",1216587191
251657,comment,250704,251278,0,0,LarryV,,,"I don't think IT will ever become that important.  IT will just take its rightful place next to Law Firms and Accounting Firms as a necessary part of the business but not the core.<p>It is kind of surprising that IT, with its self references as fast-paced and innovative has taken so long to realize its own inefficiencies.  IT (in the sense of internal computer systems for businesses) was greatly over invested starting in the 90s because the executives of the time were so scared.  I remember stories of Hollywood executives who would ask their assistants to surf websites they were going to invest in and videotape it.  They would take these video tapes home for 'research' the same way they would research actors, directors and movies to invest in.  They completely didn't get it.   So what did they do?  They did what most people do when they are scared,  they try to buy insurance.  This insurance came in over-investment in all things technology both externally and internally,  leading to huge IT departments that then used their bulk to buy more technology and increase their internal political might until all this over investment corrected itself in the legendary bubble pop.<p>I think when all is said and done, IT will be just like Payroll.  When was the last time you met a person who works 40 hours a week processing payroll?  They used to exist at every company - now everyone's checks come from ADP or PayChex.  IT will be done by an outside company and will part of the budget for each person on the payroll.  But of course I am a little biased...<p>Hmm, payroll - There is an industry to be disrupted...",1216587103

251643,comment,250704,250997,0,0,LarryV,,,"I think the problem with 'simpler' computers is similar to the problem with WYSIWYG development and database platforms:  they are too simple for anyone whose job or interest it is to create a webpage or database and too complex for the ocassional user.  This is why MySpace took off where all the many DIY webpage creation tools did not.  MySpace redefined the goal with tools that leveraged the hidden desires of people to have a webpage.  In the case of MySpace is was to socialize.   Most people don't think of MySpace and Facebook as a web development tool but if you look at what the end result is,  you'll see that people are creating online content using these social networks.<p>So the problem of ""simpler browsers"" will likely only be solved by solutions that redefine the experience and goal and it will likely be very close to what we now call a smartphone.",1216586052
