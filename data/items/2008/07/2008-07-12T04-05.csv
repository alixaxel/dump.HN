GM is dying because its a big old company and big old companies die..and..because as a nation, the U.S. does not protect its companies/citizens from the effects of global free trade.<p>The stock price is a different story.  
This article misses something important.  Was there some massive cover-up with GM's financials?  No.  The debt due to pensions and such is not new information.  If the stock buyers and analysts didn't adequately project a meaningful market price based on GM's published financials, who is to blame?  Unions?  No, the stock should be priced lower if thats whats on the books.  Don't blame unions for bubble markets and the unfounded position that stock prices and company value should always grow.",1215838267

244314,comment,244221,244267,0,0,smanek,,,"that's close - but not quite what I was taught.<p>Basically, men aren't as important as women. If 99.99% of men died today, the human race could be back to it's normal population within a generation (a man could easily father a child a day for 30 years ~10,000 children). On the other hand, we'd have much more trouble if 99.9% of women died, since a women can only realistically have about 10 children in a lifetime. This encourages men to be bigger risk takers - women were the limiting reagent to population growth.<p>Similarly, the potential gain for a ridiculously successful man (genetically speaking) is that he can have several thousand children. A women, on the other hand, can likely have 10 children whether or not she is successful; so there is little (evolutionary) benefit for her to be hugely successful (or take risks necessary to do so).",1215837095

244310,comment,244221,244267,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Unfortunately, your explanation does not go the whole way.<p>Consider the evolution of biological genes:<p>a) Men and women share mostly the same genes (the y chromosome is a desolate wasteland), and there are few (if any) known mechanisms by which gene merging is different for male and female humans.<p>b) Dominant, decisive, intelligent, women are likely to share similar evolutionary advantages to men. Note that I leave high status out of this equation.<p>Compare the mathematics to the evolution of culture:<p>a) There are numerous known cultural differences between what men and women grow up with. There are also many known mechanisms for which cultural <i>meme</i> merging is different for men and for women. Our culture directs different memes towards men and women, to a far greater extent than gene selection does (if it does at all).<p>b) High status women are in fact less likely to have many kids, as is shown by an abundance of demographic data. Therefore, the mechanism by which they can spread what's responsible for 'high-statusness' is limited mostly to memes. But culture strongly moderates this influence of dominant, high status, intelligent women. Consider the treatment Hilary Clinton is getting now. Even in a more ordinary circumstance, male bosses can wield power in a way that would label their female cohorts 'ice queens'. So the influence of powerful women is labeled a bad thing, and the adoption of those values by other women is severely inhibited.<p>---<p>So, for this case, at first glance, it seems like the evolution of cultural memes completely dominates the influence of the evolution of biological genes. Does anyone see a hole in this argument?",1215836890
244309,comment,244221,244221,0,0,helveticaman,,,"This is sad, but from a biological perspective, it's oddly tautological.  Men are organisms that run huge risks in hopes of huge payoffs, while women run smaller risks for more certain rewards.  One could consider a male lion to be an entrepreneur, and a lioness to have a steady job.  However, in nature both strategies are equally successful, while in the modern world being an entrepreneur is more effective.<p>On the flip side, men are incarcerated much more frequently than women, and for similar reasons.

Before Stallman could finish building his, an ingenious young Finnish computer scientist named Linus Torvalds—who was initially inspired by a Stallman speech at the Polytechnic University in Helsinki the year before—played off a Unix-like operating system called Minix to develop a free software system of his own. Incomplete in other respects, it had the kernel that Stallman's lacked—one that meshed so beautifully with the GNU system that it seemed destined for it. Strictly speaking, the complete operating system should have been called GNU/Linux, representing the combined contributions of Stallman and Torvalds. Stallman always insists on the term, pronouncing it ""GNU slash Linux."" But in the popular mind, it came to be known as only Linux. Stallman has never gotten over that.""",1215835904

You take on most of the risk of a founder yet have nowhere near the reward.  And the hours are often founder-like as well, since the company often has no clue what it's doing and so you just keep doing everything until something works or you run out of money.  And if you do run out of money (pretty likely), nobody knows or cares about what you did, which can hurt you in your future career.<p>Being an early employee in a startup with traction can be a very nice place to be, though.  Many people underestimate both the chances of success once traction's been achieved (high, even if you're not yet profitable) and the potential market size.  And you don't have to put up with the uncertainty and risk that the founders did.  Most startups with traction don't get sold for $10-50M that's common for a startup with a product and a couple customers, they get sold for $200M+ or they go public for $5B+.",1215835706

Now, I'm not a sociologist, and I'm simplifying here, but it seems to me that it starts in childhood with the selection of toys and judgments on character that parents and family members apply.  Boys get Legos, girls get dolls.  This gets reinforced in grade school where perhaps girls are rewarded more for excelling in ""creative"" activities while boys are subtly steered in a different direction.  In high school, science and history books are almost devoid of women.  Meanwhile television and movies continue to portray stereotypical views of women.  By the time college and career roll around, you've got both subtle and explicit forms of discrimination to contend with -- not to mention a complete lack of role models at the CEO and founder level in Silicon Valley.

It makes sense that geek startups will be mostly male, as well.<p>It's very difficult for women to break into any field that is male dominated.  The fact is, just being different causes a woman to be treated differently in a male-dominated environment.  That makes it hard and un-fun.  This is exacerbated by the fact that some guys really are jerks, and enjoy exerting the power that comes with picking on someone in the minority -- women, in this case.<p>If something is more difficult, there are fewer people who are willing to do it, regardless of gender, race or creed.
