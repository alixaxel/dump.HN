Introductory students are taught Scheme, and the required curriculum includes language design, algorithms, and operating systems.  Optional courses that I took included cryptography, computer graphics, computational geometry, and artificial intelligence.  Some of these classes used Java, others didn't.<p>That being said, the threshold for just passing the classes never seemed very high.  The education was there if you wanted it, but most students didn't seem to, and were happy to get by with a barely passing grade.  This is obviously a problem, but different from the one discussed in the Spolsky article.",1217458578

262419,comment,262224,262272,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Well, here's a naive one written in Lua. it keeps a fifo list of {timestamp, number} pairs. The fifo is implemented as a double-ended queue in a closure. The averaging function takes in the current time and a new number. Pop off the pairs that are outside of our sliding window and subtract their value from a tally. Push on our new value and add its value to the tally. Return the tally divided by the size of the queue. This algorithm takes linear time with respect to the rate of transactions (i.e. how many do we expire each call) and linear space with respect to window size (how many entries fit in our sliding window).<p><pre><code>  function create_sliding_averager (window_span, debug) 
      local window_span = window_span -- seconds
      local tally = 0
      local fifo = { tail = 1, head = 0 }
      local debug = debug
  
      return function (amount, current_time)
          local head = fifo.head + 1
          local tail = fifo.tail
  
          fifo[head] = { timestamp = current_time, amount = amount }
          tally = tally + amount
  
          local cutoff, old_time = current_time - window_span, nil

          if fifo[tail] then
            old_time = fifo[tail].timestamp
          end
  
          if debug then
              print ('cutoff: ', cutoff, 'old time:',
                    old_time, 'current:', current_time)
          end

          while old_time ~= nil and old_time < cutoff do
              tally = tally - fifo[tail].amount
              if debug then
                print ('expiring: ', fifo[tail].timestamp, fifo[tail].amount)
              end
              fifo[tail] = nil
              tail = tail + 1
              old_time = fifo[tail].timestamp
          end
  
          fifo.tail = tail
          fifo.head = head

          if debug then print(tail, head) end

I would usually use a small library to implement (push(), pop(), peek()) on the fifo but this example will run in a stock interpreter. On my system the average for rand() hovers around .5 so it passes my initial smell test. It's hovering around 80k entries in a busyloop with a 10 second window.<p>This is a pretty brute-force solution. I'll see if I can think of something more elegant.",1217457848

Both ways, we get one new kilowatt of electricity, but one way is less expensive.<p>Except that energy saving is capped.  If we're using 5kw and we want 100kw, saving that 5 is nice but only 5% of the goal.<p>And yes, we're going to need significantly energy than we have today.  The first of those ""extra uses"" are also known as India and China.<p>Also, while the assumption that energy savings costs 25% of new production costs is convenient for an argument, it isn't all that common.  People don't spend more money than they have to.  As energy costs have gone up, the low-hanging fruit has been picked.<p>Of course, some folks cheat by including ""savings"" that requires changing behavior/reducing value and assuming that that's cost free.  That's wrong because minimum energy use isn't the goal - the goal is to maximize value for cost.
