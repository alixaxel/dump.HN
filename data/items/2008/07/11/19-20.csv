If you add in the network effects of reduced training costs, ""standard"" formats, and consultant availability, Maya may actually be cheaper than Blender... at least in the current market.<p>I wouldn't look to a big studio to change the situation, either.  They are not ""paying through the nose""...  In fact, they are in a good position to negotiate even cheaper prices and better service than smaller studios.<p>Any initial adoption will come from small, independent groups that teach themselves Blender in school, end up preferring it to the big packages, and don't mind that this keeps them from working at larger studios.",1215806325

I've known for quite some time that I won't be truly happy working for a large company and that entrepreneurship is in my blood (no one in my family works for anyone else).  I also spent two years in college doing sales for a small web services/software company and got a lot of exposure to the development of a SAAS solution and the web as it relates to small-to-mid-size businesses.  I spend a significant portion of my free time researching the web, writing mock business plans, and trying to develop ideas that I have.<p>But the one thing I continue to struggle with is finding someone else who wants to form a startup.  I work with some very smart people, but the problem is, their whole game plan is built around climbing the corporate ladder, whereas mine couldn't be more opposite.  So what is the best strategy for someone like myself to find a trustworthy, hard working partner to form a startup?  I fully respect what programmers/engineers/hackers bring to the table and I feel that I would compliment those skills very well.  I also have a pretty good understanding of the web and wouldn't consider myself one of those ""pie-in-the-sky"" business types that are responsible for that stereotype.

Google can't really be like VC.  As a company, they are not expected to have failures.  Looking at their trading history in 2008, it looks like concerns over stuff like monetizing YouTube is kicking them in the reputation.<p>I think, however, that they are also suffering from a thing that the media loves to do -- turn in its darlings.  Once a ""gee-whiz"" media baby stops being exciting because of its newness, it is popular to try to take the ""darker"" angle on it.  I think this started in the geek community with the Google in China business a few years ago, and now it's hitting the wider world.  I think this would be a problem for Google regardless of their product strategy.<p>I also suspect that, while Google can't be like VC, they're not really like normal companies, either.  I think people expect them to be a little more experimental and to fail a little bit more often -- although, on a smaller scale than YouTube.  I think that people still think, ""Small failures from Google are just signs of progress.""  It probably wouldn't hurt them to be a bit more conservative right now with their stock taking a dive.<p>Finally, I don't think that Google has lost their geek-hipness just yet.  I, for one, still think tha Google spits out a couple interesting services every year.  They aren't us cool as they used to be, and the Google cool factor will probably wear off for them eventually.  But, as one of my co-founders says, they can ""burn that bridge when they get to it.""",1215805283

Only when a company with deep pockets releases ogg vorbis in a high volume device will we see who is waiting to come out of the woodwork and start a patent suit.<p>For the tiny and shrinking set of people that want ogg vorbis, it isn't worth the legal risk.<p>(Sidebar: I don't mean to imply that vorbis is vanishing now, but as storage gets cheaper I expect mp3, aac, and vorbis to drift away in favor of lossless formats which are not subject to the body of psychoacoustical patents.

Everything I say here is my own words and none of this is endorsed/backed by my employer.\nFrom what I can tell, AMD's strategies are more long-term than some people would like.  For instance, we're taking time to rewrite software when we could squeak by with just modifying it.  We just reorganized my entire building.  These things have lots of up-front costs:  lost time, productivity, etc.  But I would be surprised if they didn't pay off in the future.<p>Until last month, we were in a hiring/raise freeze.  Most benefits were frozen (profit sharing, buying stock, etc.)  Now that stuff is being lifted.  Management believes (as do most employees) that we have passed the worst of the storm.<p>HR and legal can be a real pain (more so than many other companies i've worked at).  They can regularly prevent real things from happening.  Thankfully, they are physically seperated from the hardware/software boys (literally on the other side of town).  They have a dress code; we don't, they have lots of inane security policies (no camera phones, etc.), we don't, etc.<p>The management style is very hands-off (at least for hardware/software boys), which is both good and bad.  The ""very good"" developers can really shine.  If you want to work on something, just do it.  Rarely do you need manager approval, and if you do it's usually just one level up.  I've had several ideas that I've gotten a chance to implement in the last few months that have really streamlined the manufacturing process and saved the company a lot of money.<p>On the other hand, average/mediocre software developers are totally lost.  Upper-level management communication basically consists of elaborate ways of saying ""Make more money"" and ""make chips fail less"" and that sort of thing, things everybody should already know anyway. How to go about doing any of that is largely left up to the ingenuity of the small team or even individual developer.  Great for smart people; bad for mediocre developers.<p>I certainly don't think AMD is in danger of collapsing or anything.  It's just not as competitive at this precise moment as it was in 2001-2005.  I can say that the company is treating its engineers/developers right--flexible hours, casual dress, nice facilities, all the sort of things that lead to happy programmers/engineers and great products.  Most of the employees in my building seem to own stock, so I would imagine they also think AMD has a good future.",1215803197

The Palm has also been available for several years from a few carriers with a $10-$20 unlimited data plan.",1215803048

Sell the cars at a loss, then only let them use special gas that is massively marked up.<p>For $7.99 a month, you can have ""airbag live gold"" which automatically deploys the airbags during a crash.

So when one of their projects fails people say look google has failed, they are losing their focus, they have peaked and now they're going down.<p>And that means more money will go into stuff that google competitors are doing because now they can say to their investors, look, google can be beaten.<p>They will stop selling their businesses to google at the earliest possible moment. More startup founders will be willing and able to go it alone, and fewer will want to go work for google just to watch their baby flounder like all those other half hearted me too projects.<p>There's another reason why they cannot act like a VC. Much of what they do needs size and network effects. If people doubt that a particular app has a future, it doesn't get traction, which means it's not going to get big fast. An app by a big vendor that doesn't get big fast is not geeky and cool, it's dead in the water and totally uncool.<p>Microsoft has lost its influence long before their profits started to go down. That's why google absolutely needs focus and they need to be very convincing. They need to be so cool and then they need to say, oh and by the way, we'll crush any competition, so don't even try!",1215802990
