Not a single link to prior art, no explanation of why his solution will be better than anything else.  no compelling problem to solve.<p>The author's blog would be better if the author focused on problem 2: ""I require a lot of number crunching now and then. time is a premium.""  Tell us more!  He might be onto something, but I can't figure it out.",1216101200

I am tired of XML and Java, and I don't see why it has to be enforced. It used to be that you could use all sorts of languages on an operating system. And if Java, why give us yet another API? There are enough Graphics APIs for Java already, I am not motivated to learn another one without any visible benefits over the existing ones.",1216101114

The point of this isn't to test a new Google interface, it's to gather data.  You don't want to spoil the experience for millions of people, hence the bucket testing.<p>We use it for our search quality and it's a great way to get some more info about what people like which has more info than click data.",1216101107

246407,comment,245866,246368,0,0,alabut,,,"""the story of one success"" - only if you consider the company succeeding as their sole success. But another metric is to compare the number of successful products 37signals has put out. They've made a bunch of apps and most (all?) of them do very well in their respective areas (lots of paying customers!) because of the common development philosophy they share.<p>In other words, when it comes to their ideas on how to build stuff well (a mix of agile programming and user-centered design they call Getting Real) they put their money where their mouths are.<p><a href=""http://gettingreal.37signals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettingreal.37signals.com/</a>",1216100171
