They just don't get it.<p>This article is based largely on the assumption that priority number one will be to port everything to Windows and I think this is an absurd assumption to make.<p>Are we to believe that Microsoft is willing to risk throwing away $100M+ in order to migrate this thing to Windows?<p>Don't forget that Microsoft ran Hotmail on Unix for years. I imagine by the time they got around to porting it to Windows they were about ready for an upgrade anyway. (Plus, Windows was finally getting to the point where a project like that could even be considered.)<p>My guess is the meat of this deal was about bringing in some new IP and some bright engineers- not about running some search engine that almost no one has heard of. In that case, the platform it runs on is largely irrelevant.",1216404174

If California does indeed use more than China then it's both not by much and not for long.<p>Also, why is this on HN?",1216404149

In US, there is a credit crunch and in China, there is a dearth of companies to fund. Clearly, it's easier to fix the latter. I see China eclipsing US entrepreneurship scene in less than 10 years.",1216404140

What I found was either freelancers who offered to work for free (the job was small) but ultimately bailed, or big companies who didn't even want to talk to me. I ended up writing my own texts and feeling better for it. Anyways, I just want to tell the OP: if you're good AND professional, you should be rich soon :) Or at least too busy to care about money.",1216404012
