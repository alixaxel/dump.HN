256213,comment,255729,256113,0,0,unalone,,,"Because Linux's problem isn't its bugs, or its glitchiness. Its problems revolve around the design theory that builds it.<p>That's where Apple wins big-time over the other two. It has a consistent theory of how to reduce clicks to get effects. From not having a lower bar to HAVING an upper menu to Spotlight to its Dock, everything is designed to make things faster for you.<p>Ubuntu won't ever have this. It can't. Nothing that's designed to be truly open can. You can't tweak things to the same level of control. You can't implement multitouch and make programs that RELY on multitouch. You can't put iTunes controls on the keyboard, or an Eject key. You can't make iChat integrate with Mail and your Address Book when not everybody will have each of those programs. It's not possible.<p>I've used both thoroughly. The level of polish on the one side is VASTLY superior. Look even at Adium versus Pidgin. They run the same library. But one takes up far less space, has better-designed themes, runs more smoothly... because Apple allows for that. It offers big screen resolutions and superior font support, so you can keep things tiny and out-of-the-way and still readable. It deals with a modern-day theme that means a focus on professionalism still works. It knows it can use Growl and the Dock for notifications, which keeps it much less in-your-face than anything FLASHING ever would.<p>You can't get keyboard shortcuts that are as good when you don't know the keyboard. You can't get software support when you don't know the hardware. You can't have a superior user interface when people use five hundred different displays and two thousand different methods of input. (Exaggeration.) Ubuntu can not win a battle when it can't control the tools used to fight. It can't control hardware, it can't control software, without betraying its design theories. Apple can, and so Apple will always win in a fight hands-down.",1216953925

256187,comment,255220,255698,0,0,unalone,,,"Yes. But that's where the issue of popularity and singularity pops up.<p>For Facebook, there's a huge userbase that's already there, and already cookie'd up. Because Facebook has such a huge brand name, it can stand alone and work pretty well.<p>OpenID, first off, has a DISadvantage in how open it is. No single large button will work. (I love the idea of Clickpass, I think that it has a chance to work, but that means yet another branch of the original OpenID concept.) You need either one single field to log in from, or you need multiple buttons, one per service.<p>From there it's a matter of individual service popularity. And here's from my experience only, so I could be speaking alone, but the services I used didn't remember me and I had to log in each time. I used ClaimID, MyOpenID, and AIM. Same problems with each. And I used OpenID to AVOID multiple logins. Even when I'd logged in for one site, the second one meant entering my log in again, then going to a second page to verify access. That means the log-in process is longer than just using a separate ID for the site. Registration moved slower, too, because first I had to log in, then I had to grant access, then I had to pick a user name - half as many page loads as even registering with a site using email verification. (Sites that used OpenID AND email verification were the last straw.)<p>So... conceptually, yes. Exact same process. The difference is that with Facebook I need two clicks to log in, no keyboard, and two clicks is fair to me. The same as theoretically entering a user name and password. And registration is faster, and it keeps all my identities together. So Facebook, by being a faceless corporate entity, has a usability edge, and for the majority of users (I'm not a fan of either, mind you), usability is all that matters.",1216952349

256184,comment,255453,255475,0,0,neilk,,,"I once had an enlightening discussion on a company mailing list about this. The common complaint among the female programmers was that their university classes were directed towards these self-selected male know-it-alls, who had been overclocking their PCs since middle school. Many of the women, who were just making their first foray into Comp Sci in university, got so frustrated they almost quit. And these women eventually became great programmers, so imagine what the women of average talent experienced.<p>The funny thing is, when prompted, quite a few of the men chimed in that they resented these male uber-nerds too.<p>So maybe society just forgot how to teach computer science or programming to adults. It might be that the schools have a reliable business, graduating the inveterate nerdz-4-life.<p>And maybe that's why practically every student I interview codes like they didn't learn anything in university.
