Trivial but the site just gives a blank stare.<p>- When loading the first time the RH Google adverts advertise competitors before your app.<p>- Why are you flashing 1 word at a time?<p>The first 2 are trivial, the third I'm not so sure about. In any speed reading that I've read about or tried the emphasis is on being able to increase the chunk of text the eye/brain can input and comprehend at once. When I added some text to read I (surprisingly) could comprehend the text at default speed. The speed however was not fast enough. And I got the distinct impression the reading flow was broken up by word instead of sentence. So I then tried a quick experiment using the tool \nto read the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading</a> entry.<p>Surprisingly it worked pretty well. I got through the article pretty well. I even read on the pro's and con's of ""centre-based"" text vs whole word chunking and agree this one works well after you get used to it. One thing I did notice was large words can be missed if shown infrequently. I also tried to move the text to left justification. It did not seem to solve this. It would be interesting if you had some training tests to calibrate your speed and check your comprehension. Read a 1800 word essay, answer some questions to see if you are reading at your optimum.<p>All in all, the app works for me.",1217301364

A really engaging story about how game changing startups can turn a centuries-old industry on it's head....er...it's actually about baseball, but the other part is true too.<p>- Crossing the Chasm.  It's a roadmap for introducing a new product.  Gives a framework for thinking about the ""who"" and ""why"" of a new market.<p>- Sales Learning Curve by Mark Leslie.  It's actually not a book but rather a short paper.  Shows how the sales learning curve is similar to the manufacturing learning curve.<p>- Extraordinary Popular Delusions & the Madness of Crowds.  Why do otherwise intelligent individuals form seething masses of idiocy when they engage in collective action? Why do financially sensible people jump lemming-like into hare-brained speculative frenzies--only to jump broker-like out of windows when their fantasies dissolve? We may think that the Great Crash of 1929, junk bonds of the '80s,  over-valued high-tech stocks of the '90s and real estate bubble of the past few years are peculiarly aberrations of our time, but Mackay's classic--first published in 1841--shows that the madness and confusion of crowds knows no limits.<p>- How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.  The title pretty much says it all, huh?  Oh, this book was first published in 1931...<p>- Hiring Smart.  It's a book that takes about an hour to read and provides practical tips on how to interview someone (as opposed to the other way around).<p>- Art of the Start by Guy Kawasaki.  Good read with some nice tidbits (particularly on fundraising).<p>- Patton on Leadership (as in General George S. Patton).
