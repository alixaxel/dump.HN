254953,comment,254919,254919,0,0,gm,,,"Interesting list... I found myself disagreeing with several items here, but I think it is only because of my focus on programming.  Three years of calculus is overkill in my opinion, though I do think that one year teaches you the mindset enough.  But I can see that it is only because I do not do scientific programming.<p>Same with foreign languages:  For me it has been a really important tool being completely bilingual.  It has gotten me many opportunities, but again, maybe it's because I'm much closer to the business side of systems analysis than the pure science/engineering side.<p>Good list.  Anyone have any opinions on the items?",1216860233

254950,comment,254633,254906,0,0,lsc,,,"Yeah.  I know some very good developers who were first SysAdmins.  Even I have written a patch here and there to various system programs.  To 'level up' as a sysadmin, even if you don't want to be a dev, you do need to know some programming.  I don't know if I have the attention span to sit down and write a large app from end to end, but many times I've had to hack up the programs a client was using.  I once patched courier-imap so my employer could continue to use the same UIDLs<p>Ugh. nearly all customers were using pop3 like IMAP-  'leave mail on server'   the problem was that UIDLS needed to stay the same, (the UIDL value is an identifier of a pop3 message-  the pop3 client uses it keep track of what messages are new in the pathalogical 'leave messages on server' scheme.  If we changed the UIDLs, all messages would be 'new' to the mail client and customers would scream.) and qpopper UIDLs contain characters that can't be in filenames, while courier-imap's pop3 daemon uses the UIDL for the filename... so I hacked it so that if the filename started with 0x, it treated the filename as a hex-encoded UIDL. (otherwise it acted as normal... that way next time they upgrade the courier server, they probably don't need to include my patch... most of the old 0x mails will be gone in a number of months.)  A simple change, but it allowed us to move to maildir (which isn't always faster, but in this case was massively faster)  without disturbing the customers.  But yeah.  as a more senior SysAdmin, you are expected to occasionally deal with that sort of thing.  Being able to kindof read debugger output also really helps.<p>Oh, also the 'got lucky' comment was more about coming of age during the .com boom than about becoming a SysAdmin.  The .com boom (and my timing) was luck.  Becoming a SysAdmin, well, that was more the 'path of least resistance' at least once I got started down this path.",1216859662

It's spin to present the loss of a technical founder as an opportunity. The fact that they couldn't keep him in a CTO role, distinct from a VP of Engineering role, speaks volumes.

Your sentences accurately describe what these products -are-, but they wouldn't inspire an investor to believe that they were multi-billion dollar opportunities.<p>Facebook - When Thiel invested in Facebook, the prototypical social network was Friendster, a massive failure. Facebook wasn't the first or the only social network for college students. What made it different from the competition? That's a more interesting question, and one that isn't easily answered in an elevator pitch, not today and not in 2004 when it was first funded.<p>iPhone - Let's go back to the iPod then. In the words of Slashdot's CmdrTaco when the iPod first launched: ""No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame."" Barring a prototype, how do you describe to an investor what makes the iPod different? My best attempts would fall flat: ""You see, it has this little wheel..."" Now we understand what the Nomad --> iPod jump is (innovative technology giving much better usability). Now we can spread hype in anticipation of the Palm/WindowsMobile/Blackberry --> iPhone jump.

In human history, this organic order has been shown to provide the best incentives for progress. It causes life to improve for the most people at the fastest rate.<p>Also, I enjoy living in a free and prosperous society, I want my future children to live in a free and prosperous society, and I think the organic order of the market, which is a product of freedom itself, is the most likely organization of society to preserve freedom and prosperity.<p>All the alternatives to the market that have been tried throughout history are versions of Plato's philosopher-king. Whether leaders are elected or chosen by birth, the idea is that society needs a few wise people to have more power than everybody else in order to guide the rest. The arguments for a philosopher-king are simple and straight-forward, so many people advocate the idea. However, although arguments for the market are more subtle, I believe evidence and logic shows that the organic order it produces is better for society than order imposed by a philosopher-king. Bottom-up is better than top-down.<p>I'm not particularly successful, although I guess I am of above-average competence and have a fair chance at success.
