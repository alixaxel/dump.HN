And as a one-person, bootstrapped company, I have to go where I see revenue first.<p>As for your use-case, I think it's a definitely important one, and that's why I offer Export to PNG and export to XML even in the free web version. I believe a non-technical client could take a stab at creating a Mockup, export it and send it to the designer/developer without too much effort.

I agree that tagging like you describe is the best approach there.<p>For our ""1.0"" launch we're focusing more on the lesson delivery for companies and trainers, which we've been calling their ""private learning network"" and ""lesson storefront"" where they get companyname.dojolearning.com (or a few other domains we registered :) and send their learners there. You can see simian.dojolearning.com as an example, which is the learning site for my other software project.<p>For our ""2.0"" we're hoping to put more emphasis on the public side and also add some social elements so users can find lessons through each other and get recommendations in the system too. But for now we chose to really hone the lesson builder and lesson delivery and just get it out there for companies to use.<p>So right now it's more of a Basecamp style (private focus), and the 2.0 would be more of a YouTube (public focus) in that sense :)",1215459905

I feel like doing 3 versions at different price point and platforms is even more work then one hosted option, but thats just my opinion.  I also believe this would be way easier for customers, especially non-designers that want to do mockups before going to a design shop.  clear mockups done by the client are super helpful starting points in the design process and save clients money/reduce project time / and increase probability of client getting what they want the first time from designers.

I can grab off the internet or the shelf any piece of ""Windows"" software and put it on my computer.  Likewise, I can do the same with the Mac.  I can't say that about GNU/Linux.  Why?  Because each distribution (and new version of a specific distro) has different dependencies taken care of by a regular install. Distros get around this by providing repositories (and Ubuntu's is excellent), but it's still different than being able to just grab stuff.  GNU/Linux is much more in a state of flux which means that it can progress very quickly, but also that software requires more tweaking for each distro.<p>Proprietary stuff.  This has come a long way since I started using Linux in the RedHat 9 days.  Ubuntu 8.04 allows for easy installation of proprietary codecs, but things like DeCSS (for DVD playback) is still a pain and flash (becoming more important in the YouTube generation) is absolute crap.  Not the fault of GNU/Linux, but it does still lessen my enjoyment of it.<p>UI stuff.  I like GNOME's HIG for the most part, but GTK+ is starting to look old.  Look at Adium and Pidgin.  Pidgin is a fine piece of software, but it just looks cludgy by comparison.  Likewise, there are just somethings that no one seems to want to fix (the minimize animation is crap).  More abstractly, none of the desktop environments seem to be hitting what I'll call the Firefox level.  Specifically, that nice balance between simplicity and complexity that Firefox seems to hit.  GNOME goes for simplicity to a fault while KDE will throw every useless thing into the mix and tell you that you should just be comfortable looking through a cludgy list of a million settings.<p>GRANTED, there are many thing that are simply superior about GNU/Linux.  Examples include software updates that don't require restarts, some of the best multi-tasking I've seen (where Windows and Mac might make other processes hang a bit in responsiveness), and of course being free.  It's truly amazing, but there are some annoyances.<p>If I were to lay out some milestone's in GNU/Linux's future, I'd have to argue that these would be important: like LSB (Linux Standards Base) becoming the norm (which I think will happen when developers start seeing the number of new things they can add decline and they focus on environment stability); getting consumers off proprietary codecs and environments (like flash or DVD - yes, this is out there); and a change in one of the two desktop environment's philosophies to be more Firefox-like in terms of verbosity and the like.",1215459124

There may be some things, but I don't know that many people would look for it there.<p>My suggestion: let topics be determined more organically, and use a tagging mechanism like the one on del.icio.us where you can combine tags to refine the particular topic you want.  To go back to the ""Politics"" topic, I might rather see all topics tagged ""politics+communications"" to learn more about making political speeches, or ""politics+county+texas"" to learn about how county governments in Texas work.  Or, if I just had a general interest in mathematics, I could just look at the list of courses tagged ""math"".

Ditto for hacking.</i><p><i>Because pastry chefs leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing.</i><p><i>For a pastry chef, a cookbook is a reference library of techniques.</i><p><i>Another example we can take from pastry is the way that dishes are created by gradual refinement. New dishes usually begin with a sketch.</i><p><i>In hacking, like pastry, work comes in cycles. Sometimes you get excited about some new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it.
