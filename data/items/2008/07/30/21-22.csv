262365,comment,262177,262177,0,0,jessestay,,,"unalone, you have some excellent points.  By the tone of your voice, I clearly struck a nerve.  I appreciate your constructive comments though.  Here's my own response to your comments:<p>""That's because Groups and Pages serve as a sort of utility on Facebook. Yes, they're abused by immensely stupid people. But where SHOULD they go? On the ""info"" page, which is designed to show the user's INFORMATION on the site? That's what groups and pages ARE. On the ""feed"" page, which is supposed to show incoming activity? Yes - that's why they ARE displayed on the site when there's activity regarding them.""<p>My point on this was that it's now in a different place than before.  I recall no blog post or documentation by Facebook pointing out that these were going to be removed.  I use them frequently to find out affiliations a user is a part of, and with them having moved, I had to search to find them now.  Once users get used to this, I agree - it's in a good place for now.  However, they could have provided better documentation to users that this was going to be there.  It wasn't in the developer preview until it was just launched, and I argue it wasn't even in there last week, because I looked pretty thoroughly last week when I was preparing this.<p>""1) Facebook is not a site for businesses. It's a site for connecting with people you know. They fucking SAY that when you register. If you're trying to exploit it, you do it AGAINST the system, and them stifling that is a GOOD thing.""<p>I beg to differ on this one, and this is part of the problem.  Businesses see Facebook as a huge opportunity, and it's part of the reason the 25 and older audience is the fastest-growing audience on Facebook.  As Facebook ignores this, businesses, and professionals will also flock away from the site.<p>""You're supposed to use your network affiliation to announce your job. Not groups, and not pages.""<p>Facebook has announced they are eventually removing the networks so this won't be the case for long.  Facebook also isn't just about ""announcing a job"".  It's also about providing businesses an opportunity to interact in a reasonable and social way with users.  Facebook is a tool for both users and businesses.  This is how Facebook makes money and I doubt they're going to ignore it.<p>""The changing of the FriendFeed information is because Facebook has suddenly added a lot MORE functionality into their feeds. Apps can show MORE information now, because there are multiple tiers of app distribution.""<p>I agree completely, but my point there was that Facebook gave developers little to no time to improve this.  This is why you're seeing poor feeds, and poor use of the design by applications.  I agree though that this is a bigger opportunity for developers, and over time this should be much better.<p>Oh, and you can call me Jesse. :-)",1217454667

262327,comment,262177,262177,0,0,unalone,,,"Has Mr. Stay not looked at any of the Facebook documentation explaining why they're acting like they are? This article smacks of illiteracy or, worse, apathy.<p>""Facebook seems to have moved the Pages and Groups on users' profile pages. Now, to access Pages or Groups, one has to click one page deep from the main profile Page into the ""Info"" tab, and if you scroll down your Pages and Groups will be in the main section below. What's even more odd is that there is no way to drag those Groups or Pages around like there was before in order to put them higher up for users to see.""<p>That's because Groups and Pages serve as a sort of utility on Facebook. Yes, they're abused by immensely stupid people. But where SHOULD they go? On the ""info"" page, which is designed to show the user's INFORMATION on the site? That's what groups and pages ARE. On the ""feed"" page, which is supposed to show incoming activity? Yes - that's why they ARE displayed on the site when there's activity regarding them.<p>And clicking and dragging is a fuck-all feature on Facebook. It was necessary when there were hugely cluttered profiles. Now that Facebook's gone ahead and ORGANIZED things, it's like this magical land where you don't HAVE to guess where things are, because you KNOW where they are. But no - we can't assume that Facebook, one of the most ruthlessly efficient sites online, actually knows what it's doing. We're still comparing it to MySpace, after all. That means Facebook's bad and stupid.<p>""Facebook evidently does not want users to see Pages and Groups as the first things users see when they visit your profile, as the company seems to be saving the business portions of Facebook for later. They seem have put low priority on them lately.""<p>Possibly for two reasons.<p>1) Facebook is not a site for businesses. It's a site for connecting with people you know. They fucking SAY that when you register. If you're trying to exploit it, you do it AGAINST the system, and them stifling that is a GOOD thing.<p>2) You're supposed to use your network affiliation to announce your job. Not groups, and not pages.<p>""It's obvious that Applications have now moved to the ""boxes"" tab, and Facebook has made this clear in several announcements and blog posts recently. They did cut developers short however in the time frame they offered, and developers aren't happy either. For this reason you'll see most of your applications in that Boxes tab, rather than on your main Profile page, and applications like the FriendFeed app on Facebook no longer display detailed information in your news feed, but rather, ""so and so has new activity in FriendFeed"".""<p>The changing of the FriendFeed information is because Facebook has suddenly added a lot MORE functionality into their feeds. Apps can show MORE information now, because there are multiple tiers of app distribution.<p>And application developers can now design an ENTIRE PROFILE PAGE for their application, if the user opts in. That means, wait for it, they have MORE space to display things. The ""boxes"" tab is really the ""shitty applications"" tab, since designing a profile page is not difficult at all, and we're not supposed to care about shitty applications. If Top Friends can make a page devoted to hopeless cliquishness, any developer can do the same. (Though the fact that Facebook now implements ""top friends"" functionality into their friends display means that hopefully people will stop being stupid. (That was a joke.)<p>""As you can tell from the original revision of this post that I mentioned above, even I was confused by the new design (and I wrote two books about Facebook)! While I like how clean the new design is, getting to know where features are and aren't will take some time. This is going to confuse many of you, and there will be some backlash. My hope is, that with time, all this will work out for a better, cleaner, less spammy Facebook that we can all appreciate.""<p>My complaint was the opposite - not much changed at all. The features are all basically where they used to be, and when they moved, it's easy to find there they went.<p>And - also - who the FUCK writes a book about Facebook, let alone TWO? No. Don't reply. I know the excuses. I know some people care about this shit. Those people deserve to be shot point-blank or at the very least denied the privilege of blogging in a way that I see the link.

262302,comment,261705,262010,0,0,unalone,,,"Wrong, wrong, wrong, WRONG. I think a lot of people who comment like this make such comments because they've never used Macs for any real period of time.<p>Three off the top of my head: the contrast of dark grey for focused apps to light grey for unfocused ones means that you can see what's focused instantly. This is useful because Apple encourages opening multiple things at once: the green button for maximize sizes most apps so they fit whatever's being displayed and nothing more.<p>There's no unused pixel. KDE 4.1 shown here has large blocks of matter at the edges of their windows. OS X does not. Likewise, that little grey button on the top right, the one that minimizes bars that you don't need, allows for much more efficient screen economy. No, you don't care, because you like looking down your lengthy xmonad nose at us common serfs, but a lot of us LIKE doing a lot of different things with our computer, and Apple doesn't compromise: we get an efficient system AND one that, you know, does stuff.<p>Not to reel off Apple's most recent ads, but Stacks mean you can access a lot of information without cluttering your screen, and you can still keep it all organized. Making Downloads into a stack means that suddenly your desktop is blank except for things you drag off from other apps and screenshots you take. It compartmentizes your computer into Downloads, which are things that take a little while to get, Desktop, which are things that you grab quickly, and Documents, where things are organized.<p>Three given as impulse. I could literally spend hours going into fine detail about the small little bits of polish that Apple has applied to their operating system. You can say a lot about OS X. You could argue that it's not ""efficient,"" though by some definitions of efficiency it outstrips Linux and Windows by far. But you can not argue for its not being polished. Apple is the industry MASTER of user interface, they have perfected the art of polish, and if you say otherwise you are a stupid, ignorant fuck.<p>I say that with all due respect; I'm sure I'm overthinking your little flippant remark. I upvoted you because your comment leads to a venus of discussion - but you're about as wrong as a nerd arguing operating system on a Y Combinator site could possibly get.",1217451888

Even longer ago, in the late 90s/early 00s there was a site called BriefMe that did email newsletters based around the same concept.  Similarly, it also closed up shop -- possibly for the same reason (it was paying people $5 per short summary and I guess couldn't break even on the other end).",1217451693
