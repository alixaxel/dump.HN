230452,comment,230179,230266,0,0,ken,,,"Indeed: technically, it's impossible.  Email addresses, per RFC 822, are not a regular language -- though it's doable in Perl because Perl ""regular expressions"" are unapologetically more powerful than real regular expressions.<p>RFC 822, section 3.4.3, defines comments in email addresses to be surrounded by matching parentheses, and which <i>nest</i> -- a classic example of a language which is not regular.<p>Chalk this up to ""stupid technicalities I learned one day when I decided to write a regex to match RFC 822 perfectly"".  It turned out to be a fun but useless exercise, because most email programs don't accept half the crap that's in RFC 822 anyway.",1214623926

Thanks for asking interesting questions -- they provided the excuse to dig into this paper that I downloaded last week but hadn't taken the time to skim yet.<p><i>Some people become extremely well informed, and can always argue one level of detail lower that I'll ever be able to do.</i><p>The trick is to learn to tell the difference between ""an argument at a lower level of detail"" and ""a big cloud of chaff"". It's an art. Descending into the data and looking at it for yourself is part of the answer, but it's not always enough -- some people will try to circle around and around, up and down, through a forest of details as part of a strategy to bewilder and exhaust you.",1214623403

230441,comment,229853,230420,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"There's a serious problem in the market, which is that publicly traded corporations pay the people who run them largely in stock. This gives the people in charge a very short-term view, because their pay is based on the difference in share prices over a short period of time.<p>What this means is that the market is very poor at long-term thinking and investing (which is why I agree with Andreesen about dual class stock structures). In short (and he sums it up better than I could, so read his article if you want clarification) our market has become very bad at long-term strategizing.",1214622037
