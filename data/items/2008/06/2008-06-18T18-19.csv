Insane hours. Very little job satisfaction.<p>- Consulting - 50,000 pounds per year. Long hours. Moderate job satisfication.<p>- Film post processing - 40,000 pounds per year. Long hours. See your own work at the cinema.<p>- Application programmer - 30,000 pounds per year.<p>- Teacher - One year training course, possibility of 40,000 pounds in five years if you can handle unruly kids. (Many don't make it.)<p>- Games programmer - Insane hours. Project may require porting code or using a legacy engine. Awful third party libraries licensed to shorten development cycle. Pay depends on previous success. May require beginning as a game tester at minimum wage.<p>- Startup Programmer - Theorectical average salary of 100,000 pounds per year. Large control of project specification. Good chance of recognition and job satisfaction.<p>> game development now lends to larger teams, less individualism...<p>In the summer of 1996, I got some work experience testing a game at Bullfrog. In 1996, Bullfrog games were taking between 20-22 man years to develop. As a lead programmer, the latter phase of the project would consist of 12-15 hour days of bug fixes and build failures. In the subsequent 12 years, I haven't had the inclination to apply for a job in the games industry.",1213813935

I've interviewed quite a few game development graduates for programming jobs, and they weren't any better or worse than CS graduates. Plenty of riff-raff like from any other subject of course, but enough decent people that they're clearly not useless degrees either. I do wonder if you're limiting your chances with such a specific degree though. No idea how easy it is to get a non-game job with one of those.<p>I suspect the effects they're seeing are caused by:<p>- dramatic increase in cost of living in the UK (low salaries really burn)<p>- UK university degrees becoming easier. (you won't believe what passes for a 2.2 these days)<p>- The game industry isn't quite as cool as it once was.
