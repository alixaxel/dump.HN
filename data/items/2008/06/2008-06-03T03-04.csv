It doesn't start with OO, but you can actually easily build as much OO as you want.  In fact, ""something like C, but with virtual functions"" almost describes Lua.  (You have to add that it's Dynamic and Interpreted.)",1212465537

But being ignorant of how far VM technologies have come and how far Ruby has left to go is not excusable.  (Or more importantly, not being self-aware enough to figure out what you don't know, then having the bad luck to get posted on social news.)<p>In any case, most of the time it matters more to programmer's egos now than anything else.  CPython is already fast enough for low-level bitwise operations on large amounts of data, provided you are clever with optimizing and you're willing to implement key routines in C.  Just look at Mercurial!  It's in the same league as Git for speed, and Git is written entirely in C by one of the best C hackers around.",1212465118

We will be selling only a small variety of cookies, and milk/water. The store itself will sport a very modern/chic vibe, with free wifi - a place where college students can come chat and study, and for hipsters to stop by. As we see it, there aren't any stores that only sell cookies and are packaged in a way that appeal to a young demographic.<p>Would you go to a place like this? Anything you'd like to see? Any problems you see with the idea? Please provide any sort of advice you may have.<p>B)<p>The second part deals with the funding aspect. This isn't a web startup where the cost barrier of entry is relatively low. We'd need to build the interior, the kitchen, buy supplies, etc., so as you can see, a venture like this could get pretty expensive. I was wondering whether any of you have experience with this sort of venture, or whether you happen to know anyone that does. Do you know anything about funding? Is there a world of VC's out there for this sort of stuff? Any other funding ideas?<p>Thanks.<p>EDIT: The cookie place next to UCLA in Westwood is Diddy Riese, and yes, I know about them. :P",1212464593

207587,comment,207486,207486,0,0,stcredzero,,,"A big problem with OO is that most GUI interfaces are not a good match.  It's quite natural for people with a GUI builder to start writing a program from the GUI down.  Of course, since people tend to like attaching ideas to things that are more concrete, like the window they've just made appear.  This tends to produce bad designs from the OO standpoint, however.<p>On the other hand, if people start writing up and passing around CRC cards, they tend to produce better designs.  My conclusion is that GUIs have too much baggage from documents.  In some important way, they are much worse than 3x5 cards that you can pass around.  Once we figure this out, some aspects of programming will improve.<p>It will probably always be hard.",1212464536

I know if an e-book was priced $8 versus the $10 paper version, I'd go with the $8 for pretty much any book. It wouldn't make sense to NOT have an ebook option, but it also wouldn't make sense financially to price it below the paper version. Finally, although I can see reasons for pricing it above the paper version (you have features like search, copy and paste, etc.), I think many people would find this absurd. Hence, the only remaining option is to price them at the same cost as the paper version. Clearly, any of the other options are possible, but the reasons listed here are, I think, valid for not doing so.",1212464136

Good use of OO, FP, pointers, recursion, data structures and concurrency are <i>all</i> hard.

It compares taking a friend's book to simply copying it, but the friend presumably does not own the copyright to the book.<p>The idea of copyright extends beyond money. By being able to freely copy an artist's work the artist loses control of his creation. Bill Watterson, the creator of Calvin and Hobbes, did not license out his characters for lunchboxes or plush toys because he felt it would hurt the artistic value of the comic, even though he could have made much more money licensing it.
