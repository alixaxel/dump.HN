Basically, after orthogonalizing a set of feature vectors for dimensionality reduction, the resulting landscape of posts is clustered (k-NN as far as I can tell) and the 'closest' set of 'hot' posts to a user is returned.  I'll be better able to fuss with this after I have a little more free time (eg. after my exam and the paper I'm working on); the code is primarily in Recommender.cpp if you have checked out the r2 git repo.<p>Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm instead of a supervised algorithm was, in my opinion, the Wrong Way to Go.  After I get done with my screening exam this week, I am planning to screw around with it and maybe see if libSVM will offer a means of constructing arbitrary discriminators based on the selections of, say, one's favorite users, or one's own feedback.<p>Obviously there are a great many nits that need to be worked out with my idea, but I figure it may be worth a try.",1214798344

231684,comment,231591,231654,0,0,kylec,,,"In my opinion, if you're making employees fill out surveys about their happiness, you're doing it wrong. What's needed is a culture where employees don't just follow policy but help shape it as well. Contributions met with positive feedback beget more contribution, and everyone feels as though they have a say in how things are done.<p>Of course, not every idea is good. Instead of ignoring or dismissing the idea, explain its flaws and ask them to present a revised idea that addresses those points.",1214797938

231679,comment,231515,231515,0,0,singapore,,,"This is a genuinely terrible article with an overblown and under-researched thesis - just a lot of uneducated pontificating.<p>One way you can tell, for example, is his treatment of the Singlish phenomena in the same context as mainland Chinese English when, at even the most casual glance, they are completely different things.  (Singlish is a primary day-to-day language for a large number of people - mainland Chinese-English is not.  Singlish is often spoken by native/fluent English speakers who have been educated in English from primary school to university; the situation in mainland China is the opposite.)",1214796710

231672,comment,231527,231527,0,0,gills,,,"Public infrastructure may be designed to last many decades, but at least around here (Seattle) it only lasts a few years before being 'upgraded' for whatever reason, usually due to growth.  On a meaningless and cynical tangent, I think the reason is to keep the construction firms employed.<p>The same seems to be true of much of our software.  The core concepts are solid; but the growth rate of datasets and improvements in technology warrant constant replacement of old infrastructure with new.  Whether the improvement is for efficiency or fun, it happens.<p>Reading further down the article (find the bulleted list), this individual's thought process is quite frightening.  The argument seems to be for the removal of 'societal infrastructure software' from the free market, existing instead in a subsidized walled garden of chosen businesses.  Municipalities would then have to rely on the products of such organizations.<p>To me this looks like an argument for the establishment of Looters.  I'll grant the author good intentions, but not my agreement.  Software, even for infrastructure, needs to continue being produced in a market setting where fast-paced innovation is embraced and praised, rather than feared.",1214795828
