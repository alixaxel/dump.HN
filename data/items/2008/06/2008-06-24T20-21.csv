Google is a great name, better than all the examples you've mentioned for one simple reason:  How many times have you been lost and called a friend and asked her to google an address for you?  How many times have you googled a girl you met to see where she works of if she has any pictures you can send to your friends?<p>Back when Yahoo was the only game in town for search, nobody ever aked me to Yahoo something.<p>Flickr is a great product with an easy to mis-spell name.<p>Reddit is good, though.<p>Regards,<p>Fred",1214340743

226806,comment,226195,226195,0,0,fdschoeneman,,,"I don't like straightforward names, as you've described them, period.  For one thing, they aren't really straightforward with the way human brains work.  For instance, is it carprices or carprice?  Similarly, I'd recommend you stay away from cute names like karprices.com or qarpricez.com.  I realize that their intention is to describe their business category, and let the user figure out what the business is about from the name, but what you really end up with is something generic, something that doesn't stick in the mind, and that is vulnerable to a competitor with a memorable brand that can stick in a consumer's mind.<p>Some specific advice would be:<p>1) Make it impossible to mis-spell.  I know, this was said before in one of the threads above.
2) Does the name have the potential to be used in a sentence, like, ""can you google that for me?"" or ""can you xerox that for me?"" or ""Did you see x's latest twitter?""  
3) Does the name suggest the business category?  For example, twitter sort of suggests what it is that the product does, if only on a subconscious level?  Same for a lot of Proctor & Gamble brands.<p>Probably the best thing to do is pick up Ries & Trout's ""Positioning.""  I know Ries has some newer stuff out that speaks directly to naming Internet companies.<p>Good luck!",1214340534

I thought that it would be cool to make a startup similar to Wufoo that would let indie bands customize their own forms for $20/mo and host everything for them. Then the bands could embed the form on their MySpace page and website. They could also allow blogs like Pitchfork, Stereogum, and Gorilla vs. Bear to embed it in their reviews/coverage.<p>You could get creative with revenue sharing and advertising, but that's the general idea.",1214340142

For instance, the compiler could copy specific functions or classes from an include file and save them right into the script where they're actually used -- therefore eliminating the performance hit of managing include files at runtime.<p>Now, as to whether there's a benefit to learning an entirely new language in order to do this, I'm not so sure.

Oh, just a few more points until I level... oh, I can finish this dungeon and get a new sword. There's also the social aspects of that - you do a dungeon with some friends, get involved in their dungeons later so it has a social motivation for returning as well. I think you also get emotionally attached to your character, and don't want to see him deleted by canceling your account.",1214339702
226793,comment,226657,226657,0,0,gregstoll,,,"Points that come to mind:<p>- The leveling curve is just about right.  At the beginning you gain levels very quickly, and with them new and exciting abilities.  You always feel like you're making progress, be it with better spells, better gear, getting to adventure in new zones, etc.<p>- It's very casual-friendly.  When you're logged out you earn ""rest XP"" which, upon logging back in, lets you level faster, so you don't have to play in large chunks of time to make progress.  It's also pretty easy to level all the way up to 70 (max level) playing by yourself.<p>- There's a surprising amount of humor (pop culture references, etc.) which is a nice bonus.<p>- There are lots of things to do even at max level - this wasn't as true in the past but you can do daily quests, play in one of the four PvP battlegrounds, join an arena team, do raids, etc.",1214339617

226770,comment,226657,226657,0,0,imperator,,,"The reasons are manifold.<p>1. They took every lesson from every MMORPG before them, and put it into WoW. This means things like PvP flags, and not having death exact a heavy toll. This was not obvious to WoW's predecessors. Generally, Blizzard does not enter a market first, they wait, let others innovate, and then combine features into a heavily polished product crafted around an easily understood theme.<p>2. They reward human psychological tendencies to generate habits. This is done through staging a series of rewarding goals. The repetitive parts are not so repetitive that you lose sight of the goal. If the user can hold the goal in their mind and find achieving it satisfying, then a player will return multiple times to what is essentially the same task.<p>3. They capitalize off of the desire for novelty. Blizzard did a great job of establishing variance in terrain, music, audio, objectives, and creatures. Little touches like non-enemy animals roaming the land broke up the environment into a place that felt diverse enough to be real. Providing places with enough characteristics to endow unique identity made the place even more memorable. A heavily carpeted room, a place that emanated foreboding, or a bizarrely twisted tree. Places like that were memorable and this prevented them from entering into the tedium.<p>4. They struck the perfect balance between the feeling of work and play by fostering the social component well. Try playing WoW by yourself and with others. These will be very different experiences. One will eventually be a boring game, and the other will incorporate the pleasant grooming of conversation so well, you'll discover you're talking more than playing the game.",1214338518
