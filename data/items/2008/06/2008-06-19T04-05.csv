Some people don't like the symmetric extra buttons, but they're really awesome for web-browsing (forward and back), and in other applications too. It has great accuracy and the mouse wheel 'clicks' when scrolling (so you know how many increments you've scrolled).<p>Your tastes may vary.",1213851292

I've had mine for 5 years and it looks pretty much the same as the day I got it.<p>As for mice, I was told by someone while playing counterstrike about the ultimate mouse: the Logitec Mouseman Dual Optical Mouse.<p>It was only 30 dollars and let me tell you, it's ridiculous. It came out during a time when 800 dpi were top of the line. In fact, it was the only mouse that had 2 of them! It was also about 20 bucks cheaper than most other mice with a single 800dpi sensor. It was discountinued not long after I purchased it, and there doesn't seem to be many of these mice floating around.<p>It's shape is also really nice and seems perfect for most hands. It also has a conveniently located but hard to accidental actuate thumb button too.<p>This mousepad/mouse combo has given me optimum performance ever since my high school gaming days. It has honestly spoiled me which explains my disdain for using any other computer for web browsing.<p>I am getting better at using the keyboard for a lot of things, but web browsing seems to be designed around the concept of a mouse. I have tried vimperator, and it just didn't seem natural (not to mention certain mode-change oddities).",1213851228

I ended up using it literally as a doorstop after the prof suggested we do so as a joke, only kept it to do the assignments from the book, and went with Eckel's Thinking in Java instead.<p>That was a few years ago and a couple editions back..but I think some of it was personal preference/frustration. It's been a while so I forgot what my particular gripes were..I thought the introductory stuff was okay but (iirc) what ended up happening was that the book didn't cover anything particularly advanced that I wanted to know more about, which at that point was probably things like JDBC and JavaServer...things...I guess back then it was JSP and servlets, it looks like they dropped that for JSF in the newer editions. Obviously I can't expect a book to cover everything, but I mean I was expecting at least a gloss-over of the more advanced topics.<p>Plus, if I remember correctly, a new edition of Thinking in Java was less than half the price and an older edition is available online for free.
