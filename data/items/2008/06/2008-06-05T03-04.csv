You can get things done quickly in PHP, but I would recommend staying away from it as a first language.<p>Honestly, if you care about speed as much as you say you do, you should be looking into Java.

209637,comment,209570,209570,0,0,evdawg,,,"I am also a relatively long-time linux user, started with slackware in 2003.<p>Currently I switch between OS X on my desktop, and Ubuntu on my laptop.<p>While the only program that I use on OSX that I <i>don't have</i> on Ubuntu is Photoshop, there are many programs which I think are much, much stronger on OSX. These include:<p>1. Transmit. Gnome just doesn't have a well-designed, reliable GUI FTP client. Transmit is amazing and it makes my job so much easier.<p>2. Adium. As great as Pidgin is I vastly prefer Adium, it has a greater feature set and I love being able to customize it's appearance.<p>3. Skitch. Skitch makes it so easy to screencap, edit, and upload pictures straight to my own personal servers (via FTP), I <i>stop</i> myself from taking screenshots while on Linux just because it's a pain in the ass compared to skitch.<p>4. NetNewsWire. Especially now that it's free, there is no RSS client for Linux that even comes close to NNW.<p>5. Transmission. Let's face it, although it shares much of the same underlying codebase, the OSX GUI is just so much more of a pleasure to use, not to mention the GTK version is missing some key interface features.<p>6. Quicksilver. I always find myself pressing contrl-space while on Ubuntu expecting Quicksilver to pop up, but only being disappointed when it doesn't. GNOME Do (<a href=""http://do.davebsd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://do.davebsd.com/</a>) is a project aiming to reproduce Quicksilver functionality on Linux, but it's a long ways away.<p>7. Textmate. Great text editor, Gedit is OK, although I find myself wishing I was editing in Textmate instead. You can hack around with Gedit to get many of Textmate's features, but they feel shoddy compared to the real thing.",1212637029

Nothing is more motivating than the ""oh my god I need to pay my rent and buy dinner but I have no money!"" feeling. Having backup plans and exit strategies can sabotage that.<p>But, as a fellow recent quitter myself, I have to admit that I also have my own backup plan for when the money runs out... grad school. ;)<p>Congrats to all those that have quit recently, and to all those considering it, just walk in and do it. I guarantee you'll be singing and skipping on the way out.<p>I simply saved up six months expenses and gave my notice at a convenient time in the project schedule at work (end of one project, before being put on another one). No bridges to burn (I didn't have a lot of complaints about the job, and the coworkers were great) so I have a standing offer for employment in January (when the money runs out) should I need it.

I kept in touch with my ex-coworkers and I know the more interesting work would've materialized in another few months had I stayed).  I also had other job offers at the time, and knew no one who had gone down this path.  None of this made it easy.<p>So I ""eased"" my way in.  I switched to working part-time (again, I had the fortune to work with great people at the time - they were sorry to see me go, but very supportive of my decision).  It eventually became obvious that even part-time work was too big a distraction, so I quit entirely after about a month.<p>Not the most spectacular story, but I haven't regretted the decision.",1212635692
