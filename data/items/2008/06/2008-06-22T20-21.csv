224417,comment,224312,224317,0,0,ljlolel,,,"Actually, that does work!  I forget the precise names (this is studied in Behavioral Economics), but there are a number of cognitive biases which cause people to wrongly evaluate their decisions.<p>For example, say you have two choices A and B.  Imagine they have different characteristics along 2 dimensions X and Y.<p>Imagine A is higher along dimension X, while B is higher along dimension Y.  Now, suppose that looking at A and B, you would choose A.
Add a third choice C which is more strongly along dimension Y than A or B.  Now, you have a choice A which is strongly along X, choice C which is strongly along Y, and choice B which is a little X and a little Y. Also, you don't really like or care about C.  These results were shown with numerous experiments: presented with choices A, B, and C, you will often choose B.  Notice that before, without the irrelevant alternative C, you chose A.  But add in a choice that you don't even care about, you prefer B.  Rationally, that shouldn't happen, and economists try their best to explain that but fail.<p>As for having a super-high priced item, that makes sense for a number of reasons.  For example, one reason may be the halo effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect</a>).  Just the existence of a very high-priced, very high-value item can make people perceive your brand to generally be of a higher quality.<p>Also, some behavioral economists (e.g. Benabou) postulate that people have ""identities"" for themselves which they refer to when making consumption decisions.  So, someone might think of themselves as the frugal buyer, and so they will always go for the cheapest alternative which gets the job done.  A lot of people probably think of themselves as the middle-of-the-road average person.  So if you make an super-double-over-priced option, then more people will buy the over-priced option because they perceive it to be more average.  Plus, some of the people who consider themselves to be big spenders will buy the super-double-over-priced option anyway!",1214167992

For the events that actually show on the calendar, I wrote this function that converts positions on the calendar (left and right CSS offsets) to UNIX timestamps (and another function that does vice-versa). In the code below, the parameter ""el"" is a jQuery encapsulation of the DIV that holds the event, the ""isEndTime"" parameter is whether to look at the beginning of the DIV or the end (i.e., start or end of the event), the this.parent.timeStart variable holds a Date that begins at the very top left of the calendar (midnight at first Sunday of the week), the this.parent.timeslice variable is a shortcut/cache for the number of seconds that one column in the calendar represents (i.e., # of seconds in a day), the this.hSpacing variable holds the CSS ""left"" offsets of the 7 columns as an array (60, 210, 360, etc., for a 1024-wide window resolution), this.vSpacing is the vertical # of pixels in one half-hour block (each day is partitioned into 48 rows of half-hour blocks), and this.borderWidth is just the width of the border between half-hour blocks.<p>Within a minute or two, would you be able to comprehend the following? (the whitespacing is a little ugly, but I can't go over 80 characters horizontally)<p><pre><code>   _dom2time : function(el, isEndTime) {
	// The function px2num below takes a DIV element and CSS attribute like ""left"", and
	// returns the number of px that CSS attribute was assigned.
	// For example, a DIV with left:50px called with attr equal to 'left'
	// would return 50.
        var px2num = function(el, attr) { return
		parseInt(j(el).css(attr).substr(0,el.css(attr).indexOf('px'))); };
			
	return
		(this.parent.timeStart.getTime() / 1000) +
		parseInt(this.parent.timeslice * (
		(function(n){for(var i in this.hSpacing) if (n <= this.hSpacing[i])
			return i;}).apply(this, [px2num(el, 'left')]) +
		((px2num(el,'top') + (!isEndTime ? 0 : 
			px2num(el,'height') + this.borderWidth)) /
		(this.parent.rows*this.vSpacing))));
   }
	</code></pre>
If you can't understand it, let me just take a second to explain. The UNIX timestamp at a given position is given by the time at the start of the week, plus the days before that event, plus the seconds up until the event on the day of the event. So, I take the start-of-the-week timestamp, and then take the number of seconds in a day times the ""fraction"" of a day the event occurs at (it would be 5.5 for an event occuring on Friday at noon). Traditionally, this code would've been done very different by starting maybe with some variable which accumulated the time up until the event (starting with the beginning of the week, then adding the days up until, then the seconds in that day up until), but instead it's all compressed into one return statement. When I had written this, it came naturally, but when I stopped to look, I realized ""Wow...this might be kind of hard to follow"". And yet it's much fewer lines of code than a ""traditional"" approach would've used. What would you prefer?<p>EDIT: Am I writing Lisp in Javascript?",1214166752

Right now society doesn't even admit that self-study could possibly work, they just tell you that it's a path to guaranteed failure.<p>There was one significant gap in my skillset that I can directly blame on being self-taught through Wikipedia and other web resources: I didn't know how to take a textbook and systematically study from it. I was too used to jumping around or starting from some thing-to-learn and just reading the specific concepts it depends on. This works great when you're studying subjects that are well-covered by online resources or looking up reference information, but it really falls short for more advanced or esoteric topics.
