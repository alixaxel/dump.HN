I'm considering adding a feature which allows visitors to pay for services from other visitors. I would like to do this incurring minimal legal cost and minimal operational cost. I would write the software which does payment/order processing , have the money transferred to my account, and cut monthly checks to people who made money.<p>1) How much legal overhead is involved in providing such a service, and what legal issues should I expect to face?<p>2) Would this be classified as a money transfer service, like tipjoy is?

231392,comment,231040,231275,0,0,mxh,,,"<i>it is taxed much higher than passive income</i><p>Could you elaborate on this a little bit?  The passive/active divide is a little fuzzy to me, especially since you apparently include ""subscription fees from web apps"" in the ""passive"" category.  It seems to me that such fees will either be taxed as ordinary income (if they're coming into a pass-through entity such as an S-corp or some LLCs) or 'double-taxed', first at a corporate rate, and then at a 2nd personal rate when you transfer them from the company to yourself.  (The combined effective tax rate generally seems higher than the pass-through rate.)<p>I can see the lower effective rate being justified a couple of ways:  considering the effects of FICA/Medicare taxes, restricting consideration to cap gains (e.g. appreciation in publicly-traded stocks) or tax-free securities, etc.  But I'd be interested in where you draw the line between ""earned"" and ""passive"" income, and how you conclude that ""passive"" is taxed at a ""much"" lower rate.",1214767106

So everyone had a built in excuse, ""The computer did it.""  The bosses had trouble holding people accountable because a) the bosses didn't understand the algorithms themselves and b) It was hard to argue with that logic.<p>Then ERP systems starting using much simpler altorithms and rules.  For example, ""Don't tell me to change anything unless it's more than 3 days early or more than 3 days late.""  Something anyone could understand.  It took about 10 years, but man and machine finally started working together.",1214766861
