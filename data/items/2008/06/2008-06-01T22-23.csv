206237,comment,205923,206209,0,0,breck,,,"<i>A far better solution would be a push from the user - email the website a list of contacts for example.</i><p>I disagree. The implementations I have seen are very easy to use and effective. This solves a huge problem of having to build a friends list from scratch every time I join a new site. Emailing a list of contacts would be a feature no one would ever use.<p>The security concerns are warranted. I wouldn't give out my credentials to just anyone, only to reputable sites. If a site were to abuse a user's trust by using the email login info for unathorized purposes, a user who was actively and willingly trying to help the site by inviting their friends, I think the consequences should be and would be severe.<p>As long as one uses common sense in deciding whether to give out their login info, I think this is a really good idea.<p>Ideally, a trusted third party--or the email providers themselves--would handle this type of contacts exchange through some type of JavaScript tool.",1212360296

206222,comment,206107,206169,0,0,gnaritas,,,"I've spoken to Avi and that's exactly how DabbleDB works.  He front ends the system with Apache and uses a rewrite map to launch an external Ruby script that checks to see if the image for that request is running.  If it is, it returns the port its running on, if it's not, it launches the image, records what port it's on and and proxies the request to it.  Images time out after X amount of time and shut down on their own.<p>Each customer gets his own image, though the customers data is stored outside the image using an image segment.  This lets them upgrade the Dabble image without messing with the customers data.  When an image fires up, it loads up any image segments into it.<p>Basecamp is also exactly the kind of app that fits well with this architecture.  Lot's of small independent databases.<p>It's not that different from how Hacker News uses load-table to store the customer data in files and loads everything into ram when the web server starts up.  Both systems are basically homebrew object databases very well for the limited load placed on them.  Gemstone is the granddaddy ODB that can handle anything you can throw at it.",1212358589

It is also my understanding that they intend to adopt a business model in which they'd have a free version (that will suffice for most people's needs) as well, and they plan to make commercial versions affordable. But we don't know what they're going to charge yet, so it's really just speculation at this point.<p>They are going to release the Ruby parts as Open Source and it's not set in stone that they're going to keep the VM closed either. However, if they choose not to make it FOSS, it's very unlikely that MagLev will become the single most popular choice. That said, companies pay a lot of money in hardware and hosting fees, so if the speed claims were to be true, many companies would have no qualms about paying for a much faster implementation.

</code></pre>
Authors including J. R. Lucas have debated what, if anything, Gödel's incompleteness theorems imply about human intelligence. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a Turing machine, or by the Church-Turing thesis, any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.<p>Hilary Putnam (1960) suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_%28philosophy%29#G.C3.B6delian_arguments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_%28philosophy%29#G.C3...</a>",1212358341

The only reason I said ""Here's how I understand it"" is that initially I wanted to explain both what a salt is (a notion I certainly understand because I read about it and implemented it) and what a nonce is (a notion I probably don't understand because I didn't really read about it and didn't implement it).<p>I know I still have much to learn but at least I know what I don't know with respect to nonces, and I find it pretty lame that you're saying I shouldn't ""design security systems"" just because I can't spell a word properly <i>for a technique I just admitted I ""never used and can only make guesses [about]""</i><p>I've been working like crazy for the last 2 years to learn everything  about Common Lisp and making websites and you're saying I should give up everything just because I still have things to learn?!<p>You can't judge someone's skills just by looking at a data point like that.
