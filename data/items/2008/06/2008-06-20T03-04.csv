You're saying I should bank with XYZ Bank because their savings account interest rate is 100% higher than my current bank!  Or, .5% vs 1%.  I'm saying the interest rates are .5% and 1% respectively.<p>As for the 10 out of 100 total winners claim, it looks fudged up to me on quickly scanning the abstract.  I'd have to use a calculator and read the study.  That cute little bit about a compliance adjustment smells like fudge.  And, as I've said, there are other studies with other conclusions.",1213933149

It seems like there are far fewer enterprise software startups now (although it's very possible I'm mistaken).  From the tidbits I've heard around, there was a lot of saturation and consolidation.

Good point about the public url ... it should be easy to use and remember.<p>Images can already be added to documents and templates. If a template has an image field, the user can just click it to change to another one. I've created a bunch of custom border, background and decoration images so that there is already some for users to choose from.<p>I provided the PDF download so that documents could be printed easier than through a browser, with higher quality.

Bullying is one of the worst features of the abysmal society which exists inside schools.<p>Plus the piece doesn't go very far in describing the micromanagement (that would give away the punchline). What kind of boss tries to control what you eat and what clothes you wear? Who demands you raise your hand before you can go to the toilet?<p>More fundamentally, the job wasn't chosen and there was no interview. In other words, it's slavery.<p>We don't see it because we were slaves ourselves for 12 years and therefore we feel it must be right.

Expect big lawsuits next decade about the side effects.<p>> you have to concede that if the price is low enough or the side effects are low enough, then it's worth it.<p>Not quite so simple, because there are lifestyle treatments that do work and are generally not pursued.

It might be that homeschooling encourages independence and initiative, or it might just be that the public school system is designed to produce good employees.<p>I'm the oldest in a family of 6 - all home schooled. My brother and I both have an entrepreneurial streak in us (my brother sold candy at the Jr. High near our house after school to raise money for his X-Box fund. He raised enough to buy it at 11, with no help from parents. He even bought the candy on his own).<p>However my other brother is leaving for the Air Force Academy in a few days - he wants to end up in politics somewhere. To me it seems like the military and political careers are opposite to entrepreneurship. I guess we're not all the same.",1213930818
