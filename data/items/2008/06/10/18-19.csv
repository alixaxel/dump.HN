If money had a personality, that would be what a VC is.  So you must cajole them into your arms and then reassure them that they are safe with you while you get as much as possible out of them.  It is perhaps not by chance that a VC sounds like a mistress, since they are both forced to maximize a huge, time-sensitive asset (money, looks) while lacking any expertise.",1213121521
214117,comment,211630,211851,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Well, I don't feel like YUI tries to make JS into Java.  The goal of YUI is to add some extra APIs under a single global object, and pretty much let you write your code however you want.  It's a library that quietly does nothing if you don't use it, and it doesn't ask you to change how you do things.<p>jQuery is, of course, Javascript.  John Resig didn't invent functional closures or chaining.  But it seems like jQuery is designed to change the way that you write Javascript.  It even says so on <a href=""http://jquery.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jquery.com/</a>  It's a set of conventions, and they're not standard. I'm not saying that they're bad (in fact, I really like the jQuery style and think it's very elegant.)
