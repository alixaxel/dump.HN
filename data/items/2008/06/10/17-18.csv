Can your family help pay for your necessities? e.g. you could go dependent under your parents for insurance till you are 25 and unemployed.<p>Then after that is answered, ask yourself will your idea if delayed by 6-12 months will be executed by someone else?<p>My Personal experience: I graduated college 7 years ago, I have had a steady job for the past 7 years and was able to save some money. When the startup bug bit me last year, I continued to work a full-time consulting gig while working on my idea. This was a bad move on my part, because I always found myself some how busy, tired, not motivated enough to work the ""night-shift"". The passion was there but execution was tough to maintain at times. So I finally quit 3 weeks ago and went full-time, while dedicating 100% of my savings to my startup (I don't have that much saved up due to college loans, CC bills, and other obligations). I have enough to run me for 4 - 6 months of not needing a job..after that who knows.<p>BUT...the past 3 weeks have been AMAZING, working 14 hour days on just my idea is rewarding, less-tiring, fun, exciting, and it NEVER feels like 14 hours!!<p>So my suggestion, make sure your necessities are covered..quit..and get your idea out the door..the big corporate jobs will always be there in the future...but at least if you find yourself back there you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you tried.",1213120065

214087,comment,214037,214037,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Your first question is really two questions:<p>1. Can you successfully grow a company that you start part-time?<p>2. Can you successfully grow a company <i>while</i> you're still part time?<p>The answer to the first appears to be yes: among others, this describes Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, EBay, Facebook, PlentyOfFish, Bloglines, and Del.icio.us.  It almost seems like companies that do this tend to do <i>better</i> than the ons that jump in all the way immediately.  The extra time gives you a chance to do the riskiest parts of your startup - market research and prototyping - while still under your employer's umbrella, and it's a test of your commitment.  If you're passionate enough to put 4 hrs/day into your startup while still employed, you'll be in much better shape when you're not employed.<p>The answer to the second question appears to be no: of the list above, EBay is the only one that made enough money to support the founder at his previous salary before he quit his day job.  There's just too much that needs to get done at a startup to do it all in your free time.<p>As for my own story - I spent 9 months working part-time on my startup before going full-time.  The immediate effects seem to be that it set us back 9 months, and I have about $30k more startup capital.  There're likely 2nd-order effects as well; for example, because of the 9 month delay, my cofounder got accepted to HBS before we launched and quit.  OTOH, if this recession turns out to be long and deep, the delay and extra capital may mean the difference between falling down dead in the middle and making it through to the other side.  And in the 9 months extra I spent at my job, I got to see my project go from ""death march"" to ""almost done"", which is good practice for when your startup starts looking an awful lot like your last employer's product.<p>I also shared your fear about becoming too busy and worn out from the job to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams, but this fear turned out to be overblown.  You don't magically become a different person when you take a corporate job.  If your startup is compelling enough to sustain you through the inevitable low points, it'll be your job that suffers (and then you just need to realize that and back out before you get fired).",1213119755

214085,comment,213911,213923,0,0,geebee,,,"I'm not sure what safety standards you're referring to... certainly, cars evolved higher safety standards, but SUV's threw most of that out the window.  Many (but not all) SUV's are pretty much shells bolted on to a light truck frame.  They are very top-heavy, and prone to rolling, and they don't have the structural integrity of minivans and sedans - furthermore, they are built into a very stiff frame that doesn't have much give.<p>The net result is a car that is considerably more likely to inflict severe injury or death toward pedestrians and drivers <i>outside</i> the car, yet remarkably enough also reduces the safety of the people <i>inside</i> the car.  SUVs may make people <i>feel</i> safe - in this sense, they are ""the triumph of marketing over engineering"".<p>If you're interested in protection, a heavy, single frame car that stays lower to the ground is probably your best bet (though you will risk some injury when and SUV hits you up high and circumvents some of your buffering, a heavy frame and a vastly lower probability of rolling will offset this for a net gain in safety).  It's also preferable when your increase in safety doesn't come at the expense of people outside your car (though, like I said earlier, SUVs don't really increase safety for their occupants).",1213119563
