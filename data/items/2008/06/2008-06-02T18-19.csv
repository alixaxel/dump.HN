207090,comment,207049,207049,0,0,crystalarchives,,,"I've done web development (PHP/MySQL) on both Windows and Linux, and Linux wins hands down for me primarily because of the number of useful utilities at my disposal on the command line and ease in moving around the directory tree.<p>However, packages like XAMPP help greatly in making sure everything runs smoothly when developing on Windows. Nothing in the PHP/MySQL code itself should have to be different on Windows, but configuration settings need to be tweaked prior to launch on a Linux box.<p>Caveats I can think of when moving code written in Windows to Linux is that Windows uses the backslash instead of the forward slash for directory paths, but I think newer versions of NT support the forward slash, too - please correct me if I'm wrong. Also, Windows uses a semicolon (;) to separate path variables while Linux uses a colon (:).<p>Windows also uses \r\n instead of just \n as a newline character so when/if you edit the code after porting to Linux, you'll get ^M characters at the end of each line, which I can't stand. A quick global search and replace restores my sanity though.<p>I don't have any experience at all using Perl on Windows, sorry.",1212432655

Just because it happened to you does not say it happens every time.  Just simply say their customer service is not as good.  Point 4 is not helpful because there are many more variables to take into consideration when pricing a VPS.    And anyways, Slicehost has an option for 4 GB of RAM.  Linode only has an option for 2880 GB of RAM.  Doesn't that mean that Slicehost gives you much more RAM?  I realize you probably mean something different, but you did not explain yourself.

207088,comment,207049,207049,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I used to do it, I recall that it wasn't <i>that</i> much of a pain to setup (like I spent a half day getting everything working and didn't worry about it again), but it was enough of a hassle moving code between my laptop and the production Linux servers that I went and learned vi, started developing over SSH, and eventually just bought VMWare and loaded up a Linux image.<p>The shebang line isn't really a problem - Windows servers just ignore it.  IIRC, the Windows PHP and Perl Apache modules go by the file extension to determine which module to execute.  This is probably in the configuration instructions somewhere...I just followed a tutorial on the web.<p>The parts that are really painful are:<p>1.) You have to be really careful keeping your code platform-independent - which is good practice anyhow, but can be tricky.  Paths are the obvious problem - I was always forgetting and hardcoding backslashes instead of using whatever the PHP platform-independent equivalent is.  Since the directory structures are different, you'll need to keep every path in a config file and reference them indirectly - again, good coding practice, but easy to forget.<p>2.) Some functions don't work the same between OSes - anything with symlinks, permissions, umask, or pipes is going to behave differently.  IIRC most of these functions had sensible defaults (i.e. do nothing) and didn't fail outright, but keep this in mind.<p>3.) Calling out to external programs is a real pain.  I think this is what made me finally switch - the app grew so that it needed to call out to UNIX-only command-line apps written in C, and I didn't feel like porting them to Visual C++.<p>That's all based off memory - it's been about 4-5 years since I developed on Windows, and 3 years or so since I last worked with PHP.  Basically the upshot is that it's possible, but there were enough corner cases that for intensive work, I found it was better just to bite the bullet and get VMWare.",1212432608

But keeping it running is harder I'm afraid... I suggest you try to find someone in your area (or even join a LUG, Linux User Group) to help you with the more advanced things. You can first try setting up a server as a VM, you can get virtualbox for free and it works great! Good luck but if you want something, you can do it (some people here have learned me that)",1212430635

If it can do something else, that might be cool, but it can't do much. ^k and dictionary bookmarks in firefox are far superior to using that shell.<p>Dictionary bookmarks, for all those unaware, are a beautiful feature I rarely hear about. For example, go to en.wikipedia.org and right click inside the search text box on the left. Click on 'Add a keyword for this search.' For name, put anything, for keyword i have 'w'. Now, whenever you are in the address bar (ctrl+l or alt+d to get there in windows/linux, apple+l in os x) you just type 'w plants' to get the wikipedia page on plants.<p>Go and try it, type ctrl+l, 'w firefox', enter. I almost can't live without it. And the same works for anything else, so google news can be 'gn', google images: 'gi', etc thus making that more useful goosh. goosh doesn't even have any of the features you'd want from a *nix shell like redirection.",1212429880
