After watching Al Gore's TED talk covering 15 ways of reducing your personal footprint, I started to look into companies selling carbon offsets.<p>My question for Hacker News is, how would you assess the footprint of a startup so as to be ""green from the get-go""?  What I can think of is:<p>- Personal carbon use (house, transportation), since we don't have an office yet\n- Servers (our host isn't green to my knowledge)\n- Additional services such as Amazon S3 and EC2<p>How would you go about calculating a carbon footprint for such a scenario?  Also, do you think there is a real promotional advantage to being green?",1214593121

There is no meaningful argument: the current, epochally high rate of CO2 release is driving current climate change.<p>Yes, the climate changes on its own.  Sometimes it does this ""rapidly"".

Conversely, CO2 greenhouse effects have been qualitatively understood (even it quantitatively modelling it is a bitch) for many decades.  I'm not sure which ""most people"" you think are ignoring the argument, but I assure you it doesn't include climate scientists.  It's just that it doesn't make any scientific sense.  We know with certainty that fuel burning is producing a rapid spike in CO2 levels.  We know with certainty that CO2 is an effective greenhouse gas.  We know to within reasonable error bars that the climate is changing rapidly.  Do the math.  Occam's razor demands that we look at CO2 as the undeniably best hypothesis.
