I didn't.<p>I think it's a cruel stereotype, and the upvotes that comment has received are telling of the lack of sincerity on this topic.<p>There are many things you can do with IT/ICT to help the developing world.  Here are some suggestions:<p>Build a non-literate UI on a cheap cellphone.  Use it to provide rural villages with healthcare and market information, and financial management tools (like microfinance accouting).<p>Hack together a long-range WiFi to provide connectivity to a remote site.<p>Stream video from your cell phone to your favorite video-serving startup.  Convince people to donate their time and money by showing them conditions on the ground.<p>Build a service that lets multiple villages form a cooperative using cellphones.  Let them buy agricultural inputs in bulk at better prices, access wider markets for their goods, and coordinate transportation and tool sharing.<p>Use pcs or phones to educate rural farmers on modern agricultural techniques.<p>There are countless underfunded projects that are trying to do something in this space, going far beyond microfinance (though that may turn out to be one of the most important measures taken).",1214429961

The equity grows over time and usually requires a minimum 1-year commitment for any equity stake.<p>In your case, you guys didn't think this part completely through (oh well, move on).<p>I suggest you talk with the previous programmer. It's more than likely he doesn't see any value in his equity and may be willing to give it up completely or for a small return.<p>If he wants a return for his effort, you guys could come to some sort of arrangement of payment. This could be an immediate payout or a payout dependent on funding (seed/series A). If the value is too high for an immediate payout and the programmer has no faith in you getting funded, you could arrange to make monthly payment installments ($300/mo * x months).<p>As for his rate, I would suggest that he not expect his ""corporate rate"" for his work. As he was doing this in good faith as part of a team, it's stronger to expect a discount, similar to what you'd charge a friend or partner for work (i.e. $25/hr vs. $100/hr).

My side project is 95% C++.<p>I think C++ is infamous because it's so easy to shoot yourself in the foot with its language features.  Templates are an excellent example.  They sound like a wonderful idea when you first begin to use them, but unfortunately it's extremely easy to <i>abuse</i> them.
