People's spirits are weighed down by the artificiality of that. It's a drag to drop what you're doing, which presumably is interesting, and go sit around doing something boring. Surely that's the last thing you ought to be doing in a startup.<p>To get out of the trap, apply the converse. The same people who groan at the thought of enduring an arbitrary meeting will come to life when working together on something real. Therefore, figure out how to make your meetings real work on something that matters. Failing that, ask the team to figure out a way to provide the value of the meeting without needing to have a meeting.<p>Here's my criterion. I ask myself whether what's going on is making me (and others) feel more or less alive. If it's the latter, I try to understand why. If necessary, I'll speak up and say frankly that what we're doing feels like a drag and change the subject to what we can do about it.<p>Basically, if it doesn't feel fun, something's wrong. Fun is the canary in the coal mine: if it goes, everything else is going too, just more slowly. So it really pays to give attention to this. I'm surprised more people don't figure that out. (Incidentally, by ""fun"" I don't mean anything <i>set up</i> to be fun, like those asinine team-building outings... those things aren't fun, they're a crate of suckage with a label that says ""fun"" stuck on it. What I'm talking about is spontaneous enjoyment of creative work and meaningful interaction with others.)",1214197143

The sideways flick your wrist does when you reach for it is murderous. Most laptops' integrated pointing devices will help a lot. The Apple trackpad is great. IBM (Lenovo) trackpoints work well too. Switch up hands you use for the pointing device.<p>I lucked out on this one: the last desktop computer I ever owned died just as my RSI symptoms peaked. I then didn't regularly use a computer for around three months, which let the symptoms subside. I've owned a laptop as a primary machine ever since (eight years now), and have had very few recurring symptoms.<p>(2) Exercise. This is huge topic, obviously, but in particular, core strength development will help your body in surprising ways.  Very specifically, use light (<20 lb or <10 kg) dumbbells and do regular and reverse wrist curls. Obviously go easy on these at first.<p>(3) Keep your wrists straight when you type. Easier said than done, of course, but good posture and a good chair will help out here.",1214196540

If there isn't a set of issues that need to be brought up, then you should seriously consider skipping meetings.<p>At a minimum, the following things should be kept in mind for running meetings:\n1) Send out an agenda for the meeting beforehand a minimum 4 hours (half a day) ahead of time to allow everyone enough time to read it.  Have printed copies for everyone attending can be helpful as well.\n2) Use the meetings as a forum only to disseminate information to your team or to make decisions.  This one is crucial.  If you aren't making decisions, the meeting is a waste of everyone's time.\n3) Have a fixed time each week that team meetings are held so that everyone can plan ahead to be available to attend.\n4) Keep the meetings as short as possible.  Hopefully with a rather focused agenda and restraining your meetings from turning into a discussion forum, you can keep the team meeting to an hour or less.<p>No one likes meetings that feel like they're a waste of time.  Also, by making the focus of the meeting on decision making, you stop it from degenerating into endless discussions.

224752,comment,224520,224520,0,0,vaksel,,,"My advice, is a little different from the rest. All those things are good and all, but it doesn't hurt to lay the ground work for your future.<p>I recommend that you start coding your statup now. This is the best time for it. You have no expenses. You have very few commitments. And you are surrounded by a lot of other smart ambitious people that you can tap. Clubs, professors, classes, will make it easy for you to find out who the smart people are. So if you run into a problem, you can easily find someone to help you understand it.<p>And this way the times when your startup grows very slow, you'll have some other things to play with. Honestly if you don't have an idea now, start throwing some ideas in your head, pick one and start coding, if you change your mind along the way, change your product, you have plenty of time to get a winning combination. And remember, it doesn't need to be rocket science, Facebook is nothing more than a big database.<p>But this shouldn't be your only concern, you have to multi-task. Honestly the startup life is pretty shitty. You work all the time, you lose touch with most of your friends because you constantly skip going out, and unlike college where you are surrounded by women of your age, you end up being pretty much a monk, seeing two-three women your age during the week. So spend that time in college having fun.<p>a) start lifting weights. Trust me, it'll do wonders to your social life and for your self esteem. Honestly if you are afraid of going to the gym, buy a set of weights at a store and workout at home. I actually prefer that because you don't spend the extra time of driving to the gym, and can do it whenever you have free time.(i usually work out when I watch TV since I'm in front of it anyways)<p>b) Join some activity clubs. Honestly you sound like you have no idea what fun things you like. So look at all the clubs at your college and join a bunch and see what you actually like.<p>c) if you want excitement there is nothing better than buying a motorcycle. Start off with a Ninja 250(used). The reason is that its a starter bike(it'll run you like 2K used, 3K new, they hold their value really well). Granted its a little dangerous but thats part of the excitement. Then once you get the basics down, upgrade to a 600cc bike(the most expensive one will run you like 7 grand). And don't upgrade to a 1000cc bike because those are the killers.<p>d) get laid, Honestly college is probably the easiest time of your life for that .You are surrounded by women your age and as long as you are even remotely in shape you'll get a positive answer. If you wear glasses get contacts. Don't fool yourself into thinking that you'll be knee deep in women once you graduate. Like I said, w/o going out I see maybe 1-2 attractive women my age. And if you hate the party scene in college, you'll hate the bar/club scene when you graduate. You don't want to end up like that guy in the 40 year old virgin movie. And trust me, if you ride a bike, have a decent physique and no glasses, in college? You will have NO problem getting women's numbers. All you have to do is initiate the conversation.<p>e) take a road trip, just get into your car and head some place 2000 miles away.<p>f) obviously there are many other exciting things to do, but I don't know your money/location situation, so I dunno if you can afford to go sky diving, or if you live near an ocean so you can learn how to surf/ride a jet ski",1214195198

That period basically shaped my current career (I usually say that I did a Phd, and I wrote a thesis, and the two weren't really related).<p>In the middle of postgrad I started lecturing, and I (somewhat hypocritically) started getting really frustrated with students who weren't interested in anything beyond the exam, particularly as I watched the curriculum get watered down to basic vocational training.<p>I don't really have a point out of this, except that I believe it's still possible to get a lot out of university, but only if you consider it a place of learning instead of a place of teaching.

You didn't answer my question.<p>Name a piece of code of comparable complexity to qmail that's never had an integer overflow. Here's another hint: Perl isn't one of them.",1214194426

You don't have to be a vapid partier just looking to hook up, but making social mistakes is much less costly in college than it is in the business world. Find some groups that interest you, and there are probably girls there that share that interest - it's much harder when you're out.<p>Is there some programming project you're passionate about? In college, it was horse racing and poker for me. Always trying to make a quick buck, I know. Anyway, the only real way to learn about writing code is to do it. Your first project will probably fail, so don't sweat it.<p>If you like this craze, pick an easy language and write a web application. You can get a VPS running for $20-$50 a month, and you could install SVN on there as well. Anyway, have fun and observe yourself - and make sure to study your algorithms!",1214194146

Then you have all packed into your return something that's technically one line but actually takes seven lines to display in a way that it can actually be read.<p>So could this be written clearer in less than ~12 lines? Oh yes. First, why are we working in seconds when JavaScript uses milliseconds natively? Assuming that's really necessary, you must do myDate.getTime()/1000 an awful lot. So let's assume you added a getTimestamp method to Date.prototype. And I'm going to assume that el.style.left actually has to equal one of the members of hSpacing--it doesn't make sense that you'd allow dropping without snapping to the grid <i>and</i> that you'd only want the right result if they happened to drop left of the day column but not if they drop one px right.<p>And it looks like you've got jQuery mapped to j instead of $, which is weird but ok.<p><pre><code>    function domStartTime(el) {\n      var week = this.parent;\n      return week.timeStart.getTimestamp() +\n        week.timeslice * j.inArray(parseInt(el.css('left')),this.hSpacing) +\n        (parseInt(el.css('top')) + this.borderWidth) / week.rows / this.vSpacing;\n    }\n\n    function domEndTime(el) {\n      return domStartTime(el) +\n        parseInt(el.css('height')) / this.parent.rows / this.vSpacing;\n    }</code></pre>",1214193666
