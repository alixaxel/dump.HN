A founder who just got a round of funding should be thinking on ways to increase the value of the company instead of their salary.<p>I would like to know what is the norm in VC backed startups.  Are there significant pay raises or bonuses after a round of funding?  Do the founders and the employees share the wealth?  Or are things kept fairly similar to the status quo.",1205355451

Frankly, consulting full time offers great pay and a boatload of flexibility.  For a long time I went through firms and they ate 20-30% of my ""profits"" although they dealt with the billing and finding work, which is worth quite a bit.  Lately I've been on my own though.<p>My startup activities are limited to at night (after the kid's in bed) and some time on weekends which does put a damper on things, but it also makes me more efficient <i>and</i> since I can think more (like when driving to a client) I tend to make less mistakes.<p>And I echo what aagha said, incorporate early.  Some clients don't do 1099, only corp-to-corp.  There are some tax benefits to an SCorp as well (you can take a salary which you pay employement tax for and then take distributions which are not employment taxed).  I probably would have saved $30k over the last couple years if I'd incorporated rather than been 1099.",1205354000

The main problems that I see about the STL is that I find it more of a demo library for showing off how far you can push the generic programming metaphor than a pragmatically designed toolkit.<p>Here are a few points:<p>- Heavy template usage makes debugging hard.  The Intel compiler does the best job I've seen of reporting sane errors, but it's still ugly.<p>- Heavy template usage makes the symbol count and binary size explode.  Bigger binaries mean more cache pressure, so this slows things down, makes for bigger downloads, etc.  (For a project at work recently I had to refactor some of our template based code to be OO instead as heavy template usage and associated expansion was quite literally adding 20 MB to our application's size.)<p>- The API is fugly.",1205352951
