And once you upmod one thing, it will cost more to upmod something else soon after that.  This system might have to be seperate from the karma, but you could pay karma to get points in the other system.  It would definitely need to be refined.",1205218026

The radius varies as 1/x along the x-axis, so the volume grows as 1/x^2 while the surface area grows as 1/x. This means the growth rate of volume goes to zero much faster than that of the surface area. As a result the volume integral converges, while the surface area diverges.",1205216737

133981,comment,133731,133731,0,0,sah,,,"In my experience it's best to just get something out there as soon as it's interesting to play with.  It'll get content into your system, it'll point out problems and possibilities that haven't occurred to you, and there's nothing like real users to motivate you to focus on getting the most important things done as soon as possible.  I've worked at a number of startups that wasted a lot of time working on features that turned out not to matter at all, because they thought they couldn't release without them.<p>I sometimes hear this idea that you only get once chance to acquire users, that they'll show up, take a look, and if your product isn't good enough, they'll never come back.  I think that's just untrue.  First off, the chances that your product will cause enough of a stir to reach your entire potential userbase when it's not very good yet seem pretty low to me.  And second, there are plenty of examples of companies that had to completely reinvent their product more than once before they found success -- off the top of my head, Flickr is one of those.  I worked for another company that did that, and I didn't notice any problems getting people to look at version 2.",1205216391

133978,story,,,36,30,tel,"Ask YC: Voting Karma",,"My view of Karma is similar to my view of money: it's an artificial measure of the value you add to this site.<p>Most of my Karma comes from comments because I honestly take a pretty passive role here, taking in and commenting instead of actively adding nodes; however, I have an interesting habit. Whenever I write a comment, before I submit, I double check to see what value I'm really adding. If it's not pretty significant — if my comment is pretty much just agreement with something someone said with little additional information — I drop it and just upmod. It's a small effort to try to bring up the signal-to-noise ratio recognizing that even well meaning comments can be be noisy.<p>The part I want to call attention to is that, to me, it seems like you're still adding value when you upmod. It's far less than a full comment or submission, but you're calling attention to signal instead of noise.<p>My suggestion is that Karma could be incremented based on some fraction of the number of upmods that occur on an article you upmodded after you did so. This rewards the people who read articles (especially those on the new page) and vote so as to bring attention to something interesting.<p>Sound interesting?",1205216164
