A lot of discoveries look simple in retrospect, but keep in mind this was a complicated game that was essentially intractable until the advent of supercomputers (early reviews of thousands of hands weren't even enough to get accurate readings on the odds).<p>It took a math professor from UCLA (Thorpe) with an interest in programming to really get a handle on the odds.  We could all write a program to calculate basic strategy odds now, but at the time, it was very, very innovative.<p>While Hi-Lo and other counting systems seem pretty simple, I think it was a stroke of genius to think of this the first time.  And it was another stroke of genius to use a programming language to determine exactly when the count turned the expected return in favor of the player.  Add in statistical systems for bankroll management (ie., how do you use a small but positive expected return into a 99% chance of making money while keeping bankroll growth as high as possible), and you have some real sophistication considering that it hadn't been done before.<p>The people who did this the first time were brilliant, and personally, I think it is pretty fascinating.",1206717969

(She tried to have a mammogram in the same year that I had a simple 20-minute physical. Turns out that violated the fine print in our policy, and we had to pay out of pocket.) I'm glad to say that our uninsured, thirtysomething friend just managed to save enough money for his cancer surgery, but others of our friends aren't so lucky. And I live in <i>Massachusetts</i>, where the state has forced insurance companies to sell relatively affordable policies to individual contractors like me. If I lived in a different state, I'd probably be paying over $1000 a month for the privilege of having my claims denied.<p>So, sure, I'd love for clinical immortality to be possible, and love it even more if it were an ""unquestioned human right"". But here in the USA I don't even have the ""unquestioned right"" to <i>effective, existing medical technologies</i>, and that's a more pressing concern.<p>Meanwhile, would I want to age in a post-Singularity world? Who the hell knows? I don't think you can be immortal and still be recognizably human -- the entire design of humans is predicated on mortality, just as it's predicated on gravity and an oxygen atmosphere and the presence of edible plants and animals. And who knows what the post-human aliens will think?<p>To the extent that post-singular beings remain human, I think they'll exhibit many of the same self-destructive tendencies that humans do now. I used to be a cancer researcher, and the sight of people lighting cigarettes still makes me angry inside. It feels like they're setting fire to my hard work. But what can you do? To discount the future is part of human nature.<p>Recommended reading:<p>On the alienness of the immortal human: William Gibson's <i>Count Zero</i>.<p>On the psychology of the immortal human: Doctorow's <i>Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</i> is good. The much shorter, ha-ha-only-serious version is the tale of Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged in Douglas Adams' <i>Life, the Universe, and Everything</i>. (Douglas Adams is one of those guys whose every throwaway joke encapsulates an entire <i>series</i> of philosophical novels.)<p>On the ""unquestioned human right"" to immortality: Roger Zelazny's <i>Lord of Light</i>. You may have to read most of it before it becomes clear what I'm talking about, but keep reading. It's an awesome work.",1206717829

148569,comment,147962,147962,0,0,riobard,,,"what a hack! I LIKE this idea! It's neat!<p>Look at this code I wrote for Project Euler. it checks if a sequence is ""palindromic"". A ""palindromic"" sequence reads the same both from left and from right. So the simple idea is to check from the left of the sequence to the middle, and compare each element during the process with ones read from the right. Note here I use Python 2.5 integer division (//) to ensure the index is integer.<p>Using official Python index syntax, I have to write ""s[i] == s[-i-1]"" to compare elements on symmetric positions in the sequence.<p><pre><code>  def ispalindromic(s):
      return all(s[i] == s[-i-1] for i in range(len(s)//2))

</code></pre>
However, using the ""bitwise or"" trick proposed above, I just write ""s[i] == [s~i]"", really neat!<p><pre><code>  def ispalindromic(s):
      return all(s[i] == s[~i] for i in range(len(s)//2))</code></pre>",1206717323
