I'm assuming the ""bored developer"" wants to start a business around whatever idea he can't think of.  There are ideas, some useful, some even patentable, but to make a business you need not so much patents but the ability to present it in such a way that a prospective customer thinks, ""That provides me with more value than the price they're asking for, so I should buy it.""  Think of it this way: are Starbucks lattes patentable?  But they are a good value to half-dead zombies on their way to work/on their way back from a grueling day of work.  That makes them I think like 10 billion a year, roughly same revenue as Google.  BeOS was awesome and technically advanced and I'm sure had many patents.  Who paid for it?  Nobody.  Company's gone.  There's a difference.",1204423106

(Unless it's just another tool used for certain libraries in certain applications)<p>PHP isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be, especially PHP5.  It has a horrible reputation due to some very bad design 'decisions' made early on, but it has got a lot better.<p>I was talking with some of the core devs on #drupal last night and plenty of them are well aware of RoR and its utility -- web <i>applications</i> are very easy to write and deploy in Rails, but a big modular CMS like Drupal takes a lot of work to do it right.  It's iterative, it benefits from a network effect in terms of modules, and frankly it kicks the shit out of Radiant, Bricolage, and any other solution I've used (including hand-rolled jobbies) for that particular problem.  So, right tool for the job... it's surprising to me that 'Drupal developers can write their own ticket' because it's actually very easy to use and code to.<p>Ruby and Rails are beginning to (unjustly IMHO) get the same sort of scrutiny simply because bad programmers can use them to quickly create dogshit.  It's not the fault of the language, not unless you're using it for the wrong purpose.<p>Python never seems to have got popular enough to attract morons, and thus continues to chug merrily along at Google and elsewhere.  The last day I wrote something interesting in Perl was the first day I ported something interesting to Python.  I never really looked at Perl the same way again.  It has some truly horrific design decisions that can make it easier to write horrible ugly code than to write good code.<p>But, again -- tis a poor craftsman who blames his tools.  Having at least a passing familiarity with the strengths and weaknesses of various popular tools never hurt anyone.",1204421231

As time remains constant and life becomes more complicated, I suspect people will become more selective and use more of the kinds of services they would actually bother paying for and limiting their interactions with things that are interesting, but not enough if they actually cost something.  That said, most non-programmers usually start the ""what would I want built for me"" process from the perspective of ""that would be so useful that I might even consider paying for it"" whereas, from my experience with programmers (trying to recruit for my own startup efforts), most programmers start the ""what would I wish someone built"" process from the perspective of ""that I would respect this guy's technical ability a lot.""<p>Case in point: there are tons of ideas that can become good, useful, practical valuable services based on standard, already existing technology reconfigured in different ways.
