It seems like you'd have to either solve some pretty tricky AI problems, or get people writing for the internet to do all this extra work. It might still to feature in some larger, professionally developed sites, but I'd be surprised if it took off.",1205477991

We are getting feedback from other channels too, but we think getting comments/advices from geeks is quite valuable (especially regarding the use of AdSense, the Amazon associates program, and the concept in general), even if those comments are short and simple.<p>And I guess your strategy for ads placements will probably be more relevant later on, if the traffic ever justifies it.",1205476980

When we got to the command center area, I noticed that all of the individual computers were running Windows 9x (the ones they used to check email), but that the one hooked up to the projector with the location of all ships in the Navy on a map was running some form of Redhat 5 and GNOME. When I pointed this out to them, they turned off the project in a hurry :) (someone had forgotten to turn it off before we came in)",1205476259

They don't charge / swallow the currency conversion and international use fees, so all you pay is interbank currency conversion rate. Other cards might have ridiculous fees (minimums and up to 3.5% transaction fees).<p>My only peeve with the Capital One card is that their online interface doesn't allow automated bill payment, so you have to do it manually once a month (and not forget).<p>For ATMs, any large US bank should work fine abroad (anything that's part of the cirrus, etc. networks). Fees vary. Also try telling your bank to whitelist you for certain locations/countries.",1205475724
