In both instances, we have used MS development tools to varying degrees.  At the game studio, we primarily used visual studio - We preferred visual studio for a lot of reasons which I dont feel like enumerating in quick post;  Developing for cross platforms, VS was the best choice and supported by all first party vendors (SONY, MS, NOA).<p>Although it might be the trendy thing to bash MS, their developer tools and support are very good - Yes, .NET libraries and API's are certainly bloated in certain areas, if so, hack it to your liking and create a smaller footprint - .NET is very flexible and is really not that hard to learn;  You make it sound like learning MS technologies and other development tools/languages are mutually exclusive, when in reality anyone who has coded .NET knows that to be untrue<p>If you are asked to learn .NET in a professional environment and your response is 'Send out my resume', I'm not so sure I would like to have you on my development team.  (goes both ways I suppose, if you dislike .net so much, you should find an environment/job where you can develop to your preference)<p>Seems like I'm a shill for MS ;)  I'm not, I just think they deserve a bit more credit than they are given - in my current job we develop in a mixed mode environment with MS & LAMP (might sound weird, but it works)<p>My 2-cents",1205869462

It's just complete and total FUD.<p>Personal preferences aside, .NET is no different than any Java, Ruby/Rails, or any other programming stack. Programmers typically gravitate towards one stack or the other based on experience. Microsoft doesn't have any sort of ""evil plan"" to fill your mind with .NET.<p>As for choosing a career path, while .NET isn't the trendiest stack, there are definitely plenty of jobs to be had, just like with Java. It's true that if you're interested in working for a startup, you might want to learn Python or Ruby, but if you're interested in job security (which is what you're talking about), you better stick with the ""enterprisey"" stacks like .NET or Java.<p>I'm a .NET developer, but I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. Still, I can't stand it when people claim that everything Microsoft does is some sort of evil plan.

Then assign a confidence score using a   t-test, maybe: t = (excess return * days) / (sample variance / sqrt(number of days)), and look up the confidence level based on the t-value. Finally, rank users according to their confidence level.<p>Something else--since this is technical analysis, it would be cool if you could include some other indicators on the chart, e.g. RSI, more than one moving average, bollinger bands, etc. That could give you some cool metrics--you could track how well each combination of indicators improves picks, by user and in aggregate.",1205866837
