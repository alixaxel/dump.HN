151094,comment,150993,150993,0,0,pjf,,,"What is the reason of increased noise? Isn't it the popularity?<p>In my opinion, yes. Whenever the site got mentioned somewhere, a new stream of unimportant topics appeared.<p>Why can't or shouldn't the gravity be dependent on submitter reputation? Wouldn't we find any techniques to prevent gaming such a system? If the raw importance, not gaining another karma points, matters, shouldn't we consider moderation by selected hackers?<p>Sorry for asking so many questions, but I find these being very fundamental to any further considerations about limiting anything. If you want to do this, you have to have some authority.<p>I strongly support the idea of opening the HN database. This would let the others build interfaces around it, experiment, and hopefully find better approaches to limiting the noise.<p>As a summary, please note that in case of increasing the quality, one has to do any of the following:
 - increase the signal,
 - limit the noise,
 - develop better techniques for dealing with poor SNRs (but I find this being unapplicable by humans).<p>To make things clear, my comment is solely about limiting the noise. I'd be very happy to hear ideas on actually increasing the signal.",1206975039

To define the problem well, I think access to the news.YC data would be very helpful.<p>So a meta-idea would be to open the news.YC database of users, submissions, posts, and ratings. That way, we can look for specific changes in voting/submission patterns. In particular, I'd like to know:<p>- how post length has changed over time<p>- how strong the correlation between post length and score is<p>- if participation has dropped among those who used to contribute the most valuable comments<p>- the average comment score over time<p>I don't see any downsides - news.YC isn't looking for profit, or to be acquired, so there doesn't see to be much use in protecting the data...<p>How about it, Paul?",1206973305
