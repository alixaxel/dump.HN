Rather than listing all of your skills list only the skills that job requires plus a few extra closely related.<p>Listing too many skills can get your resume tossed because the resume reader will see a lot of Adobe products listed and think you're more of a graphic designer than a developer. Concentrate on what the job opening asked for.",1204671517

Here is a summary of my opinions (note from a year ago).<p>pylons: didn't really like the lack of decorators, didn't seem to be an ORM of choice, docs looked weak although the wiki was well stocked with recipies<p>django: really well documented. Seemed to be HUGE and I felt intimidated by it. It wasn't clear to me I could strip it down to what I needed. Didn't seem very modular, you can only use the Django ORM and templating engine.<p>web.py: Far to simple for my needs, you need to build nearly everything from scratch, simple to learn because there is nothing there!<p>I chose Turbo Gears because it seemed easier to chose the components you want to use. The idea that the TurboGears community picks best of breed python components and integrated them really appealed to me. This is both good and bad but in general I think it's been good for the project.<p>A year later and I haven't been disappointed. The TG community is really friendly as well :) TG is working with the pylons team for the next version of TurboGears and I know there has been a lot of code sharing between the groups.<p>That's my 2p, good luck.",1204670034

So in that sense, you don't know what you're going to write until you actually write it.  The act of writing one thing triggers new thoughts and ideas, which you immediately write down, which triggers more ideas.<p>To me, that's the only fun kind of writing.

It's poor, it's biased and it's written like utter capitalist garbage and not credible criticism. Simply put: It's the same shit I've heard for years about socialism, the only thing is that Europe is a bigger faster growing economy than the US. Uhh that means socialism WINS and capitalism LOSES, the market is the ultimate truth and that is capitalist doctrine #1.<p>EU 3% growth, US 2.2% growth.
EU $16.37 trillion GDP(OER), US $13.79 trillion GDP(OER)
US inflation is also .9% higher, which means the US GDP(OER) is going to get worse every year.<p>The US currently beats the EU on poverty line by about 3%, however the EU keeps bringing in countries with unemployment and poverty lines well above acceptable levels, and hey go figure the EU is still growing better than the US.<p>I'm sorry, but all 'evidence' of a benefit to capitalism is bull. It's already been proven that people in the US spend on average twice as much on health care as people in the UK(with the worlds largest nationalised health survice) and the poor in the UK are as healthy as the US' rich. That means there's a proportionally larger, healthier and more productive work force in the UK than the US.<p>So EU has the #1 economy in the world, it has several of the best health care systems in the world (competing for #1 between UK and Germany really) that are slowly spreading throughout Europe... and the US has what now?
