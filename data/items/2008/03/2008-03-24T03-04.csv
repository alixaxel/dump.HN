I'll have to work on that.<p>Keep in mind that different situations demand different writing styles.  For instance, if you are trying to resolve a bitter conflict, ""writing things that cannot be disputed"" is just the way to go.  In that situation, your #1 objective would be to find things that both parties agree on, and build up from that.  (This also might be a good way to win an argument.)",1206331041

In principle they don't have to worry about offending local sensibilities any more than an American magazine writing about China.  At least that's the official story....",1206330977

144287,comment,144105,144105,0,0,dejb,,,"I think it ranks up there with 'Ideas are worthless'. You could just as well say the 'Air is worthless' or 'Air is nothing more than medium that can be used for commercial flight'.<p>The ability to monetize something is not the only measure of its value - the benefit that it causes the world is another important measure if value (this could be measured economically or otherwise). In an ideal economy, total 'value' would be maximized when the 'benefit' and 'monetization' metrics of value were closely aligned as it would lead to the best allocation of resources. Or to put it another way - things would be best if people were rewarded for doing good, useful things.<p>Of course the practicalities of the world don't always make this possible. But to try to cut someone down like Arrington did for suggesting that it would be better if musicians could received compensation for the enjoyment their recordings provide is in my view incorrect and immoral.",1206328878

All in all, they have a very pessimistic view of the world in general and the free market in particular. The startup crowd is long-gone from reddit.<p>My hypothesis is that this effect comes from the international nature of reddit's audience. I hope this hasn't become the normal thinking of people in the US.",1206328562

144281,comment,140989,140994,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Stress is really a function of whether you care about the outcome, not how much work it is.  In my first full-time job, I didn't give a damn about whether the company failed or succeeded since I was gone in a year anyway, and it was one of the least stressful periods of my life.  When I first went to college, I figured I'd coast and forget about grades, and had a blast.  When I started flunking out and I realized I didn't want to throw away 4 years without a degree, it got stressful.  When it became virtually certain that I'd flunk out, my stress level just evaporated, despite the fact that I was working harder than ever (I ended up getting that degree after all).  Then my second full-time job was very stressful because I actually cared how the company did and yet big factors in the outcome were outside of my control.",1206328453

Now how many lawnmowers are in circulation? Certainly I own one, I have an IOU for one lawnmower. And of course Bob owns one, he's mowing his lawn. If I swap out my lawnmower IOU for some cheesecake and a Tijuana Brass LP, now I'm creating currency and inflating the money supply, since really anything can be currency, ask all those people swapping around cell phone minutes.<p>I think this is confusing for currency because the IOUs look so much like the real thing.",1206328203

144275,comment,144014,144233,0,0,wallflower,,,"The best (yet flawed) analogy I ever heard for a large company. People in a company are like gears in a complex gearworking. Some gears have more influence/leverage such that if a big gear (GM) moves a little a lot of smaller gears may start moving faster. And to cap off the analogy, sometimes a movement causes some other gears to go backwards. It was from a VP too.",1206327712
144274,comment,144197,144209,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I've found that I rarely know the right name for a variable until I've written a significant amount of code that depends on that variable.  Refactoring's a must for me, because otherwise what the code says would have little relationship to what it does.  I don't think this is due to a lack of foresight or planning (I <i>do</i> pencil & paper design notes before I start coding); it's more that in the process of coding, I discover abstractions and common code that that aren't apparent until the code's actually written.",1206327634
