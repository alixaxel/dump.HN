132295,comment,131548,132278,0,0,curi,,,"Most of my practical advice is nothing too special. You could get video previews for some shows, or get descriptions or read reviews and explain what it's about to child and see if he likes the sound of it. You can offer to get more of the same kind as something he likes. Parents already do these things at least sometimes.<p>What parents don't generally do is have an attitude of trying to get whatever their child likes. They do that ""within reasonable limits"". Reasonable being a matter of their own judgment. They have preconceived ideas about what shows are bad, and try to avoid their child finding out about them instead of refuting the bad ideas. They fear ""bad influences"", instead of thinking that the worse an idea is, the less persuasive it is.<p>One consequence of this attitude is that sometimes children want something, and their parents refuse, supposedly for the child's own good, and the child gets upset. Plenty of parents would, if their kid saw an episode of Veggie Tales (or whatever) and liked and repeated some ideas from it, say ""omg the evil christians are polluting his mind"" and forbid him from seeing the second episode that he's looking forward to. That's the wrong approach. Keeping people ignorant of ideas you think are bad is not the path to the truth.",1205027350

For me, the most valuable part of the competition was how inspirational it turned out to be. Seeing how much was accomplished under severe constraints (48 hours, max 4 people per team) shed new light on all my other development efforts.<p>I imagine that people who do well at such competitions would be better hires, but that would be due to other factors - passion for coding, good time management skills, etc. I doubt it's a major difference, though.",1205025841
132282,comment,132074,132250,0,0,Electro,,,"If you could mount a powerful cell phone repeater it would be more valuable than an Aerostat as whenever a cell tower is taken down, you simply need to fly one or more over an area to cover it.<p>They might even be a cheaper more efficient way of covering densely populated areas than paying exorbitant land fees and the constant battle to get them placed. I really don't see how a plane that can fly for 5 years wouldn't benefit the Cellular industry.<p>It would also help wildlife studies. I mean simply program one to follow a high density of radio transmitters, and tag as many birds as humanly possible before they migrate and then you've got perminant tracking and monitoring of the birds flight positions. The plane could be equipped to transmit the locations through a satellite telephone link or other such device.<p>I'm sure there are thousands of uses. Terrain mapping, you just strap a camera to the bottom and GPS and you could have it build up a high detailed map of an area. I mean it would be a lot more useful for any industry that requires land surveys as getting a high detailed map with a wide angled lense would allow you to build up a topological map.<p>Hell you might even be able to spot useful resources, or really anything visible from altitude. Police could use it to find recent graves with infrared and optical sensors and it'd be cheaper and faster in open areas than using people.<p>As I write this I realise the list is literally nearly endless, so I think I'll save myself the time and STFU now before I get carpel tunnel!",1205025711

At age 17, they need someone to walk them through the college admissions game. Most poor/middle class folks don't have that.<p>When I applied to college, I figured it was grades and SAT's. I didn't have anyone to tell me to engage in activities to fit the admission's office checkboxes (i.e., ""leadership experience"" or ""community service"" looks better than ""programmer at a .com""). No one told me that ""ambitious, will try to graduate college early"" doesn't make admissions officers happy.<p>Overall I'm quite happy where I wound up. But admissions coaching would have helped if I were rich enough to have it.",1205025550

I also remove any desktop image and setup four desktops, each a primary-ish color.  I then select a fairly minimalist theme to reduce wasted chrome space.<p>I also give common menu items numeric or unique leading characters so that I can navigate the main program menu more easily without a mouse.<p>I have some shortcuts for popping up gvim with my One Big File of notes, and another for bringing up /tmp/crap.txt for scratch space.<p>I adjust the icons, systray, etc to use minimal space ( though I don't care for show/hide task bars; I prefer to always see it).  I set it so that I only see the aps assigned to current desktop.<p>I think the biggest souping comes from a collection of command line scripts I've assembled to automate various this.  Basically, if I don't have a super-direct keyboard shortcut for something then I have a Ruby script to make it happen.<p>Assorted apps I add in: Mercurial, Gimpshop, gvim, ruby built from source, VMware server, Firefox with 2-dozen add-ons, Pidgen, kvirc,  Picassa, Inkscape,  and the Gnome terminal (though I use Kubuntu).",1205025061

It should be the child's decision, with advice from his parent.<p>The fundamental issue is that if you can't persuade someone of your ideas, that is a bad reason to force him. If your child wants to see a religious video despite your advice, then he should see it. If it's full of dumb ideas it won't be very persuasive anyway, right? Certainly not more persuasive than the wise parent..?",1205024686
