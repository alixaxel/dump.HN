You see, you can download the SDK and do all of the testing you want . . . good luck running your code on an actual iPhone though.  A lot of developers read the fine print, and skipped over the finer print.  To try out your newly developed games, or virtual worlds, against the actual iPhone accelerometer you have to be accepted into the OFFICIAL iPhone Developer's Program.  Guess how many of the 100000 developers who downloaded the SDK were accepted into the program . . . Oh . . . So then you read the article already . . .<p><a href=""http://apple20.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/03/15/apple-to-100000-iphone-developers-dont-call-us-well-call-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apple20.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/03/15/apple-to-100...</a><p>The short version is that Apple is giving its strategic partners a head start, EA, Salesforce, AOL, Epocrates, Sega . . . and Apple quoted a quite a few more the press release Intuit, Namco, Netsuite, PopCap . . . you get the idea.  Good for Apple, its partners, and probably the iPhone . . . Bad for startups who happen to compete with something one of the partners wants to do.  Guess which app will get the splash page billing on the iTunes App store, the startup's or the partner's?<p>There is SOME good news though, if someone is willing to search past the first page of the iTunes app store to look for your app, they will probably be able to find and install it without much trouble.  Of course that is ASSUMING that you are allowed into the OFFICIAL developer's program, which there is no guarantee of either if you are making an app that competes with a strategic partner.<p>Cheers!",1205603969

This is essentially how YC works -- the prototype is the idea displayed, not executed -- PG is the veter.<p>One can simply move this to an earlier stage.  One must establish oneself (or one's group) as an expert in a specific area, then have persons submit their ideas to your organization. You review them, and offer them to sale to interested parties.<p>This is essentially how VC works but I believe it could be re-encapsulated at an earlier stage, esp. with software engineering projects which are primarily idea drivien.<p>To the doubters out there, this is simply specialization of labor in a growing industry.  Not everyone should attempt to do anything.  Compare journalism.  Editors, Writers, Editoralists, Proof Readers, Managers.  All work to some degree with the text.

That's a very personal attack against a person that is making a very personal choice to publish his own content. I think you could only attack him if the content he published was of a different nature, say scientific data, government documents or general public stuff. But he can share his own data the way he wishes too, and I don't think you have the right to call him an asshole for that.<p>I understand the sum of personal choices can generate a problem for the general population, but in any case you can't attack the individual choices: you can't either regulate them by law (as in many other cases where individual choices get regulated for society's common well), or just let them be.",1205603311

That you found the standing-still experiments an interesting way to measure child self-regulation is also a valid opinion I respect.<p>It is the pairing of the two opinions into the unsupported statement ""Standing Still Predicts School Success Better Than IQ"", and then the promotion of that dubious statement to the key position of headline, that I find objectionable.<p>Alternate approaches I wouldn't have objected to:<p>* contribute article with original headline, but post a first comment with ""I found it interesting that the article suggests ability to stand still for longer may predict executive function, and thus school success, better than IQ.""<p>* contribute article with original headline plus appended pot-stirring question: ""Old-Fashioned Play Builds Serious Skills (Does standing-still predict success better than IQ?)<p>Or, if HN were to someday allow a comment-with-submission or subhead-with-submission, that would be a great place for highlighting an opinionated takeaway from deep in the article, even though the article's main thrust is something else.",1205603227

I gave it a try, it's actually pretty nice.<p>Basically, traits provide reusable components of behavior that are not tied to classes. It's pretty sweet. It lets you do things like delegate data members/methods to other objects.<p>For instance:<p><pre><code>    class employee(HasTraits):
        employer=Trait(company)

    class manager(employee):
        hire=Delegate('employer','hire')
</code></pre>
This code causes an employee to have an employer data member, which MUST be a company object. So far, just static typing (checked at runtime).<p>The manager subclass of an employee has a ""hire"" method. But a manager doesn't hire employees himself; instead, he hires employees on behalf of his employer. So boss.hire(emp) is delegated to the boss's employer, and is equivalent to boss.employer.hire(emp).<p>It has lots of other cute features like this as well. Take a look.",1205602474

137610,comment,137536,137605,0,0,tim2,,,"Correction, the companies that I have experience with were not US based.<p>I will elaborate on why everyone loses. The workers lose because they are paid less than if they were free to find the highest paying job, and have to invest a large amount of money to get here (points 2 and 3.) America loses because the workers are forced into earning less money than they would if they didn't need to go with these companies to give them more than a remote chance of getting a visa. This undercuts American workers (point 1.)<p>The governments may let these companies do this is because the companies pass off their process as selecting higher quality visa candidates. Immigrants like them because they know they will not be turned down for a visa if they go through the company (and getting turned down causes problems later - what the hell??). Still, bad.",1205600760
