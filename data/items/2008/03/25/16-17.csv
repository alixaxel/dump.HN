Maybe some of them acutally don't like you, but I am quite sure this is not true for everybody.<p>If you publish something (in any media) you will get different opinions. Some people will agree, some will not. Some will express support, some will express critique. You can respond to that, they can respond to your response etc. This is called discussion. As a result of discussion some people will change their mind, and some will simply agree that they don't agree. Especially when the subject is life style, where there is no ""one size fits all"". I like spinach, others don't. You feel free in startup, I don't (taking care of non-technical stuf, bleeeeh).<p>The other thing is that written word (like your essays) is taken more seriously than if it was said by mouth, so the lions metaphor would be absolutely not a problem if said over a beer, but when written it left impression, that you call ""corporate"" folks' lives a piece of crap, while some of them CHOSE corporate as giving THEM more freedom (by some definition of freedom) than startup.<p>As simple as that - no size fits all, people care about different things, leaving impression, that their life is worse because of that will do no good.<p>Cheers!",1206463683

145826,comment,145631,145631,0,0,indiejade,,,"My advice is contrary to what most people here are saying:  avoid both the headhunter firm, and companies that utilize headhunter firms.<p>To begin, there's a _reason_ they're ""all over you.""  I know and have been there, too, sometimes getting several calls in one day from various agencies.  Any phone call that begins with ""I'm so and so with such and such IT staffing.  I have a client that. . ."" is a no-no in my book.  Headhunters don't care how much money you make, only how much you can make them.<p>They tend to like to leech the maximum amounts possible both from you and from the company you are sent to work for ""for them.""  The really pathetic thing is most headhunters/recruiters don't even know what they're talking about tech-wise.  Sure, they may have some smooth telephone skills, but that's about it.  The most laughable one called me up to ask if I knew what RHEL stood for.<p>The constant barrage of calls and such from them should tell you:  (a) that there are more leeches like them than there are people like you and (b) that your time and talent are potentially valuable to somebody somewhere, but that various obstacles exist in your line of communication.<p>Maybe I'm just a stickler for efficiencies, but seriously.  Putting yourself behind a ""brick wall"" (IT staffing/headhunter) even if the company you want to work for is indeed on the other side of that brick wall can be really frustrating.  It's especially frustrating when you have to re-arrange that brick wall every time, just to get anything done.<p>One more thing to note: The fact that this ""startup"" is already utilizing a headhunter firm would worry me if I were you. Usually companies don't tend to need to pawn off hiring duties until they're unable to handle hiring on their own:  this can be an early warning sign.<p>I don't know if I can speak for the group, but I think most of us here on HN value our independence and as someone earlier mentioned ""being stuck"" anywhere just doesn't factor into the equation.<p>P.S.  I'm sorry, but it's not a ""valuable service"" when it's something that anybody can easily do on their own.  MBA Rule #1:  managers should not ask others to do something they can do themselves; this includes searching for, seeking out and talking to potential employees _directly_.",1206462909

Why would a buyer's agent be a good faith representative in negotiations if it was in their personal interest that the sale price be higher?<p>The only reason this has worked for so long is that Realtors collude on the commission (it's 6% everywhere... there is no price competition). They also actively try to control entrance into the profession to make sure everyone tows the line.<p>To me, a fee-based buying agent makes much more sense. Barring that, at least pay them as a percentage of the difference between the asking and final price. That way if you get the house for $10k under the asking price, they can have 35% of that, rather than 3% of the total value of the home.",1206462325

145815,comment,145654,145654,0,0,gruseom,,,"I had an idea as I was reading this. Open source seems counterintuitive because it gives away code, which people assume is valuable. As the article says, ""How can you build a business by giving away the store?"" But what if code isn't that valuable?<p>More precisely, what if code isn't worth very much <i>when separated from the programmers who wrote it</i>? This notion explains a lot. It explains why source code theft is almost unheard of (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36551</a>) - except, of course, programmers taking copies of their own code with them when they leave a company (I'm sure I've never done that). It explains why codebases decay so quickly when they're handed off for maintenance, and why rewrites almost always fail when they're not done by the original team. It explains why people don't really buy or sell source code as such.<p>It also matches the experience of working programmers, which is: most code sucks; other people's code really sucks (""it's all shit"", an oldtimer once told me); and it's often easier to write code than to read it.<p>The best description I've found of this idea is Peter Naur's (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=121291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=121291</a>). Naur puzzled over cases where, even when code was well written <i>and</i> well documented, other programmers (not members of the original team) screwed it up. His explanation for this is that the program is not the code. Rather, the program is a set of mental constructs (Naur uses the word ""theory"") that live in the minds of the programmers writing it. Code is merely the canonical written expression of the program, and it's a lossy one: given only the code, you can't reconstruct the theory. Since the theory exists in the minds of the team, if you lose the team, you lose the theory, and with it most of the value.<p>Viewed this way, the economics of open source vis-à-vis closed source are not nearly so counterintuitive. If code isn't that valuable, then open source isn't ""giving away the store"" at all. And if what <i>is</i> valuable is the theory of the program in Naur's sense, then open source adds value by extending the theory to a larger base of programmers, something that closed source has tried and failed to do for years.<p>If open source is value-creating, it's not an economic paradox. It only looks that way because people (especially non-programmers) have a mistaken model of software value. It's not surprising that it would take time for business models and infrastructure to catch up.",1206462061
