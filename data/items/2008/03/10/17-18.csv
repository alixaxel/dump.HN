133268,comment,133055,133213,0,0,palish,,,"Hoo, boy.  Where to begin?<p><i>C#(.NET)</i><p>Convoluting C# and .NET is a bad idea.  C# is a programming language and .NET is a platform.  If someone writes a compiler that translates your favorite language into CIL, your language can then be used to create .NET assemblies (modules) and interface with every other .NET assembly.  In other words, write your program using any syntax you like and use any library you want.  Someone even wrote a LOLCode .NET compiler ( <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/lolcode-dot-net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/lolcode-dot-net/</a> ).<p><i>It stopped looking elegant and fun and started looking like the schematic to build the HVAC system for a skyscraper. Ditto for C#.</i><p>Are you referring to the C# programming language or the .NET platform?  C# 3.0 includes implicit typing and lambda functions ( <a href=""http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/0/4703eba2-78c4-4b09-8912-69f6c38d3a56/LanguageEnhancements.wmv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/0/4703eba2-78c4-4...</a> ), which are both elegant and fun.  .NET 3.0 still includes every bit of functionality from .NET 1.1, so at what point did the platform become inelegant?<p><i>When I wanted to figure out how bittorrent works, I just went and read the spec published by Bram Cohen. I didn't have to call up his company and ask for a Certified Bittorrent Engineer to come out and train me onsite in a three day session that costs $8000.</i><p>When I wanted to figure out how .NET worked, I just read its free and extremely comprehensive documentation ( <a href=""http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a4t23ktk.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a4t23ktk.aspx</a> ).  Also, high-quality documentation is one area where Microsoft whips almost everyone in, and documentation is <i>really</i> important for popularity.  Apple has also nailed it with their iPhone SDK docs ( <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/iphone/</a> ).  If you're trying to grow a platform, you'll want to take notes.<p>Let's also not forget the extremely powerful WYSIWYG GUI editor ( <a href=""http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/315/designer.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/315/designer.PNG</a> ).<p>Garbage collected languages can sometimes outperform other languages (read: C++) because of the design of a moving garbage collector.  Every .NET language uses a moving garbage collector.<p>That said, it does have many flaws.  The biggest one is probably the Windows lock-in.  Mono is nice, but not quite complete.",1205170328
