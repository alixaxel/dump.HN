Figure 30% taxes, and you're at $8517 annually.<p>Who has better knowledge and/or google-fu to dig up what an average german welfare recipient makes per year?<p>(Also, most states have a higher minimum wage than 5.85: <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm</a> .

128856,comment,128816,128816,0,0,gcv,,,"Fascinating stuff. I wish a northern state, like Montana, would try a similar experiment in half of its counties, and ditch daylight saving time for a year and see what happens. I suspect it would save money, too.<p>On a slightly more hackerish note: I worked on a power trading system, and it would break like hell twice a year, on DST switch days. Because electricity trades on an hourly basis (except in Texas, which uses 15-minute intervals), everyone who deals with aggregating power flow or power over the course of a day, ends up writing a loop like ""for (hour = 0; hour < 24; hour++) { ... }"", which is totally wrong. The spring forward day has 23 hours, and the fall back day has 25. That code therefore breaks twice a year and loses money because (a) it needs to be fixed, and (b) it did its accounting wrong. I hope studies examining the economic efficiency of DST take this sort of thing into account. Probably not.",1204641948

We've a culture of what's called 'begrudgery' - speaking ill of people who succeed - though in truth it doesn't seem to have held us back.<p>As to the things you describe I doubt they're of the same caliber. Someone starting a business here will often look to government grants and other funds for bootstrap cash. Does that create a bad environment though? In some ways yes, Govt may not be quick to hand over money and may not have the understanding a lot of venture capitalists do, but overall I don't think so: I know quite a few small business owners and technology startups, it certainly doesn't seem excessively detrimental. I've no experience of that scene in the US though.<p>In Ireland at least, I think we develop polar love/hate relationships with those that succeed, either lauding or slandering them. Micheal O'Leary of Ryanair is a good example.<p>I come from a family of business owners and starters and know many others. I've also worked on EU-wide research projects (telecoms related; and see little of the resentment the article implies is prevalent). As such my experience is obviously rather selective.",1204641821

I think there are lots of people that get stuck in the equivalent of ""I'm a waiter now, but just waiting for my big break"" sort of thing for decades in acting/music/startup thing.<p>I find these type of stories to be useless, because it doesn't separate the difference between ""those that stuck to it and made it"" and those that ""stuck to it and mired in limbo""  While both luck and skills play into it, a lot of people lean too heavily on luck and not enough time developing their skills.  I think it's important to be persistent, but persistent so you get better at what you do.  Be undeniably good, so all it takes is a little luck, not a lot of luck.<p>Ironically, there's a demotivational poster that says ""If all it takes is a pretty picture and a cute little saying to inspire you, then your job is what robots will be doing soon.

A more comparable figure to the German number might be 8% if you count people who have given up on job searching and don't get counted in the official statistics.<p>To make a full comparison you might also want to look at the number of people working part time jobs that really want to be working full time. Our laws encourage employers to split some kinds of work among part time employees rather than hire full time employees. The economy still has just as many unemployed man hours, but they don't show up in the statistics because each individual is employed.
