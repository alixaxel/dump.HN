141321,comment,140651,140651,0,0,njoubert,,,"Thanks to everyone that replied. My friend made a great comment today when he pointed out that, for the most part, people go to work at startups so that they can get in on the ground floor - pull those extra hours and accept less pay because hopefully you will be able to build the company out into a moneymaking venture. As an intern, those reasons are absent, since you're leaving shortly after you start with no stock or any other ""i was there first""goodies anyways.<p>On the other hand, the web startup is probably more along the lines of what I would like to be doing long term, and one of the founders is already assuming a mentorship position - he called me a couple of times, and rather than trying to push his side, he's giving me some guidance and opinions on how to approach this kind of decision. This is, naturally, great for a student like me.<p>Still undecided, but i'll probably make up my mind throughout the night. Thank you for the candid discussion everyone!",1205977825

I mean, sure, they're both sports, but they're completely different games.<p>I feel like the things I learned in a big and small companies are largely orthogonal and it's hard to say which is more valuable without knowing what the original poster is hoping to use that experience for.",1205977689

141308,comment,140602,140658,0,0,pfedor,,,"It depends on what you mean by ""fail"". If it means ""drop out before getting a PhD"", then you are surely right. But that's not how most people who enter PhD programs in sciences define success. They want a tenure track position afterwards (possibly with a few years of posdoc positions in between), and eventually they want to become tenured professors. And I suspect--I can't back it with any numbers though--the failure rate for them is of the same order of magnitude as for startups.",1205976783
141307,comment,141240,141240,0,0,TrevorJ,,,"Products also get really nuanced at the higher ""Power user"" skill levels since users tend to specialize their skills in ever more specific ways.<p>For instance, in my line of work if you are a 3D generalist, it won't matter a ton what of the top 3 or 4 animation packages you go with, but if you specialize in really really high end character animation it matters very much.<p>Taking it even further, if you are setting the bar for character animation the way Pixar or Dreamworks does, you'll be using highly customized very specific tools written directly to handle the specific requirements of a particular film script.",1205976129
141306,comment,141248,141286,0,0,matstc,,,"I agree with you but I wouldn't be so stark. My email address book is still the one thing that I maintain and keep up to date. As social networks come and go, that address book remains current. That's why a lot of social networks will offer to import my contacts when I sign up to a new service. Email is the reference and is constantly being leveraged.<p>Also, as the article says, the initial impetus of connecting with friends of friends and old acquaintances from high school quickly wears off. Once that fun is gone, what is left is a broken and boring network that might not be so valuable to a business.",1205976051
