Lawyers to help you get favorable terms, tax ppl to help you understand the tax implications (there is a GAINORMOUS DIFFERENCE between long term capital gains and short term).

130308,comment,130228,130228,0,0,Flemlord,,,"With a more mature company, the valuation method is fairly straightforward. The ratio depends on your industry. Find a few equivalent companies and average their PE ratios. Then subtract somewhere between 20-40%, depending on how new/mature your product and customers are. Multiply it by your current earnings (on a run-rate basis). That's the fair price.<p>If you aren't profitable yet, you can do the same thing with the Price/Sales ratio, although that's more subjective and less accurate. It sounds like you may be new enough that all of these methods are out the window, and your valuation is based purely on your hotness and growth potential. In that case, I don't really know what you're worth. The only way to establish a fair value is to get a bidding war going.<p>Actually, if you are truly on an exponential growth vector then 3-4x earnings sounds low. Why would you even consider it? In a year, you would have earned more than you would have made by selling the company. Is there any reason to think your earnings have leveled off? Also, is this a cash or stock deal? Is the payout no-strings-attached or is there an earn-out requirement with target revenues?",1204777735

It would be well worth it if it buys you more time on your product.<p>As for processes, it seems like engineering processes are mainly affected by one decision: how do you break up milestones/versions? You can 1) aim for a constant amount of time per cycle, and cut a prioritized list of issues to fit or 2) decide what you need to do for a milestone, estimate the time required for each issue, and go at it until you finish. I've seen successful projects in both areas, so maybe it's a style thing. The important thing is that you do something.<p>Another important thing is deciding the lifecycle of a bug/improvement/feature. And toss it out the window for things that are easier to do than to file.<p>Also, as the project matures, you need a story for the division of eng time between bug fixing and creating new features. If you do support, you'll need a way to respond to the pressure from that. Maybe alternating responsibilities between engineers would help keep a constant response time to customer issues.<p>For team organization, trying to split things up into silos with less than 4 engineers or so seems pretty counterproductive, unless there is a huge disparity for some particular skill. As you grow, organize teams around major areas: frontend, backend, developer support, etc.<p>If you're going to be hiring, decide on how interviews will be carried out and what the decision criteria will be. Keeping it fairly uniform will allow you to measure it better.<p>The important thing is to stay responsive to feedback from the trenches (even if ""the trenches"" is just you for now).<p>Just some off-the-cuff ideas that your post brought to mind.",1204777193

130300,comment,129848,129848,0,0,avinashv,,,"I spent 20 years in Dubai, and when this article came up on other sites months ago, it urked me how many mistakes there were.  I'll address the glaring ones.<p>1. No, that's not true.  Taxi drivers usually have a <i>great</i> sense of direction and locations.  It takes time to get used to giving directions by landmarks, but that isn't always necessary.  Houses are usually in areas where it is easy to reference the community, street, house number etc.  Apartment buildings have names, and if you name the location, street and building you're fine.  I've never been ""expected to draw a map"".  Mail delivery to your door is not impossible.<p>2. Got nothing here, unfortunately.  Etisalat (the oldest and primary ISP) does do this, but mine (my parents still live there) does not.  I speak to my parents using Skype, I can play poker online and since the ISP is privatized (Etisalat is not), they aren't bound to obey the Islamic laws that make Etisalat filter content through a proxy.<p>3. There isn't sand everywhere.  It is in a desert, but if you walk around you won't get covered in sand.  It is incredibly hot though, yes.  But so is Texas.<p>4. First, the author complains that there aren't enough plants.  When the government solves this problem, then it becomes an issue of water consumption.  All water is desalinated, and the government foots the bill.  By the way, Dubai has more greenery than Manhattan.<p>5. I don't know where this author went, but of course there is poverty and so there are going to be poorly maintained toilets.  In 20 years in Dubai, I never had to use anything that wasn't a proper, Western-style toilet.  Oh, and Burj Al-Arab is a 5-star hotel.<p>6. There were issues with labor exploitation, and I can't argue that this isn't a problem.  Unless you're working in construction or something along those lines, this isn't going to affect you.  I have never met anybody (neither has anybody I know) that has had their passport taken from them for a decade.<p>7. That is true.  Dubai is very expensive.  But this isn't a secret: <a href=""http://www.citymayors.com/economics/expensive_cities2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citymayors.com/economics/expensive_cities2.html</a><p>8. This is just idiocy: break the law and you will be fined.  I actually find the way the city of Dubai manages intersections very well.  Everything is clearly marked out, if you can turn on red then there will be a separate lane to do so that will actually turn off.  Cops are much more ubiquitous than claimed; ""weeks"" driving around without seeing one?  Bah, maybe in your driveway.<p>9. And now we're insulting people on their religious beliefs?  If someone wants to dress like that, let them.  You are under no obligation to do so.  In the summer, I walk around in shorts and sandals.  15% or so of the population is local, and I guarantee you not everyone dresses like that.<p>10. Maybe people stare at her because she is hot.  Or extremely ugly.  Or because she is a white girl who for some reason thinks she should be wearing a full burkha.  As I already mentioned, around 15% of are local, so it's not like they haven't seen a white girl before.<p>11. No, it isn't.  Prostitutes are illegal.  There are also prostitutes in New York, London, Tokyo, etc. etc.<p>12. No.  Alcohol can only be sold for on-site consumption at bars and restaurants in hotels and some clubs.  To buy it for yourself at home, you have to go to government-approved stores (African & Eastern is the company that has the distribution rights) and buy from them.  Yes, it is expensive.  Canada does this in much the same way (government stores that are more expensive than they would be in, for example, the United States).  The liquor license isn't needed to consume alcohol in your house, it is needed to buy alcohol.<p>13. One by one: for rent: I've never heard of this, and I can't attest to it's accuracy, as my dad owns his own business.  For telephones: I think this is wrong.  I have friends who have walked into stores and gotten their own phones.  In fact, there are special cheaper tourist packages that have shorter expiry dates etc.  Satellite?  Again, can't speak for sure, but I am going to say this is wrong, just as I've never heard it.<p>14. There is no road where the speed limit is 160 kmph (100 mph) in the United Arab Emirates.  Kids are kids.  Kids in Dubai aren't more prone to be stupid.<p>15. ""Litte business""?  No.  Weekends are what they are for religious reasons--Friday has the religious signifance in Islam that Sunday does in Christianity.<p>16. Dubai has MBC2, which was, at conception, the world's only free-to-air movie channel.   I've watched lots of big-name movies on there.  As with all other channels.  Television is syndicated late for the most part because American networks don't feel that the UAE is a market worth giving premiers to.  As for commercials...come on.  If a show is 42 minutes long and is put in an hour slot, the time has to come from somewhere.  Commercials repeat regularly--this isn't a problem only with Dubai--because companies bought two slots.  That's it.<p>17. This is because the author is unfamiliar.  I've mentioned what I think about the roads already.<p>18. Are we back on taxi drivers again?  There is some definite racism by a white person here against people who are normally from in and around India.<p>19. Speeding is a major problem, yes.  I'll be the first to say that I won't be surprised if Sheikh Zayed Road has the highest per-capita death rate on the planet of any single road. 30% tinting is allowed to anyone, local women can get much higher because they can take off their burkhas in the car to drive with unhindered vision but with the security that their face won't be seen by a man that isn't their husband.<p>20. Touché.<p>There's about 50 words of <i>real</i> complaint spread into 20 link bait points.  Hilariously enough, the author mentions ""tax breaks, multi-cultural environments, and beautiful buildings"" which to me, are incredible.  There are few countries, nay, cities, in the Middle East that are as welcoming and appealing to expatriates.  They should take her visa away.",1204776892

If you can't convince a developer that you bring needed value to the execution of that idea, and you can't pay developers to work on your idea, then you have nothing.<p>In six years you could have learned to program well enough to build a kickass demo--the fact that you haven't makes it pretty clear to developers that you don't believe in your idea enough to commit your own time to it (other than, apparently, thinking really hard about it)...but you'd be really happy to have someone else commit time to it and share the results with you.  Hell, with the quality of modern tools, if you started today, you could have a proof of concept running in a year, even if you've never seen a terminal or a text editor before.  Python, Ruby, Perl, and even PHP, make developing simple applications, well, simple.<p>Sorry if I seem to be dismissing you without knowledge of your idea or your actual work in the field, but this is what you're facing in trying to get someone to write your software for you, for free.  This is what you have to overcome, and I hope I've made it clear that the way you are presenting it is not going to do that.  What you think you're saying, and what an engineer hears you saying, are apparently two very different things.  I suspect you think you're saying, ""I've done all of the legwork and research and hard work leading up to actual development, and now I just need a technical person to put these well-researched pieces together.""  But, an engineer hears, ""I've done nothing but have super cool ideas for the past six years, and now I'd like you to implement my vague and over-reaching specifications into a product, for free, and share the results with me.""<p>You can't really blame them for not signing on, right?",1204776679

Just for reference, he's a Ph.D. just above 30, and his idea comes from something he discovered coincidentally from his research.<p>If it is really a good idea, find a partner who complements your skills. Assembling a team is probably the hardest part. If you can't assemble one, all odds are against you, no matter how good the idea is.

If have some cash outsource it to india or elance. if people are paid with money, they sometimes tend not to 'care' what they are working on, but give results.<p>The fact that IBM is doing research in this field means that they think that it might be worth it to work on this.<p>I think you need to act on it and if you spent that amount of time mulling it over, checking into things. get it done and see what people think, let the market decide. If someone doesn't get it, explain to them why they should. people thought blogs were stupid, all the other search engines didn't buy into google, now they wish they had.<p>I was in a similar thought process when i started my site, after i started it i kept coming across competitors i never even heard of. the fact that people are using my site and getting results was my 'vindication', after all there are a lot of other services that guarantee so much but didn't work for some people.<p>as far a i know ideas are worthless. pg talks about it some where. put it out there and see what happens, if IBM looks into what you are doing and blatantly copies you, sue them, but expect a long drawn-out legal battle that you won't win.<p>Lastly, people might have a hard time helping you out here if you don't talk about your idea.
