150411,comment,149052,149497,0,0,kerrynitz,,,"In economics they call type [1] positive and type [2] normative - the implication being that economics only deals with positive questions and tells us nothing about normative questions (how should the world be). When I studied a bit of sociology they took an approach borrowed from philosophy in categorising methods (and effectively split up type [1]): they were interested in how the theory (substitute argument here) addressed the questions of [a] what is the nature of the problem (ie ontology or how the world is), and [b] what can we know about it (ie epistemology). How you answer questions of type [b] determines whether type [1] statements can ""be tested by experiment"" - ie not everything that is in the world can ""in principle be tested by experiment"". For example, often whilst we can say that A is generally followed by B, and so infer that A at least partially causes B (whilst causation does not imply correlation we usually infer it does if we have some plausible mechanism in mind for why it should), but that in itself can not reveal precisely to us exactly why A causes B - ie how the mechanism works exactly.\nMost writers tend not to explicitly reveal their views on [b] and so we are left to infer them.\nAs to identifying type [2] statements, the verbs ""want"", ""should"", ""prefer"" are dead give-aways but the problem lies when they are dropped from the sentence - eg cabalamat's example becomes ""Everyone likes cats"". Using [b], we can ask whether it is possible to know this, which might help identify it as a type [2].",1206910653
150410,comment,150279,150352,0,0,danielmueller,,,"The main argument against using 'bloatware C++/Java' for teaching is that the language obscures the relevant idea/lesson at hand and so makes the learning process unnecessary harder.<p>But the problem is that you have to define what kind of learning experience you wanted to achieve in the first place. If you use assembler as a teaching 'language' (or some similarly lowlevel language) you would show all the nitty-gritty details of what's going on, but you would probably be attacking too many points at a given time. If on the other hand you'd use a more abstract language than 'C/C++/Java', then you may loose some details along the way, but you will be able to focus much more on the algorithmical/computational part of what is being taught.<p>So in the end it's all about what you want to learn/teach and only after that's been decided you can choose the appropriate language to best transport the lessons with.",1206910593

150401,comment,150279,150352,0,0,PieSquared,,,"At least one reason is that it hides too much from you.<p>I started out in Java. It really got me into programming - I could make all these pretty little windows and graphics and do everything else quickly and easily. But, as I later found out, at the expense of that ease came my knowledge.<p>Example: The ArrayList class. It's a dynamic array. The LinkedList class. It's a linked list. They're fundamentally different. But in Java, they look and act pretty much the same, and they're already available in the standard library. The learning programmer doesn't need to know how they work or anything.<p>Same thing with memory. In Java, you get no feel for what memory is being used, or how it's being managed. In C,  you're the master (and the slave), and you yourself have to manage and take care of memory and pointers. It tells you much more about how computers actually WORK when  you're programming in C.<p>In summary, Java just gives you too much. It hides you from the raw details. This is great for a production purpose language - but for a teaching language, what could POSSIBLY be worse, when the intent is to reveal and NOT hide all the small details?",1206909471

But I did spend 4 years writing a significant amount of systems C++ code in VC++, and --- at least 8 years ago --- VC++ was <i>significantly</i> better than any comparable C environment.<p>We can get into a tit-for-tat on it versus, e.g. GCC, but I feel like one way to lose a programming environment shoot-out is to imply that Microsoft half-asses that part of the business.<p>Regarding #2, you seem to be sticking up for the author's implication that Ruby has ""complex"" syntax compared to Lisp. Clearly, most languages have more ""idiosyncracies"" (here defined as: ""notation of any sort"") than Lisp. That doesn't make Lisp's austerity an interesting lesson to take to other languages; it is, in fact, the major failure of Lisp.<p>There is a notion, unaddressed in the original post but far more important than any of that post's insights, that obsessively regular syntax is crucial to metaprogramming. Even defined down to ""true macros"", this is simply folk wisdom: you can get ""Lisp-style macros"" out of any language that gives you access to an abstract syntax tree.<p>Finally, call the two ""mainstream"" high level languages Ruby  and Python (relegating Perl and PHP to uh, different, uh, categories). Both share the type system the author appreciates in Lisp.",1206908911
