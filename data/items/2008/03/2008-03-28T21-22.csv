148894,comment,148503,148503,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I think too many people have fallen into the trap of thinking ""If we build it, they will come (with money).""<p>This simply isn't the case. You must build something valuable, and capitalize on the value. Unfortunately, traffic isn't quite as valuable anymore.<p>Think about it, there are a lot more startups now, each with their own eyeballs. The supply of eyeballs has gone way up, which in turn means that with a static demand the value of the traffic has gone down.<p>Many startups begin with the thinking ""We'll build something a lot of people like, and sell advertising from all of this traffic we'll receive."" As I've just explained, the value of traffic is much lower with the increased supply. Startups capitalizing on traffic are entering a very competitive market.<p>Sure, a few companies will gain a massive amount of traffic and do very well (think digg, reddit, etc...), but the majority will need to find another way to be profitable.",1206740577

148885,comment,148503,148613,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Another way to sell the ""data"" is to use the information you know about your users and sell not only trends, but targeted advertisements based on your user data.<p>Think about Myspace and Facebook. They have a ton of information about their users (and a statistically relevant amount of info about the general population as well). The magic is that they can sell ads to men between the ages of 18-21 who are in a state college and earn less than $30,000 per year. Not many companies have access to that amount of information about their users.",1206739530

148882,comment,148341,148827,0,0,wanorris,,,"All excellent points. Thanks for posting this.<p>I agree that 2 months should never be a cause for alarm for something like this. It's only that for so long they had been able to keep building significant continuous improvements in clickthrough rate that makes it a potential warning sign.<p>At some point, clickthrough rate could actually end up plateauing on an ongoing basis as they run out of ways to keep improving the rate. Then their ad business would be solely dependent on impression growth (which I assume would still be fine) for clickthrough growth.<p>Of course, as you point out, referral quality is also an important factor, so even if they get the same number of clicks, that might be great for advertisers if it's better traffic.<p>Is this the end of growth in clickthrough rate? Unlikely. But it's always good to keep an eye on these things in case it turns out to develop into a trend.",1206739294
