I've been working on this recently and would love to start a conversation on the topic...<p>Pageviews isn't something that works consistently across apps. For example, let's look at WarBook and Scrabbulous. Scrabbulous is killing WarBook in installs and Daily Actives, but probably sees significantly less pageviews than WarBook.<p>My current thinking is an attempt to measure the virality of a given app, basing my thoughts around the Net Promoter score (""Would you recommend this to a friend?""). This can be assessed easily if you're working with paid media. Your click-thru to install can be compared against total installs, inferring your social install number.<p>If we can measure this number against Daily Actives versus time we could potentially ascertain the longevity of this app (are users installing, passing it on and then never playing again? or do they play for a month or two? forever?).<p>Thoughts, feedback, comments?",1206557638

As others said - <i>learn from it</i>.<p>Specifically, if you are doing something that you have a little experience with (like, say, starting a business), it is generally a good idea NOT to assume it will work out. Better yet, treat as a wild card experiment with a great risk of failure. Approach it as something that you are trying out and using to learn what works and what does not. Very few people can succeed on unfamiliar grounds and it is almost always a matter of luck. Far more people succeed through trial and error. So learn from the mistakes and try again.",1206557535

Winston Churchill<p>Exercise and a break from the computer are both a good idea. I think you have to reflect on what happened but with some emotional distance. Remembering Thurber's observation that ""humor is emotional chaos remembered in tranquility"" you should write down your lessons learned once you can laugh about it (at least a little) so that you are not just re-opening wounds. Some amount of lateral drift (reading books, seeing folks you've neglected as your firm was failing, etc..) can also give you perspective on what to do  differently next time. I had a painful failure about a decade ago and concluded ""I am through with being an entrepreneur."" After five years at a big company I realized that I had mis-assessed and that I couldn't help being an entrepreneur. Failing at a startup doesn't mean you should give up being an entrepreneur, but you should get some perspective on how to make ""new mistakes"" the next time out.",1206557340

147158,comment,146860,147062,0,0,BrandonM,,,"On Gentoo, where compiling occurs nearly every time a program is installed, one common method used to speed up compiling is to use the -pipe option to gcc as well as to mount memory onto /var/tmp/portate (the location where files are written before actually being installed). These two measures alone can speed up compile times dramatically, as the disk is never touched in the middle of compiles. Instead, the only time reads occur is as the source is read in, and writes only occur when the final binaries, libraries, and configuration files are installed to their homes on the file system.<p>If your source files are located contiguously on the hard drive [1] and writes are cached to occur in big blocks, while also using some compile-in-memory techniques like those outlined above, I imagine compile times would not vary much on flash-disk MBAs as compared to those with conventional laptop drives.<p>[1] This could be accomplished by keeping your project in a compressed file and loopback-mounting it to your project's working directory.",1206556976
