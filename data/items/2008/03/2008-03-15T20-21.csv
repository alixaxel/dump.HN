On the other hand, if you stand up, go to the whiteboard, and start writing things down, while talking them through your train of though (""Well I'm not positive how to do fractions in other bases, but this way makes sense to me"" and then proceed to work out the problem as best as you can) then you show more motivation and enthusiasm.",1205614601

If you want invites do the same.  Bam, middleman removed.<p>P.S.-Though I did get a chuckle out of your ""super connection algorithm""",1205614340

It would allow America to brain drain the rest of the world and in doing so greatly help America's economy.
