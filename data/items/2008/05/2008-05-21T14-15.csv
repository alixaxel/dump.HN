196069,comment,195085,196044,0,0,sdurkin,,,"""You just said: 'the minorities are protected, and that means force can be used on them.' It's a clear contradiction.""<p>This is the basis of constitutional government. Just holding a minority opinion doesn't necessarily mean the majority can't constrain your behavior with force.<p>For example, if I hold the minority opinion that ""killing people for no reason is fine,"" then it isn't a violation of my freedom for the non-homicidal majority to arrest me.<p>Constitutional government includes a series of guarantees about what can't be done to minorities, and also usually includes checks and balances on the majority's power to prevent rash action.<p>""What kind of government program isn't justified by that reasoning?""<p>The answer is that all governmental programs are justified as long as they improve the public welfare.  Those you have listed would not.<p>The fundamental difference is that in the progressive model the market is not the be-all-end-all of politics, it is just a means used to accomplish an end.  The economy exists to serve the people, not the other way around.<p>""""Some socialism is necessary to stave off communism.""
And some sex is necessary to keep your virginity.""<p>Pretty much everyone on either side of the left-ride divide agrees about the need for the modern welfare state, even if they disagree about the extent.  Communist orators used to draw crowds of tens of thousands before the New Deal.<p>""You take an unprincipled approach that scales to tyranny.""<p>Your pure libertarianism scales to a far more direct form of tyranny, and doesn't come with the niceties of constitutional protections.  What's the market rate on a police force? An army? A life?",1211381931

196044,comment,195085,195739,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"""The constitutional structure protects minorities from the tyranny of the majority, and as such, when it is in the good of society, that force can be used, including to collect taxes.""<p>You just said: 'the minorities are protected, and that means force can be used on them.' It's a clear contradiction.<p>What kind of government program isn't justified by that reasoning? Why doesn't the government start controlling or ""guaranteeing"" super markets, car dealerships, or house construction?<p>You take an unprincipled approach that scales to tyranny.<p>""For example, asserting a right to health care provides more output for the society, as it takes away from the costs of untreated illnesses""<p>That is complete unvalidated. Where is the evidence? Keep in mind, the comparison is to health with government management and with individual decision making (and not government coverage vs. none). One huge fallacy specific to health care is that health does not equal medical treatment. So you can't equate a dollar paid for medical treatment and a dollar improved in value of health.<p>""Some socialism is necessary to stave off communism.""<p>And some sex is necessary to keep your virginity. Corporations that accumulate government power usually do so because of unprincipled approaches to what the government should and shouldn't be doing. Look up the history of railroads in the US, and specifically the rise of the Interstate Commerce Commission. A government entity went out of it's bounds to ""protect"" the people, and the new power was taken over by the rail companies. It's exactly what I mentioned before: What kind of government program isn't justified by that reasoning? And then who do you think is going to control it? Our benevolent senators? Or the people with a $$$ interest?<p>For health coverage, lots of policy decisions make much more sense if you just consider the AMA the largest and most powerful union in the US. They act for the benefit of themselves, and not their patients, often doing so with government force. One example, two words: drug war.",1211380530

196037,comment,196004,196004,0,0,mooders,,,"I think it is also helpful to understand one's own motivation for picking up a given business book. For example, Kawasaki's Art of the Start is very useful for most startups, but invaluable for those chasing external funding. But Porter's Competitive Strategy is less useful (note: not necessarily <i>useless</i>) for a startup than it is for an established player looking to compete effectively in an established marketplace. The point being that if you understand the problem / context you have that requires resolution or action, then you can better judge whether reading a book is more or less likely to be a productive use of your time.<p>I do very much agree with Seth's second point: markup the book with tags and pencil as you read.

I have read my share of business books, and wish I had stuck to this philosophy. I have begun to take a lot of notes on index cards, and attempted to apply at least one principle from each book that I read (think of it as ""Deliberate Practice"" [<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/6da4ey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/6da4ey</a>]).<p>Don't get me wrong, there are a <i>lot</i> of bad books out there, so its hard to know whether you are wasting your time with a bad book, or wasting your time because it happens to be a really good book but you don't happen to do anything with it. The problem that I face is separating the wheat from the chaff - most business books that hit the bestsellers normally have a huge marketing engine behind them, which does not necessarily make them great books. On the other hand, books like ""Think and Grow Rich"" which you can pick up at Half Price Books for $3 is something I read every year (once).<p>On a side note - ""Programmers get amazing value because for $30 they are presented with everything they need to program a certain tool."" I disagree. A lot of programming books I have read just don't cut it and provide little or no value. Mainly because a lot of authors are playing catch up with the latest and greatest technologies and invariably the book is rushed to the printers just so that they are not a version or two behind. The ones that provide real value are the ones that have proven to be timeless (SICP, PAIP which I am yet to read).",1211378629
