You will never become a good hacker if you are only doing it for the money or for the recognition. You have to be able to love the code for the sake of the code itself. You have to be able to see the beauty in the code. Otherwise you will never really understand it. It is the difference between being able to copy a poem out of a book and being able to write a new poem.
2. Assuming you are a true genius, the process will still take you many years. Working hard will not be enough. You will have to learn how to work smart to learn all the stuff you will need to know.<p>If your purpose is to understand hacking to the point where you can better understand technical people so that you can work with them better .. that is a much more realistic and reachable goal. For that I would recommend you start with Ruby or Python and try to make a full-scale production webapp, and from that experience you will learn a lot that will explain how a technical person thinks.",1210875409

I would bet that when/if PG has his own kids, he would fall flat for it. I'm a parent and became aware of this concept prior to having the first child. Yet I still catch myself from time to time.<p>The ""Lies We Tell Kids"" article reminds me of virtually all educated parents attempting to explain things to their children at the moment when it's least effective. I often see (in public places) parents trying their best to explain to children why candies are bad for them, why curse words are bad, etc... all the while the kids are whining and throwing further tantrums. Such attempts are completely useless. What is most effective at those moments should be a stern warning, followed by immediate action if the kid does not comply to your command. Such actions are typically: immediate timeouts, loss of privileges, etc... I'm not talking about or even suggesting spanking the kid.<p>Regarding the ""stern warning"" method above, this is my favorite: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1889140163"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1889140163</a>

The biggest symptom of this is that there are dozens of ""machine learning"" toolkits, environments, libraries, etc all intended to provide a situation that frees you from worrying about extraneous details (like how to get data out of crappy HTML in order to do some kind of data analysis project), but a lot of people just code everything from scratch in vanilla Java/C/Python/whatever.<p>The way I write programs, generally, is I do the simplest possible test that still embodies the essential idea behind what I want to do and grow it from there. Thus a language supporting that has to be flexible, and I don't see why dynamic typing is necessary or sufficient for that.<p>The type system has little or nothing to do with also supporting essential features that support the way I think: closures, combinators, metaprogramming, and other things that often make life a lot easier.",1210874724
