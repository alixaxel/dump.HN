They can keep the ""island"" above sea level by building a mooring tower and tie seasteads to it.  Their territory can be the 200 mile economic zone of Nauru.<p>Also, there's lots of healthy stuff that can be kept in dry form.  (Fruits, Legumes, and grains.)  They will also have the ability to keep things frozen.  Chest freezers can be highly efficient.  Especially if they are not opened very often.",1211252384

194691,comment,194651,194651,0,0,aneesh,,,"I don't see why this is such a big deal.  Scaling by a factor of 2 doesn't make any of the math lose it's beauty.  The underlying math is still the same.  Calling 30 minutes ""an hour"" doesn't make time go faster.  It's all semantics, really.<p>Anyway, pi is so engrained in our mathematics that the costs of switching would surely be higher than any superficial, aesthetic benefits.",1211252068

I'd leave Castro Street second only to Shattuck Avenue (in Berkeley) in terms of affordable, excellent ethnic cuisine. There's even a used book store on Castro (though it pales in comparison to Moe's on telegraph).",1211252053

194678,comment,194651,194651,0,0,mhartl,,,"I independently 'discovered' this a few years back, basically on the grounds that there are infinitely many shapes with constant diameter but only one (the circle) with constant radius.  It stands to reason that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter contains a spurious factor of 2; it must be that the ratio of circumference to <i>radius</i> is the more fundamental quantity.<p>This discovery was almost enough to make me want to memorize an embarrassing number of digits of 2π; 6.28 is really pathetic.
