(See: Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming)<p>What should be happening is that NY has just made it undesirable to do business there. There should soon be a list of companies that just won't sell there as it is too much hassle. This is probably the goal. In some politicians muddled thinking this will help local businesses... Protectionism is ugly, even when states do it.",1210823940

Most parents would do the opposite and restrict internet access for starters, let alone have the ability to assist in his intellectual interests. As far as kid activities his age, I'm sure he would be bored stiff around others. That seems like a blessing to avoid behavior that would no doubt only lead to worse choices later in life.",1210821827
