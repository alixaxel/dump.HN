People have suggested not scribd-ing everything before; I can only assume that the reason this has not yet happened is because the feedback we are providing is more valuable to YC than a few upset readers.<p>And this may well be the case: When most people have problems accessing a web page one way, they won't tell you directly; instead, they'll try to find another way to access it or give up.  By providing only one way to read PDFs on a discussion board, you get access to this otherwise invisible negative feedback.",1211309945
195147,comment,195105,195105,0,0,maximilian,,,"If black holes usually get created by collapsing massive stars (much bigger than the sun), then how could CERN possibly create a black hole?  I don't know too much about the particle physics of black holes, but it doesn't seem to make that much sense.<p>Black holes basically happen because the gravity of the thing overcomes all other forces because its so incredibly massive in such a small space (overcomes the forces keeping atom's nuclei apart too).  Smashing together a few protons together might make those proton nuclei to crash together, but I don't see how that could possibly make a black hole.<p>To me, any crazy thing like a black hole that could destroy the earth, is far too energetic and ridiculous for humans to actually make unknowingly. (for now I guess)<p>I'm sure the smart dudes at CERN thought about this and aren't worried.",1211309885

Many times they start with a good reason, but after a little while they wander  and end going to sites they never intended to go to in the first place.<p>For teens it is increasingly more difficult to stay away from networking sites like myspace.com, there they share more personal information than they ought to and do whatever it takes to have as many 'friends' as possible.<p>One problem with an ever increasing reliance on computers is that we are more and more getting away from physical actual contact with other human beings.<p>Kids are potentially vulnerable to predators and all kind of garbage found on the Internet like porno, violence, drugs, and much more.<p>I couldn't resist adding my pitch of salt to your essay, it is like much of what you write straight forward and to the point.<p>Would be nice if you were to write a new essay on how kids and teens could be better protected, and why they have to. A problem I frequently see is that there are many homes where the kids and teens are computer savvy, but the parents know next to nothing about computers. Just picture a teen or little kid as the computer admin with unrestricted access to   the system and the Internet.<p>Some possible solutions, apart from trowing the computer out the window, should include besides parents training, better operating systems, that make from simple to easy to secure and filter Internet access, opendns to block unwanted content, and even this could be controversial more Government oversight, to really get rid of plagues like spy ware, virus proliferation, phishing, and many other Internet ills.<p>That's all, take care.",1211308472
