If your entire experience with the city of Cambridge is surrounded with individuals involved in academia, then it would be easy to come to such a conclusion.  Having a friend that attends a well known Cambridge institution, I would never title an area based on or around the experiences I had with those individuals while visiting because that would be entirely inaccurate.  If that were the case, I could call Cambridge the pseudointellectual and back patting capital of the world (not that those were my experiences, but no less accurate than any of the previous statements).",1211929087

201506,comment,201373,201453,0,0,Xlp-Thlplylp,,,"Since we're on the subject of the politeness of New Yorker's and the attitude that everything has its price, in New York,  a simple ""thank you"" might be considered a costly acknowledgment.<p>Here's a dismal example by hacking standards, but it's still indicative of the attitude. Someone from a financial firm, known for its rating system and price indexes, had a data conversion problem. They were using Matlab--a dismal language with a bastard semantics. One of the functions they were using was Datenum(), which converts dates and times to the number  of days since the year zero, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.<p>The specification of this function should have been to return a floating point number equal to 1+1/86,400 (in units of days) for a date argument equal to one second after year zero. And in fact, the open source equivalent function in Octave does exactly that. However, Matlab's function differs from this in the 11th decimal place. Their technical support has been silent on the issue.<p>When I informed the person at the financial firm about this  discrepancy, they thanked me for ""my comments."" In the next sentence, I was informed that that they were redoing their calculations using another method. It was stated as if the decision to do this was an entirely independent judgment, not at all informed by my observations, and completely unrelated to any problems they might have encountered using the previous method. They simply decided to change the way they were doing things, without explanation.<p>Finding a numerical bug that could complicate the analysis of code that depends on it is not earthshaking. But not stating what informed a decision to avoid the problem altogether is a typical New York attitude. Or perhaps the reluctance to credit others is typically corporate. Correct me if I am mistaken.<p>I have to agree with Paul Graham's essay on the relative lifelessness of employees: if I were an employee, I simply would have accepted the decision as a completely independent  judgment, internalized it and defended it.",1211928299

Launch an open version of your website and let people <i>think</i> that its userbase is too small? Or deliberately limit the size of the userbase and remove all doubt?<p>If the site is really not ready, you should recruit a handful of testers -- only five or six are necessary to tell you what you need to know. Otherwise you should just launch the darn thing. Actively recruiting people to help fill it up is still a good idea, but don't put some up some stupid barrier that prevents these people from inviting their friends, their friends' friends, and anyone else in the world.

Security, regulatory compliance, reliability, accessibility of data, etc. are all things that are historically not being well-served by even larger companies, and I think they're the reason a lot of ""Web 2.0"" companies are unable to make their way from success with consumers into enterprise markets (where a single sale can make your month a good one).<p>Wufoo have managed to do it extremely well.  They provide great export features, and they go to great lengths to explain how and why they provide reliable and redundant infrastructure.<p>But the good examples will be dragged down by the bad examples, and the end result will be much slower adoption of the model.  So, going off-line without warning and without providing a means for customers to get their data, is a great disservice to not just your own customers but to every other hosted application provider.<p>I don't want to pick on the Stikipad guys in particular, but it's a real problem--if you aren't sure that you'll always be around to serve your customers, you need to make a dead man's switch plan to get the data back into the hands of your customers.",1211927403

I would probably go for a masters degree as opposed to a PhD since I am assuming a PhD is setting myself up to drop out at some point (I don't intend on it taking 6 years to find a co-founder).
