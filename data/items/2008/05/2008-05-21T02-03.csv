Further, tax rates of the top 10% account for the majority of revenue. So I not only deny your claim but put forth that your rhetoric is emotionally manipulative - pitting the rich (""them"") versus the rest (""us poor little everybody else"").<p>The ""rich"", the top 1%, are the prime drivers of wealth creation. They are the reason GDP grows faster than population growth. The incentives on the top 1% heavily influence GDP growth.<p>Also, the percentiles used are very misleading. The top and bottom quintiles today are not the same people in the top and bottom quintiles 20 years ago. So most stats we track about poverty and wealth are fairly useless because they follow that faulty assumption.<p>Just in case anyone isn't clear on this: if you're a founder of a tech company, you're in the top 1% - perhaps not in income today, but in wealth generators and life-time taxes paid and to-be-paid.",1211338757

It's a little cumbersome, but I (and my company) have purchased literally a couple of dozen domains via the email interface on adamsnames.tc.<p>One other cool thing about adamsnames.tc is that you don't pay for the domains for a little bit after you order them.

There are a lot of very passionate Rails hackers, and I can see Rails taking over the web application development sphere over the next few years.  This isn't because it's necessarily better, mind you, but because Rails has a hell of a lot of mindshare.<p>So, you should be as worried about finding competent Rails hackers as you should be about finding competent Python/Django hackers.

It will be more like, you notice some patterns of repetition in the code of your existing project(s), and then you devise a way to factor that into a library. Try to implement your web framework as libraries instead of a monolithic pile of spaghetti. There are tons of design decisions you'll have to take and it's better if you can use different parts of the web framework (and perhaps write new ones) for different projects. At first your web framework will be pretty specific to your project, and you'll hit walls whenever you want to go in a direction you hadn't thought of yet.

195594,comment,195423,195479,0,0,timr,,,"Here's my take, after working in Ruby/Rails for a year, and coming from a background in C++ and Perl (with a tiny bit of Lisp in my distant past):  Ruby is nothing like Lisp.  It has some metaprogramming features that make you think (vaguely) of Lisp, but fundamentally, it's more like the bastard child of a torrid, three-way affair between Lisp, Python and Perl -- the genetic heritage was passed on, but poor baby Ruby got little of the careful childhood upbringing.<p>The result?  Ruby has the syntactical consistency and beauty of Perl, and the blazing speed and low overhead of Lisp.  There are roughly six dozen different ways of doing <i>everything</i> (including really simple things, like delimiting blocks), and bizarre inconsistencies in basic use cases (e.g. <i>most</i> String functions return copies, whereas nearly everything else works by reference), and plenty of long-term code maintainability <i>nightmares</i> lurking in the corners.<p>It can be fun to code in Ruby, and it's certainly a language you should check out someday, but I'm still not sure it's the language you want to choose for a project involving a team of programmers or long-term project maintenance.  My advice, if you know neither Ruby nor Python, is to learn Python, unless you've got some particular reason (i.e. a job) to learn Ruby first.  Rails is an okay framework, but Django is okay too, and Python is the more elegant language.<p>(Now...if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go put on my asbestos underwear....)",1211336423
