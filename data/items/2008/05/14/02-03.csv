189227,comment,189065,189065,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"First of all, I hope we all understand that ""free speech"" in its purest sense doesn't really exist. The proof is in ""Falsely shouting fire in a theatre."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_thea...</a>)<p>Point being: Some people do believe that there is a minimum amount of decency required on the nation's airwaves to preserve ethical standards particularly of children whose values are highly malleable. It is justified as not being a violation of free speech with the same idea as that of the schenck ruling, that there indeed are limits to what a person can say without punishment.<p>Personally I feel people have a right to their belief in something like this, while others feel it infringes on our rights. But again, no matter what society we live in our rights are always limited by boundaries anyway...and boundaries serve a good purpose in shaping the morality of a nation. Morality...is often useful. I'll leave it at that?",1210733965

I went to a predominantly white suburbia school, and have plenty of friends who use the term ¨dirty jew¨ as a derogatory comment without second thought.

189198,comment,188489,188771,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I think you should show respect for others' beliefs, at least to the extent of not ridiculing them, <i>except</i> when those beliefs are themselves the topic of conversation.  In that case, there's really no way to have the discussion without being willing to disagree.<p>When talking about lies people tell each other, the beliefs <i>are</i> the topic, whether or not you believe they are lies or truths.  If you don't want to have other people weigh your beliefs in such a context, I would suggest not mentioning them during such a discussion.  There are beliefs I have which I'm sure most don't share, but which I don't feel the need to defend (anymore) at every opportunity.  For example, as an atheist, I wouldn't typically go to a Christian forum and announce that God doesn't exist, unless I were prepared to have my views ridiculed.<p>Please don't take this as meaning I think you shouldn't discuss your beliefs in this thread, but only that I think you shouldn't try to influence others not to debate you honestly by implying they're being uncivil.",1210730433
