I think it is better to set yourself a reasonable goal, and sell when you reach it.  This keeps you dispassionate about it and prevents greed from letting you make silly decisions.",1209697081
179198,comment,178443,178443,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"this is wrong.  there is no universal answer to what to invest in.  smart people go where the money is without bias.  if stocks are under priced and heading for a spike you invest in an index fund.  but what about right now where the market is grinding sideways?  people who invested in commodities are making a killing.  when commodities stop making you money you abandon them too.  getting attached to an investment just because it made you money is bad.<p>it's harder to do than to just invest in an index fund, because you have to go against the herd.  if you had decided to dump your stock in 99 and invest in commodities people would have said you were insane.  You'd be the one laughing now.<p>Go where the money is.  (without bias)",1209696919

179184,comment,178385,178786,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"this question is why the financial institutions exist.  companies that do nothing but solicit your money and invest it for you while living off a percentage don't really know all that much about how the markets work.  Like the previous poster said, you have to be a contrarian.  It's exactly that ability to invest in something when everyone thinks it is worthless that makes people rich.  stocks were dirt cheap in the 80's, commodities were dirt cheap in the early 2000's, you have to figure out on your own where to go next.<p>I will say that these trends seem to have followed a 17 year period (on average) during the 20th century.  If this remains true america has another 9 years of slow economic growth (and commodities have another 9 years of bull).\nBut we must always beware of the induction fallacy :)",1209695813

179173,comment,177865,177865,0,0,hugh,,,"OK, I've finally finished reading the Nature paper. To me the interesting, yet bothersome, thing about this design is that in contrast to the past fifty years of trends in electronics, it actually has moving parts. We're not just sloshing electrons around the place, we're actually moving dopant atoms through an amorphous solid, by applying ridiculously enormous electric fields. My worry is whether this will wind up being durable, or whether the response is going to change after these atoms have been yanked back and forth a few billion times. The paper certainly doesn't say anything about extensively testing these systems.",1209694206

179167,comment,178465,178918,0,0,antiform,,,"Having known graduates of both Daewon and KMLA at several elite colleges, I can say that their performance is comparable to most of the other students at their respective colleges. There are those who continue in their study habits and graduate at the top of the class, those that relax a little to explore their options and enjoy more of their college experience, and those that put more emphasis on socializing than studying. There's no real stereotype of a typical graduate from one of these schools, other than being smart, Korean, and communicating in fluent English. Most of them seem to be happy to be going to college in the U.S.<p>The craziest thing about most of this is that it takes just as much (if not more) effort for kids in high school to get to one of the top 3 Korean colleges (Seoul, Yonsei, Korea). In fact, both KMLA and Daewon also have a track for students who want to attend Korean universities that is just as intense.<p>It's hard to say whether this is the best way for a person to spend their high school years, but in places like Korea and Japan, this is the way that any college-bound student spends their youth. Everybody who wants to go to college either attends a college prep school or a private prep program from about middle school, because that's the way it has always been.",1209693740
