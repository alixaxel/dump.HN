196367,comment,196025,196300,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's NumOfMessages, not NumOfUsers, and Messages = Messages/User * Users.  Then the question is whether Messages/User and Recipients/Message remain constant as NumOfUsers goes up.  If both do, then your total cost is linear with the number of users, which is what you want.  But if either of them is linear in the number of users, then the total number of messages becomes quadratic in the number of users: a linear factor from growth in userbase, and a linear factor factor from increased usage by each user.  Most likely there's a logarithmic correlation (Recipients/Message goes up as more people are on the service, but not by as much as total users), which is still generally fine for scalability concerns.<p>E-mail's actually a really great example.  It worked great as long as it was used for person-to-person communication, which held both the number of messages/user and the number of recipients/message constant.  Then spammers found out that the more people who had e-mail, the more they could send to at once, and sent recipients/message through the roof.  In 1997/98, there were actually a number of articles about how the e-mail architecture was in serious trouble, and unless some way could be found to limit spam, it would collapse within a couple years.  Of course, they dealt with it through spam filters and blacklists on the server, so now e-mail works fine.<p>Twitter's problem is that both Messages/User and Recipients/Message average significantly higher than e-mail, and yet the resources they have available are significantly lower than the full resources of the Internet.  So even if they don't have an architectural scalability problem, they could very well have an economics problem.",1211394301

The costs <i>do</i> work with and contribute to the capitalist market responses, by making more polluting products more expensive, relative to the less polluting.<p>On the revenues side, I agree again, but why not use that money for general expenditures?  Why not tax the bad things (pollution & other negative externalities) more, and the good things less (sales, income, investment)?",1211393736

When trying to select a name, think about the message that the name sends, the impression that it leaves, the way it primes whoever hears it for the first time. It doesn't have to be descriptive of what you're doing, but it should probably convey your general approach to how the company should be - e.g. serious vs. fun (personally, I prefer the ""fun"", but it's really a personal thing).",1211393691

196345,comment,196149,196149,0,0,niels_olson,,,"As someone who deals in diagnostic tests all day, nobody's diagnosed on one test. There's a similar problem I worked out on the odds of getting into medical school, I'm sure this is elementary stats and has someone's name on it, but I'll call it the acceptance problem: how many medical schools do you have to apply to in order to have 90% chance of getting into medical school?
For any school there is a acceptance quotient:
Q = (acceptances sent out)/(number of applications received)<p>For any given student applying to some schools 1 thru n, the goal is getting at least once acceptance, and applying to more schools, mathematically, can't possibly hurt in the closed case (neglecting social engineering, time spent on applications, etc), so the chance of acceptance, Ca, approaches 1 with every new application in the following fashion:<p>Ca = (1 - (1 - Q1)(1 - Q2)(1 - Q3)...(1 - Qn))<i>100<p>There's a visual and some worked out examples here:
<a href=""http://nielsolson.us/MedSchool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nielsolson.us/MedSchool/</a><p>Similarly, if the sensitivity of a test is 90%, that means the test identifies 9 of every 10 people with the diagnosis. If I administer n different tests each with a sensitivity of S, then the chances of accurately diagnosing the disease, Cd, </i>goes up* with each additional positive but never gets to 1.<p>Cd = (1 - (1 - S1)(1 - S2)(1 - S3) . . . (1 - Sn))<i>100%<p>So lets say you are doing, say, genetic testing, and any one gene is 1% sensitive for the disease. If you tested 300 genes you could be no more than 95% certain of the diagnosis.<p>(1 - (1 - .99)^300)</i>100 = 95.09591...%<p>Now, if your genetic tests were 5% accurate, you're panel could be no more than 95% accurate with 59 tests.<p>If your test was 50% accurate, you're panel could consist of 6 tests and be no more than 95% accurate.<p>Of course, if some of the tests are negative, things get more complicated. One of the problems with these data sets is that we have no idea how predictive they are. You can't even calculate the predictive power of the database. There simply haven't been enough events. Then we get into surrogate measures (how many were positive on tests 1 - n and were found to have razor blades in their homes, etc).<p>The claim that these databases can't be effective isn't true. They could be. P might also equal NP. Whether the hypothesis is strictly true or not, the vague but real set of 'practical concerns' suggest that the truth of the hypothesis is sufficiently difficult to test as to render the null hypothesis the de facto assumption until proven otherwise.",1211393535
