199926,comment,198732,199849,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"""Self-taught"" and ""autodidactic"" are denotatively equivalent, so from that perspective the word ""autodidactic"" is absolutely not more precise.<p>What's more, relying on connotation to enhance precision is kind of silly. Connotation is highly subjective and often inconsistant across a community.<p>One good example of this fact is that few people here seem to see the connotative difference between the two words in question. I don't.<p>Maybe you can help us. Thanks.",1211770609

The more they do it, the more hits they get, the more links they get, the more their ranking improves. This puts them above the authoritive threshold of other sites which allows them to steal more content.<p>Can you think of a method to discourage this activity?",1211770026

I speak Spanish, Catalan, English and Russian. In my opinion:<p>* English would be php: it's dead easy to mash together just about anything, and grammar and vocabulary are as inventive as you make them. Plus everybody understands it to some extent.<p>* Russian is Lisp: amazingly powerful, but hard to get right and to think in it (at least for a non-native like me -of course I'm biased.)<p>* Spanish is like java: everybody understands a bit of it, but getting started is terrible (one needs to know what subject, object, articles and verb conjugation are just to say the simplest of things.)<p>* Catalan is like Spanish, but much less widespread: perhaps a java-like language now nearly defunct because of lack of libraries and a powerful company/state behind it -take your pick.",1211769620

I won't bother you with the steps that did not work, just the steps that did.<p>-main thing is to force yourself to use a posture holding your shoulders back and your head / neck back.  Laptops are the worst because they force you to look down.  As I understand it, the wrist pain is actually neck pain, shoulder pain, arm pain and wrist pain.  Your neck, shoulder and arms unconciously make adjustments to relieve pain and the wrist bares the brunt of it because it cannot adjust and pass the pain down the line anymore.<p>-indoor rock climbing (bouldering) about 20 times helped a ton.  I don't go anymore, but the stretching and strength building helped a ton.<p>-going to yoga about 10 times help also.<p>-I still don't mouse with my right hand, left only.<p>The #1 thing for me is to not look down toward the monitor and hold your shoulders and head/neck back.  When I read about holding my shoulders back, I did it for 2 days straight and had extremely sore back muscles the next day.  The sore muscles got better in a few days and the difference was huge.",1211768439

Sure, often the value provided is an argument which might merit discussion, but the thing that ties Disqus and Tipjoy together isn't actually the content itself but the blog format. If anything, Disqus is just a distribution channel that works well in the blogosphere, which I guess is reason that they should team up, but it doesn't add much value to Disqus, and Tipjoy would probably appreciate being thought of as more broad than a ""tip your blogger"" platform.",1211768400
