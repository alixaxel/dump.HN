With enough humility, hard work and emotional control you have a better chance of beating the market. I've never been satisfied with investing in mutual funds because the average returns will be lowish - 5-7%.<p>So I studied Buffett, Peter Lynch and few other well known investors strategies. It took me about 4-6 months tracking their histories and the reasons behind their decisions. From this I developed my own strategy based largely on Buffett's and its worked a treat.

So not very.<p>The problem is that mso's control the feed from the station to your house and they will be loathe to add a middle man.  Google struck a small deal with a smaller satellite company a while ago(sorry i forget the name) to offer their ads which this is probably using and im sure google is paying a rediculous premium.<p>Anyways, cable and satelite companies by large will not go for this.  They will make their own and are probably actively doing so.  In other countries there are some deployments.  Their each pushing their new interactive platform, ocap for cable, mediaroom for satellite and with good ad applications could offer services far superior to what google currently offers.<p>For example, they could 
-target specific ads to specific set top boxes.  So you could target demographics better.  Why must I see tampon commercials!?<p>-allow the user to give feedback so to make ads more relevant or blacklist shitty ones they dislike. like fucking heads on commercials.<p>-instant/impulse purchase feature for products<p>-allow the user to choose which ads they want to view by category or whatever<p>-get better demographics on who is viewing their ad, not just the generic ""300k cpm which google does.""<p>-give viewers discounts for providing personal info<p>-interactive ads, forms to get feedback<p>-ability for user the equivalent of a cpc.  if they like an ad they can get more info on it, watch it again, save it, etc.<p>-allowing customers to place ads by location so you could target a block around a pizzeria<p>-allow customer micro purchases so 50$ and it gets shown to ~500 houses once.  cheap high quality camera ppl can make their own. Youtubeish. Googles requires like 8k.<p>All the above will make ads more relevant, increase demand and make a lot more money.<p>Google seems to just be a nice UI connecting ad agencies to people who want to purchase the ad, and a more clear way for someone new to put their ad on tv.  The first feature, connecting to ad agencies already exists, otherwise known as a phonebook.  Plus google is a middleman here probably taking a cut when there doesnt need to be one.  Second feature already exists.  This is nothing exciting imo and if it didnt have the google logo it wouldn't of made it on those blogs.",1209672733

178869,comment,177705,178716,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"But this argument is subject to exactly the fallacy I was talking about. Namely it assumes the following:<p>1. The increased consumption will happen without a corresponding increase in the ability to provide resources to fuel it.<p>2. Absolute per capita consumption of scarce resources will remain the same or greater.<p>3. Everyone on earth will someday have the same level of consumption.<p>To answer all these:<p>1. Without an increasing ability to provide resources, consumption levels cannot rise (there would be nothing to consume).<p>2. As innovation and environmental consciousness progress, absolute per capita consumption of scarce resources will hopefully decrease, in favor of consumption of non-scarce resources. (When we can transmute dirt into energy for instance, or finally have solar-powered transportation.)<p>3. The upper end will always rise. Someday the entire human race may <i>on average</i> consume at the rate Americans do today, but there will be some group/nation/whatever somewhere that consumes at a much much higher rate still.<p>---<p>He is right to argue that we shouldn't just assume everyone in the world could live at Western standards <i>right now with our current ability to procure resources</i>, but it takes a long time to raise living standards, and our ability to procure resources steadily improves as well.<p>The current consumption rate in Central America probably pales in comparison to America, but would also probably seem really extravagant by US standards circa 1800.<p>I think the implicit motivation for all this hand-wringing about how much more the West consumes compared to the developing world has to do with some misguided assumption that it is somehow unfair. Equality sounds great in practice, but it'll never be a reality (short of a perfectly altruistic benevolent dictator). Instead of focusing on how unfair it is, why not try and do something to help those at the bottom? Innovate... pull a Dean Kamen and figure out how to cheaply purify water.

Or, after the dollar devalues a bit more and the price of coffee goes up, about enough for a nice latte at Starbucks.<p>For my time and money, I'd look for a different gig that paid more.  That is unless you really want the startup experience and the company is really cool.",1209672184

Is China powerful because of its population only?<p>Personally I think China will pull the whole world economy down the more it opens to the world (it’s already started with Gas and food); the growth will be tempered by humanitarian need.<p>Put aside the option of a bunch of cheap labor China is still globally a very poor country and not yet in the position to make mandarin a great commodity.",1209672073
