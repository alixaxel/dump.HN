187673,comment,187575,187575,0,0,marketer,,,"""Wouldn't it be nice to have easily readable, understandable data and configuration files""<p>No, not really<p>How many times do people actually read XML data, or configuration files? Once in a while I suppose, when performing some configuration tasks, or debugging some data operation. But 99% of the time, your programs are the ones reading the XML. And this is exactly what XML is designed for - being easy for machines to read.<p>XML is easy to parse, because you have hundreds of available XMl parsers. In many languages you don't even need XML parsers, they're included in the language (actionscript and scala come to mind). It's easy to query with xpath, it's easy to validate with xsd. Most databases can store it natively. There's a whole ecosystem of xml tools that help you work with the data. It would be hard to trade all that for something slightly more readable.",1210607798

And then Sr. Architect X announces hiring of a replacement in the next 6 months and everyone spends 2 hours a day up-modding his/her old code, etc.<p>Oh and what if I think that nested if statements are easy to follow so I go around dinging you for extracting to methods or using ? : form or something.<p>Perhaps if you had a really bad-ass coder whose job was to apply karma to code from either lower-tier or less experienced for part of the day, that might work.  It provides incentive, it comes from a source of understood quality and authority and it can be accompanied by constructive criticism or substitute code to study.
