Greenspun has a particular style, one which thrives on irony, drama, and the occasional dollop of literary exaggeration. :)<p>In fact, the linked article does <i>not</i> argue that Brazilian labor is more expensive than that in the U.S. All we can conclude is that, taking all factors into consideration, cheaper foreign labor isn't driving Embraer to avoid the USA. Given that aviation is a heavily regulated, litigated, and taxed field, that doesn't tell us much -- maybe building jets in the USA for US customers saves a bunch of tariffs, or takes advantage of a tax loophole, or saves delivery costs or supply costs.<p><i>I looked up Brazil's per capita income and it's just under $5k a year. The jobs mentioned pay $50k a year.</i><p>Well, to be fair, ""aviation assembly worker"" might be a relatively high-paying job in Brazil. The cost of ""workers"" and the cost of ""skilled workers suitable for careers in your aircraft factory"" are two different things. But, again, the article gives us no clues whatsoever.",1210777169

It'll keep you hydrated, which is good, and you'll snack less on average.  A lot of the munchies is actually dehydration (like late night snacking).<p>Also, if you have peanuts or something and you're just watching TV rather than coding try eating them with chopsticks to slow you down so you notice when you're full.

Generally the situation was that someone who had been working for years decided to start a company with a friend and used the reputation and contacts he'd built up over the years to raise money to finance it.<p>I've never worked at a company with more than 10 employees where there was a non-technical founder who didn't provide access to capital.<p>With that being said, I think as the ""business guy"" there will be a lot of pressure on you to work extra hard and really produce (especially if you aren't providing the financing). It's usually not enough to have ""good ideas"" or ""the idea""...you should be bringing something so valuable to the table that the other founder(s) says ""Thank god this guy is here!""<p>It almost seems that a business guy will have to put in more effort than a hacker as a founder.

189622,comment,189502,189502,0,0,elai,,,"I don't accept that his particular verbose version of doing things in java is acceptable.  Just because dynamic language x does x things hidden behind a bunch of code means that you have to emulate the exact same things in another language to achieve the same result.<p>It's bad smalltalk to emulate C while your programming for it, and similarly it's bad C to emulate smalltalk with it.   It's like I would take his original java version and made it into perl, insisting that the perl script HAS to be in a class definition, and HAS to be in a main method, I MUST define the resultset in a static class list, and output with separate methods.  Saying that perl couldn't reproduce my 'reusable object' java functionality with doing that is just pedantic.<p>He should of just extracted a real example where it's impossible to do something in a short amount of code due to the lack of a specific feature, or being chained to java's static typing.  Like converting a JDBC ResultSet to an int[]. (5 lines of code, 15 if you don't compress the curly brackets)<p>A real life implementation of his example:
public class Out { public static void main(String args[]){ for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) { System.out.print(''+i*i+' ');} System.out.println();}<p>Also just because a language is succinct, doesn't mean it's productive.  Just look at SML.  It's many, many restrictions act as a straitjacket to do simple things, yet also keeps things succinct. It's would be better to say that because of intentional restrictions x (static typing) or lack of feature y (first class functions), it makes it that doing some simple thing z is forced to used workaround a.  Because language b has this feature set, this leads to general bureaucratic overload.<p>Java isn't bureaucratic just because of the language alone, Sun & apache contributes a lot of this itself in how they've programmed their standard libraries and their love affair with XML.",1210776256

189618,comment,189494,189494,0,0,justindz,,,"This has always been a topic of interest to me.  The ""System"" (as much as/if there is one) is designed to facilitate a certain objective.  In our case, economic growth and individual wealth.  For brevity's sake, I'll skip the digression about clustering, distributing and distributing unevenly.<p>So, if that systemic objective does not make <i>your</i> life meaningful, what do you do?  The way of the world is towards this objective because it's the best progress we've made so far towards meeting most people's basic human needs.  Escaping to a different country with human rights and a different objective is not very feasible.<p>Changing the system isn't a good option because for most people the system is fine.  There are also tons of people for whom it's not fine, but they don't notice and it's not necessarily our business to try to wake them up unless they ask.<p>So I think the best option is, like the author is suggesting, to opt out as best you can.  Find what makes you happy and base your life around that, while minimizing your conflict with the governing body (e.g. they pay property taxes, rather than bury a bus full of guns and plan to resist--that would be un-lazy and make them miserable).<p>Had I not gotten married (which I don't regret, btw), I would have continued to work to fuel my desire to buy up a big plot of land that I don't have to mow and building a minimal but fully livable tree house.

A lot of designers (myself included) can get caught up in the mind set of 'beautiful' = 'Good Design' which is not the case. Most sites should avoid looking ugly but do not need to look beautiful.
