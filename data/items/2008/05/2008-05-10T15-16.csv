But one hell of a good effort I would say for a bootstrapped startup, toughing it out in market with fully funded sharks.<p>Can I ask what's next in your pipeline, how does this experience influence your future projects?",1210434830

186340,comment,184345,184499,0,0,thorax,,,"Well, I didn't actually mean it in that sense. When MySpace was getting its umpteenth million user, the site layout, fonts, styles, etc, was all amateurish and nowhere near ""great"". It didn't have any elegance at all anywhere.<p>Nowadays they've had some professionals hop in and touch up some of the core site elements. I still wouldn't call anything about it ""great"", even in terms of ""good match for each user"" because it feels more like they're just working with whatever they were given. None of the widgets/elements/profile tools they're given are 'great' on its own.<p>So basically MySpace shook the premise for me that quality is any sort of an essential element for success. They're probably an exception, but they're very much a huge exception.",1210434814
186339,comment,186298,186298,0,0,m0nty,,,"False dichotomy. Ask yourself a slightly different question: can we hire someone with skill <i>and</i> experience? And the answer to that is not ""I know someone with wild skillz who does all these kewl demos but he hasn't worked on a big project yet."" Learning to program for a big project is a skill in itself, so I think you need to get an excellent programmer who is also good at building large apps <i>and</i> can prove it.",1210434565

Its complexity can be frustrating sometimes, a bit of a time-sink.<p>Altough I'm currently using a Mac, I try to resist the temptation to use Textmate. It may be easier to use and extend, but it is not Free Software.<p>I wonder if in the next releases Emacs can be made more friendly to users who keep forgetting about how its internals work and the elisp syntax :-)",1210434360
186336,story,,,2,4,iamwil,"Ask YC: Tools for non-profit organizations",,"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0206.cabot.html<p>I was reading this article about donating cars to charity, and I was a bit surprised to learn that non-profits have to go through a for-profit organization to auction off the cars that they have.<p>In general, this led me to think about non-profit org problems (which are many).  Every one that I know who's worked in non-profit before says that money is tight, and it's mostly based on volunteers who can be flaky and non-committal.  The most glaring problem that I see are usually their basic IT needs, and getting the tools to coordinate and communicate.  I can't help but feel there's an overlooked opportunity in an under-served market here.  However, the only thing I can think of is consultancy, as most good tools they need have an open source version.<p>Anyone know what's currently done in this arena?",1210434354
186335,comment,185830,186307,0,0,hugh,,,"<i>if you're smart enough to make a successful poker bot, you're probably smart enough to write a program to trade stocks or other liquid instruments like government bonds or commodity futures</i><p>I'm not so sure about that. I think the main reason is: there's a lot more ""stupid money"" at the poker table than there is in the market.<p>The bot as mentioned doesn't seem to do anything particularly fancy -- it just looks at the cards on the table and figures out your odds of winning based on that. This is information which is easily extracted mathematically, but which most players don't have direct access to. Good players will have a pretty good idea of these probabilities, whereas lousy players won't. If you can find yourself on a table full of lousy players, you're at a huge advantage.<p>In the market, on the other hand, there's only one poker table, and all the best players in the world are already sitting at it. Any time statistical arbitrage opportunities arise in prices, you can bet that D.E. Shaw and Rennaisance Technologies have already noticed it and moved a few billion dollars that way. If you want to win, you don't just have to be smarter than six guys in their basements doing calculations in their heads, you have to be smarter than thousands of overpaid quants with supercomputers.",1210434154
186334,comment,186298,186298,0,0,sayhello,,,"It depends on what you define as skill. Some skills can only be obtained through experience. However, experience alone is meaningless.<p>These guys do sound like they don't know what they are doing, and them looking for someone with skills in specific technologies only might be a bad idea.<p>Instead of those specific skills only, for a CTO, they should perhaps look for someone with broad knowledge (or willingness to learn) of their problem/solution domain (web application development for instance), as well as solid technical ability.",1210434043

I never met anyone who was so successful in coming across as completely arrogant using only text.<p>Advertising has traditionally been very unfocused. Anything that focuses it will work better than unfocused advertisment. Facebook has the data to focus advertisments. So neccesarily, Facebook works better in delivering advertisments to users. QED.<p>If or not they are actually executing this optimally is not relevant, the fact is that they have the capability.<p>Microsoft and a bunch of very smart business people are willing to bet billions on this. I think I'll stick with their opinions, rather than that of Matt Maroon, a very mediocre smalltime poker player.",1210433967

You want to find people that are actually in your target demographic, not the fickle digerati that try 10 new web services a day but never stick around at any of them.<p>You want your initial customer base to be your target demographic because their initial feedback will help shape future iterations of your product.  If you just launch with the web 2.0 social news scene, their feedback will be less relevant and will take your product down a distracting path.",1210433863

186329,comment,186081,186150,0,0,babul,,,"just because something is difficult to learn does not make it a goog weeder. Python/Perl/etc. were not thatdifficult to learn and back in late 90s were goog indicators as people who used them were focused on getting things done easily and efficiently as possible.<p>This, and the the fact that generally they were not taught at college/undergrad level, menat people who had learnt them were self-developers and/or early adopters etc. who had a ""real"" interest/passion and which then helped to differentiate them from the general masses.<p>Just because you know a functional language does not neccessarily make you any more/less smart. I know plenty of people who are brilliant at things like ML (they have maths backgrounds) but not so great at bigger picture thinking and putting it all together. the really smart ones are people who can do that.<p>Just imho how I see things.<p>Sorry if I was off topic in posts, maybe I was missing points as reposonding to many things at once.",1210432542
