People keep discussing about balance in startup, startup life, aspects of startup (tech, pr, marketing) etc.. Though people fail to think about the issue of having a balance in the industry. Women obviously an important part of the startup ecosystem. I fail to believe that in this are we have come to a saturation point. I think women need to take initiative and and make the leap. I would personally like to see more women founders. \nThe reason I am passionate about this topic is because of my girlfriend. In the past few years she has been really passionate about the tech scene and doing a startup. She currently works for Fotoflexer.com and loves it.",1209617982

And, he's also upset that the starting salary for a CS grad is now pushing 6 figures.<p>I'd actually wager that the true cream of the crop is primarily interested in starting their own companies and cashing out early.  It's the second tier that are interested in working for MSFT and GOOG. And then, the rest of the companies are fighting for scraps.  I could be wrong, I'm not doing the HR thing like Joel is.<p>And, it's only going to be a matter of time before undergrad salaries across the board start climbing.  And once the press starts writing ""Tech shortage.  Salaries skyrocket!"" there will be a lot more people going into CS as a major.",1209616921

178067,comment,178010,178010,0,0,maxwell,,,"The problem with most synchronization systems I've encountered is that they're based on unification -- ""one version to rule them all."" Unification seems to be an optimization strategy, seen in all kinds of networks, from computer to political. History doesn't suggest it's a very good model in the long run, since it's so fragile. The Bible survived because so many people duplicated it, while all those single manuscripts in Alexandria, however divine, went up in smoke.<p>Duplication seems to beat unification. Just look at how Wikipedia and Google, writhing seas of duplication, kick the living shit out of closed taxonomies and hierarchal directories. Anand Rajaraman hit the nail on the head with his ""more data beats better algorithms"" observation, and I'd skew it here as ""more copies beats better organization."" I want to <i>asynchronize</i> my data, not synchronize it. The tricky part is making this model work at a personal level, across devices and yet not exposed to the world at large.
