Microsoft bob: bad, online file/data synch: good. Obviously the MS implementation is bound to fail for reasons circling the proprietary-lockin-nonstandard-triangle but the idea itself is killer.

If they sold the company for 20 million dollars, you'd gross about $60,000 in options, and probably net around $10,000 after capital gains and stuff.  Give or take an order of magnitude.  Just a very rough back of the napkin.",1209614077

178032,comment,177766,177858,0,0,jrockway,,,"> I don't see why people get so excited about version control, myself.<p>Well, for most programmers it's one of their most frequently used applications. Subversion is annoying because operations are really really slow.  ""svn ci"" takes forever as it slowly calculates changes, sends them to a remote server, waits for svn to slowly update its database, and finally wait to get a response back.  I want to commit my changes, not take a 15 minute nap.  Git creates a few files, and it's done.  Commits are instantaneous.<p>Subversion also has other annoyances.  If you want to save your changes before updating, that's too bad.  ""svn update"" can destructively modify your working copy (with no way to revert), and there's no way to commit when Subversion decides that your working copy is out of date.  You have to merge upstream right then and there, so fuck you.  This means that you have to make a copy of your working copy with ""cp"" just so you don't lose data.  Then you have to manually merge.  What!?  This makes me pine for the days of ""foo.c"", ""foo.c.BAK"", ""foo.c.BAK.OLD"", etc. ;)<p>Git handles this the right way.  You can commit your changes whenever you want.  They're saved forever, and you can always get back to this state.  If you feel like pulling in upstream, you can.  You then have the opportunity to merge, or say ""fuck the merge"" and forget it.  Git doesn't care when or if you merge upstream into your working copy.  You're never forced to do anything; you decide how to work, the computer doesn't tell you what to do.  (You can even do it non-linearly; make a branch ""foo"", do the upstream merge in ""master"", pull a few upstream changes from ""master"" into ""foo"", work on that for a while, pull the rest of the changes in, and finally merge foo into master and send master back to the server.  Git handles all of this perfectly, so instead of worrying about what the version control system wants to do, YOU get to decide what to do.)<p>Finally, Subversion, despite its marketing hype, has no support for branching and merging.  Yeah, it has ""cheap copies"" that you can use diff3 against.  What a joke.  (SVK is better.)<p>Anyway, please don't think I'm some rails weenie that just switched to Git last week because some blog told me it's cool.  I've been using it for over two years, not because it's cool but because it instantly made programming more enjoyable.<p>Like I said, I don't want to be too mean to Subversion, since that's never the way to advocate something ... but switching from Subversion to Git feels like ending an abusive relationship.  You don't realize how bad it was until it's over.",1209613645
