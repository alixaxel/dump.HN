Has the average gotten better in the last 30 years, stayed about the same, or gotten worse?<p>My feeling is it has gotten much worse as people have sought degrees solely for the purpose of using them to get jobs in the field, precisely as you suggest would happen to blogs and reading cliff's notes.<p>However, may I point out that blogging is very different from reading the cliff's notes of a book? A hiring manager can read your blog. If they simply check  that you have a blog, well, whoop-de-doo. I have a blog, so that clearly proves nothing.<p>However, if the hiring manager reads your blog, they can deduce a great deal about what you pretend to think and how you communicate it. So it is a small example of your work, much as posting source code is a small example of your work.",1211684372

199294,comment,198859,199164,0,0,xirium,,,"> IP was conceived in such a way that TCP, UDP, and other protocols could be layered on top of it, but because NATs break the encapsulation, with NAT each new protocol requires every router's NAT to be reprogrammed to know how to handle it.<p>> If IP had been designed with NAT in mind, it might not be so broken now.<p>Perhaps UDP should have been defined with session numbers. Some NAT complexity is due a lack of standard session identifiers.<p>> The internet was meant to be a network where every computer is equal, and in that environment anyone could set up a server and start doing business or providing their own content. No more. Now, thanks to a completely avoidable numbering shortage and a NAT-hell, the internet is getting to be more like television - big company's servers provide the content, and you consume it, just as the media companies and cable companies like it.<p>There's no shortage of network addresses. However, there is a shortage of products that support practical protocol extensions, such as RFC1365. Router and operating system vendors have been keen to push IPv6 compatible products but there's less sales to be made by supporting downwardly compatible extensions.<p>You may be conflating your remaining problem - ISPs firewalling desirable packets for the purpose of creating more profitable grades of service. Admittedly, its no fun being squeezed between large corporate interests but be positive.",1211684000

If it's a simple website where the JavaScript just makes things a little slicker or easier to use, then you should gracefully degrade for browsers with JavaScript disabled. Same with CSS and low res.<p>If it's a complex web application, don't worry about the people without JavaScript enabled.<p>As for cookies, I think it's pretty much expected that they be enabled for any sort of login mechanism.

199279,story,,,58,53,hesid,"Telling our children the truth: response to Paul Graham",,"I do not remember my parents ever lying to me, and I have tried to always tell my children the truth as well.<p>I never remember my parents swearing at anyone or about anything. They were honest when they were angry or upset, but did not feel it was helpful to get demeaning or curse things or people. I have also tried to help my children work out their problems and anger without resorting to shouting or swearing, because I agree that the escalation is more hurtful than helpful. We don't always succeed, but that is the goal.<p>When our textbooks glossed over the truth or TV programs misrepresented reality, my parents pointed it out. I have done the same with my children.  When we asked about sex, drugs, alcohol, my parents explained it straightforwardly and also explained why they had chosen to remain virgins until married, and not risk addiction to mind-alerting substances (or even health-altering tobacco).<p>Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny were always fun imaginary characters.  Jesus was a historical person, whom, my parents honestly explained, some people considered just another human being, but that a third of the world's population considered something much more, themselves included.<p>I have similarly tried to tell the simple truth to my children.  What is lost by that?<p>As to religion, my parents said that they believed that God really does exist and that the Bible is a historical record of man's interactions with a real God. But they did not hide from us, even when we were very little, the fact that there are many people who think God does not exist, and that it is really only the personal experience of God for oneself that can ""prove"" his existence (and the existence of a spiritual realm) to an individual.  They pointed out that if a person has never experienced God, he has no reason to believe God exists (unless he wants to accept the testimonial of others who have as proof enough).  As a result I was able to be honest when I myself had not yet encountered God, and never look down on others who had no reason to believe in him having not encountered him.<p>I always felt free to challenge my parent's values and perspectives because they did not demean opposing opinions, but explained clearly and directly why they had chosen the path that they were on.  They practiced what they preached. I have tried to do the same with my children (now all in their twenties).<p>My children have the advantage of seeing the honesty of my parent's lives as well as my own and my husband's.  When my mother got cancer, we sat our kids down and told them everything that was happening... they knew about the chemo and the pain and her 5 year fight to live was played out before their eyes.  On her death bed my mother asked my second son about the paper she had been helping him research for college. He knew her body was soon to stop functioning... and that while some thought her spirit was also about to end, none of us believed that was true.  We burned her body, scattered her ashes and rejoiced in her release from pain into eternal life.<p>I believe if parents do not think that heaven exists they should tell that to their children the first time they ask.  But they should also tell them that many others believe heaven does exist. Or vice versa. That would be telling them the truth.<p>Perhaps my parents were so straightforward because they were highly educated (my father graduated from Caltech (BS), Columbia (MA), Cornell (PhD) and Princeton Seminary, my mother summa cum laude from USC), so intellectual honesty was important to them.  Or perhaps they were honest because they believed in the moral obligation of truth because of their faith in a moral God.<p>Whatever the reason, I would like to affirm to all parents that truth works.  Be honest about why you have chosen to believe what you believe and live how you live.  Be honest about the mistakes you have made and are making.  Kids can handle truth delivered compassionately.  What they need is a strong relationship with you and each other, and that cannot be built on deception.",1211682443
199278,comment,198732,198932,0,0,erdos2,,,"Who is Ayn Rand? An utterly dreadful writer and philosopher who believed that the axiom of reflexivity of identity had substantive ontological, social, moral and political consequences. It's no accident that Objectivists sought to justify their belief in the ""virtue of selfishness"" in the law of reflexivity; they have no use for altruism. Rand's philosophy glorifies the sociopath homo economicus, whose sole objective in life is to maximize his expected utility.<p>However, results in evolutionary game theory show that a society of self-seeking, self-regarding agents will generally face conditions that ultimately lead to its collapse.<p>Gary Cooper's goofy speech in The Fountainhead  ( see <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc7oZ9yWqO4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc7oZ9yWqO4</a> ) typifies Rand's attitudes. Among other preposterous propositions, Cooper is made to utter the nonsense that great inventions are uniformly the work of sole inventors, selfishly and reflexively seeking their own interests. This is ahistorical; see Against Intellectual Monopoly by Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine ( <a href=""http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstnew.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstnew.htm</a> ) for the history of inventions such as the steam engine, radio, telephone, and so on. In each case, ideas were in the air, and there were a number of people who came up with similar inventions more or less at the same time.<p>Cooper argues the basic notions of intellectual monopoly, which are that intellectual property is essentially indistinguishable from tangible property, and that all copies of ideas ""belong"" to their creator. These arguments come straight from the RIAA legal playbook. I'm surprised that any culture of hackers would want to subscribe to notions more commonly associated with corporate monopolists.",1211682305

199275,comment,198964,199243,0,0,henryprecheur,,,"At my school there was a blind guy, he used Lynx to surf.<p>Once I looked how he was surfing / coding. And he was incredibly slow ... ""Normal"" people scan the page. He could not, he had to more or less ""read"" the whole page. I did not see much more, but it gave me the impression that surfing was a frustrating experience for him.<p>One of his friend told me that one thing that screwed him each time a was surfing was the ""Javascript links"". On lots of pages (well ... too much) instead of a regular HTML link there was a piece of Javascript code witch supposedly was opening a new window or do ""something smart"". These links did not work for him.
The worse part of the story is that the fall-back mechanism is pretty easy to do:<p><a href='page.html' onclick='return do_something_smart(this.href);'><p>Maybe the situation has improved. But I guess that it did not improve that much. Writing a Web-browser is complex, therefor I believe that integrating accessibility features is difficult too.
And upgrading everybody's wheelchair is not easy in practice. So it is for screen-reader, and accessibility software. We still have IE 6 around! It is utopic to believe that every handicapped would upgrade in just a few years.<p>Of course we should not drop Javascript, but we should think about its impact. It is like adding a step in front of a building; it can be a real obstacle to some people.<p>The web would be a better place if we do so. Not only for our handicapped friends, but for us in the future. I don't want to give up surfing when I am old because I broke the web with fancy and non-essential features.<p>HTML is the web.
