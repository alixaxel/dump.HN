Another way is that the people who create these devices will just limit their specs to be below Microsoft's requirements.<p>I think this is amongst the first time MS has directly had to respond to Linux as a threat on the desktop though.",1210449396

Since then I haven't had any problems. I can't imagine working with a regular keyboard ever again. Interestingly my typing speed has gone up too.",1210448778

Afterwards I switched from clickety keyboards to slimlines on all of the desktops that I work on.  I really do think that the shorter finger distance makes a difference.  Additionally not having a keypad means I can get the mouse closer to the keyboard, which reduces strain for me.",1210448634

I have picked DynDNS for super-low TTL and pretty good DNS reliability story.<p>If all I want is just sit on domain until its useful, I may pick yahoo instead.",1210448626
186464,comment,186434,186434,0,0,smanek,,,"To recap: Microsoft says that if a producer wants cheap window's licenses, they have to limit the specs on their umpcs (screen < 10.2 inches && hd < 80GB && ! touchscreen).<p>This is a good thing.<p>If a consumer wants, e.g., a umpc with a touchscreen, they will be forced to get a linux one. Getting more people to try linux (and giving the linux hardware an intrinsic edge), is probably one of the worst things microsoft can do to itself and one of the best it can do for linux.",1210448620

186459,comment,184549,186436,0,0,antirez,,,"> in response to actual problems, instead of hypothetically in response to imagined problems.<p>This is really one of the differences indeed and you stated it very well, and you are right, stated this way we are saying a very similar thing. Also I think this other sentence from your comment is very interesting:<p>> part of being an expert is knowing what to throw away and what to keep.<p>So now the picture I get is that the real difference is selectiveness: about what design to pick among the possible, what problem is worth to fix, what experience is worth to remember.<p>Thanks for the interesting comment.",1210448160

As soon as we stop standing for this bullsh*t, ISPs will have to adapt or die.<p>But, as long as we keep paying them, they will continue to try and pull this stuff on us.<p>And pistoriusp: probably not. It is extremely unlikely that your ISP enforces its bandwidth limit per day. What do you mean by ""Your connection is reset every 24 hours""? That's a bit ambiguous ...",1210448111

No<p>IOW, there's still no recognition today, on the side of the purveyors of ""classical"" AI, that anything except digital processing might be needed for a computer to think ""as a human would"".
