205381,comment,205258,205258,0,0,nostrademons,,,"All of these have ""Yes, but..."" corollaries that can bite you just as bad:<p>1.) Yes, but...a little time spent refining your idea at the beginning can save you a lot of wasted time later.  For example, my startup is a webapp to let people create their own casual games.  We decided, early on, to start with an arcade proof of concept, because arcade games are what everyone thinks of when you say video games.  All our competitors did the same thing.  But most of the growth in the casual games market has actually been puzzle and word games, which are also more personally compelling to me.  A little thought might've saved months of work.  (Or maybe not, since it's looking like the sweet spot for our app may be in multi-genre games that don't fit into any archetype.)<p>2.) Yes, but...it's often not clear what the right tool for the job is until you've explored the problem domain, and you need to pick <i>a</i> tool in order to do that.  What if, after building that Window's GUI app in C#, you find that it really should've been a webapp?  If you'd written it in heavily macro-ized Lisp, you could probably just change some macro definitions to generate HTML pages instead of Windows GUI forms.<p>3.) Yes, but...when you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again, it's time to abstract it into a library.  Otherwise you end up like one of my old employers, who found they were invoking some DNS call wrong and said, ""Well, we can fix it...but we'll have to fix it in 109 places.""<p>Another example comes from my current project - I've got this abstraction called a SpriteReference, which basically picks out one or more sprites, possibly in a context-sensitive way.  I built a custom (JavaScript) GUI widget for this, which is used in lots and lots of places.  When I went to clean up the GUI for this, I spent a day changing the widget and it's instantly reflected everywhere I use it, instead of hunting down the several dozen places where SpriteReferences may appear in the UI and changing each one.<p>4.) Yes, but...oftentimes, you need those tests and documentation to build the rest of your application.  You can't build upon code that doesn't work.  There've been several times that I went back and added unit tests simply because that was the only way I could make further progress.  The alternative is ""hope and pray programming"", which is unfortunately quite common in real companies (both my previous employers have practiced it, and they were in security/remote-access and financial software).<p>5.) Yes, but...if you can do it in 6 months, so can all of your competitors.  It seems like there's a wide variety in launch times of successful products, ranging from 3 weeks for Reddit to 5 years for the Apple Macintosh.  I definitely agree that you should put <i>something</i> up on the screen as soon as you can though - I'd say more like 1 month.  That gives you something to react to so you're not designing against a vacuum.<p>Really, this is why software entrepreneurship is hard.  A lot of advice is right but incomplete, and could easily go the other way depending on circumstances you have no way of foreseeing.",1212263018
205380,story,,,1,0,abl,"Ask YC: wiki for java docs?",,"I am trying to put together a wiki for a project at work which is written in Java. I would like to promote collaboration between the programmers, in addition to the top-down funnel knowledge-base currently put in place by the project manager. The goal is to provide wiki-like edit capabilities to an existing set of generated java docs, and also to integrate into the wiki the growing knowledge base collection of developer questions / solutions currently being gathered by the project manager.<p>I've looked at sites such as wikia.com and wetpaint.com for hosted wiki solutions, but didn't find any solutions to import the existing knowledge base (Word documents :))  and the generated java docs. Unless there are some functions on these services I am not aware of?<p>I also looked at jdocs.com, which appears to do just that - provide editing for java docs, but I found its UI not appealing.<p>What I have in mind is something that looks like Facebook's developers wiki - http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Main_Page<p>Or is there is a mediawiki plug-in that does just this?",1212262943

My boy, that, or rather the converse: that you can work in and manage an industry without learning it, is the great promise that MBA programs make to their students. The idea that there are abstract principles of management, of dressing down subordinates, of bringing in new business and cutting costs (that's all that CEOs do, essentially) that free the MBA from ever having to dirty his or her hands with the business--their primary, all-consuming interest, they protest--is for them a feature, not a bug.

I think the best way is to take a couple representatives of the pride young enough to be able to percept reality and learn things, show them the rest ""civilized"" world, teach some basics, provide with some primitive instruments and get them back to the pride. Then, just watch how things will get developed: will they kill each others or will they develop ? What we can get of this is prove or bust of mainstream development theory, at least. :-)",1212261453

Our main form of search is entering ingredients that you have on hand and you get a list of recipes that contain those ingredients.<p>We are now looking at doing something more then just full text searching, and keywords. The first problem we want to attack is making words that are basically the same, show up in the search when the other is called.<p>For example, we have egg and eggs, or milk, 2% milk, whole milk, and skim milk. We want someone to only have to enter milk. If they do enter milk, then the entire cluster should be searched.<p>My idea of an approach to this problem is this. We search for longest common substring. Then create a directed graph representation. Then when a person searchs for a term, we use a proximity measure and then search for all the terms with in a certain proximity.<p>So, I was wondering one, does anyone know if their is a name for what I am talking about, and two, does anyone maybe have a better idea of how to do something like this.",1212260948

205359,comment,205228,205310,0,0,antirez,,,"Thanks, sure I'll try to provide more information.<p>wc -l tells me that the whole framework is 1095 lines of code. It is composed of this different modules:<p>the main module handles the page generation in a functional way, I pass a method implementing a given page of the site and this method will get a parameter that is an object that holds the whole state of the page, so I've methods like isloggedin?, username, isadmin? and so on.<p>The same module will handle HTML generation. We rewrote it from scratch using method_missing so there are no preset tags. We write things like<p><pre><code>  H.div('id'=>'foobar') { ... content ... }\n</code></pre>\nAnd there are virtual tags we can define that are tags with specific pre-set properties. Also there are DSL-ish ways to write SELECTs, HTML lists, and other elements that written as H.tag(..) { } are not very easy to write/read.<p>Then there is the DB module that is somewhat similar but much more light than Active State, but the idea is to encapsulate a query and the single rows in objects with methods like .each, .save, .delete and so on. Example:<p><pre><code>    users = fetchall(""SELECT * FROM user"")\n    users.each{|user|\n        user['username'] += ""x""\n        user.save\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWill append 'x' to every username in the DB. We restricted all the functionalities in order to don't have any kind of ""rebuild"" stage, just the information passed in every query from the DB are enough. There is not one class per table and so on it is pretty basic.<p>Another module is KFS: this is a class that will create a database in the filesystem in a very simple to manage way. Every time we have data we don't want to store in the DB we store it in KFS: the KFS root is inside the webroot so for example storing an image there will have the effect to be directly accessible by the web server. KFS is designed to don't have race conditions and is atomic. So it acts as a base for a caching system.<p>Other things implemented in this 1095 line so fo code is a DSL able to generate forms for us with the ability to automatically check for missed fields, to auto-fill parts of the form with defaults coming from a DB query or from a Ruby hash object and so on.<p>The framework is also able to do automatic pagination of everything we like to paginate just passing an anonymous function for data access and a block for item->html rendering. Send emails, generate Google Charts with little code, and... that's it.<p>Our configuration is Apache + mod_ruby + ruby 1.8 + MySQL<p>All the code was written in less than 30 days including 50% of the framework (the other 50% was already written by me in a week of the last summer).<p>Thanks for your comment.",1212260707
