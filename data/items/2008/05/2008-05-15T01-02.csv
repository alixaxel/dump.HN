190182,comment,190011,190052,0,0,silencio,,,"Except they aren't making the best decisions most of the time, and by the time the kid can study what they want easily on their own (think things like money for buying materials), they're stuffed with bullshit busywork from their normal classes that are intellectually boring and take forever to do, until they get to college (hopefully).<p>Or at least that's what it was like for me. One of the things I loved to do was to code, and well, that sort of went out the window for the two years I was in high school because I'd be dead tired and in need of sleep every single night after the requisite extracurriculars and homework. My parents wouldn't let me drive to school in the morning because I'd get only a couple of hours of sleep a night sometimes and they didn't want me to fall asleep behind the wheel.<p>Even on weekends I didn't have time because I had to study for the classes I hated and do lame group projects where at least one member didn't do their fair share of work.",1210816038
190181,comment,190148,190148,0,0,hhm,,,"Dani, this is a wonderful essay, really. Thanks a lot.<p>I had many problems related to what you mention there. Long story short: some years ago I got to my nation's newspapers because of my own small game studio and of my work on the local game dev association, and I got to speak to lot of conferences with very prestigious people, but I always felt empty, and I always felt I was more and more of an imposter. I rushed doing activities not because of my interest on them, but because of how they could help maintain and enforce my own image... and so on and on. Also I actually was starting to feel more and more stupid, because I wasn't doing the things I love most, and that I think I need to feed my mind.<p>Finally I decided that was stupid, and I decided a first step to find myself would be to shut the mouth up. I stopped caring a lot about press and related stuff, and despite I eventually did some note most of the times I sent the media to colleagues that I felt cold talk better than me about the different subjects. I dropped out from forums and disappeared from communities which only helped my ego grow. I just kept working quietly with a few clients, and I even started filtering my clients only to do the most interesting projects, which could again give a boost to my brain and let me feel again that I was doing something worth, and not just something that gave me money while making the others feel I was actually worth.<p>This was a lot of time ago, and that was like a slow career reset for me. These days I'm much happier about my work, while being a lot more slow profile (now I'm rarely called from the local press, as a remnant of my previous career, and because of my current activity I'm now teaching and giving some conferences).<p>But I think I have a lot more to learn yet. I loved your article, and despite all my growth in the latest years, I found interesting ideas in your article which I think I could use to improve my life a lot more. Thanks again.<p>Only wish I had read this some years later (the more years, the better).",1210815919
190180,comment,190011,190040,0,0,silencio,,,"I don't know about that. There are plenty of cases similar to this, and yes, even younger.<p>I got pushed into a gifted program (the highly gifted magnet schools in LAUSD) by my parents. It was boring, and I wish they didn't - the people I met were fantastic but the program itself was the biggest waste of time. Another kid in my class made the papers like this one cause he finished his HS diploma and went on to college early, and his mom fought EVERYONE along the way to make it happen.<p>Of course, I dropped out of HS early and went to a community college too (well, I took a whole bunch of classes there starting from 6th grade anyway), and I enjoyed the experience. A lot of my friends went from middle school to college. There are a fair number of programs like that around like at Cal State LA..a few more places..Simon's Rock is another one I can think of now.<p>I don't think it's really the studying, but the attitude. The only time I liked the gifted program was where we almost had individualized studies (one kid might be doing basic math, another could be doing algebra) but were grouped together into one class (the social factor) and we were free to do whatever we want. I liked community college because I picked what I wanted to do, generally wasn't stuffed with useless busywork (I dropped most of those classes and took the same one with different profs), et cetera. Meanwhile, the equivalent AP classes at the HS were boring, nothing BUT busywork, and we HAD to stick with the schedule studying to the tests we had to take and there was no room for anything more because some people couldn't keep up. The forced-ness was what I hated.<p>And yeah, that whole work and play are opposites thing is annoying too. I learn a lot from hands-on labs and things, and we didn't get to do a lot of those ever. Maybe it was because it was a cash-strapped public school?<p>Finally, I think all of this needs to be customized to the student, because that's what makes it so good. The gifted program I was in was great for some, the early college stuff was great for others, and neither really worked for me.",1210815735

One of the best pieces of advice I got was from a college professor whose course I took in high school:  ""You're headed for great places.  Don't sacrifice your childhood/youth just to get there faster.""<p>At the time, I didn't really appreciate the advice, but looking back, it gets truer every day.  Take some time to appreciate the little things.",1210813667
190166,comment,189830,189987,0,0,jdavid,,,"on a failed startup of mine, i redid my taxes 3 years after i closed the company.  i received $25k as a refund, and it cost me $4k for the accounting.  good accounting is WORTH IT.  had i used that firm in the first place i might have saved an additional $50k and spent $4k on fiscal advice.  Since i self funded i did a lot of stupid things when it came to managing cash flow and spending personally for my company.  also for being able to better leverage credit vs opportunity cost on selling stocks and paying employees, i could have much better used my available margin trading ability that had an interest cost of only 5%, and with some stocks, waiting till the fiscal reports would have been worth 20%, which would have kept me in the black personally, vs. having a burn rate.<p>oh the things i would do differently, and well, the things i am doing differently with social helix.",1210813623
