My first conception was a website where I posted lots of tiny bits of code, centered around Web 2.0.<p>So, lots of little bits of Web 2.0.  Hmm, ""bit,"" like bits and bytes.  Then I thought of Web 2.0 tropes and came up with 20bits since that was the trend (37signals, 30boxes, 43things, etc.)<p>And now you know.",1210650654

Perhaps making something that other people enjoy is more necessary for a writer than for a programmer or painter?",1210650593
188281,comment,187977,188086,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"This isn't an entirely fair criticism. The section you are talking about was labeled ""Marketplace,"" and it was intended to be a way for users of the software to find other companies to either network with or buy/sell from/to. It was completely independent of the ""Vendors"" section and had no bearing on the accounting aspects of the software. The feature has since been removed, in any case, since I didn't have enough time to work on it.",1210650423

188277,comment,187590,187590,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't get why Twitter doesn't scale.  It's just webmail, but with smaller messages and a simpler UI.  Here's how twitter should work:  every user should have a list of users following them.  When they tweet, each follower gets a copy of that message in their personal inbox.  A copy is also attached to the tweeter's account, so new followers can suck that copy in when they start following them.<p>That's it.  Now, sending a message takes O(n) (n=followers) time, which is really cheap.  On my machine, it takes about a second to create and sync 40,000 files (there's not much data, so replicating this via NFS wouldn't be that expensive either).  With that out of the way, all you have to do is ls your ""twitter directory"" to see all of your friend's messages.  This is another incredibly cheap operation.  It's easy to distribute, and there's no locking.<p>Anyway, just look at the mail handling systems at huge universities and corporations.  They scale fine, and they're much more complicated than twitter.  Twitter is just a subset of e-mail, so it should be implement that way, not as a ""SELECT * FROM tweets WHERE user IN (list, of, followers) ORDER BY date"".  That is the wrong approach because it makes reads (very common) expensive and writes (very uncommon) cheap.  That's why twitter doesn't scale.",1210650100

I have exactly the same problem with programming, do the little tidying up actions almost reflexively now, AND I climb as well. Absolutely love that climbing all in your head.<p>Joking aside, I'm a sophomore in college now, and I closely approximate the 'brilliant failure' model (a little arrogant to say that though!). High school was a breeze, but suddenly you can't not do homework anymore. Classes are not going well and either the depression started first or the lazy/bored attitude did; either way, it's a death spiral. Takes a ridiculous amount of brain power to stop it.<p>Hm that was an impromptu rant, sorry.",1210648995

Also, the framework itself is so compact you can carry everything around in a few megs of a USB thumb drive, so now you have a truly portable cross-platform package you can use to develop wherever you are!<p>So just get involved, and let's lead the way into the cloud...
