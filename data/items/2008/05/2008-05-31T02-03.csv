Freshmen year it seemed like all the students were wide-eyed and eager to meet new people.  By Sophomore year all that had changed, much to the dismay of this new kid in town.<p>I've graduated since and -- I'm fortunate -- things worked out for the better.  But if I had it to do over again I almost certainly wouldn't transfer.",1212202701

This poll also seems to have initiated (in my opinion) some of the best discussions I've seen on this board in a while.  Although some polls and ""Ask HN""s can be a bit stupid, the good ones are really good.<p>So, yeah, I'm an INTP.  I've lately been acting a bit more E than usual, but I'm still definitely I (am all I am).<p>(Why oh why didn't Common Lisp abbreviate integerp?)",1212202573

They provide the syllabi / assignments / calendar used for all of their courses. You could probably take the corresponding classes and adapt their schedules and problem sets. I've done this for classes where I didn't find my lectures or suggested materials particularly helpful.",1212202557

205044,comment,204240,205010,0,0,tokipin,,,"> I would argue that if you can't test a given theory, then what you have isn't a theory, but a belief.<p>most psychology is like this<p>> The Wikipedia article I cited actually states that self-reporting is to be taken more seriously than the test results.<p>currently doctors look at pictures to determine if a patient has cancer or some other condition.  why can't the computer do that instead?  neural networks are used for this sometimes, but it remains that the subject is not so easy to capture with a pixel-wise algorithm.  hence, why is it strange that a point-by-point questionnaire is inadequate to ascertain someone's type?<p>> As far as the theory itself, the original ""Please Understand Me"" book is filled with wild extrapolations from anecdata and borderline mystical thinking.<p>the original theory isn't Kiersey's or Myers-Briggs'.  it's Jung's.  he didn't think of it as a ""put me in a box"" type of thing.  that was how Myers-Briggs sold it.  also Kiersey originally used four general archetypes, which he did not notice until later corresponded nicely with NT (rational) / NF (idealist) / SJ (guardian) / SP (artisan)<p>invention/reinvention of these types occurs often.  i remember finding a book published in Einstein's time titled something like ""on the two types of intelligence in mathematical discoveries.""  Jung's theory may not have even existed at that point, but the book was clearly talking about Ni/Ne (by extension, mostly INTJ/INTP)<p>another reinvention is the programming characters Mort, Elvis, and Einstein.  Elvis = INTJ, Einstein = INTP, Mort = probably ISTJ<p>and again, a lot of psychology is hand-wavy.  you're not going to be able to prove any of these things any time soon.  that doesn't mean they aren't sound.  take a look at those forums i linked, and tell me if you think there is no difference between them, especially no difference having precisely to do with their types<p>> This is precisely why this kind of pigeonholing is so maddeningly counterproductive.<p>indeed, it can suck, and some people use typology defensively and offensively, which is certainly counterproductive<p>> ""Clicking"" has just as much to do with personal goals as it does personality similarities, no matter how (mis)measured. What if one is aware that there are benefits to meeting with minds that have perspectives different from one's own? Perhaps that person would most ""click"" with people wildly differently than his/herself.<p>try it.  tell me if you find someone whose second letter isn't the same and you click with them.  i guarantee you you won't.  i don't mean that in an assholish dismissing sort of way, but the S-N axis is by far the most ""categorizing""<p>it's almost like speaking a completely different language.  you could flip every other letter and keep that axis the same, and you will be able to understand eachother easily.  but flip just that letter and you're at eachother's throats<p>is this a generalization?  despite the fact that my best friend doesn't share my letter on that axis; no, it isn't.  it's 800% proven fact, and will be the case in 800% -- maybe up to as high as 1200% -- of situations.  even videogame characters, and the letters S and N themselves, hate eachother due to this rigid dichotomy<p>> It would appear that this is at least in conflict with the idea that clicking is determined (at least partially) by compatibility on a personality axis. At most, this is an absolute refutation of MB personality theory in that it denies it any predictive power. What's the point of having the categories if you can always plead out of them when the evidence is uncomfortable?<p>could you think of them as boxes?  yes.  but they aren't boxes in the way most people would think.  <i>genaralizations</i> is more accurate, and gets across what i was trying to say -- you may be introverted, but that doesn't mean you can't go hit corners in your lo-lo wit da gangstaz whilst spewin out madd lyrics, or lead a country as president, etc.  in fact interesting things happen when you put types in places they wouldn't normally be.  you could think of it as a mutation effect that in some cases is very beneficial<p>Feynman (ENTP) is a great example.  most scientists are INTJ/INTP, but science was lucky and grateful to have Feynman as a member<p>your type is you, but what you do with you is up to you :)",1212202445

205039,comment,204602,204602,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"""the news"" is a filter on the vast flow of data about what happens in the world everyday.  it has been the traditional filter for so long that it is accepted as reality by nearly everyone.  
It is easier to control people than most think.  You don't even have to lie, you just have to control which truths they are exposed to.  Control the filter, control the people.  
This isn't especially sinister like progressives would have us believe.  The corporations aren't out to create 1984.  They just want to make profit.  So they control our filter with profit as a motivation.  What we want/believe is a filter that has truth as its motivation.  The reason the media is dangerous is because people think it is latter while it is really the former.  As soon as you realize that a source of data is trying to sell you something, that source should be immediately suspect.",1212201617

We started Stunt Pilot in the Flash IDE but it quickly became apparent that it was a really ineffective development environment for what we were doing. Flex has its problems, but at least the core model is more appropriate (i.e. entirely source code, command line compiler).",1212200740
