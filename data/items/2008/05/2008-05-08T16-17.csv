184735,comment,184345,184345,0,0,lee,,,"Here are some rules of thumb that may help guide your approach.<p>In my experience, you need to divide up your problem into two different issues to solve: design and branding. Design for functionality and smoothness of user experience. Brand so that your audience relates well to your product.<p>A lot's been written about good design. Yes, teens definitely respond to it. If a site's hard to use, they have the attention span of hummingbirds and if you cause an engagement failure because of poor usability, they'll be gone and won't return. Above all else, focus on making your site easy to use and the user experience seamless.<p>Branding depends on your audience's demographic. Most teens have developed a strong enough, though flexible, identity to be attracted to some things and repelled by others based on their perceived sense of who they are in their greater and lesser social ecosystems. You might be interested in reading everything danah boyd (intentionally lowercase) ever wrote, most especially ""Viewing American class divisions through Facebook and MySpace"" here: 
<a href=""http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html</a><p>In general, people, no matter what their age group, adapt to symbolic systems they're immersed in. Kids in gradeschool can glance at a page in a textbook and from the fonts, point size, layout, graphics, tell you precisely whether it's a third grade book or a fourth grade book, and therefore whether it's for them or not. (The same goes for someone looking at a full page ad in The New Yorker - font, point size, color choices, etc..) Higher income demographic kids are exposed to high end design by the time they're in their teens and have a more positive response to it than kids without the opportunity and exposure to design. In my own work with teens, non-college bound teens find Facebook's design BORRRRRING! [picture an entire class of kids singsonging that in unison] They tolerate a _lot_ of busy-ness and chaos on a page and will jump onto MySpace whenever your back is turned.",1210265927

French movie character experiencing existential despair boring.<p>Nobody outside of the medical world could possibly care about this stuff or get excited to work on it. Hardly anyone INSIDE the medical profession cares about it. Entire entry-level careers have been created for ths type of thing (medical records specialist) because nobody who can do something else wants to do it.  I'm surprised your programmer ONLY wanted $6900 a month. Boredom is the real reason she didn't get much done and eventually left. Also, let me guess... she also hated your guts because she was sitting here working on this super boring application while you were out doing stuff she perceived as not very important.<p>This isn't meant to be insulting. I had an experience similar to yours.  Nearly identical, aside from the duration and money involved. I didn't get paid as much and I bailed after 4 months. We even were using Python! I was the programmer. Other person was a doctor. Building some sort of medical record keeping startup thing. He was paying me ok, but not great. I had some laughably low percentage of the company. After the first two weeks, I alternated between wanting to kill him and wanting to kill myself. It sucked that bad. Medical record keeping is insanely boring. The programming issues are equivalently boring. It is like doing your taxes multiplied by 1000. It sucks. SUCKS. The hardest part of your programmer's day was probably mustering up the psychic energy needed to even fire up her text editor.  I'm almost having a nervous breakdown right now just thinking about it. You medical people have really gotten yourself into a record-keeping pickle.<p>Your only hope is to learn programming because any programmer that is any good will want to disembowel themselves working on this sort of project. There is a real opportunity here, because all this work is going to end up being done by huge mega consulting firms who specialize in these sorts of boring recordkeeping problems. They are going to charge $69,000,000 per month to do this.

The one they mean is someone who works long hours but gets little done.</i><p>Can you cite a definition of ""workaholic"" that has this sense? I can't find one (in a few minutes of googling). The definition that seems to come up everywhere is ""compulsion or addiction to work"". If they're arguing from that then it's not tautological.<p>The closest thing I found to the sense you mention is in the second-last paragraph of the (rather good) Wikipedia article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaholic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaholic</a>. Which makes me imagine the following thread: ""Ask YC: Are you a ""bulimic"" or ""relentless"" workaholic?"" :)",1210262889

Given the recent flap over adding video to the site, which is an individual user's choice, what would kind of noise would people make if ads started popping up on Flickr even if people could opt-out? The issue of how user's seemingly arbitrary whims may obstruct monetization of community sites seems to begging for further analysis.",1210262428
