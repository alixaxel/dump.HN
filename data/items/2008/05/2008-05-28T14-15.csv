A single small EC2 instance is around $75 per month + bandwidth.<p>You can also go with a platform on top of EC2, like RightScale, which gives you some support, including MySQL, but it's expensive ($500 per month!). I don't have experience with other services but I do use the RightScale dashboard for creating/restarting/terminating instances.<p>There are many advantages to going with EC2 though, if you can absorb the admin work. For example, if you need to do some heavy crunching you can run another instance only for the time of the crunching, say 12 hours, and that's all you pay for (12 * $0.80, if you were to use an extra large instance).",1211986571

We can only get so much oil per week into this country. There's only so much pipeline and so many tankers that we can send into our country. We are facing demand destruction. People decreased driving by 11 billion miles this March as compared to last March. Decreases in driving YoY have occured three other times and that was during severe oil crises.<p><a href=""http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/05/us-vehicle-miles-vs-real-gasoline-price.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/05/us-vehicle-miles-...</a><p>See this interview if you'd like to learn more about the fundamentals going on currently.<p><a href=""http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/05/t-boone-pickens.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/05/t-boone-picke...</a><p>But there is speculation, that is a fact. The total barrel capacity for Cushing, OK (where light sweet crude is delivered) is around 65 Million bbd. The current open interest for this contract on the NYMEX is about 300 Million bbd. These contracts aren't exercised, they are rolled and such.<p>Not only are their speculators, there are hedgers (transports, airlines, UPS, etc) so that accounts for some.<p>I am not anti-speculation. Speculators give liquidity to a market and encourage price discovery. Upping the margin requirements to trade /CL is a dumb idea. It would lead to further price manipulation.<p>We do need to get rid of OTC (over the counter) markets because they don't show us the price. The same can be said with credit default swaps (CDS), but that's another story. Provide an open market, and that will help.<p>If you want to scare out the speculators, tap into the Special Reserve for a week. That should cause a pop in the bubble. Clinton did it. Bush II has been pumping oil into the SPR and wanted to keep adding in and double the capacity. The numbers were something like 5x as much than what we had before he came in. Legislation just recently stopped him from adding more.<p>In terms of policy changes, you can put a price floor on crude contracts, say 70 bucks a barrel. Anytime the price goes under that, the government collects the difference and puts that money to work in a green hedge fund/pension hybrid.<p>Another policy would be to create economic incentives for people that buy cars.

Personally, I believe it's speculation, but that's only because every other time we've seen a 50% rise in price over 6 months (housing, dot-com) it's been a bubble rather than a sustained increase.<p>This is one of those things that it's impossible to know for sure either way, since secret market manipulations are by definition secret, and anyone who knows has a vested interest in not telling you.<p>Regardless, Friedman's point holds either way.  If it's a supply problem, then a gas price floor encourages the development of efficient vehicles and alternative energy technologies, providing us with alternative supply sources.  If it's a demand problem, a gas price floor reduces our consumption demand, and then India and China can go deal with the troublesome states in the Middle East (let them handle Iraq!)

I think the problem is that when I’m reading comments I see the username and the comment, but I don’t really associate them together in order to form a bond over time between that username and those set of comments.  Instead, I tend to remember a set of comments and a set of usernames, independently.  Am I alone here in this behavior?<p>In any case, the cities and ambition thread got me thinking about what it would take to make an online community more like an offline one.  I think the bulk of it comes down to conversation, of which there are two parts: content and mechanics.  The content side seems OK here (for what I’m looking for at least).  The mechanics side falls way behind the offline world, however.<p>Offline we have 3-d conversations using most of our sensory perceptions. Online, a lot of that obviously goes away.  Of course there are benefits of being online too, e.g. asynchronous threads, archiving, etc.  But the lack of the senses drastically takes away the emotional feel of the offline community.<p>Pictures next to usernames I believe would be at least a start in the other direction.  We would get more of a visual sense for a person.  For me at least, I think I would start associating usernames more with their set of comments.

202088,comment,202056,202056,0,0,streety,,,"Although I use S3 I don't currently use EC2 and the limited research I've done on it may mean that some of what I'm about to say is incorrect.  Hopefully others with more experience can jump in and correct any errors.<p>Firstly, when you talk about a shared hosting plan I assume you don't need to set up the server, you just drop your files in the htdocs folder and your site is ready to go.  EC2 instances are analogous to a vps system.  You're responsible for setting up the operating system, installing apache, php and mysql.  There are 'images' (not sure that's the correct term) set up with everything ready to go but that still leaves you responsible for a lot more of your site than you may be currently.<p>My understanding is that MySQL is problematic.  Currently each instance is given a certain amount of hard drive space but if that instance crashes for any reason all the data is lost.  The intention is that S3 is used for your permanent storage but it isn't suitable for running a database on.  Permanent drives have been announced but they will only be available later in the year.  Until then you are left with work-a-rounds, frequent backups to S3, mirroring drives across instances in the hopes that you'll only ever lose one instance.<p>Connecting multiple web servers to a single backend database server is handled in the same way it would be with any other vps service or indeed dedicated servers.",1211984088

The economist also claims that increasing supply will have a disproportionately small impact on the cost because the cost is not being principally set by supply vs. demand and therefore it would just provider larger hordes of strategic assets for the companies engaged in this practice who are hedging their positions against the dollar decline.<p>Is anyone smarter (and sexier!) than me able to bolster or refute that claim?",1211983670

This is not really a judgment issue but about explaining the dynamics of an existing market. If you would prefer to believe that I don't know what I am talking about that is fine. But at minimum I would suggest, if you are really interested in how artists today become successful that you do a little independent (and therefore not tainted by my bias) investigation from people that are really in the biz.
