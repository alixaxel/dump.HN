It's actually a bad sign, because it means I'm not working on my startup. ;-) Then there are periods where I'll post like twice a week and my RescueTime log'll show that I'm spending like 80-90% of my computer time coding.  So yeah, it's a tradeoff, and ultimately the code is more important, but I find that I burn out if I spend too much coding.",1210359502

You can't even play single-player gamers without it connecting over the Internet.<p>Also, the Need for Speed games have advertisements in them, when you've already bought the game. Like, you crash into an SUV and you see a big car insurance company logo on the side, and every time you get a call on your phone from one of the NPCs, you see a Verizon logo.

185722,comment,185450,185450,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I remember having a conversation with a couple coworkers and my former boss about the nature of ""talent"".  My hypothesis is that what we think of as innate talent or giftedness really arises from slight differences in pain/reward pathways in the brain, such that ""gifted"" people derive enjoyment from activities that the average person finds very boring.  This leads to them practicing those activities more often, which leads to them becoming more skilled, which leads to <i>more</i> enjoyment, and a positive feedback cycle ensues.  The amazing feats we see are the cumulative results of years of this feedback cycle - at each stage, the gifted person is just a little bit better than the average folk and enjoys the activity just a little more, but over time that lead compounds.<p>That was my experience with math, and has for the most part been my experience with computers.  Even when I was ""on strike"" in 6th grade and refused to do any schoolwork, I found it very difficult to avoid the math tests or homework.  I tried once and found it so boring that on all further math work, if I wanted to protest how stupid the assignment was, I'd just do all the work and write down the wrong answers in the answer column or do it and refuse to turn it in.<p>When I quit my job to work on my startup, my former boss threw up all sorts of objections like ""You have no idea if this'll work, and if it doesn't, you might find yourself writing lots of code for nothing, and that really sucks.""  And I just kinda looked at him a little funny.  What I wanted to say was, ""Dude, that's what I do anyway.  That's what I do for you, that's what I do when I get home, and that's what I'd continue to do even if I cashed out for millions.  There's nothing wrong with writing lots of code for nothing, and on the off chance it succeeds, it means I won't have to work for superficial idiots like you.""  (I didn't; I just said ""Okay.  I'm still leaving"" and left.)",1210357434

185719,comment,185348,185682,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"Many of the people who ask this question don't really want an answer, because they're already committed to leaving ""room"" for an immaterial soul.  So the simplicity of the answer depends mostly on the ideological commitment of the questioner.<p>I'm game if you are, though.  You might start by thinking about a modern digital computer.  It's made up of a very large number of very small devices (transistors) that sling populations of electrons back and forth.  The brain is made of a much larger number of less-small devices called neurons, that sling bigger populations of bigger objects (organic molecules) back and forth.  So according to the basic understanding of QM that tells us relative indeterminacy increases when considering smaller objects, the functioning of the human brain is marginally more predictable than the insides of a modern computer.",1210357325

Taking the time differential between when a contribution was posted and when it first met a ""value"" threshold (say, 5 upvotes) and rewarding one of the people who voted in the affirmative by giving them, say, .25 karma points for it, does not reward the lowest common denominator. My hypothesis is that it might have exactly the opposite effect by encouraging those who might otherwise be excessively frugal with their votes to use their voting opportunities in a meaningful way.<p>In other words, if you want to look at this in absolutes and think that when I say that I think it's a good idea to take a given variable into account that I am somehow implying that the variable is free of all bias and in every other way perfect, you are making a mistake.

As far as I can tell, it's still some healthy market forces at play, I don't think the line to monopolistic behaviour has been crossed just yet.<p>What I don't quite understand about this whole debate is the variable pricing part.

(as opposed to new releases or the back-catalogue) There's hardly any differentiation in price going on there. Are retailers playing the Apple game as well?

If I didn't have the storage backend done, I had to work on that, because otherwise there was <i>nothing</i> that'd have a concrete effect.  Same with the basic UI skeleton - it needed to be done before anything else in the UI was useful, so if I didn't want to work on it, tough.<p>Now there are many more potential ""attachment points"" to the project, and it's easier to find something interesting to do.  If I don't want to work on this UI widget, I can find another UI widget that needs doing.  If I don't want to do UI at all, I can work on the backend or runtime libs.
