179949,comment,160004,160313,0,0,ibsulon,,,"I was just looking through the archive and saw this. What I meant was that the idea of steroids as an illegal substance was idiotic. The dangers of steroids are overstated with the newer generation of steroids in moderate doses (IE - below ronnie coleman levels.) Controlling insulin levels personally scares me, but I don't consider that as something to make illegal either.<p>My perspective is that people should have the right to use these chemicals on their bodies as they see fit. Now, if a private company wants to limit those working for their companies from ingesting such chemicals, I agree that it should be their option. (The NFL should be allow to test for steroids, for example.) I also agree that these chemicals should be limited to those whose bodies have matured.<p>However, I think it's idiotic to control what an adult does with his or her body if it doesn't affect another individual.",1209764523

You say to buy stocks, in a good index mind you, but you also say they are no better as an asset class when you adjust for risk.  So why buy them?<p>Or do you agree with my point from above?:<p><i>The overall point here that I suppose I am making is that just because asset classes grow at the same rate when adjusted for risk doesn't mean you should be indifferent to which you invest in. Buying low, selling high aside, if you can smooth out the risk via buy and hold and other strategies, it is wise to invest some in the assets with the higher growth curves.</i>",1209762111
