This article says that Rails is no good for processing intensive tasks and that you should use C. Rails is a framework for serving web pages, it isn't doing any of the processing or message queueing. I'm sure that Rails won't work out of the box with whatever backend you would need for a stable twitter, but I haven't heard anyone address the actual technical issues. Is it just a matter of having to tweak Rails or is there a reason that Rails is the wrong architecture?<p>Blaine released Starling, the queue system that Twitter uses. What do people think of that? Was it the right architecture? Is there some out of the box proprietary solution that would have worked better? What were the tradeoffs of writing that in Ruby?<p>People seem to be catching on that one of the problems is a small operations team. Some people say there's just one person but I'm pretty sure there's two. Either way, I can't imagine that with just two people they've had enough time put in fully redundant systems let alone a real staging environment. What should operations look like for something Twitter's size?<p>On the Gilmore Gang, Blaine mentioned that the reason Twitter's track feature only works on the phone and not the web is because it's much easier for them to do broadcast than to do the lookups necessary for historical display. Yet, I use Summize and Tweetscan to give me a web based track feature.

If I type a search phrase into the URL, it redirects to google.  If I type a URL into the google box I am one click from the site I want to be at.  I guess I'm just sloppy, but I use one for the other all the time.<p>It almost seems as though the two could be combined with some clever rules.",1211483083

The point is that the discussion that follows about the ideas in the articles/comics is still radically different on HN than most other places.<p>Randall has some thoughts that apply very well in a group like this so his comics appear here often and start interesting discussions. The only thing not interesting to me is that every time one is getting started I have to wade through a boundary layer of ""lets blacklist xkcd"" comments.<p>Doc my karma if you will, but I think the silent majority has voted with the upmod arrow on the post.
