202599,comment,202371,202422,0,0,hv23,,,"I've been thinking a lot about this problem and recently had a similar, in-depth discussion with a group of friends. 
The essential model is a VC firm that pools together the small investments of private individuals, presenting that pooled capital to startup X, and splitting up the equity that's exchanged for the investment among the individuals who invested in it. Those investors, in addition to just money, would offer the Startup X whatever resources they can provide.
At first glance, it seems like a great model, and it very well could be viable, if you can think through the following problems and come up with solutions:<p>- Privacy concerns. Someone has raised the issue on this thread already- private companies are not like public companies; they do not have to disclose their operations, finances, etc. because it is not in their own interest to do so. In this model, what's to keep a competitor from making a small investment in the company and finding out the nitty-gritty details of Startup X's strategy? For this model to work, privacy would have to be granular, meaning only the VC firm that pools together the investments is privy to all of Startup X's private information, while the individual investors do not get total access. Would individual investors still pursue such an investment, when they do not have access to complete information? The answer is uncertain.<p>- VC resources- As far as Startup X is concerned, if they are a viable business with high potential, why would they accept money from this VC instead of going a traditional route, where they can get access to experienced VC's with resources, connections, and expertise? A discerning entrepreneur would realize that, while these individual investors certainly could have something to contribute by way of resources and could even provide strength in numbers,  the fact that they are making small investments might mean that they are small-time investors and are not that successful in the field. That, to me, would indicate that they don't have the kind of resources from a VC that I need for success. If I were in that position, I'd rather even take money in the form of a loan, given the previous privacy concerns I've mentioned.<p>- As tricky said, ""managing the noise"". Let's, for the sake of argument, say that Startup X DOES get 100 investors that can each offer some resources that would be of help to the firm. Of course, if you are an individual offering your money, time, and resources to a firm, you have a strong opinion on what the firm should do. As a startup in this situation, I could imagine facing a lot of pressure from a number of opinionated individual investors in a situation where you are not equipped to handle that pressure. An early-stage firm should focus on building a product and positioning itself to users, not on delivering results to its investors. In fact, startups already face enough pressure, in many cases, from VC firms to cash out early-- you think they'd want to take on even more?<p>These are just some of the problems I came up with. I'm sure there are numerous more, but hopefully one day one of us can  think through the equation and figure out a good solution. I'm CERTAIN that this model will succeed one day, if only because early-stage investments are getting smaller and smaller to reflect the lower costs of entry for web-based startups. Let's think away.",1212007557

202595,comment,202342,202503,0,0,gunderson,,,"Are you saying that people in the US don't get vaccinated already with or without ""health insurance""?<p>BTW, the reason that someone can't sell a $20/month insurance policy that gets you the kind of basics you're talking about is b/c it's illegal.  By law health insurance plans have to abide by all kinds of rules, one of which is that they must insure against the possibility that you develop a drug problem and all kinds of improbable things.  The end result is that even the cheapest health insurance is quite expensive.<p>The problem is that government is already regulating the private market significantly.  Add to that the tax loophole that lets employer-provided plan fees be taken from pre-tax income, and you have a set of incentives that have resulted in the mess we're in.<p>Also, top notch care at a level that was very elite in 1990 is now significantly cheaper than it was in 1990.  The problem is that the average person wants cutting edge 2007 medicine, which is a lot more expensive.<p>Think about it this way, the more effective healthcare is, the more people will spend on it (not less).  As procedures have a higher chance of succeeding, more people will decide to get them (who in the past would have gone to hospice).",1212007473

If something comes from the government, you get one try (like doing an experiment with one petri dish).  If the government does not offer a top-down approach, then often many people will try (so you get many petri dishes and a better experiment).<p>The same argument can be used in favor of healthcare policy at the state level rather than at the Federal level.<p>The idea that the Federal government offers the ideal approach to solving broad problems is fraught with a fundamental misunderstanding of science and the idea of any policy being at its core an experiment.<p>Sadly, those who advocate a single attempt at a solution are very far from thinking of the optimal solution as the result of experimental trial and error.

When a person is in the ICU, it's not quite so clear that a person is only going to live 1-2 days and then die.  People want their family in ICU, because they want that person to have any and every chance at living.<p>Certainly he raises some good points about cost effective health care.

Option 1: Spend 50% of your time honing your skills, gaining valuable experience
Option 2: Spend 100% of your time honing your skills, gaining valuable experience
Another thing to consider is how awesome it is to work with people who are as good as you (or better), love what they do, and have things to teach you. Even if option 2 pays less, take the cut and get the experience that will propel you into a higher pay bracket. BTW, none of the supremo hackers I've worked with have begrudged me time to play with some cool new tool - as long as I willing to share my knowledge.",1212004943

That's a very good point about the cultural institutions -- though in my experience, they're woefully underattended.  It's <i>possible</i> to hang out at the zoo, conservatory, science museum, etc. ...but my family was thought to be a bit odd for actually doing so.  (Of course, we lived in the wealthy suburban soccer mom part, not the university-intellectual part, so that's probably why.  Neighborhoods have messages, too.)",1212004807

Raise your price and possibly get the attention of the clients of the higher-level competitors.<p>It's also a kick in the rear to your current potential client that ""you are worth it,"" showing them that this is a good deal for them and that what you're offering is clearly a steal at the present time.<p>Whatever you do though, don't ""threaten"" to raise prices on them if they don't call in the next 10 minutes. Just let them know, ""We're planning on raising our prices about 15% (made up) next year (quarter, month, whatever), but if you decide the other guy isn't what you need we'd be happy to work something out for you. Just let us know soon.""<p>Goodluck!",1212004807
