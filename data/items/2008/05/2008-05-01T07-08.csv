Its totally lame compared to CL.  Its weird how I now prefer the non-newness of CL's look.  CL is so clean and fast, that Kijiji just looks awful and cluttered.  Not to mention it uses Flash, which immediately gets minus points.<p>Yay for CL. I have gotten so many awesome things through it.",1209628490

I'm a grad student so I have a lot of back and forth between school and my computer and I'm always syncing files back and forth through email (which is such a pain!).  File syncing is a big deal for me.  The fact that you guys do version control sorta by default is awesome.  I've been thinking about how you guys do that, and I think I know how, but I'll keep it to myself as you probably wouldn't comment or confirm it anyway. (so nobody steals your thunder).",1209628091

On a macro scale, even the population explosion of the last 40 years has so far been sustainable due to huge advances in agriculture, health care, and energy. As long as our ability to provide those things grows at the same or better rate as our population, it is sustainable.<p>(I'll note I am using the literal definition of 'sustainable' here... able to be sustained. As an nerd, I'd really like our future ability to provide those things to be environmentally and socially sound, but that wasn't what I was talking about.)<p>Exponential population growth becomes a problem when we give up innovating.",1209626168

178195,comment,178056,178146,0,0,rtf,,,"The endgame for any ""platform"" software technology is an open, freely available, ubiquitous spec. Flash is, within its current domain, ubiquitous and free-as-in-beer. Only the open part is missing...<p>And that means that it could be dethroned on mobile devices: unique Flash builds everywhere will increase the cost of the platform over time, become a support nightmare, and eventually make users switch to a more open alternative. As it stands platforms other than Windows and Mac are second-class citizens, either having buggy/lowered performance(Linux), or supporting only older versions of SWF. (Wii Opera, mobiles) This is not a good track record.<p>So Adobe should be applauded for this move. They aren't stupid, and they still will have some control over the spec into the near future, since they possess the premier dev tools.

The Reddit thread is full of people really interested in this idea but unable to run the program due to some incompatibility or another.  I did this in Direct3D because I didn't know Flash and thought I could get it done faster in D3D.  Well.. I could, and that was a big mistake.  The end result is way worse than the time delay it would've taken me to learn Flash.<p>Hopefully someone finds the source code useful, or inspiring, or somehow some good can come out of this.  It's just frustrating that I can't solve these issues for people.<p>You might want to try making sure you have the latest Direct3D components:  <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3&displaylang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2da...</a>",1209625631
