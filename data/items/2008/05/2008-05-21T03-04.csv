195669,comment,195160,195570,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Statistical randomness is pretty well defined. Say you have a set of independent and identically distributed (iid) random numbers, then if you plot a long run histogram it should resemble the probability density function of the distribution. Irrespective of whether it was generated by a pseudo-random algorithm or by quantum disturbances, your set of numbers is statistically random in a practical sense.<p>Your question seems more philosophical, though I think at the quantum level things become more or less random whichever way you think about it. Furthermore, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle suggests that we'll never have sufficient technology to measure both the position and momentum of a particle, which I would say is a pre-condition to observing a deterministic process at work on the quantum scale.",1211341954

This is far different than having a proficient coder walk in the door.<p>You'll have much better luck getting a proficient rails coder than a proficient django coder. On the flip side I'm starting to get a lot of rails candidates that aren't really interested in rails, but used it at their previous job. For  while if someone had rails on their resume it meant they took the time to learn it on their own (which is a good sign). Those days are gone.",1211341609

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (as well as the cut of 64) disproportionately affected the lower income brackets.  As a matter of record, tax rates are higher for the lower income brackets, and lower for higher income brackets than at any other point in US history.<p>To cite wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986#Income_tax_rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986#Income_t...</a><p>""The top tax rate was lowered from 50% to 28% while the bottom rate was raised from 11% to 15% - the only time in the history of the U.S. income tax (which dates back to the passage of the Revenue Act of 1862) that the top rate was reduced and the bottom rate increased concomitantly.""<p>""The ""rich"", the top 1%, are the prime drivers of wealth creation. They are the reason GDP grows faster than population growth.""<p>Anyone who has capital gains from the labor of others. It is misleading to say that they are responsible for this growth themselves. Their wealth is invested in those in other income brackets, and used to drive up GDP. There's nothing morally wrong with this system.<p>I agree that incentives for the upper %1 have a disproportionate effect on GDP. That said, from an economic perspective, I happen to believe that the Laffer curve has a very steep right side, and that we are to the left of the peak. This means that by raising rates, more revenue can be collected. For example, the 1981 tax cut did not improve revenue collection.<p>I believe that we should raise rates in order to pay for progressive social programs. The upper %1 have benefitted from not only their skill and ability to drive wealth creation, but also a good deal of luck.<p>Progressivism is a form of social insurance.  It is an acknowledgment that perhaps, through no fault of my own, I might have been born poor, or with skills not suited to the modern economy.  It is the understanding that in the richest nation on earth, no one should want for food, shelter, or healthcare, no matter what their ability to contribute.<p>This is not rhetoric. It is a judgement of values, and an assertion of a logical argument.<p>Think of it in terms of human capital.  Those born into poverty today lack the access to crucial resources, such as education, to contribute to the economy to their full potential. It is a colossal waste of human resources to allow these conditions to continue. Imagine if Bill Gates had been born in Compton instead of Seattle.",1211339664
