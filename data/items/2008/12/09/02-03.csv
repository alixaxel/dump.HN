390814,comment,390413,390413,0,0,martinflack,,,"A year ago I embarked on a project to learn Common Lisp by building a trading system, to execute with the Interactive Brokers API.<p>I modeled the woodiescciclub.com trading strategies, primarily because the math is simple and the patterns are well defined. However since then I've seen other parties on the web talk about how the Woodies patterns actually don't make money consistently, although I didn't corroborate this.<p>I actually found CL to be a fantastic language for this. I was writing up the Woodies patterns using a DSL I had created:<p><pre><code>  (defpattern zlr ""Zero Line Reject"" :with-trend\n    ((count 1)    (within  100  250) (trend :up :or-opposite-invert))\n    ((count 1)    (within  100  200) (trend :up :or-opposite-invert))\n    ((count 0 10) (within  -50   99) (trend :up :or-opposite-invert))\n    ((count 1)    (within  -50   50) (trend :up :or-opposite-warn) (angle :down))\n    ((count 1)    (within    0  115) (trend :up) (angle :up) (away 8)))\n\n  (defpattern hfe ""Hook From Extreme"" :counter-trend\n    ((count 1)    (within  200  300) (trend :up))\n    ((count 1)    (within    0  199) (trend :up) (angle :down) (away 3)))\n\n   ...etc\n</code></pre>\nThe defpattern macro was creating, for example, #'is-zlr, #'is-zlr-up, #'is-zlr-down, which were then used by a trading engine that monitored 5-minute bars on a given futures contract and launched trades.<p>Another CL feature, restarts in the condition system, helped too. When the data feed broke or got corrupt, an exception thrown which could reload the data feed and restart back in the listening loop without forgetting any context was helpful.<p>Also just running in a Lisp image was great because I could swap functions during a live feed without stopping the program.<p>In the end, the programming worked great, but the trading system lost money. I had it working in backtesting over a few months and then papertrade mode for weeks, and then when I took it live, the volatility rose and it started hitting the stop all the time. I adjusted things like stops based on ATR, but I really just ran out of my little budget to play with it.<p>It did however teach me CL. ;-)<p>Modern trading platforms have built-in tools and programming languages and writing things from scratch in CL is really just an academic exercise.<p>I believe it's possible to do algorithmic daytrading, but quite a bit more difficult than it seems. There are way more market behavior modes than you can appreciate at first, and the keys to success lie more in counterintuitive aspects of your system like position sizing rather than intuitive aspects like entry strategy.<p>The best talk I heard from someone on the subject indicated that it takes years and the end result is a fairly sophisticated algorithm-switching engine, because the hard part is just to survive.",1228789139

Perhaps you know how it works, but have not thought through the implications of it working any differently?<p><i>No, closures refer to the j variable that doesn't get incremented, only assigned to. ... The actual issue is that all invocations of the loop body alias the same var j, even though it's declared inside the block.</i><p>You're doing it wrong.  Javascript doesn't have block-level scope.  It <i>only</i> has functional scope.<p>In the process of parsing an execution context, all ""var"" statements (and named function declaration statements, which are a special sort of ""var"") are handled first, and only once.  A var inside a loop still only creates the variable once, scoped to the function.<p>So, your code sample is actually equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    var closures = [], j = undefined;\n    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        j = i;\n        closures[i] = function() { alert(j); }\n    }\n    closures[0](); // outputs 9, duh ;)\n</code></pre>\nYou have one ""j"" variable that is shared by all 10 closures.  When you set ""j"" in loop iteration 9, the closure created in iteration 0 faithfully sees that change.<p>Closures tracking changes to variables in the parent function is not a wart.  Consider this code:<p><pre><code>    var thing = (function () {\n        var privateData = ""foo"";\n        return {\n            set : function (x) { privateData = x; },\n            get : function () { return privateData; }\n        };\n    })();\n</code></pre>\nIf closures ""trapped"" outer values at their current state, then no matter how you called thing.set(), it would always return ""foo"" from thing.get().  Also, it would be much more expensive to keep track of completely independent contexts.  <i>(You could argue that these side effects make js a less pure functional language, and you'd be correct; another, less clear, argument could be made that this makes javascript less good, and I'd disagree.)</i><p>However, your complaint seems not to be about closures or shared activation objects per se, but rather about the lack of block-level scope. Since ""j"" is created inside a set of braces, you seem to suggest that there ought to be multiple ""j"" variables created, which are each forgotten at the end of the loop.<p>That's how C++ does it.  But javascript is not C++.  Javascript is javascript.  And <i>only</i> functions create scope in javascript.<p>IMO, this is not a wart.  Doing otherwise would mean that every ""while"", ""for"", ""switch"", ""if"", and ""else"" would have to create an activation object, which would get quite expensive and complicated.<p>If you find it confusing that a var inside a loop is only created once, then take Crockford's advice, and always put all ""var"" statements at the start of a function.  Personally, I disagree with him on this point, because I find it more useful to ""var"" variables near their use so that moving code around doesn't accidentally result in leakage to the global scope.",1228788378
