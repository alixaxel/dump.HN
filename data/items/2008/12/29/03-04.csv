And as working with these sorts of datasets becomes more and more common, it is silly to think that we should have to reinvent the wheel every time instead of having tools evolve around their uses.<p>Moreover, we're in an age where a couple people can successfully take an idea from a hobby project and turn it into a working business with little more than time, effort, and knowledge.  Given this, I would ask where the line is drawn between ""I need to work with this data"" and ""what sorts of cool things can I do with this data"".  My personal belief is that the line is very fine and blurry, and that the work of ""jerkoff hobbyists"" today is likely to lead to the serious uses of the future.",1230522110

412520,comment,412244,412410,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"One problem with discussions like this is that ""programming"" has an absurdly narrow definition. If you aren't actually spending the majority of your day typing code into emacs and fixing Javascript bugs, you are not a ""programmer"": you have ""migrated into management"".<p>A senior law partner who never personally argues a case or drafts a contract, but does nothing but attend meetings all day and supervise younger partners and paralegals, is still ""practicing law"". The chiefs of large hospital departments are still ""doctors"" even when they don't pick up a stethoscope for days at a time. Late in Beethoven's career, when he was almost completely deaf, no longer able to perform or even to critique other performers, he was still a ""musician"".<p>Whereas (e.g.) Joel Spolsky is now a ""manager"". Except when he's working on Arc, PG is more likely to be called a ""manager"" or an ""angel investor"" or a ""venture capitalist"" or a ""technology pundit"" or a ""marketer"" or a ""writer"" or a ""teacher"" or a ""designer"" or a ""strategic consultant"" or an ""executive chef"" (I think he does all of these things!) than a mere <i>programmer</i>. But just because these guys somehow don't fit our hyper-narrow definition of ""programmer"" doesn't necessarily mean that they had a problem with their software careers. It might just mean that there are many opportunities in software -- some quite rewarding or lucrative; many of which are best performed by someone who also knows how to program -- that aren't captured in the scope of the term <i>programmer</i>.<p>Part of the reason why there seem to be so few ""programmers"" in their forties and fifties is that by that time many of them have dreamed up a better job title for themselves, like ""senior member of the technical staff"" or ""chief of QA"" or ""Java architecture consultant"" or even ""co-founder"" or ""CEO"".

He was a CEO and a co-founder, and was paid accordingly (and then some). But what was he doing when he reviewed a spec in gory, technical detail? He was <i>programming</i>. At a higher level than the average college intern, yes, but just because you're not touching a keyboard or dealing with individual calls to <i>malloc</i> doesn't mean you're not programming.<p>Unless we decide that it does. But then we shouldn't be surprised to find that <i>programming</i> as a career is something that many people eventually grow out of.
