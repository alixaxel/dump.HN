406976,comment,406509,406509,0,0,incandenza,,,"If you look at the rest of the site, they're not only against porn, but seem to be discouraging orgasm in general, based on the ideas of spiritual traditions such as Taoism.<p>While it's true that many traditions did advise this kind of thing, that usually would have been in the context of cultivating some kind of overall spiritual path.  It's not something that would just be recommended to everyone in a blanket way.  It seems to me the people in their forums who talk about struggling not to masturbate at all may be doing themselves more harm than good (at least, they could apply their energy to something other than trying to subdue a basic biological function).  I think a lot of people persuaded by the message of this site are just indulging some aspect of their psychology that gives them a tendency toward self-denial, while buying into the notion that it's for some higher purpose.<p>It's important to distinguish between a habit and an addiction.  It would be a difficult adjustment for me to live for two weeks without electricity, but I wouldn't consider myself to have an electricity ""addiction"".  To qualify as an addiction, a habit would have to have additional characteristics: for example, escalating momentum, interfering with other life activities, being used as an escape from problems that were created by the addiction in the first place, and so on.<p>There's a tendency to use the most extreme examples as anecdotal evidence.  Some people can have a glass of wine with dinner and it's not an issue, and some people (alcoholics) may ruin their lives in a matter of days after the first drink.  But that's not a particularly strong argument for saying that no one should ever drink, just because some people may become alcoholics.  You just have to carefully observe your own life and figure out how to make use of your energy in an appropriate way.  Anyone who has a blanket prescription for everyone is peddling dogma.",1229986252

406974,comment,406305,406866,0,0,antiform,,,"What you say in your last statement is true and helps to clarify a subtle point. I tend to shove all of that stuff (logic, set theory, problems of undecidability, etc) into the nondescript box labeled ""philosophy of mathematics."" When I meant a field was ""small,"" it was not meant to be pejorative. Philosophy of mathematics is a rich and productive field with many applications within its varied fields. The main problems I see are the ones described the article I linked, in that people attempt to apply the theorems to things like physics, politics, law, or postmodern philosophy.<p>Of course Goedel's theorems do not totally exist in a bubble that only contains arcane mathematical incantations. For instance, Goedel's theorems imply (like the halting problem) that you cannot create a compiler that would be able to determine whether a program will not terminate and reject it, by considering what happens when you feed it a Goedel statement. However, this problem is something that I would also classify under ""philosophy of mathematics.""<p>Also, I hope I did not provide any implication that my view (or any view, for that matter), is the final word on the subject. I'm not dead-set in my own beliefs on incompleteness and if you can provide a convincing argument of a rigorous, nonmathematical application of Goedels theorems, I'd be more than happy to change my mind.<p>There is considerable discussion as to what exactly the incompleteness theorems imply, and there are many eminent minds on the many different sides of the argument. For instance, I believe Stephen Hawking is somebody who believes that physics cannot ultimately be formulated into a final number of finite principles. Do I believe this to be a rigorous application of Goedel's incompleteness theorems? No. Do I believe that this can be applied to fields outside a relatively restricted problem space? No. Does this mean I'm right? Of course not.<p>As to your point about Strong AI, I don't want to open that can of worms in this thread. I'm not yet convinced that the human mind is equivalent to any finite state machine, so I'm afraid that we don't even agree upon its the basic premises. However, I would love to discuss it any time outside of the thread.",1229986104
