414785,comment,412912,414282,0,0,azanar,,,"Sometimes the choir needs to be preached to, though. It helps to hear someone else put into words what one might be thinking intuitively. It also helps to know that more people are thinking the same thing than any individual might give credit for.<p>The flip-side of this is that people like Robert are not just preaching a dreamland ideal that people should aspire toward but accept up front they'll never be able to reach. The expectation is that people take what is being preached and put it into practice; but that's not what I usually see. I normally see people who will arm-chair philosophize about, but will either succumb to peer pressure or fear before actually pushing for what they believe is a good thing. At that point, the believe is completely useless.<p>The upshot of this is that places that actively prevent people from turning out anything but crap need to be actively prevented from turning out <i>anything</i>, if we expect conditions to change at all. But it's a risky position to take, and most people seem under the impression that the thing it puts most at risk is the livelihood of their families. While I think that risk assessment is melodramatic, I will admit it does put one's social class at risk, which ties directly into the relative creature comforts of their family. Knowing why people prioritize this latter matter so high is something I've been struggling with for a little while, but maybe it's just because I lack the context of a family to support.",1230677051

414773,comment,414564,414564,0,0,tokenadult,,,"The article includes the interesting comment that a fairly eminent geometrician had little number sense of the kind described in the article. One of the wonderful things about mathematics is that it combines reasoning about discrete, countable things, that is numbers, with reasoning about shapes, that is geometry. An especially good book about both aspects of mathematics is John Stillwell's Numbers and Geometry.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Numbers-Geometry-John-Stillwell/dp/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Numbers-Geometry-John-Stillwell/dp/038...</a><p>I'll quote a bit of Stillwell's preface to give the flavor of the book:<p>""What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>"". . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>""The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the 'advanced' branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.""<p>A more controversial, and plenty spicy, comment on the algebraic approach to mathematics as contrasted with the geometric approach to mathematics is Paul Halmos's article, ""Applied Mathematics Is Bad Mathematics,""<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=rQ6FAAAAIAAJ&q=Halmos+Applied+Mathematics+Is+Bad+Mathematics&dq=Halmos+Applied+Mathematics+Is+Bad+Mathematics&ei=DKJaSZT8F5GoM8mguN8B&client=firefox-a&pgis=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=rQ6FAAAAIAAJ&q=Halmos+A...</a><p>(that's not a full-text view of the article)<p>which I disagree with, as maybe Halmos intended his provocative title to be disagreed with.",1230676669

414770,comment,414330,414700,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"""Rent stabilization in NYC isn't mandatory for new construction,""<p>In NYC, future crazy regulations are always a worry. Most new construction IS rent controlled. My previous apartment (built to be condos, but the owner was unable to sell) was. To evade various ridiculous NYC taxes (which make a lot of new construction unviable), you need to submit to rent control.<p>""if landlords can't charge rents commensurately, where are the sky high rents coming from?""<p>Sky high rents come from <i>current</i> demand. Rent control provides a disincentive to <i>long term investments</i> like new construction or major renovations to rental buildings.<p>Incidentally, neither of the ""things that bother you about the free market religion"" are actually part of the free market ideology. 1) only applies to efficient markets (like the rental market, with many buyers and sellers, and good information) and 2) is closer to the Clinton/Bush/Dodd/Obama ideology that ownership is something to encourage.<p>""Neighborhoods don't just magically become expensive to live in. I won't claim that the only reason is because good, noble people moved in when things were cheap and turned things around, but it's ridiculous to suggest that the people living in a place have nothing to do with that place becoming a desirable place for wealthier people to live.""<p>In some cases the people are completely unrelated. The main attraction to living in Harlem is the 1-6 trains. Having tried to get a sublet for my old place, I discovered that the people living there make it <i>less desirable</i> to live in.<p>""You're making an emotional appeal for a guy with a family to have a right to be close to his job - that cuts both ways, you know.""<p>As far as who ""deserves"" to live on some place, it's a wash. So lets not favor any particular group over the other. As far as emotional appeals go, I'm not casting any group of people as assholes.",1230676518
