We've been inundated the past few months with articles about a__hat CEO's in the financial services industry who were absolutely clueless, allowed their people to take financial risks that have brought their companies to their knees, while taking tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.<p>Meanwhile, Joel says that sometimes as a CEO, it's helpful if you put up the blinds and not just say that you care about your employees.  CEO's get stuff out of their way so their people can do the work.<p>Hell, a CEO just using the term, ""servant leadership"" to describe their philosophy of management is a pretty idea these days, considering what the financial sector is going through.",1228190110

While not a huge deal, fetching water for his developers' guests is not something that Joel really has to do.<p>...and even if I were to assume the basest of motives (that Joel wants to keep his developers working at Fog Creek so they make him lots of money), it's still a compliment as a developer and the type of attitude that makes me enjoy working hard.",1228188409
