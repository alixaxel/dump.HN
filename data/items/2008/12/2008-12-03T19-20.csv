Another task involves optimizing the processes and minimizing the associated cost.<p>The whole raison d'être of a large organizational pyramid is cost of processing and transmitting information and handling the associated noise. Middle layers of management filtering and processing information for the upper decision-makers. Keeping the noise down by designing company 'policies', 'strategies' and 'missions' that can be easily communicated to every employee.<p>A manager who designs the most efficient and scalable organization structure wins over the competition or conquers a new market.<p>Here comes the internet with zero cost of communication. Here come high level languages that make it cheap to describe the most efficient processes.<p>Any large organization can in principle be substituted by a code because the organization itself IS a code written in job description language.",1228334391

But I do support a different standard for workplace safety where it comes to children, so I don't think the question is irrelevant.<p>As always, there are unintended consequences.  A great article in the Mercury News called ""paid by the piece"" demonstrates how sub-contracting circuit board assembly clearly has led to a circumvention of child labor laws.  And of course, much of our dirty industry is now handled by children overseas.  For instance, small children spend as much as a day sorting through junkyards in Cambodia in order to afford just enough food to stay malnourished.  The alternative, of course, is starvation.",1228334373

384706,comment,384606,384606,0,0,RobGR,,,"I believe that as a general trend, we are in a period of time where the large organization is collapsing, across wide areas of human activity.<p>Without writing a thesis on it, I offer the following disconnected observations:<p>* The US Military, one of the largest human organizations, was successfully attacked at it's headquarters for a total expenditure of less than $400,000 and a few lives, and has not and may never catch the attacker<p>* The Roman Catholic Church's sex scandals<p>* To be fair to all religious factions, punch in ""baptist financial scandal"" into google, or any other large religous denomination<p>* The disappearence of any sort of financial security in corporate employment or retirement<p>* The fact that there is no ""corporate ladder"" that PG refers to, and it has likely existed only in people's hopes and fantasies for two decades or so.  The way to advance in most corporations is to have the corporation grow beneath you, or to leave for another corporation and come back to a higher position.  Promotions and raises inside one corporation do not meet inflation when averaged over all employees.  Loyalty is punished, almost as if in some sense the organization knows it is a bad thing and is trying to kill itself.<p>* The collapse of joint financial organizations that were once emmensely powerful and efficient:
   * We used to all put premiums into large insurance corporations, and those insurance corporation used their economy of scale to invest those premiums, such that they paid out something like 109% of premiums as claims and still profited.  Today most big insurance corporations pay out less in claims than what they take in via premiums.
   * We used to all put money into banks, which then made loans and paid interest to the depositors.  Now we don't save, and as of a few months ago, banks don't lend.<p>* The US Federal Government, arguably the largest human corporation, is bankrupt and disfunctional -- it was never a model of efficiency, but in times past it got some things done, built dams and won the wars it fought and etc.  Now it does nothing productive at all.<p>* IBM, Microsoft, GE, GM, Exxon, etc -- the readers here don't need to be told of their failures, but I would additionally point out the trend that they don't want new additions to their organization, and attempt to hire mainly contract, outsourced, non-employee employees these days.<p>* The United Nations<p>One thing to note, is that I think if the trend is away from big organizations, the trend of integrating Europe into one big EU is a bad one.  The trend of increasing Federalization in the United States is probably also generally the wrong direction.",1228334256

""Working Girl"" with Meg Ryan, ""The Secret of My Success"" with Michael J Fox, ""Big"" with Tom Hanks.  Those are just a few.

But over time, as industries mature, companies are naturally starting to consolidate into larger and larger entities in order to survive. Paul thinks that just because we're seeing this early growth in web software, it applies to all economic activities of mankind.<p>Using Pauls's main arguments (historical perspective) it's not hard to ""prove"" the opposite: world is constantly moving towards consolidation.<p>Look: Desktop software development world looked very much like web scene today: one person could invent (and implement) an electronic table or an editor or a basic interpreter or an interesting game and do very well financially (has been done thousands of times). Yet in the early-mid 90s most software got prohibitively expensive to build for a small firm.<p>Also you can go back to early automotive boom in the US: there were myriads of automotive startups in mid-west (and in Europe too) and look what happened to all of them later.

In fact, I remember he made the point that looking at the turn of the last century, even the largest business of that day would be considered small to medium by today's standards (and goes on to ascribe that to a lack of management knowledge - it's impossible to manage a huge corporation without management).<p>If ""larger is better"" has only been with us for a hundred years, it may well slink back into the shadows sooner than we think.<p>I think the order in which this will unfold will be highly dependent on what kind of business you're in. Car manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to get small any time soon, at least not until we have perfect simulated models of the human body to get rid of all the human trials, and until we have instant, near-free manufacturing processes available to all. By the time those happen, it seems unlikely that ""corporations"" will look like they do now....",1228331356

I did sign a contract but I am not sure if the scope is limited to my work related to what I do at the company.<p>My current company is pretty vast and it's not unimaginable that they could come up with a similar product but it's highly unlikely .. even more unlikely in the coming years.<p>The other thing is that I don't know if the project will take off and I don't wanna discuss it with people at my current company yet.",1228331015
