I've been in the position of defending 'rent control' on this thread, but really all I'm committed to are the ideas that the op was a terrible article that proved nothing, and that not displacing people from their homes is a worthy societal goal.  If there are better ways to accomplish that than rent control, I'm all for them.",1230756448

415867,comment,415753,415826,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I wondered about this myself, but I do see potential long-term effects of a purely gas-tax based system. Even electric vehicles contribute wear and tear to the road system though they don't contribute emissions. The need for maintenance doesn't stop just because cars would be non-gasoline based. Eventually we will need to acknowledge this point from a purely pragmatic stance. Encouraging high-efficiency vehicles via a gas tax is a reasonable incentive now but it's not sustainable.<p>I suspect that the eventual system will bear a resemblance to the one in use for long-haul trucking, where operators keep a detailed log of how many miles they drive in each state as well as loaded weight. GPS is one way to facilitate such a system.",1230756053

If you want to drive in a city with good public transportation, you should pay more than someone who is living outside the public transportation network.<p>A gas tax hits everyone. Some people depend more on their car than others. If the goal is to reduce carbon emisions, the tax burden could be put on the drivers who have better alternatives.",1230756030

But any game that's on both systems, such as Rock Band, I purchase on the Xbox. The high def graphics alone are enough to ensure that.<p>I'm not a fan of the new experience either in one respect: if you're going to force me to choose an avatar (which is annoying) at least make a creator as good as Nintendo's. I find myself unable to make reasonable approximations of anyone I actually know. Also I don't care for where it starts you out now, on that little shopping area.
