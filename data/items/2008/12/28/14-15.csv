411938,comment,410438,411494,0,0,curiousgeorge,,,"Not really. The last nail in the coffin of serious research on the gold standard was ""Golden Fetters"" by Eichengreen. It has a phenomenal and indisputable country-by-country timeline showing the cycle of deflationary behavior stopping during the Great Depression in country after country shortly following (4-6 months) the effective abandonment of the gold standard. One can argue that N=20 is not significant research, but there is a reason no-one will take you seriously if you do.<p>I personally haven't met anyone who has argued for the gold standard and has read it although that may be a comment more on the academic backgrounds of the people who used to write pro-gold stuff and stuff it into my inbox back in college than the theoretical basis of the argument. So while gold may have a place as an investment (especially as a hedge against inflation) in large part people who spend considerable breath on extolling its virtues using words like ""intrinsic value"" and ""stability"" and ""natural"" are kooks. Their choice of the word ""natural"" is also odd since gold coinage is hardly more natural than paper and in fact is less easy to control the asset base.<p>When economists talk about not repeating the mistakes of the 1930s, they are by and large talking about the importance of maintaining liquidity in the system to prevent deflationary spirals, and avoiding liquidity traps. They are also cognizant of Keynes' proof that Say's Law does not work once people want to start doing things like holding liquid assets, and the dismal performance of things like the zero-inflation policy in Canada and other countries through the 1990s.<p>I'm amazed by the number of Internet libertarians who have jumped on this bandwagon.",1230474999

Instead, they tend to be visible only in niches of the PC market, rather than simply the Mac niche or FOSS niche.<p>Also, I recommend that you moderate your intake of propaganda re Windows security too. Windows is the big target, and has by far the largest number of suckers (i.e. unsophisticated users). That doesn't make it inherently insecure, or savvy users of it incompetent.",1230474446

Cheap energy makes it easy to start a business and cheap to produce food. Economic prosperity is a good antidote to belligerence and a strong economic class is a good counter-balance to the political establishment of a country.<p>If you will permit me more naive idealism, this is one of the reasons why I have such high hopes for nuclear fusion.",1230473879
411924,comment,411093,411093,0,0,cchooper,,,"For those who couldn't see the page:<p>The most interesting feature of this language is that all functions commute over lists. For example:<p><pre><code>  [2,3,5,7,9,11].at(3)\n</code></pre>\nreturns 7, but if you pass a list to 'at' instead:<p><pre><code>  [2,3,5,7,9,11].at([1,3,4])\n</code></pre>\nyou get [3,7,9]. This means you don't need functions like 'map' to apply a function to a list. You just call the function on the list and it automatically commutes. It works for trees too:<p><pre><code>  [2,3,5,7,9,11].at([1,[2,3],4])\n</code></pre>\nreturns [3,[5,7],9].",1230473757

Such people will make money but they will never become rich, because all they really want is to have some toys. Once they have maybe $20.000 a month, they can get all the toys they want, all the girls they want, and their journey is done. These are people who want to ""make it"" and retire to an island they bought. Unfortunately, they will never be able to buy the island, but they will be able to rent a cottage there for a few weeks each year, and that will be enough for them.<p>Some other people just want to win. Money is the path they have chosen, and they will continue to try to win, time after time. They are playing a game, and they want to be first. These are the people that look for new opportunities, keep trying them, expanding and so on. They will be able to afford the island at some point, but they will never want to go retire there, because the game by which they define themselves does not exist there.<p>Another group of people care about their ideas. They have an idea, they nurture it and build it out and they want people to use it and admire it. When people buy it or use it, or ooh and ahh at some way he expanded it, that is when they feel the sense of accomplishment. The money is not that important, but if the idea is a good one that people want, it will make money. When his idea gets bought out, he will find a new idea and work again to make it appreciated.<p>In the end, all groups just want to get some positive feedback for something they did. They want to push a button and get a dopamine rush to the head. They just choose different ways to do it.",1230473019
