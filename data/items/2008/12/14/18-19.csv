397533,comment,397440,397483,0,0,mojuba,,,"I think you are making 2 good points here.<p>First, we went through transition from begin...end to {...} and it porbably wasn't as painful for conservative folks as it is now when going from {...} to indentaion. So one question for a language designer is to whether target conservative public or not.<p>Second, mixing two styles when, for example, generating markup makes Python a burden. They don't go well together. You have to focus on two things: what your code is doing and proper indentation at the same time, while with C-style languages you worry only about the code. Oh, and the ""isolate code from markup"" concept hasn't been proven to be effective in all situations. So another decision to be made is to whether the language is going to be used on the Web.",1229280934

397523,comment,397261,397261,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I'd suggest the complement to this is emulation.  I have an emulator for my old CP/M environment.  I understand there are several emulators for Mac OS pre-10 stuff.  DOS emulators and  modern virtual environments galore.<p>So, don't just move your data.  Make sure you also include emulation applications/environments.  You may end up with a set of matryoshka (Russian stacking dolls).  But, if you drill down through them, you will always be able to access your data, even when in proprietary format.  And with the continued increases in processing power, the old evironments remain usable even through the emulation.<p>I guess a few notes on how to use the emulation, might be well worth it as well.  So that 5 years later, you have some reminder of how to connect the bubble gum to the bailing wire.<p>Open formats would be better.
