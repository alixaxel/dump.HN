381777,comment,381687,381687,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"A guy goes to his wife with a business idea.  He has had them before, and his use of their savings has taken the couple's net worth to below zero when the debts that he has incurred are factored in.  The thing is, he believes that this business will be different.  This is the one that will turn things around for them.  A bit skeptical, the wife hears the husband out.  At length, the husband finishes his 'pitch'.  Still skeptical, the wife tells him that while she would love to help him give this new business a try, they are out of money, and are obliged to start paying down debts at this point.  Relieved at being able to blame their situation for the denial as opposed to her skepticism, the wife tries to move the conversation to a different topic.  When the husband hits upon an idea.<p>They still have a sizable sum of money in the kid's college fund!!!  Just enough to get him started!!!<p>----<p>People we are broke.  I would suggest everyone accommodate  themselves to the new fiscal realities coagulating around us.  To continue to spend in the hopes that some future generation will pick up the bill is morally unconscionable.  It is also contrary to our self interests by the way.  As it is highly likely that the most damaging consequences of our financial mismanagement will develop in a more immediate time frame.  That is, it is likely that you only THINK your kids will be the ones saddled with the consequences.  In our current situation, it is far more probable that you will.<p>If a business enterprise requires government assistance to make it economically feasible then alarm bells should be going off in our heads with regard to the economic efficiency of that enterprise.",1228147000

Negative buoyancy of anchor >> Positive buoyancy of rope.\n2. Sufficient rope exists to reach the bottom with some additional rope remaining in the boat. \n3. It's a calm enough pond without eddy currents such that, essentially, the only non-trivial forces acting on the rope once an anchorage has been established are isotonic (i.e water pressure).<p>Actually #3 completely obviates the need for an anchor in the first place, but I digress.<p>Imagine that one were to cut the rope at the anchor.<p>The rope begins to ascend to the surface due to its positive buoyancy and the amount of water being displaced will decrease over time until all of the rope is floating on surface and displacing its own weight.<p>Scenario #2:<p>The case is slightly different if the rope is under any kind of tension.  Assuming a sufficiently strong rope and zero relative boat movement from its anchorage, the negative buoyancy forces due to the anchor are sufficient to overcome drag effects due to the current so the boat is very slightly being pulled under--hence an additional very slight increase in the water level of the pond.<p>Two additional edge-case visualizations that may be helpful.  Think of the ""perfect superdense anchor"" scenario with a neutron-star and carbon nano-tube rope and a ""worst-case"" anchor consisting of aero-gel.",1228146199

There is no evidence that the RNG was anything other than fair.<p>A related attack on poker is just stuffing a game with colluding players.  You don't have to know player A's cards to beat him in the long run if you know the cards of B, C, D, and E (and, if you want to get really tricky -- they can know yours, too!).<p>Plus, given that this is online poker, you can have players B, C, D, and E be bots, programmed to talk to your server to get the odds, throw enough hands to look reasonable, and bet big only once in a while when their collusion means The Syndicate rakes in the moolah.<p>Example: the flop is 5, 6, 7 with 3 different suits.  The best hand from The Syndicate is pocket 7s, which is (poker amateur hour commences) pretty strong but not unbeatable.  Everybody is out but one player.  The next card is shown, and it is a 3.  There are two worlds the game could be in now: the world where there are fours available, in which case the adversary might have one.  Then there is the world with no fours available, in which case The Syndicate has the best possible hand and will only lose by a freak accident.<p>The adversary goes all in.  The Syndicate checks with the other TEN cards from the deck they saw, notes that they've seen three of the 4s already, and calls, with a smile on his face.  (Again, amateur poker player but I'm thinking this is a 95%+ win for the syndicate.)",1228145994

381747,comment,381503,381503,0,0,peakok,,,"Interesting, but definitly not surprising. When I was younger I found a way to hack a poorly designed online quizz, tied to a very famous french radio quizz. It was pay per play, with a 1000 euros weekly winner (400 euros for the second, 100 for the third).<p>The hack will make you laugh : right click on the flash app, select ""Stop"", and enjoy unlimited time to answer the questions instead of the 10 secs countdown. Then, when I was ready to submit the answer, I'd change my Windows clock time back in time since you'd have to be the fatest player as well.<p>But the interesting part is how I started playing this quizz. One night, very very late, I bumped into the site and I decided to try the practice mode, wich was free. I started the quizz, and I had a surprise when I discovered that a small white asterix showed next to the right answer every time. I thought that it was dumb even if it was the practice mode and I suspected something wierd was going on, so I immediatly started a real paying game to verify my suspicions. Again, a white asterisk would sit next to the right answer.<p>You'd have to answer 5 grids of 10 questions successfuly to make the best score, then the winner would be the overall best time. I managed to finish the 1st grid, then in the middle of the second one, the white asterisks suddenly disappeared. This is when I understood what happened : the admin was probably cheating the game, and he made a mistake wich made the asterisks visible by everyone instead of himself only.<p>Still, the game was under French juridiction and supposely enforced by an ""Huisser"", like every other game in France. My bet is that the huissier didn't understood jack about computers and didn't care at all about this internet quizz.<p>I talked about this quizz to my best friend and we quickly discovered the exploits. We figured out that if we set the Windows clock back in time before I even started to answer the question, the final time per question would be a couple of hundreds milliseconds, varying from 50-300.<p>So I decided I would take my chance against the admin and try to win the 1000 euros, wich was plenty of money for a teenager. It was still a lot of work because most of the questions were insanely difficult and even with Google it was often hard to find the answer. As a matter of fact, the quizz was plain impossible to answer for a human.<p>Nevermind, with a lot of patience and a couple of days, I managed to answer the 5 grids with an amazing final time, I figured out that if the admin was cheating, then he couldn't say anything. The game would automatically ends at midnight every Sunday and declares the winner. I did the last grid on Sunday evening so that I wouldn't appear in the high scores too early and the admin wouldn't suspect anything.<p>I watched anxiously the table of scores and as midnight approached I started to relax, nothing unusual happened. Then suddenly, at 23:45, 15 mins before the game would end, a player appeared out of nowhere in the scores and was quickly climbing the ladder. I knew it was him.<p>When he finaly ended his fifth grid, he reached the top scores, but only took the second position because I had a best overall time, so my plan worked perfectly as I knew he wasn't prepared for this. A couple of seconds later, the game ended and I was declared winner. I was given a phone number I had to call to claim my reward.<p>On the next day, I dialed up the number. When he picked up, you could almost hear the spider webs being removed from the phone :<p>- ""Hello ?""<p>- ""Hi, I won the game yesterday, and I was given this number to call.""<p>- ""Ohhhh, it's you"", his tone was priceless. You could guess I was the first person ever claiming the reward. At this moment, I knew he knew and he knew I knew. He asked for my details and told me I would receive the check soon.<p>I tuned up to the radio show in the afternoon, and waited for my minute of glory. ""And congratulations to our internet winner of the week, <i></i><i></i> <i></i><i></i>, living in <i></i><i></i>, for winning the 1000 euros"". Good.<p>A couple of days later, I received my 1000 euros check and I went to see the updated list of winners on the site. Unsurprisingly, I was the only one listed with a real name instead of a nickname and an actual town showing in the details.<p>The following week, I decided I would beat the admin again, for my best friend this time. I tweaked my tactic a bit so I would valid the last grid in the last minutes. It wasn't as easy as it sounded since the pages had an expiration time, but I figured it out.<p>This time, the admin figured out he should make a better score and his final score was much better than the last week. Still, I had predicted it and when I valided my last grid with a nearly perfect overall time (50 questions in about 20 secs), it was too late for him and I won again.<p>My friend called and he received his check. The rules wouldn't allow us to participate again before 6 months, but I knew there was a time to stop, and we decided to never participate again. Moreover, I had beaten the admin twice and that was my main satisfaction, and I knew I had played all my cards and beating him again would be very difficult if not impossible.<p>The third week, I went to check the winner and his overall time was indeed ridiculous. It was clear the admin was unbeatable from now. Well, in one sense only, because a couple of weeks later, the winner prize turned from the 1000 euros to a ticket to participate in the actual radio show. I laughed hard, because I knew I forced the admin to make unbelievable times and they figured out he was cheating. I don't know if he was fired, but he certainly didn't have a 4000 euros monthly bonus anymore.<p>Since this time, I have a different look on this kind of games, especially when there is an admin behind. Moral of the story : Poker is no exception, and if you cannot fully trust the admin, even with the best legislation, you cannot trust the game either.",1228145489
