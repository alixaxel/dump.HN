We're not talking about people who feel negatively about <i>your company</i>, but rather the fact that you <i>run one at all</i>.

415128,comment,414754,414877,0,0,Shooter,,,"I used to have this ""blank stare"" problem with some of my relatives and former colleagues when they asked what I was working on.  I finally realized I was often just being too technical or was using industry-specific terms people weren't familiar with...and sometimes I was being too specific or too general in my explanations. Like I expected everyone else to have the same background and interests as I do.  I finally tried putting myself in their shoes.  If you're too general, you will sound evasive or apologetic.  If you're too specific, it's easy to sound boring.  It's a difficult balance to be specific enough that you keep their interest, but not so specific you confuse them or flip their ""Techy-talk OFF switch.""<p>I try to use very common analogies and to speak as simply and directly as possible.  I usually just explain the selling proposition and/or business model of the startup without any additional information about ""how we do it"" or ""in what industry"" or ""who our competitors are,"" etc. If they want more details, they can ask.<p>I've ended up with a few stock answers I use for every one of my startups.  I usually just state the problem, and my solution to that problem, in layman's terms.  That usually gets the best response.  People usually start asking more specific questions, and we go from there.  I try to explain what my startup does, and to convey my passion for the business without sounding too much like a pushy salesman or a nut ;-)  If the startup is profitable, I add that tidbit.<p>I actually went from getting blank stares to getting new business and referrals.  A simple, clear answer about the benefits your business offers can literally turn people into customers on the spot...or at least promoters of you and your ideas.  Genuine enthusiasm and passion is memorable, and people are drawn to it.",1230698700

Because there will always be somebody like Comodo who will issue certs with insufficient verification (Comodo being an <i>extreme</i> but there's been a long history of merely <i>insufficient</i> verification; ISTR a lot of ""fax me a letter on official letterhead"", which is just total BS), the PKI component of SSL, being basically a binary yes/no system, is fundamentally flawed. Market forces compel a race to the bottom in this situation and there's just no way around it. (Not even moving it to a government function; <i>nobody</i> is immune to having money waved under their nose.) So <i>all you get</i> from SSL is encryption, not authentication. Whether you like it or not.<p>If you really insist on the dichotomy of ""SSL provides either perfect security or no security"", then the answer is, it provides no security, because it is impossible to use it properly.* The legitimate owner can do everything right and still get CA-rooted with non-zero (and significant-in-practice) probability.<p>If that's a problem, get designing and implementing.<p>* Or, even more precisely, the <i>only</i> proper use is to use a separate communications channel with the website to verify the key they are sending out, regardless of who putatively signed the cert. And this use is a myth in the general case, because I can't imagine more than the barest fraction of SSL sites have ever gotten this query and I bet the majority of organizations would either have no idea what to tell you since you can't talk to the guy who knows (if any), or would even think you were a hacker or something trying to get something from them you shouldn't.",1230698407

Gives people plenty of time to find a place they can afford that's really far away from their current job, so they spend less time with their family, or maybe even need to get a new one.  Any local support systems?  Churches that sometimes helped with groceries, trusted neighbors to help with babysitting, etc, all gone.<p>""The locals that make a place undesirable to live in.""<p>Okay, you come up with a way to enforce it, I'm all for it.

415097,comment,414754,414754,0,0,Shooter,,,"""I have a startup"" seems a very ODD way of saying what you do when people ask, anyway.  It is almost intentionally oblique.  Even as a serial entrepreneur, I would probably have a similar ""midwestern"" reaction if someone said that when I asked them what they did...it's just a weird, passionless answer.<p>If you ask a person at a big corporation what they do, they don't usually say ""I have a job with a big corporation.""  Do they?  Instead, they would usually say something like ""I work in accounting for the largest trucking company in the US.""  or ""I'm a salesman with a company that makes office copiers.""  Boring, but at least it's an honest answer.<p>An entrepreneur should be able to muster much more passion than ""I have a startup"" when asked what it is they do. People tend to respond positively when you show passion and enthusiasm and speak directly about what you do.  Even if you have to 'dumb it down' for them to understand (or omit secret information.)  Maybe this guy should have enthusiastically said, ""Yeah, I'm working on a really neat piece of software that helps people to communicate better by XXX""<p>For some reason, ""I have a startup"" makes me think of a few people I know that have no passion for school, but have stayed in grad school for years on end so they can avoid choosing a career.

There's no obvious reason behind why I would want to play it, though. I will assume by gaining ""score"" my tweets will show up on the site for others to ""guess"" about. However, as I was playing, I wasn't reading the tweets for comprehension, just to determine which was more likely to contain the (arbitrary) ""missing word"" and I certainly didn't click on any links (well, not that they were clickable). This basically nullifies any banner exchange benefit.<p>Secondly, the method you use to Captcha, i.e. missing words, is way too arbitrary and prone to wrong guesses.

The second wasn't even English, if it was a language at all. The other huge issue with this is the fact that, in general, tweets are going to be missing words because of the character limitation. I got a couple wrong simply because both tweets were missing words that would form a complete sentence, but only one of them was missing the word you wanted me to notice.<p>Basically, aside from some sort of novelty, I see no use for this service.
