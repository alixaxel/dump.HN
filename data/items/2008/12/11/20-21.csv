The ""porn movie with a plot""-films I have seen were, although explorative and interesting, not very good at provoking a boner (or anything except curiosity, really). It's a good start. What I'm suggesting here is (at least in the form of execution) completely unexplored territory, the rules that we know from other genres may not apply in the same sense. We just have to explore to find out.<p>I don't think porn necessarily has to be low-brow. Exploitation films and other really violent stuff was pretty lowbrow at some point, but today the best films of these genres are as good art as anything. I'm not sure this analogy holds all the way, but at least it's a good argument that these things are worth exploring. It's surprising how culture and people can change.<p>I love to discuss this stuff with you guys. It's not really something you can talk about over dinner, or in any other 99% of social situations.<p>[Note that I'm using a liberal definition of art here - I prefer to use the word in its original sense, as ""something really good"" which provokes emotions, thoughts and daydreams.]",1229028838

Here is what I do:<p>I have an arrangement with my employer that I will not work full-time for more than 9 months straight. After 9 months I have a 6 months break. The arrangement is tacit, it's not in a contract, but it has been working for the last 3 years. It took me one year to find such a job. I turned down another job where I could have worked 3 days a week, because they wanted me to first work full-time for 1 year.<p>Work doesn't seem to turn me off as much as you, but then I only worked full-time for one year, the year my first IT employer trained me as a developer. I then worked 4 days a week and eventually quit because they wouldn't let me work 3 days.<p>It's not that I don't like work, it's just that my extremely time-consuming hobby is more important to me. One obvious downside is that I have less professional opportunities, so if I worked more, my job might be more interesting.<p>I am not sure I could afford this, or even have the courage to try it, if I hadn't also inherited some money. On the other hand I haven't tried the lifehack stuff.<p>I am in Switzerland, a country where unemployment tends to be low, but where working part-time as a developer is uncommon enough for lots of people to think it can't be done.",1229028723

I consulted from 14 to 20, when I had a bit of a trainwreck of bad luck and choices all at once, then I held 3 jobs: one for 3 mos, one for a year, and one for 15 mos. I quit each when I got to the point you're describing. I've been consulting again since Sept 07, thinking that charging the premium rates would help limit my exposure to bad customers and boring work. It hasn't, really (I'm charging ""hundreds"" per hour as you say).<p>But it has given me the flexibility to ship my first real product. And I'm actually having a blast. And I'm not working balls-to-the-wall like the expected YC work ethic. We built v1 in 3 mos, a couple days a week, and we've already got a small stable of happy paying customers... with almost zero promotion.<p>Even the boring and unsavory stuff (bug fixes, answering tickets!) is more fun when it's something you're passionate about.<p>Maybe you're not anti-WORK, but anti-job?<p>That said, if you've learned a bunch doing what you were doing, why not try to sell software or do low-commitment micro-consulting or write about it for a subscription site?",1229028668

(70% stocks 25% bonds, 5% cash or cash equivalents.)<p>Saving 1/2 a million is hard but if your willing to live off of 20k/year then ~7+ years at 120k and you can reach that (tax is your major problem).  Max out your 401k etc and dump the rest directly into savings.  Now clearly you don't really want to work 7 years strait at a high stress job so aim for 1.5 to 2 years, take 4 months off collecting unemployment if you can and ~10 years out you can do it.<p>One way to get a major tax break is buying a home. (This is risky.)  The market is down, but will still probably fall for a while. Try and get a home with a low interest rate tax deductible loan and you can funnel a lot of money into savings fairly quickly.

OEMs will likely never bundle Firefox, but there is a chance that they'll bundle Chrome since it has Google's name behind it.<p>Hence, Chrome rescues users (developers?) from IE.<p>As for your b)... I agree totally. Chrome is nothing but an application delivery platform for Google apps that is disguised as a browser. Which is all the more motivation for Google to pursue bundling deals with OEMs.",1229026538

394719,comment,394462,394462,0,0,frig,,,"3d isn't how to think about the interface outlined there.<p>Basically, apple is investigating making multitouch part of the ""normal"" os x interface. A touch interface has to overcome the fact that fingers aren't good for precise pointing, and thus a lot of tasks that are tedious-but-doable with a mouse (like positioning windows, or using pulldown menus, or clicking small icons) become hugely painful with a finger.<p>It's pretty obvious what a good touch interface for os x would have to be like: \n- the app is designed with full-screen mode in mind\n- the app's primary content area fits in one central area\n- the tools and so on are in sidebars-and-bottom-bars<p>...and the app would avoid:\n- overlapping windows (either within the app, or between apps) or floating palettes\n- lots of little icons or finely-detailed controls<p>In other world: every app would look like iphoto or ical or itunes.<p>A ""2.5d"" interface like in this patent makes a lot of sense: each open app is in its own ""slice"", and you navigate forwards and backwards through the slices using some multi-finger gestures. The edge of the screen is used to show contextual information about what's currently open, and provides cues as to how to navigate to different items (eg: is that photo ""behind me"" or ""in front of me""?).<p>In a touch-heavy environment the gimmicky 3d interfaces from the past all of a sudden become potentially a lot more helpful. You'll notice apple's been working on possible solutions to making a touch interface usable for a long time:\n- a lot of the expose tools make more sense as ways to easily navigate between windows with a finger (eg: hit the expose key, see all open windows in miniature, then touch the one you want to maximize...)\n- dashboard makes a lot of sense in a touch context, as a way of easily pulling down some lightweight apps without disturbing your current ui arrangement\n- spaces makes a lot of sense in a touch context: each collection of screen layouts in its own little slice that's given a spatial location, and so not only do you not destroy a layout by bringing a different app to the top, you also give spatial cues as to where your other open programs are",1229026237

Part of that also is geographic as well as career considerations, but it was always about the right time to leave.<p>I too am into Lifehacking, loved the 4HWW etc.  So I think I come from a similar perspective.  Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to the question, or I would not be working at my current position. It is good, and the money is good, people are awesome, etc - but it definitely feels like ""work.""<p>I think the bottom line is if your hobby can't make you money, you need to make money somewhere, somehow, to trade for  the things you need (food, shelter, etc). Some of this can come from the government, depending on your personal standard of living that you are accustomed to.<p>In my case, I am happy to give up a portion of my life for a relatively easy, enjoyable job so that I can live comfortably, eat well, etc.<p>In the long run, I would definitely prefer to not trade my hours for cash programming, and would prefer a website (or large conglomerate of websites) that provided passive income, but I am not there yet.<p>If you would like to work together on something, you can contact me sid [at] sidsavara [dot] com.",1229026230
