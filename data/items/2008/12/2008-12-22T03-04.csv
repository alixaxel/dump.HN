And by stretching your analogy to the territory of food it only becomes weaker (with food diversity is a goal by itself). Also it can be argued that using the same operating system for the vast majority of tasks is desirable.",1229918171

It is as if somebody was saying ""look at this green spot, it is obviously red"".<p>I guess the only way to ""refute"" it would be to create complete theory of human language and use it to prove that he isn't actually saying anything. But that doesn't seem very effective or promising as an undertaking to me.<p>Rephrased, maybe the problem with the chinese room is that it uses the fuzzy notion of consciousness, appealing to the vague emotions of it's audience rather than on logic. In so far as philosophy aims to clarify language, perhaps the chinese room could be useful as a bad example.",1229917949

It can only be answered with a challenge: Learn four or five diverse languages reasonably well, then try to create the single syntax that works well for all of them. You'll understand when you're done... or perhaps rather, when you find you'll never be done.<p>I will give one example of the tens upon tens of issues you will encounter: What's the one true syntax for a type declaration? Then, once you've answered that, how does that one true syntax manifest in Python/Perl/Javascript?",1229917762

(Other than the need to figure out how to turn off indexing so their new computer is usable.)<p>The 64 bit support is nice for some applications, but it's hard to believe that it couldn't have happened within the XP framework.<p>In short, Vista broke lots of things and didn't offer any significant benefits in return for the still ongoing problems.

For the simple reason that it's not trying to make a profit - it's trying to give back to people the same amount of money they put in.<p>No, it's not.  If it was, people who cap out for years would get roughly the same return on their ""investment"" as people who do the bare minimum.  Instead, SS gives a much higher return (on investment) to folks in the latter group than it does to folks in the former.  (It's almost a decent investment for the minimum folks, while it's a crappy ""investment"" for the cap-out folks.)",1229916676

We have a limited set of form elements and then we fall back to the page request/response of old.<p>This is a problem that SVG does not solve. Sure, it might make certain presentation elements easier to create but that’s more of a CSS issue than an HTML issue.<p>This is something that HTML5 is trying to address with additional input types. We’ll still need JavaScript though to mimic more common complex desktop interactions like tree structures and tri-state inputs.""",1229916453
406028,comment,406010,406010,0,0,agentcoops,,,"Because people have different syntactic preferences?  Because some people hate c-style brackets while others hate python-style white-space?  While it would make life easier in the short-run for those trying to learn a language who have pre-existing knowledge of the standardized syntax, it's quite possible that some other syntax would lead to wildly improved programmer productivity or, at the very least, much more readable/aesthetically pleasing code.<p>In general, there seem to be a plethora of values which can be considered in choosing the syntactic form of a language: aesthetics, productivity, tradition, etc.  Having different syntax between languages allows different niches for languages within these values not to mention allowing the possibility of great innovations which could improve the experience of programming.  Seems unlikely that any current language has the optimal syntax with respect to maximizing all these values and hence it seems foolish to cut off innovation.",1229916380

406018,comment,405680,405866,0,0,Retric,,,"It's been 15 years (eep), but 11th grade was not a total waste of time.  My public school was large enough to have the full remedial, general, advanced, and honors class spectrum so I could avoid the dumbest elements of society.  Granted honor classes where still boring but least they tried to speed things up and my classmates where mildly interesting.<p>Anyway, I was classified as Exceptionally Gifted (IQ 160+?) / Learning Disabled which basically meant they had no idea what to do with me.  I did the whole state science, math, and chess thing so I spent time around people who where  focused and intelligent in high school most  of the extreme cases seemed broken.  I don't feel that having children jump through more and harder hoops leads to a happy healthy life.  I would have have loved a shorter more focused school day, but I don't see the value of trying to cram more facts into high school. Adding a course in investing, speed reading, or other useful skills would have been nice.<p>PS: I don't know if I fear success, but I don't know how I could have coped if I was profoundly gifted and everyone around me had seemed even dumber.<p><a href=""http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/underserved.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/underserved.htm</a>",1229915594
406017,comment,406010,406010,0,0,ardell,,,"The problem with standardization is that you iron out all of the innovations.  Certain language constructs are simply better for certain tasks.  Lisp is built for recursion so it's great with lists.  Object-oriented languages in theory are great for modularity and maintainability.  Granted all these aspects have a lot to do with the coder in addition to the language.<p>If all languages required you to manage memory as in C I'd wager we'd have many fewer entry-level script hackers.  Sure, every program would be lickety-split fast, but the App Store certainly wouldn't have 10,000+ apps.<p>And if every app were written in Java everything would be very portable but also quite slow.  It's all about trade-offs and picking the right tool for the right job.",1229915460

For instance, if you are paying employees in equity instead of salary realize that the long-term benefits of a successful startup may be precluded by more immediate revenue streams.<p>Additionally, we as bootstrappers tend to be less likely to ask for or buy help when it would truly help our business.  We prefer to do things our way but many times we re-invent the wheel in the name of entrepreneurial spirit.  Not a bad thing, but worth remembering.<p>Good luck to you!
