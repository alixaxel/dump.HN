386268,comment,386175,386175,0,0,papa,,,"In some ways, building the product is the easy part. Getting traction is the really dicey problem.<p>Check out some of the SEO/SEM sites like seomoz. SEO is very important. Link-building is also important. Look at getting some reciprocal links or at focusing on a specific niche within your site and really trying to develop a core audience around a few musicians/genres in order to get that ""critical mass"" of interest. Contact other sites in your space and figure out how you can get them to write about and/or drive audience to you. Hold contests. Build widgets. There's no silver bullet (for most of us).<p>Knowing the type of user that is attracted to your site is also very important. That will really help you narrow down what kinds of sites and techniques you should be using to capture more audience. Do you have a lot of kids on your site? If so, seek out affinity sites. It will be much easier for you to convert that audience to your product. Use sites like Quantcast to discover sites like yours that have traffic. Learn from the successful sites and employ their tricks (are you asking every user to invite their friends when they sign up? if not, you might be missing out on new users).<p>And, as always, be patient. My website is a little more than 2 years old and we've gone from 1000 visitors/day to 100k+/day. And even now it's still one of my primary tasks every day (figuring out new ways to get word out and encourage inbound traffic). You should be spending several hours a day working on this stuff.",1228431418

I think that making the decision to join a company has to do more with the people and vision of the company I'm interviewing with. At the same time I think it would be nice to show them my skill set. I'm have been a consultant for a long time now and there have been times when I didn't want to do business with the other company after the initial meeting and other times where I had to proof myself to the company before we could have a deal together.

I installed ruby and gems in there, as well as the specific version of Apache I wanted to use. On the downside, it means that managing upgrades comes problematic, as I have only isolated the bin/lib/etc/share mess into a separate tree, not eliminated it.<p>To make life easier, though, I'd like to use an alternative source-based package manager. I'm not sure how to do this, but I'd like to run the './configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install' invocation in an environment which tracks the files copied by the install process, and knows which files in the system my packages affected. At this point, it would (ideally) update the .deb database on the system. It could (alternatively) keep track of these files in its own database. Maybe a chroot trick could help implement this.",1228431204

386245,comment,385892,385892,0,0,time_management,,,"#11. Make friends <i>at your current job</i>-- as many as possible, preferably with some being ""diagonal-up"" (e.g. not your boss, but at a higher level). Bonus points if they are unlikely to be cut. You will need them as references if your boss gives you a bad one (which you should check 3-5 weeks after being laid off, using a professional ref-checking service).<p>Friends from the old company are not just potential references, but also possible co-founders or recruits at the new job.<p>#12. Move all your side projects onto off-work computers, and try to make sure that they're deleted from your work machines nightly and automatically. (Of course, this is not the time to do something moronic, so only delete true side projects, e.g. things that the company doesn't know or care about but that you still need to unambiguously own for future purposes.)<p>#13. This one applies mainly to large companies. In good economic times, you want to make yourself as replaceable and obsolete as possible (write well-documented, easy-to-follow code) so you can move on to more interesting projects and, if laid off, leave on good terms to a better job. In bad economic times, try to make yourself irreplaceable, even if that means making your code difficult to use. If you feel the need to be unethical, you can hide time-delay bugs. At worst, you'll be asked to train someone else in the technology and offered a severance package in order to do it, which is better than being let go cold.",1228430621

I think the synergy of having working relationships with other companies are a great asset since they will actively promote you while you promote them and so on.<p>Secondly, do you have any viral aspects / proposition for your site?  I haven't seen it so I can't tell.. But if you positioned yourself such that a small niche group must have and use your site then I think that's a great start since the group will be self-replicated the newly spawned groups will self-replicate more, hence viral.<p>Thirdly, have you looked at the discoverability of your site?  Look for patterns of how your users are finding you and how they are not.<p>Last, SEO is the hot term for these days and I think for a good reason.  Imagine if I did a google search for something related to music and your social website always shows up as #1 / #2 in the search results?
