The fact that nothing happens on this first click is already considered a UI flaw.  Why not make it easier to add products to compare when you're on the compare screen?  It seems like a context loss when you have to leave the compare screen to select another product to compare against.  It only makes it worse when you don't know what brand to select and compare against.  I do like how Newegg implements their product filtering, maybe you need something like that here.<p>When you're comparing 2 items, maybe there should be a modifier on each stat where the modifier allows you to find another netbook that has ""more"" or ""less"" of that stat.  ie, pressing the up arrow on price would find you the netbook just slightly more expensive, and pressing the down arrow on screen resolution would find you the laptop with slightly less screen resolution etc.  I do love how the netbook comparison works on obsessable though.

But solipsism is a point of view that is both depressing and not really explanatory of anything.<p>Let's assume that people around, who are similar to us, are conscious too. The problem in the last sentence is the word ""similar"". A few centuries ago, Black people were considered soul-less animals by their ""enlighted"" European peers. We recentlty came to realize that most traits that we thought made us unique, like symbolic language for example, or ""theory of mind"" ie realizing that other creatures have other thoughts and other beliefs than our own, are shared by other species (eg bonobos).<p>Even if they don't recognize themselves in the mirror, in most animal species that I know of, individuals are able to recognize their own smell.<p>Assuming personnal consciousness can be mapped to some part of the brain processing, can a dog, a frog, a worm be conscious? How many neurons make a conscious brain?<p>Let's keep on recursing.<p>Are plants conscious? At least, some of them seem able to compute.

Same thing in relationships: we're fed 'if you find the right person it'll be perfect bliss' so often that we're not willing to just do the dirty work, and find happiness in it. In short, we are a generation that doesn't know how to ""settle"". ""Settling"" and ""Contentment"" are shameful words in our society.",1229710296

I found that the commute does wonders to dull the brain. In addition, while in someone else's office, the environment almost invariably sucks. Lousy chairs, horrible flickering fluorescent lights and no sunlight, nasty cubicles. Then there's everyone who comes by to say something or interrupt me. Horrible.<p>In my home office, I control the environment. I have an excellent chair, plenty of natural light, and the ability to go to the kitchen to munch on an apple or some other good snack. I don't have to make excuses if I want to go for a run at 2pm.<p>The major downside of a home office is that I feel like I have to be more productive than the on-site members of my team, and end up putting in more hours. In an office, I watch the clock like a hawk and get the hell out at 6 o'clock sharp, unless there's an emergency.<p>YMMV, of course. It seems like productivity in an office varies widely from person to person.",1229710085

   That said, this could go pretty badly too. I'm wondering what recourse there will be for people who get falsely accused. Also, I'm wondering if this is legal. There doesn't seem to be much legal precedent, and some of the RIAA's tactics seem to be illegal, or technically unsound. And if the charges won't in a court of law, I don't see how the ISPs could cut someone off from a service they paid for.</code></pre>",1229709974

Not that estimates are reality, but it's still nice to have it all. Everything that's in the database is shown. Also, Amazon doesn't sell all models so the reviews don't always get tied in. I'm looking to expand out to reviews on Shopping.com as well since they cover more models. If you're comparing a model that does have Amazon reviews and one that doesn't, the one that doesn't will show up as a ?. The AWS interface can be a bit different for items that are sold through a third-party, so that might be affecting some models as well, I'll have to check on it.",1229709786
