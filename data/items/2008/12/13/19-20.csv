The subprime debacle began in the spring of 2007, and really began to spiral out of control on July 26 with various calamities in the CDO markets. By August 6-10 (the week of quant turmoil) it was starting to have an effect on equity markets-- which were strong at the time, and didn't start taking a real beating until Jan. 2008.<p>The economy was strong in 2007, with 4.9% (annualized) growth in Q3. Subprime didn't blow up because the economy tanked, because the mess began during a great economy, and turned it into a bad one. Of course, the tanking of the economy has made the credit situation even worse and will lead to even more defaults.<p>The default rate goes up during a bad economy, and everyone knew that this risk was there, and that a cyclical recession would occur sooner or later. What caused the rate to be ""unexpectedly"" high was the prevalence of speculation. In a bad economy with falling house prices, a resident homeowner is still going to make his best efforts to avoid the embarrassment and hassle of foreclosure, even if he has negative equity. Negative equity is irrelevant if he's going to live there for 10 years. On the other hand, a greedy and unscrupulous speculator has no reason not to default.",1229196421

When spawning a thread, there is instantly a huge space of possible paths for the program to go through. The coder then proceeds to prune off all paths that will lead to bad results, with the usual arsenal of mutex, semaphores, locks etc. etc. It's intellectually unbearable.<p>The alternative would be to explicitly specify which paths are allowable, rather than allow them all and then forbid which isn't.<p>I don't know how <i>that</i> would work, I don't remember who said it.

This is not an isolated riot in one block of Paris. Nor is this the first time.""</i><p>1) It's early.  If we keep up with the immigrant-baiting in this country, we'll get there.  Just last year, we had huge protests in the major cities because of the way that we treat immigrants.  Did you not notice?<p>2) We've been doing the violent social protest thing for quite a while:  the Watts riots in 65, the LA riots in 1992, looting after Hurricane Katrina, the Benton Harbor riots in 2003...and many, many others.  Here's a nice list:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_riots#1990s_-_2000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_riots#1990s_-_2000</a>  (for fun, count how many times France appears in the list, relative to the US!)  We have a long, illustrious history of making minority groups so angry that they erupt into violence, so if anything, France is late to the party.<p>3) For the most part, the European banks were not more leveraged than US banks, with certain critical exceptions.  That said, most of the world's banks make significant investments in US debt-backed assets, so it's pretty hard for an economic downturn in this country to avoid affecting other industrialized nations.  The bank argument is a straw man.",1229195918

I worked on a team once with mostly contractors (paid hourly) and a couple of moron permis who were like that.  They were averaging 12 hour days across the year.  The contractors did it because they were well compensated for it.  But the permis did it because they thought they could stand out this way.  Get promotions, raises and bonuses.  The problem was that working 12 hours would only make you <i>average</i>.  I continued doing 42 hours.  My boss told me I was not up to the standards of the team and needed to work more.
