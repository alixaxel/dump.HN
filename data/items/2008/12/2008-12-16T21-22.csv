400132,comment,400085,400085,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"This is perhaps the most poorly-thought out post on economics I've read in a long time.  Adams is essentially arguing for a completely unrealistic set of draconian regulations to manage every aspect of society, from capital investment to personal health.  An example:<p>""Stock bubbles could be avoided by restricting how much money can be invested in stocks, on an annual basis, to keep the price earnings ratios around 15.""<p>Err...what?  Who decided 15 was the ideal?  What about those companies that clearly don't deserve that multiple based on their growth prospects, or companies that clearly deserve more?  Why bother with a market at all?<p>He asserts that it's not socialism, but I'm having a hard time seeing how it wouldn't be worse.",1229464775

Sure, it takes a while to learn a new language, but a good programmer shouldn't have that much trouble.<p>The real problems are the other limitations.  Background tasks, full text search, MapReduce, support for uploading files larger than 1MB, not having short bursts cause the application to exceed limits, limitations in the datastore like only returning 1,000 records.<p>Those are real limits to what the system allows you to do.  Python doesn't stop you from producing something, those limitations might.  Learning a new language isn't that hard if you're a programmer.",1229464406

[1]<p>I did YC because it seemed interesting and I needed a good excuse to quit my job. [2] Tom was bored and wanted to get out of Ohio.<p>When we launched on Techcrunch, we were met with widespread apathy. Techcrunch readers, by and large, weren't our target market and didn't give two shits about a ticket site. We expected this to happen, and it was still cool to be featured on Techcrunch anyways :). We weren't creating a new platform or becoming the next facebook - we were just solving a simple problem (finding tickets).<p>The investors we met with didn't care that we were with YC (many didn't even know), they cared that we were making money in an expanding market.<p>Also, our most targeted/best traffic has been from places that didn't know/didn't care who YC was (e.g. Ticketnews.com, Thrillist). Same situation for our users.<p>Finally, as Paul alluded to, the YC name can only do so much for you, if you don't have a good product none of it matters.<p>[1] - I'm only talking about the YC brand name/credentials, not the program itself, which certainly had a positive impact on TicketStumbler.<p>[2] - When much of your family lives in Detroit and has been recently or is, unemployed, it's difficult to say your ditching a cushie 60k per year job to do a startup.

I think people have hesitated to launch major App Engine sites primarily because: (1) it isn't supposed to be production-ready yet, and (2) no one has hitherto had any idea how much it costs. It wouldn't be pleasant to spend time to write an app, become popular (and everyone hopes to become popular), and then have Google turn around and say, ""Sorry, you blew out of your free quotas, and we aren't ready to bill you to extend them.""

Since web products are so easy to change and refine in response to feedback the initial quality of a product doesn't matter too much. As long as you can get users to provide feedback and funding to stay alive while you refine the idea you have a much higher chance of success. I'd argue that YC provides both: more attention and better access to funding, particularly because YC's track record at picking winners.

We get HD with a cheap antenna, but they don't because they have not upgraded their cable box. I believe it's a pretty common scenario.<p>Another benefit to the rabbit ears: There are more channels offered via DTV than with the old analog system. We get 16 now, compared to 9 before (see <a href=""http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/12/15/over-air-digital-tv-brings-more-channels-beware-cliff-effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/12/15/over-air-digital-...</a>).

If I saw someone running TextMate, and I didn't know enough about emacs to realize that it's a legitimate alternative, dropping everything to run TextMate would be a very smart move. Your editor is a really important tool!<p>There's no question that I would switch platforms for emacs. Not that the issue ever comes up, because emacs is open-source, and cross-platform, and (for better and for worse) is not tightly integrated with any particular GUI library. So once you learn it you never have to stop using it for any reason other than personal preference. Which is probably one of the reasons why all of these folks are abandoning TextMate for it.",1229461704
