Maybe let basic users store five or so pages, and let paying users keep as many as they want? I tend to put quite a bunch of pages in my instapaper queue before reading them all at once.<p>I guess you should spend a day or two to brainstorm a long list of features and let intended users rank them and tag them as ""nice"" vs ""must have"". Put the must haves in the free version, or most of them, and the nice ones in the paid category?<p>I have no idea what the usual way of dividing features between versions is, but putting the must haves in the free version should help build user base. And when you've started using it, those nice features might start looking tastier. On the other hand, if all your needs are taken care of in the free version you're not as inclined to spend..

Net profit is the money you make from it after you pay costs. Burger King doesn't make $1 per burger, since they have to buy meat, ship it to their stores, have it prepared, etc. Losing 3 cents out of every dollar to AMEX instead of 2 cents to Visa/MC doesn't sound like much, but it's huge if you're only making 5 cents per burger.<p>That's why fast food didn't take credit cards for so long - I hear the CC companies inked deals at lower than normal rates for some huge-volume small-margin companies like Walmart, McDonald's, etc. The credit card companies want more widespread use of their cards so people start using them for everything.

It starts off by randomly creating 20 cars with variable car shapes, wheel sizes, and counterweight sizes.<p>It determines how well each car does on the course and uses this information to mate the cars together in order to get a more successful car. The way this is traditionally done is by evaluating a ""fitness"" function on each individual in the population and giving the higher scoring individuals a better chance of mating.<p>This process keeps on going on until some criteria is reached. On average, the higher the generation count the better the offspring should be.",1228759424

The fitness function is the distance travelled before the red circles hit the ground, or time runs out. The degrees of freedom are the size and inital positions of the four circles, and length, spring constant and damping of the eight springs. The graph shows the ""mean"" and ""best"" fitness.
