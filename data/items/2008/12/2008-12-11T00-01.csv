393731,story,,,15,16,gruseom,"Ask HN: How to compose two mapping functions into a third?",,"I'd like a good way to do the following, where ""good"" means some balance of simple and efficient.<p>I have a bunch of mapping functions. Each takes an integer interval [START,END] and a function FN to call once for each integer N in the interval, passing two arguments: N and some value computed from N.<p>For example, say MAP1 works this way, passing N and N+10 to the function provided:<p><pre><code>  (defun map1 (fn start end)
    (loop for n from start to end do
       (funcall fn n (+ n 10))))
</code></pre>
...so if you gave MAP1 a function that printed out its arguments, you'd get this:<p><pre><code>  (map1 (lambda (n val) (format t ""~a ~a~%"" n val)) 1 3) =>
    1 11
    2 12
    3 13
</code></pre>
Now say MAP2 does the same, only instead of N+10 it passes N^2:<p><pre><code>  (defun map2 (fn start end)
    (loop for n from start to end do
       (funcall fn n (expt n 2))))

  (map2 (lambda (n val) (format t ""~a ~a~%"" n val)) 1 3) =>
    1 1
    2 4
    3 9
</code></pre>
What I want is a way to make a new mapping function MAP3 that works the same way but composes the computations in MAP1 and MAP2. For simplicity, say I just want to add the values computed by MAP1 and MAP2. Then MAP3 should do this:<p><pre><code>  (map3 (lambda (n val) (format t ""~a ~a~%"" n val)) 1 3) =>
    1 12
    2 16
    3 22
</code></pre>
Any nice solutions? The rules are: (1) it's ok to modify the definition of ""mapping function"", as long as it's simple, and (2) I don't want to have to make a local copy of everything one of these functions does (because the intervals can be large).<p>Edit: A solution in Common Lisp would be nice, but I'm interested in good approaches to this in general. Perhaps coroutines?",1228956717

393714,comment,393180,393524,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>As for making your living by doing your calling, you either have to make some sacrifices or be very fortunate and have your calling happen to be something that's lucrative. Unless you work for a job that is minimally demanding, you most likely will only become very successful if you truly have some calling for it. Otherwise you'll probably tread water and have to find fulfillment in other parts of your life.</i><p>From the perspective of someone who's been on and seen both sides, is it worth making the sacrifices to live by one's calling if the work isn't very lucrative? Or is it more worthwhile to make sacrifices in what one does for a living to make it easier to find fulfillment elsewhere? Has your opinion on this changed between starting as an IB and where you are now as a software developer?<p>I ask because your thoughts above reminded me the number of different conversations I've had with people about comfort and fulfillment, and how much one can realistically hope to find either in what they do for a living. Some have even go so far as to suggest <i>not</i> doing one's calling for fulfillment, as they will likely have their passions crushed by some nameless corporate structure.<p>For perspective, my stance recently has been that aligning both is a worthwhile experiment, and that those who sacrifice other things in doing so will likely find those sacrifices aren't so painful in hindsight (excepting sacrificing things like food, clothing, shelter, etc). Just from the people I've known, those who have worked by their calling seem overall more fulfilled than those who looked elsewhere after-hours.

The problem really is the broken philosophy that screwing over the other guy is the only high odds way to gain. It only works until all the potential gains from what we've already created are realized. At that point, supply and/or demand dry up, and we end up in big trouble economically. People who push for this describe economics as a zero-sum game. They say fuck their neighbor because the only way to acquire wealth is to steal some of his/hers. They neglect to account for the decay term caused by the decrease value in what has already been made; they assume scarcity is a constant, or attempt to make it artificially so. They also neglect to account for the growth term, which is new things being introduced into the market, adding to the overall wealth of what we've created.
