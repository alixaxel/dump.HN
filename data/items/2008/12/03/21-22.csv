384872,comment,384606,384723,0,0,ssharp,,,"Economies of scale come into play when the increases in revenue are outpacing the increasing in spending.  This is best shown with fixed costs.  If you pay $10,000/month for office space and sell 10 widgets or 100,000 widgets, you're still paying for the same amount of office space.  So it's always beneficial to scale so long as your fixed costs aren't increasing enough to override the benefits.<p>It could be that PG meant that large corporations were more willing to take these bets as they had less to lose than a small company.  Taking advantage of economies of scale will generally require some investment upfront as well as adding something to your fixed costs (building a new plant for example).  If things don't pan out, you're left with the new expeneses, debt, etc.  The financing gap between big companies and small companies has shrunk a lot of the years.  During the times that PG is talking about, a small company would have difficult time getting the same amount of financing as a large company in a comparable amount of time.

Read the summary and focus on what <i>in the adult nervous system</i> means.<p>""DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing and has been studied extensively as a lifelong molecular information storage mechanism put in place during development. Here we report that DNMT gene expression is upregulated in the adult rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning and that DNMT inhibition blocks memory formation. In addition, fear conditioning is associated with rapid methylation and transcriptional silencing of the memory suppressor gene PP1 and demethylation and transcriptional activation of the synaptic plasticity gene reelin, indicating both methyltransferase and demethylase activity during consolidation. DNMT inhibition prevents the PP1 methylation increase, resulting in aberrant transcription of the gene during the memory-consolidation period. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation <i>is dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and that this cellular mechanism is a crucial step in memory formation.</i>"" (added italics)<p>PS: Sorry, if you where all just joking, but the summary is worth a read.",1228339230

As soon as one company develops a blockbuster molecule, others begin testing chemically similar molecules, hoping to ""get in"" on the category (e.g. statins). This is because there's a higher rate of success in developing a profitable brand in an established category where one successful molecule is already known. It's not necessarily a bad thing-- for example, it's quite good that Lexapro is available for those who might otherwise resort to the older and more side-effect-ridden Prozac-- but this leads to a proliferation of very similar molecules and devices, instead of research into entirely new approaches. In other words, the market ends up favoring optimization and refinement over innovation.",1228339224
