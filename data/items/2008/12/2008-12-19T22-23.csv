Please include an estimated number in your answer(ie. I am 10%, 50%, 500% more productive developing Python/Java/Ruby/other using Emacs versus IDLE/Eclipse/Arachno/other).<p>I continually go back and forth between using an IDE versus using Emacs/vi.

403929,comment,403462,403462,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Lately I have wondered about the ""arms race"" as Susan Blackmore calls it, between the gene and the meme. The genes want us to have small, efficient brains, capable of survival but not much else, whereas the meme wants us to have big brains because the bigger the brain, the more memes can get into it. This study, if confirmed, would seem to provide an interesting example of how bigger brains do not necessarily correspond to greater survival advantage. When viewed from the gene/meme perspective, this makes sense. The mortality associated with bigger brains is good for the gene, albeit bad for the meme, but not all that bad, because memes are not dependent on their host's surviving to make offspring. In short, memes don't care so much about our survival, only genes do. Genes, in turn, don't care so much about big brains, only memes do. Accordingly, that a bigger brain seems not to afford survival advantage in warfare is no surprise. When the war is finished, there will be plenty of smaller brain people out there left to continue to copy the gene. And as for the meme, as long as they were written down/persisted somewhere, they will get copied along too.",1229724713

403923,comment,403690,403828,0,0,jerf,,,"There's multiple definitions, so what follows is not authoritative, but IMHO it will help you understand the field better, as well as why so many people seem to be talking past each other as  they silently adopt one definition while arguing with someone based on another.<p>A strong DSL is a specialized language designed for a specific task, with its own parser and syntax not directly based on another language. Ideally, it is not Turing complete, because that opens a huge can of worms, and much of the point of a strong DSL is to avoid this can of worms. The DSL should be carefully designed in conjunction with the eventual users, who most likely will not be programmers. I've heard of impressive results with this approach, but I've never witnessed them firsthand. This definition is favored by Martin Fowler, and much less importantly/impressively, me.<p>Weak DSLs are basically APIs written such that in their target containing language, the calls into the API read conversationally and with minimal boilerplate not directly related to the domain of the problem. In general (and I emphasize that I am generalizing), they can't be used to their full power without understanding the containing language, so you still need to be a programmer, albeit perhaps with less experience. You may see demos on the home page for the DSL about how it is possible to use without knowing the containing language, but it tends to be demoware; much of the gain is intrinsically that you still have a full Turing-complete language backing you up.<p>People will bikeshed about punctuation and claim that Ruby can build better weak DSLs, but in my experience, like I said, you still have to understand the containing language to really use the language, so the virtue of dropping off punctuation marks is oversold; the syntactic constructs are still there and you still need to understand them, so whether you actually see them in source is much more a matter of taste than a matter of ""goodness"".<p>Mixing people who use different definitions of DSL is a recipe for much heat and no light. It should also be pointed out that the strong DSL people make certain claims about why DSLs are good, along with the reasons why these things are true, and these claims should not be carelessly translated to weak DSLs.<p>While I use the terms ""strong"" and ""weak"", they should be understood as descriptive, not a claim of goodness, much like ""strong AI"" and ""weak AI"".<p>If you look at a weak DSL and wonder what the deal is, it is because rather than a magical technology, it is merely a style of API... there really <i>isn't</i> much ""there"" there, but it can be useful in some cases. I would never write a weak DSL for a DSL's sake, though; just evolve the API and see what happens.<p>Personally, I think it is a continuum between ""API"" and ""weak DSL"", not a binary distinction, but for ""strong DSL"", I would say that if you're backing to a full Turing complete language like Ruby, you do not  have a strong DSL and should not expect to reap the benefits.
