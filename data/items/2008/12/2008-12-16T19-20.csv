399928,comment,399863,399863,0,0,cperciva,,,"PG claims that a shift towards smaller companies results in people being judged on their performance rather than based on factors which do rather poor jobs of predicting said performance; my experience with tarsnap indicates otherwise.<p>I have a small number of customers -- somewhere between 10% and 20% -- who are using tarsnap based on a recommendation from another tarsnap user; but the vast majority of tarsnap users signed up based on some other factor which is at best predictive of the quality of tarsnap.  Reasons I've heard include:<p><pre><code>  * I am the FreeBSD Security Officer,
  * They find my blog to be interesting and well-written,
  * I have a doctorate from Oxford,
  * They like the fact that I made the tarsnap client source code available, and
  * I beat them on a mathematics competition 10 years ago.
</code></pre>
There are a great many instances of companies succeeding with inferior products as a result of having superior marketing; while I am fortunate that people are interested in using tarsnap for reasons which are quite unrelated to the quality of the tarsnap code or service, the fact remains that the market isn't (in PG's words) <i>""[taking] every organization and [keeping] just the good ones""</i> -- rather, the market takes every organization and keeps just the ones which rank best on a nebulous combination of quality, marketing, and luck.<p>Yes, credentials are an imperfect way of predicting quality; but are they any worse than the marketing and luck which the market introduces?",1229457201

If you were to log to a database you could record things like date/time, session_id, service_name, module_name, and a generic message and do clever SELECTs on your database of events/messages and it would be easier to answer questions like 'Is this exception clustered with time?' or 'is module X ever called in a session that results in an error between noon and 1pm?'<p>Cleaning old messages is potentially easier as you can remove lower priority messages first, or simply delete any message older than X.<p>Of course, if you're logging to another remote service (like a DB server), how do you record low level events in communicating with that service, or how do you record events when the db server is down?",1229457158

Maybe this writer is unfamiliar with how Africa works.<p>Rwanda last year exported 250 million USD worth of coltan.  Unfamiliar with what coltan is?  It's the African name for columbite-tantalite.  Still not ringing a bell?  Well you can extract niobium and, most importantly, tantalum from it.  The same tantalum that facilitates the use of that nice shiny iPhone you probably own.  Don't own an iPhone?  You still use tantalum, it's in every other cell phone too!  As well as your laptop, and DVD player but I digress.<p>I was talking about the 250 million USD worth of coltan that Rwanda sold on the global market last year.  Yeah, a curious thing though, Rwanda does not have any natural deposits of coltan.  The only deposits in the area are in DR Congo.  Where Rwanda is supporting Tutsi militias to 'protect the people from discrimination'.  Someone must have forgotten to tell the people though, because every time the Tutsi militias approach a city, the people flee in terror.<p>I recently spoke with a Swiss friend of mine who stayed with me for a while after returning from the Congo and before she went back to Lausanne.  She works for the UN and had occasion to go meet Laurent NKunda before the rest of the world woke up to what Rwanda was up to.  Laurent Nkunda is the leader of these Tutsi 'protectors'.  At any rate, as she traveled up the road from the lines of the government troops to Nkunda's, she noticed something at the roadblock he had set up that told her all she needed to know about him.  You see, his roadblock was composed of the bodies of his victims, topped with heads.<p>Now the Americans sail in, and say Rwanda and Congo should negotiate with this man.  What?!?!  And, if that was not bad enough, we now have people in the West saying we should allow Rwanda to continue to export coltan.  Only now we'll make it legal under the guise of free-trade.<p>OK.  Setting aside the crimes against humanity that this man has committed against literally millions of Congolese civilians.  How can we reward the violation of another nation's sovereignty for the exploitation of their mineral wealth?  What's to stop Nigeria from pulling the same crap in Cameroon for the oil riches?  Or Angola from sweeping into Namibia for the diamonds?  There are a million potential situations like this on a continent as rich in minerals as Africa.  This idea would set a HORRIBLE precedent.  I am shocked that the NYTimes would even entertain printing it.<p>I suppose I'm making too much of it though.  This would never happen, the African Union would not support it for just the reasons I outlined above.  Still, irks me that someone would present that as a 'solution'.",1229456356
