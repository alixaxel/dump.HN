The only person who can beat you is someone willing to pay 2x+change. (When you lose, you don't have to pay anything, but that's not directly related to your point.)<p>In a Swoopo auction, if you are willing to pay twice the market price, you are only slightly more likely to win, rather than reasonably assured, and you can be beaten by anybody willing to put up $1+current bid, which, if you've poured twice market value into the bids, is still fairly low. (And when you lose, you still pay.)<p>An auction has a rational mechanism for manipulating the probability of your winning in proportion to your desire to win, as expressed by the money you're willing to pay. Swoopo's system is far, far less rational, and you can pour massive resources into an ""auction"" and be beaten at the end by somebody paying a mere fraction of what you are paying, even though they end up with the product.<p>It's a night-and-day difference. One system is rational and what most would consider mostly fair. One is crazy and what most would consider a scam.",1229140784

What really interests me is the related problem of how to kill someone securely.<p>Take, for a prosaic example, vampires.  Shooting a vampire will almost certainly NOT kill them -- sources differ but they might not die, might die but revive immediately, might die but revive the next night, etc.  So how to kill a vampire definitively?<p>I think, based on the union of all the vampire lore I've heard, you have to:<p>* stake him<p>* stuff his mouth with holy wafers<p>* cut off his head<p>* burn the body (both parts, presumably, but better to keep them separate)<p>* bury the ashes on hallowed ground<p>* ... at high noon<p>* drop a nuclear bomb on top of the church<p>THERE.

Your consciousness continues while you sleep, although you usually lose all awareness, mindfulness, and capacity to form memories. There are, however, yogis who are able to remain aware of their cognitive processes during both dream and deep sleep.<p>However, when a person is dead, the general consensus seems to be that the consciousness has left the body-- it's either elsewhere, or it has ceased to exist entirely. If the materialist explanation of consciousness is correct, then it's plausible that ""someone"" will awaken when your body is resurrected and will have your memories, but it won't be you, because you won't exist to be experiencing it.",1229139792

Yes there is - I sleep each night and wake each day. I don't think consciousness exists separately, I think it's an emergent phenomenon.
