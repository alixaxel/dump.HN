409084,comment,408983,408983,0,0,russell,,,"The article starts off with the premise that good edutainment software is needed to augment the abilities of intellectually challenged teachers.  It then wanders off into promoting the cellphone as a delivery mechanism for third world countries.  As a whole, I don't think the article says anything.  Inexpensive laptops are a far better delivery mechanism, and if we look at our own educational problems, nearly everyone has a computer available.<p>However, the premise that there is an opportunity to provide supplemental educational materials is valid.  If you have looked at your kids textbooks, they are mostly complete junk, almost comic books in content.  What I see as needed are textbook supplements/replacements.  For example, instead of a one page description of the Roman Forum with a couple of pictures, how about a 15 to 30 minute interactive video game that would allow the kid to explore the forum and its time, environs, and culture.  Accompany it with a Wikipedia-like text that would allow deeper exploration of the topics.<p>I see entrepreneurial opportunities, but also a place for a collaborative effort like Wikipedia.  If the initial efforts have to be monetized, a subscription plan for parents would be a good place to start.",1230148793

the problem was INCENTIVES.  The federal reserve pumped up the money supply starting in 1995, then when the bubble popped in 2000 they pumped up the housing market in order to disguise the true severity of the crash.  In an environment of practically free money you'd be an idiot NOT to grab your piece.",1230148767
409081,comment,408707,409038,0,0,davidw,,,"Right - that's how open source works.  Scratch your own itch, and work on things you like.  If someone wants to see something not based on Apache, well, you have the source code, a compiler, and an editor.<p>Also, Apache is a perfectly fine web server.  These event-based things have been around for a while.  I recall moving the images and some other static assets on linuxcare.com to the Boa web server to save memory.  However, Apache manages to have its own advantages, and stay relevant through the hard work of people like Paul Querna, even if, no, it's probably not the absolute fastest/smallest thing out there.  Look at Rails - after going through a succession of various mixes of lighttpd, nginx, mongrel, etc.. etc... it's now coming back around to Apache and Passenger, and rightly so, Passenger is a nicer, simpler, more robust way of doing things.  Furthermore, in terms of the other post's ""him"" and ""us"", there are a lot more of ""him"" (Apache users) than ""us"" (users of whatever other system).",1230148650

409077,comment,408834,409071,0,0,physcab,,,"Well, obviously. But with business specifically, I'm not sure if that applies.  Say you pick up a book about how to write a business plan, set up a sales team, put together an effective marketing team, etc.  It seems those are more of an art form than a science, and those abilities strengthen with experience. And if a mistake is that costly, then maybe you shouldn't be running a business to begin with?<p>I'm still not convinced.  However, I am definitely in favor of reading.",1230148249
409076,comment,408767,409059,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I think you underestimate the agency that a nine year old can have, and the influence of the extended family, friends, and role models. It's probable that the specific task was handed to her, yes. And it's often true that parents push their children too far. But I think it's also possible she decided to do it on her own after reading or hearing some inspirational story.<p>I am <i>projecting</i> my own experience as a child onto her, but when I was her age I heard about Microsoft credentials. I considered trying for them, but my mother's friend told me they were a distraction, and gave me a copy of Turbo C++ instead. I can't remember ever thinking about pleasing my parents. It never entered my conscious thought. I just knew I wanted to learn to program computers, and I couldn't, in that time, be interested in computers as a kid and envision Microsoft's credentials with the disdain that I do now. I suspect it's the same now, in India.<p>It's true that the only way out of credentialism is growing oneself as a person, and finding a way to develop a self-referent identity. The <i>advantage</i> is that one grows while striving, and one can often find oneself in much better place, with better social support, and deeper values. It's a lot more difficult to see this in the construct of an RPG, or in most public high-schools.",1230148132

They liken this to Prince of Persia, which I have not played but apparently was similar.<p>Many other classic games (and most of my favorites) follow the same pattern.  I do not think Tetris or Pac-Man would be better if you ""unlocked"" features on higher levels.<p>I do wish my text editor was better, but I want to make programming more like other successful cooperative creative activities.  Maybe a Brooks surgical team, or an orchestra, would be more appropriate inspiration.<p>Part of me is sad that our craft seems to be losing its ""take 10 years to really learn your tools"".

It seemed that he got a lot out of it.<p>My cofounder and his wife once took the Diplomatic Service Exam. She had wanted to be a diplomat, he joined for support. They got through the final rounds, and it was far from boring! During their time there, they witnessed some incredible undiplomatic behavior from an actual diplomat in the foreign service, freaking out in the cafeteria line. They were quizzed ineptly on the 'canon' of American literature. Finally, (if I recall correctly) they passed the test.

About 40 years ago, the Japanese started giving us a run for the money in some sectors.
