Unconsciously, he had been trying to create a neat, square field like those common in other parts of the Kanto Plain, but this was not what the terrain called for. Here, despite the general flatness, there were slight variations in the lay of the land and the quality of the soil that argued for an irregular shape.<p>""What a fool I've been,"" he exclaimed aloud. ""I tried to to make the water flow where I thought it ought to be. But it didn't work. How could it? Water's water, dirt's dirt. I can't change their nature.

Interesting, but excessively verbose.<p>I'll attempt a summary:<p>Larger (~1500 bytes gross) IPv6 datagrams are currently not being routed correctly over certain networks. The author has deduced that a combination of multiple factors is to blame:<p>- IPv6 fragmentation happens at the source, if a packet attempts to cross a link with an MTU that is too small, an ICMPv6 packet informs the sender.<p>- IPv4 fragmentation typically happens on the way, as necessary. TCP supports an optional IPv6-like source fragmentation mode which isn't widely used as ICMPv4 packets are often filtered by firewalls, etc.<p>- IPv6 coverage isn't perfect yet, so there are IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels in place in many cases. Tunneling adds size to a packet.<p>- Some tunnels refuse to do IPv4-based fragmentation for performance reasons. Because of the extra bytes, most packets would have to be fragmented. Instead, they use the TCP/IPv4 source fragmentation mode, but the relevant ICMP packets get lost along the way, so the tunnel can't operate correctly. Packets are eaten.<p>I hope I've understood & summarised it correctly. If anyone with more patience or understanding of these things could correct me, that'd be great.",1230585514
