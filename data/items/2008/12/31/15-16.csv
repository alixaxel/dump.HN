But alas, in the realm of biology, the micropipetters and mice-killers win again.""<p>Doing biology is the only way to develop biological intuition.  Sometimes this means pipetting and killing mice.<p>Ernst Mayr speaks to this:<p>""About two years ago, three years ago, for maybe the 20th time I went over the whole business of the species concept. What is a species? I looked at the major figures in the evolutionary synthesis, and I looked at Robzhansky and myself, and Huxley and Stebbins, all of us had reasonable species concepts, and the only person that had a species concept that I thought was quite absurd was the paleontologist G.G. Simpson. And then I said to myself, ""Well, he can't have been a naturalist in his youth if he had such a peculiar, unworkable species concept."" So I went to Simpson's biography and what did I find? I found that in college he was an English major. He had never been a naturalist as a youngster. He never collected anything, and he discovered geology in his senior year in college, and from there he went to stratigraphy and finally to paleontology. Not surprisingly, not having been a naturalist, he has no idea what a species is and he never had. I argued with him about the species concept year after year, but lacking that background, he was unable to see it, and that is the thing. Being a naturalist -- having had that background of being a naturalist -- gives you a view of nature that cannot be acquired just learning from books.""<p>(Go to bottom of <a href=""http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/may1int-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/may1int-5</a> for a video of him saying it while sitting next to E.

The answer is supposed to be 2/3, because what the question is asking you to do is consider all the parents in the world where <i>at least</i> one of the two children is a girl. Then you're left with 3 possibilities, BG, GB and GG.<p>If you phrase the question like that, everyone will get the right answer. The reason people get it wrong is that <i>people don't normally talk like that</i>. Imagine you're at a party, and someone tells you they have two kids, and ""one of them is a girl."" Clearly, they mean that the other is a boy, which means the answer is 100%.<p>But the most intuitive way of interpreting the question is that you know that a <i>specific</i> child is a girl, say because the person brought one kid to the party, who turns out to be a girl. With this interpretation, the obvious answer of 50% is in fact correct.<p>You often hear the complaint that people don't understand math.
