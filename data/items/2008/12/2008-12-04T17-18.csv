I agree it's not possible to do it properly with the GIL in place and attempts to remove it did have less than amazing results on single-thread applications.<p>That's annoying...

385895,comment,384606,384606,0,0,rpgoldman,,,"Isn't there some danger that you are over-generalizing from an industry where there are exceptionally low barriers to entry to a global trend?  What if you want to make a new automobile, or even worse, a new airliner?<p>However, I think there is another trend that reinforces what you say here.  Previously there was a strong incentive for risk-averse people to work in large corporations.  I'm a risk-averse person and I once worked at a large corporation.  With the change in organizational behavior so that layoffs have become a first resort action, instead of an action only appropriate in desperate circumstances, there is little risk-aversion benefit to large organizations.  So other than health insurance, large corporations have become a generally inferior class of employers.  This is true even if you are not entrepreneurial.",1228413399

When something is going wrong, there is sometimes no way to tell what information is important and what is not.<p>A lot of the problem with ""over logging"" may be Windows versus Unix. In the Unix world, your logs are in a flat file and you have a million tools to deal with those logs.

385880,comment,385715,385841,0,0,maxwell,,,"YouTube succeeded because it's a good brand and good enough software. If Google had just integrated video results more tightly into search, thus making it a feature rather than a distinct product, and made uploading straightforward, they might have won. They still could, actually; a lot of people I know use Google to find YouTube videos in the first place.<p>I've noticed that whenever Google launches Google _, where _ isn't a search filter, it more often then not fails. It's the branding. I think that for a lot of people Google = web search. Google Image Search is popular because it's an easily comprehensible feature of search. Google Docs is a shit brand; if I only knew about Google search and Gmail, I'd guess it's document(ation) search. Or just a word processor. It's not immediately clear that it's a web-based office suite.<p>A large part of Gmail's success was in creating a distinct brand; my hunch is that if it was launched as just Google Mail, it wouldn't have been nearly as successful (technical merits aside).",1228412500

385872,comment,385715,385845,0,0,kirse,,,"From an optimistic (and even mental health) perspective, externalizing failure and internalizing success - aka ""I did the best I could but the situation did not materialize"" - is much healthier than internalizing failure and blaming yourself when things go wrong.  Externalizing success never gives yourself due credit when things go right, and internalizing failure always blames yourself when things go poorly.  See the problem?<p>This is not to say one should have an inflated sense of value or ""don't learn from your mistakes"", but it is much healthier to optimistically look at failure as not a personal thing, but something external.<p>People who have succeeded and are confident in themselves are never afraid to look back and admit that a little bit of luck (and opportunity) was part of the equation.  But by no means will they discredit their own personal influence and attribute the entire success to something external.",1228411884

Bad laws have real consequences, and it often becomes politically impossible to repeal them.  Sarbanes-Oxley has all but shut down the IPO exit.  Consider what the expansion of 'know your customer' laws to online commerce might do to startup SaaS businesses, for example, when you consider the huge compliance costs.
