If the World Bank or other agency keeps giving them development money, they can take from that instead of building the roads, so the incentive is gone.  But, if you remove the outside donations and the infrastructure is useless, you remove all incentive for them to stay.  Thus, you get a chaotic power vacuum.  If you were callous, you could think of this as a reboot, but with nasty humanitarian consequences.  If you keep donating from the outside, then you are pretty much just funding the dictator.<p>Is that about right?",1228229725

In many of the countries including India where I live it has gone very far on the negative side that it almost seems impossible to break the loop.<p>>> Changing the government won't change the cultural attitudes, unfortunately.<p>But there got to be some way out.<p>I posted this today after going through a terrible experience. I told many of my friends that I give up, and I don't want to waste my life in this corrupted, broken system.<p>I can pledge that I am fair, loyal, committed and hard working. So is everyone in  my family and most folks I move around with. We have worked ourselves up economically without compromising on values. That is our end of it, but at times there is no survival unless you bribe the system. They CAN make life hell for you.<p>So the system changes the culture gradually and that in turns reinforces the broken system to be more broken.<p>I am sitting here today with lost hopes of any change. This needs a revolution of sort, strongly opinionated citizens and a mass mobilization on the issues. I don't even know what I can initiate as an individual. I won't even be heard.",1228229578

Brainstorm this and you will come up with good ideas like those above.<p>I like the autocomplete idea and also there's no reason not to use some syntax like ""Dentist @ 2pm"", i.e. using @ to separate title from date. It's sufficient to indicate to the machine which is text and which is date info, but close enough to natural speech as well (also the @ is a very recognisable character now).<p>One thing to note is that Google Calendar accepts expressions such as ""Dentist at 2pm""; perhaps you can try that and see how you like how that works?",1228228395

They keep trying it, and it keeps failing. Not technically, but from a user point of view. Typing stuff out the way you want people to is not easy or convenient, and if there is even the hint of uncertainty, most people will prefer not to do it. Considering that you do not have a background in this, you will lots of unmatched items, and 2/10 fails will consitute too much uncertainty for your users.<p>I have two ideas for alternatives that may or may not work, but at least have not been tried as often:<p>1. Autocomplete. When the user is typing, autocomplete his message, such that there is always 100% certainty that the command will be executed properly. Also, simplify the syntax, so I write 'remind' : 'December ...' : 'Dentist'. Your syntax has to be consistent, so once learned, there is no relearning. I don't want to have to figure out what the system wants me to type in as a command.<p>2. Visual. Use blocks and lines to create the actions. Humans have a very good sense of geometry and relationships between physical objects. Leverage that to make your app. Models of physical things are one of the few things we can actually say is inherently intuitive for human beings.",1228227175

Topics include his family background and early interest in music, physics and mathematics, his first exposure to programming, finding a mentor, and writing a doctoral thesis. He describes how ?The Art of Computer Programming? became ?the story of my life?, and why it was put on hold for the TeX and METAFONT projects. He also talks about personal work habits, programming style, analysis of algorithms, the influence of religion in his life, and his advice to the next generation of scientists.<p>One quote:

I've thought about a similar thing before and the approach I was looking to take was using something like: <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nltk.org/</a> to create grammar trees (read up on how grammars/parsers work at least on Wikipedia) for an acceptable subset of English.<p>You might notice things like a time is always after ""at"", a date ""on"" and a relative date ""in"". Ideas for rules:<p><pre><code>  Event -> Title When
  Title -> <anything>
  When -> TimeSpecifier When
  TimeSpecifier -> ""at"" Time
  TimeSpecifier -> ""in"" RelativeTime
  TimeSpecifier -> ""on"" Date
  ...
</code></pre>
Then you use semantics stuff to get the parser to return some expression that you can use, say a Python call: event(title=<title>, at=<time>, on=<date>).<p>Just some things to think about and if you don't know grammars, then read up until you understand the example I gave at least.
