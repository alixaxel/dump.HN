With things like AWS and other cloud-styles out there, building a large data center, or renting out standard servers per month is becoming less and less attractive. They certainly still like Cloud startups, but even if you aren't a ""Cloud company"" (whatever that means), you should still be hosting your stuff in a cloud.

Ten people can provide spcialized bodywork and personalization of a mass-produced car.  Ten people could probably design and oversee the outsourced manufacturing of discrete components in the car.  Ten people could probably manage a company that deals with other small firms to create bespoke vehicles based upon mass-produced frames and engines.

400150,comment,399863,399863,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree with much in the essay, but it's interesting that PG used law as an example of an organization that broke from the deferred compensation principle.<p>Most ""elite"" law firms actually do pay by seniority.  An associate is generally paid according to the number of years he or she has been with the firm.  And while the salaries for young lawyers is very high, they are actually (often) working for the potential of becoming partner - a reward for work done earlier in life.  This is the essence of deferred compensation.<p>Law firms also tend to be more impressed with credentials than almost any other segment of the economy.  The pecking order of law schools would surprise many people from the engineering world.  Of course, some schools do have stronger reputations (for good reason), but in law, Harvard > Columbia > Cornell. Students accepted to a school higher in the chain will prefer that school by a wide margin.   Whereas engineering students, especially at the grad level don't tend to have an MIT > Stanford > Berkeley kind of mentality... they'd be more interested in how their research interests match up with faculty in that area.<p>I think Law, Medicine, and other professions will be the holdouts against the trend away from school-based credentials.  It's probably no surprise - these are the few sectors of the economy that can actually ban someone (with the full weight of government behind them) from practicing based on degrees and exams.<p>The question is, when will the tide overtake them (if ever)?  Will the opportunities in a free market eventually become so appealing that only second-rate people will seek out the credentialed industries?<p>I'm not joking here.  Law school is three years, but we all know that people learn at different rates.  I suspect that some people could learn the material in a few months, whereas others would need six years, and some would never be able to learn it at all.  The requirement of a 3 year degree most definitely sends some of the brightest folks into other fields where they can leverage their exceptional ability to learn quickly (software seems to be a favorite field for these people).",1229465502

(Although my perception might be skewed by my own preferences, hopefully that hasn't made my description inaccurate.)<p>Anyway, from that perspective, what Paul Graham does or doesn't want <i>me</i> to do isn't relevant.  I doubt he really wants me to do anything other than make insightful comments, since I'm not working with him.<p>What I'm saying is that the QA guy has more bargaining power if he can go work for your nearest competitor, and perhaps still more bargaining power if there is also no trade-secret law prohibiting him from taking that other information to the competitor, not just himself.  (He can't do that legally in California.)  So, all else being equal, he's more likely to move from Massachusetts to California than vice versa, especially if he's a <i>really good</i> QA guy who can get a job even when there's a lot of competition.<p>It might be the case that having access to <i>really good</i> QA guys are more important to your business being successful than being able to keep your QA guy from defecting.  For example, maybe you're a good guy to work with, so the defecting isn't really a problem, and the difference between okay QA and <i>really good</i> QA is huge.  In that case, you'd be better off doing business in California instead of Massachusetts, if that were the only difference between the two places.<p>On the other hand, if the thing that would make or break your business is being able to raise $500 million to build a semiconductor fabrication plant, you might find yourself siting it in Massachusetts (or Oregon, say) instead of California, in order to reassure your investors that they're getting the best possible deal from your employees.<p>So banning non-competes will attract certain businesses: the ones that are good to work for and in which employee skills are much more important for the company profits than, say, employee retention, secrecy, or capital equipment investment.<p>So I think it is especially knowledge and sales businesses that will tend to seek out areas with strong non-compete prohibitions --- not on purpose, but just because that's where the superstar scientists and salespeople are.",1229464997
