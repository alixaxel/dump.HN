It isn't that they aren't important, but people tend to place faaaaaaar too high a value on drive layout for winter driving.<p>Now, on the track, it makes a BIG difference. In the snow, however, your goal is safety... not competitive times.",1230368193

Feeling that you're just cloning a succesful website without adding your own touch is just not as motivating (at least for me).<p>I'm a bit in this situation currently since I had an idea for a product that I really wanted to do, but by the time I quit my job to work on it, someone else had the same idea and implemented it for the american market... So, I let the idea by the wayside for a while but recently I decided to implement it for another market... So in a way I'm cloning someone's website (same base idea) without cloning since I originally wanted to do exactly such a website...",1230367541

Our bold leader Gordon Brown sold off the UK's gold reserves for about a third of the current market price. He even announced well in advance that he was planning to dump a load of gold on the market, so the price dropped even further. Gold's a great asset but it's not the be-all and end-all.",1230366450

In this case the new community surronding the localized version is going to provide a significant advantage to the cloner.<p>For 10MinuteMail, there is not as much value added by localizing it so it's certainly not a good idea to clone it...",1230366340

Maybe not many of them, but my new business is based on one of them and it wasn't that hard to find.<p>The European company mine is modeled after is not doing well because they've made a fatal flaw in their implementation that's preventing their growth, and it seems their management doesn't recognize this, but other than this simple issue their business concept is sound, and when they eventually recognize this issue I'm sure they will do well.<p>But I'm American and I want to bring the same service to the USA so I'm proceeding with a slightly modified version -- one that will actually work well in the USA.  I see nothing wrong with this whatsoever, it's a simple task of bringing a good service to places where the originator cannot or will not.",1230365060
