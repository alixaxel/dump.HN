We are talking about ONE certain contract...and in this case, it involves a month-to-month contract.<p>As for negotiating earlier, again, you sound like you are reading from a college textbook. Nothing wrong with it, but I run a start-up and things are not usually as perfect as books may make it seem. ie. We did just as aggressive negotiation at the time of signing up and got the best deal in the market at the time. Also note that at the time the server was given to us, the host had put in money that they had yet to recover. When we went back to renegotiate, that cost had been recovered.<p>""Why sign a contract and then renege six months in?""<p>Usually because some unexpected variables change. Happens all the time, especially in a start-up. And right now, in this economy, even more so!<p>Lastly, your point that you should negotiate just as aggressively at the beginning is well taken. However, doing that and re-negotiating to get the best deal at all times are not mutually exclusive.",1228182581

Just reading the first words of pg's essay cheered me up. when pg talks about programmers, there's no worldly spirit in what he writes. You don't see words like professional, certification etc. He writes like a kid writing about his favorite hobby. This article actually saddened me. Like its been pointed out, you really feel the author squeezing the fun out of programming. It reminded be of the stories in the Bible with the Pharasees and Scribes. They put on the outer mask of religion but rejected it's inner power: The Holy Spirit. Similarly, there has to be that inner love for programming to make good stuff.<p>I'm not trying to say I think the guys wrong or a ""Scribe"". I just think that its sad that he talks about it in such procedural way. I would hate programming if I thought like that!",1228182547
382471,comment,381920,381945,0,0,utx00,,,"i prefer hg too.<p>cheap local branching: there's bookmarks, there's named branches, and there is mq. one of the cool things about mq is that the patch queues can themselves be an hg repo. so if you're using a patch queue like you would the git index, you can 'push' that state somewhere else as way of backup. can one do that with the git-index? (if you rsync your tree, get ready to rsync huge pack files everytime they change .. see below)<p>everything is local: this is the exact same thing on git and hg.  hg incoming means check another repo for incoming changesets. ergo it needs to contact that repo which need not be remote.<p>git is fast: we have our source tree in hg and git. ~10k files plus binary stuff. no one notices any difference. on windows, hg is faster.<p>git is small: maybe so. but you have to remember, (and perhaps understand) about git-repack and friends. hg, is like a self-cleaning oven in this regard.<p>staging area: if one needs such a thing, there are mercurial queues. if you dont, it's not in your way.<p>distributed: yes. hg is distributed. that's why it has commands like incoming.<p>any workflow: same thing in both.<p>github: <a href=""http://www.bitbucket.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitbucket.org/</a><p>easy to learn: git is easier to learn than mercurial?<p>ok, now here's what i don't like about git:<p>storage: it's annoying to have to setup git-repacks jobs for each repo, but that's fine. the real killer for us is that it kills our incremental backup strategy. every time you repack you create a new pack file (in our case huge) and you have to back it up again. in mercurial you can back up the files that changed.<p>bundles: git now has them but they started in mercurial. i'm putting this down because there seems to be this perception that all the cool stuff happens first in git.<p>index: fine after you're a pro, but we have had accidents. learning curve is a bit strict with git.<p>documentation: better in hg. much better actually.<p>git has gone through a lot of interface changes. is cogito still in use?  and then they broke renaming at one point. i'm sure these things are fixed, but we've had no such issues in hg thus far.<p>in the end they both rock, but i prefer hg.",1228182376

Nobody is going to steal your idea if you don't drop out, and nothing is stopping you from working on it now.  And if it does turn out that your idea takes off, you can always quit then.  Staying in school is a <i>smart hedge against failure</i> that most entrepreneurs don't have.<p>Ignoring, for the moment, that a college degree lends you business credibility that's difficult to obtain otherwise, it's important to realize that quitting school right now probably <i>won't</i> give you a strategic advantage.  Quit school, and you've got to feed yourself, house yourself, pay the bills and do a million other things just to manage your life.  Stay in school, and you've got to do some homework.  Otherwise, you're surrounded by smart people, free resources, subsidized housing and food.
