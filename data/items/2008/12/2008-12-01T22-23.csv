I realize that this isn't popular advice amongst the <i>""school is for luzers""</i> crowd that camps out on this site, but every good developer I know had the maturity and perseverance to finish college.

382269,comment,379460,379460,0,0,mafamba,,,"I found this particular paragraph to be not right somehow:<p>Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones actually prefer to work hard. This doesn't seem to be the case in most types of work. When I worked in fast food, we didn't prefer the busy times.<p>Who are the people who are ""best at"" fast food? I think perhaps you mean that people who build things get enjoyment out of building -- perhaps more precisely, of seeing their built item in action. I think programmers in particular are used to having short feedback loops between building and trying out, and that pattern of building up and testing as you go until a larger problem is solved is a strong motivation.<p>I guess I'm claiming that harder-working isn't really the issue. The issue seems to be who is having more fun. And in that sense, your claims still make sense. Part of the fun of building is a short feedback cycle. More checks in the process make the feedback cycle longer, therefore less fun. That explains why teachers' like their jobs. You can see it in someone's face when they learn something new.",1228172002

If you want to do this in svn, you create a branch, which exists on the server, which is visible to everyone else (though I guess many won't have it checked out).  And when you commit, you need to be online, unless you've got something like svk.<p>In git, you just create a local branch, try it out, and see if you like the results.  If you do, you can have a buddy pull your new branch and see if he likes them, and if everything's good, merge it into master.  If you don't, just delete the local branch and nobody's the wiser.  Also makes for really quick commits while you're trying things out.",1228171673

382243,comment,382053,382053,0,0,unalone,,,"Yech.<p>The jokes didn't refer at all to the things that make people use Apple. It took the fact that Apple was popular and actually makes good-looking products, and used that as the basis of insults. That's the laziest sort of humor: joking without actually providing criticism.<p>It starts with the fake names. Mapple and Steve Mobs. myPod and myPhone. These aren't funny. The Simpsons could absolutely just use Apple's name and get away with it, if it's obviously parody. That joke adds nothing, and therefore by the rules of comedy ought to be removed. Anything bad brings down the good things.<p>Lisa runs into the store and points out Apple products and a parody of the Genius bar, which has never been funny. Apple Geniuses don't let the title go to their head, really. I've dealt with them a lot. They're smart and fun and they know what they're talking about, and they're perfectly willing to admit that Genius is just a bit of silly marketing. So that's another bad joke. Then we see the requisite ""Comic Book Guy is sloppy"" joke: predictable and not funny. That's the first 20 seconds.<p>Now we see Homer begging to get a computer. How is that funny? The Brainiac tells him that it's powered by dreams and imagination. I guess that's supposed to be a joke about how Apple is all talk and no play? Because that's not something that Apple's ever done, and they keep getting made fun of for it, and it's a lazy joke. Sample page: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/</a>. Apple markets its products only by mentioning features. On the splash page alone it mentions four things. If you talk to a genius, they are entirely pragmatic: they tell you exactly why Apple computers are better than other ones. This is another lazy, unfunny joke that only works if you already dislike Apple, which is the easiest audience on the planet.<p>The joke about a glowing computer being turned off - what the hell does that mean? The Wii glows when it's turned off. My Mac doesn't do anything when it's off. In fact, Apple computers tend to have fewer blinking lights than other computers. So there's another lame joke, and we're 40 seconds done with this shitty set of jokes.<p>The iPhonies is clever, but it's false. People don't get headphones to pretend like they use Apple products. Nobody does that. Furthermore, a cheap iPod shuffle costs less than a hundred dollars. Apple isn't pretentious and rich. It's high-end, and very rarely makes low-end products, but it's usually got surprisingly reasonable prices. So there's a bad joke based on a false premise that nobody actually believes.<p>Now we have a lengthy Krusty sequence that's unfunny. Seriously, now The Simpsons is like Family Guy. It makes stupid, irrelevant cameos just to carry the joke along. The difference is that Simpsons cameos are all Simpsons characters, and none of them are funny.<p>Krusty's comment about small movies: I saw the first season of Lost on my iPod on an airplane, and the screen worked for me. Plus, when you put a movie in your iPod it means you also have it on iTunes, on your computer, so it's a win-win. Apple's been steadily increasing screen size: look at the iPhone and iPod touch. Oh. We also get a tasteless Jewish joke here.<p>Steve Mobs appears, and people say that he's a genius and knows what they want. I guess this is supposed to be a joke. But from my experience, Jobs comes up with pretty ingenious products and they tend to be ones that I want. How is this funny? I like my computer, my iPod, and the iTunes music store.<p>Steve Mobs calls himself ""insanely great."" Jobs, on the other hand, is rarely self-masturbatory like that. So it's another joke that plays to Apple haters with no context. Next comes Bart, who gets to insult people and call Mac user losers. He also says that Jobs is gay. That's not only poorly stereotyped, that's crude and offensive.<p>People don't get Mac products to look cool. They get them because the Mac is incredibly delightful to use. I love my Macbook. It's an amazing tool. I don't care what people think about it: I care what I think about it. And I love it. I also happen to be straight.<p>Comic Book Guy reenacts the 1984 commercial, which is nice, but Futurama did it much better. The Simpsons is stealing from its child shows.<p>Then there's a pointless joke about how Jobs was fired and brought back. Yeah, because Apple culture just hasn't changed since then, and because Apple had the same image in the 80s that it does now. Jobs began the current Apple feel when he returned, and he's introduced good product after good product. The firing joke is a slightly higher-scale stupid joke, but it's a stupid joke.<p>Earbud-flaying. Not funny. Bart trying to escape with a computer. Not sensible, not funny.<p>The twins make a ""hate Lisa"" cameo. Yawn. They don't like her music. Yawn. They like her for her myPod. Kids don't actually... do that. iPods are so incredibly commonplace nowadays. There's a joke to be made about that. It wasn't made.<p>I love Itchy and Scratchy, but they're out of good ideas for them. And this one was extended way too far. See? Even the not-anti-Apple parts are bad.<p>The myBill is an outdated joke and it's been fixed. And what's the joke? That Apple charges 99 cents for a song? That's pretty cheap. 1200 dollars for 1212 songs is a good deal. But no: it's funny because Apple products are extremely expensive, right? 1200 dollars is so much! Never mind that buying the same amount of songs, say, as CDs from Wal-Mart would cost much more.<p>Also, buying songs from iTunes adds itself directly to your credit bill. You're charged instantly. No bill. That's the iPhone's thing.<p>The USB drive bit is clever. The underwater headquarters? Not so much. It's cliche and stupid. The big joke is that Apple has made the name Cupertino famous as where Apple comes from. There's a joke to be made there. This doesn't make it, because it's funnier to think that Steve Jobs is underwater like every other rich person on The Simpsons.<p>Steve Jobs is Googling himself! Never mind that Google loads fast and the page jobs is looking for has already loaded, so the delay is only there for the ""requisite punch line set-up time"" that makes jokes less funny. Or that Jobs has never been an attention-getter. He wears the same outfit every day! He's quietly married and his kids stay out of the news! Again! This is only a joke that's funny if you know nothing about Apple and already hate its products.<p>Steve Jobs knows all the Apple product users. Not sure why this is unfunny.<p>""Our real policy is no refunds."" Only, Apple does offer refunds, for a long time after purchase. And Lisa bought 1200 songs! Why does she deserve a refund? This is blind Apple-hate without any reasoning.<p>The final joke enforces this. Lisa's in an iPod costume handing out flyers. Apple doesn't do this. Never has. Its entire thing is rational minimalism. It's why Geniuses aren't given specific tasks and are allowed to just wander the store. It keeps their morale high and helps customers. So this is just a bad joke based on a premise - Apple says think differently but doesn't actually think differently - that doesn't exist. Apple does think differently. So there's another bad joke.<p>This is terrible writing. It's the worst Simpsons clip I've ever seen. And I'd think that if they were bashing Windows in the same way.<p>---<p>I love anti-Apple jokes if they're well done. The ""Don't Get A Mac"" video still cracks me up. I think that most anti-Apple jokes, however, are crude and poorly-done and just attempts to play up to people who hate Macs already. The Simpsons should be better than this.<p>---<p>Also, this isn't at all relevant hacker news, and it's not that intellectually interesting.",1228171282

The time I spent working on FictionAlley was much <i>more</i> educational than anything else I did in college, and if I had to pick one, I'd say ditch college and build your project.<p>It's not just ""knowing how to make a dynamic website"", too; in fact, after I finished, I vowed never to use PHP again.  The most valuable skills I got from FictionAlley were all soft skills.  How to balance a dozen different feature requests and pick out a design that isn't what anyone suggested but satisfies them all.  How to diffuse a massive PR disaster.  How to deal with a completely unreasonable customer.  How to make your life a living hell by promising features to users before they've been developed.  How to (roughly) estimate the time a project will take (if you're just starting out, expect it to take roughly 10x as long as you expect).  How to build things incrementally so you get to the finish line eventually.<p>I picked up a couple useful technical skills too; I learned all my UNIX, SQL and vi skills from that project, along with softer technical skills like how profiling, logging, optimizing, diagnosing performance problems, etc.<p>Most of this, you simply can't get in college.  The projects are not of sufficient scope.  You'll never have an unreasonable customer for a homework assignment, no matter how much you hate your professor. ;-) You probably won't have to maintain code that you wrote 3 years ago and can't stand now.<p>Heck, most people don't get to deal with that at <i>work</i> until they're in their late twenties, or even well into their thirties.  I have older alum friends that graduated before I matriculated, and they're just now getting into positions where they have to balance competing tradeoffs between different groups.<p>I actually risked my degree a whole lot more than unalone is doing - I was a physics major, and it's a lot harder to do dynamic web programming + upper-level physics than it is to do dynamic web programming + CS.  It ended up working out for me (after a really nerve-wracking last semester) and I got the degree, the fundamental math/physics/CS knowledge, <i>and</i> the experience of working on a fast-growing website.  But if I had to drop one, I'd say drop the degree, get the fundamental knowledge from textbooks, and do the project.",1228169232
