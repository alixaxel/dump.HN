I wasn't prepared to enumerate all of the differences between how a government institution and a for-profit business are run. It's no mystery that being beholden to paying customers or even a community that votes with its feet is more challenging than appealing to the many forces that drive government.

Scholarship for service is a great program.  I know the lab I was at would give civilians the options to spend 2 years in residence working towards their PhD with their civilian pay.  Granted 2 years isn't enough time to do the whole thing, but you can get courses paid for (and the time to take them) while working.  Sometimes taking the courses is considered part of your job.  Most of my MSc was paid for this way.  Government benefits are great--the BS the gov employees have to deal with is what makes it painful.<p>Depending where you are at, there is an opportunity to make an impact and do very interesting work.  There are also entrepreneurial opportunities in the government: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=395714"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=395714</a>",1229307525

I know that the caliber of programmers working for Goog, Y!, MS, Adobe is much higher than the typical Indian programmer who aspires to a H1B visa, whose primary motivation for a US Visa is increased money and social status.<p>I'm not painting everybody who is on H1B as bad. But if you consider that nearly 100,000 apply to H1B visas from India, it not hard to see that a vast majority are not of the same caliber as potential GOOG/MS/Y! employees.<p>Well, I have worked in India for 8 years as a programmer and have interviewed dozens of potential employees to work for startup companies that I worked for AND I have had the opportunity to interact with a wide sample of H1Bs in the USA. I stand by my measure of ""most programmers"" even if it is anecdotal.<p>And your paraphrasing ""Most Indian programmers who work for outsourcing shops don't care about technology"" carries the same bias that you try to dispel. I personally know a lot of programmers who work/used to work for SWITCh companies while also being excellent hackers and FOSS contributors.",1229306839
