409311,comment,409058,409296,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"There are certainly counter-examples to Churchill's thesis. While Singapore is technically a democracy, it has been under one-party rule for 50 years. In the early years of independence, the ruling party used its power to persecute its primary political opponent, the communist movement which was sweeping southeast Asia at the time.<p>Now Singapore is a clean and prosperous state with a per capita GDP higher than the USA and three times higher than its neighboring countries. There are things to dislike about Singapore if you are accustomed to Western political liberties, but it is hard to say that it would be better off if it had followed the dictates of liberal western democracy, especially in the precarious early years.<p>Chile is the most prosperous state in South America, although it was led to that point by a dictator that did horrible things to his political opponents. Iraqis had a higher standard of living under Saddam than they do under the current regime, though not if you opposed the government.",1230169762

409305,comment,409100,409100,0,0,MaysonL,,,"Yes, but. From Alan Kay[1]:<p>""One of the keys to how all this worked was the PARC version of Catch-22, known as ""Error-33"". One committed Error-33 by putting any externally controlled system, in-house or out, on one's critical path. This included vendors. Error-33 was avoided by doing all that was necessary within a research group and then sharing. Thus, virtually all the PARC hardware — including two big time-sharing main frames, the Altos, Ethernet, Laserprinter, file storage, and the systems that followed — and software — including operating systems, programming languages and development systems, productivity tools, etc. — were completely built inhouse by these few dozen researchers.<p>This sounds disastrous, but there is an important collection of theories in which the 1st order version and the 2nd order version are completely different yet both are true. For example, in programming there is a wide-spread 1st order theory that one shouldn't build one's own tools, languages, and especially operating systems. This is true—an incredible amount of time and energy has gone down these ratholes. On the 2nd hand, if you can build your own tools, languages and operating systems, then you absolutely should because the leverage that can be obtained (and often the time not wasted in trying to fix other people's not quite right tools) can be incredible.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf</a>",1230169182

You can take this approach with anything, but I love the fact that the writer referenced to video games.  Heck, there is a LOT from video games we can learn like a point system.  If you want a great example, look at www.thesixtyone.com (I am not behind that, but I am familiar with who created it, former guys who worked at Electronic Arts).<p>You can make the most complex software work for the simplest every day person if you open it up gradually.  Why do I have all of the crap that currently exists in Microsoft Word if I don't even need it?  Arguably, this is why there is so much hype around products such as Basecamp that are a world simpler than the current products that exist.  We're trying to build 1 product to accomodate 100% of its users.",1230168642

advanced thing in Emacs to be rebinding keys, it's almost essential
for normal use in fact.<p>When you're binding your own keys you need to know what that key
already does so you can decide if it's something you use now or
<i>might</i> use in the future.  If it is then you probably don't want to
use that key.<p>It would be a pretty bad situation to get to a ""you've unlocked new
feature X""!  But then find that the key for new feature X is the same
one you're fingers know to do something else.  Not that you couldn't
just rebind it to something else but that would just lead to a huge
amount of differences from the norm with no good reason (on top of the
the already huge amount of differences from the norm for a good reason
that most peoples Emacs already carry around).",1230167012
