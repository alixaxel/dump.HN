Is Friedman ""right""? Either way, he serves his argument poorly by comparing the wealthiest splinter of southeast Asia to the whole expanse of America.<p>Or engage his column elsewhere: are we <i>really</i> losing our most promising engineers to ""financial engineering""? Perhaps a less famous writer could support that argument with evidence. For instance, that writer might marry Friedman's argument with the fact that people like John Meriwether managed to nearly destroy capitalism with nothing more than an MBA.<p>Are there nuclear physicists on Wall Street? Of course. Are most nuclear phsyisicists on Wall Street? Prove it! Are the nuclear physicists on Wall Street the ones responsible for speculating on netted-out credit default swaps? The CDS racket was no more complicated than the MBS racket Michael Lewis wrote about in ""Liar's Poker"", and the BSD's on the Salomon trading desks were definitely not rocket surgeons.",1230152359

He didn't compare Hong Kong to West Virginia, Alabama... or other rural backwaters of this country.<p>Plus Hong Kong didn't always use to be a part of China, so it is a fair comparison.<p>While people in china might live in poverty and suffer of malnutrition, in here people are suffering form junk food.

The idea is that startups often neglect this in their early focus and loose valuable market share when they can't test stuff (and adapt to local customs, special cases, etc.) in other countries.<p>Initially I can only handle UK and Germany properly, but if successful this can be grown country by country with new subcontractors or whatever.",1230151829

409108,comment,408786,408897,0,0,russell,,,"Indeed!  I am on the leading edge of the boomers and I can tell you we are just as concerned and just as angry.  When I was growing up the WWII generation was lamenting how badly they had screwed it up (Vietnam, etc.) and were hoping we could do it better.  Well we didn't and the generation after us, the current screw ups, didn't either.  If anyone, I would blame Isaac Newton.  His legacy is the mechanical universe and the philosophy the everything is perfectible.  Hence the endless series of ideological laws and regulations and deregulations that will fix the problem du jour.  What we need to understand is that people are greedy, short sighted, and selfish.  They are also altruistic and caring.  We need to diminish the unfavorable traits and emphasize the favorable.  That's what antitrust and regulation do, keep the destructive side from becoming dominant.  But we also need to avoid stifling society by tamping down the ability to innovate.<p>The fixing of all this is cross generational.  If we don't fix it, every one will loose, including those who have it.  Have you seen the projections for social security?  The angst isn't fatal.  We survived the depression of the depression, we survived the post-Vietnam crisis of confidence, and we survived the crisis that Japan was going to suck up all our mojo.  (OK the auto industry didn't.)",1230151512

This license scares me.<p>It tries to close a ""loophole"" in the GPL that I never considered a loophole. Consequently, we have a brand new license that I don't want to learn because it's mentally exhausting to be reading legal documents when I want to code. I bothered with the GPL because there was enough points of view to feel relatively confident in what was happening. I don't want to bother again.<p>I hope the painfulness of having yet-another-license outweighed the perceived slights from the loophole they tried to close.<p>I'm happy to be an early adopter of a new technology.

409098,comment,408983,408983,0,0,gsaines,,,"I'm starting a educational software company right now, and while I think she's on track with her criticisms of educational effectiveness (let's face it, I went to public schools and learned veritably nothing), it seems like a supremely silly way to go about proving the market need. Who is going to buy these educational products again? Parents? And who do parents listen to? In our experience, parents listen to the teachers. So it doesn't look like a valid marketing strategy to start and educational company by saying ""teachers are stupid and can't teach."" Our goal in marketing ourselves is to give teachers some degree of control, but avoid the stultifying effects of ""fun classroom technology"" by mainly targeting self-motivated learners. Who knows if we'll make it to profitability, but having just attended a conference with over 500 teachers, pitching on the basis of teacher stupidity wouldn't have made any sales.",1230150477

Thus, my site Squeezed Books, which summarizes them.  I'd also like to foster discussion of some of the books in question, as I think there is something to be gained from the discussion and dissection of the ideas presented.",1230150192

Using Emacs really isn't <i>that hard</i>, and mystifying it doesn't do anybody any favors. (I can understand if it's not your cup of tea, though.)

409089,comment,407796,408703,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I tended to use fairly flat data structures in my own code, so the extra hassle with generics didn't often come up. I did, however, use delegates (closures!) all over the place. They're verbose, but I mapped the delegate definitions to a resharper macro and it only took two keystrokes. That helped while writing code. It still was a pain to read, though, and ultimately the macro language wasn't good enough to do what I wanted.<p>The thing I like about Fortress is that it's a grown and growable language, with almost all constructs first class and exposed. Just like Lisp. But it's coming from the complete opposite direction in terms of syntax. Lisp barely has any syntax. Fortress gives you the most powerful production parser in a programming language, plus extremely adaptable syntax (where <i>spaces</i> can be operators!) plus a wicked way to render code, plus the ability to make your programs platform portable, adaptable, and parallelizable. It can be looked at as a programming language, true. But it can also be fruitfully imagined as a powerful framework for building one's own programming language. This is what I like to do with it.  :-)",1230149636
