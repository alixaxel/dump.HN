You've received other replies mentioning various ways, with various degrees of formality, that admission offices can and do check their results. Now that many admission offices are making very fine distinctions among applicants as admission rates plummet below 10 percent, there will probably be growing interest in validating the criteria on which admission decisions are made.<p>MIT admission office McGreggor Crowley, in one of his admission travel sessions in the last year, said his office has done studies of which students perform best in upper division courses at MIT. Taking really hard classes in high school is a better predictor of upper-division success at MIT than having a spotless G.P.A., for example. He asked a large audience of high school students how many had done baby-sitting, and very few raised their hands.

400438,comment,400128,400128,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"A big reason I think they're de-emphasizing MacWorld is the crazy swings it brings in terms of stock prices and expectations. Apple isn't going to introduce an revolutionary iPhone year after year, and year after year AAPL goes through massive trade activities with speculators. We started holding up a MacBook staring at the share price every year and watch it go freakin' crazy.<p>Secondly, old media is dead. Long live new media. New media that we have in place -- online news, pro and amateur blogs, twitter, rss, facebook, chat -- has easily outstripped the effectiveness of things like trade journals and trade shows.<p>Thirdly, MacWorld has always been an odd compromise internally. Preparation for it begins early but with that pesky Exodus (12/22 - 1/2) right in the middle, it puts a rush on the rest of the 5 days to polish all of the marcomm materials and presentations. Then you have the devs all stuck in SF for an entire week.<p>If MacWorld was held at a later date then the costs might be justifiable -- it's why Apple left MacWorld Boston. The catch though is that MacWorld can't be held at a later date lest it be trumped by CES. Either way, not showing up Macworld is going to decrease the enormous strains an arbitrary January date puts on the company. The Town Hall meetings are perfectly sufficient, a lot closer, a lot cheaper, and a lot more controllable.<p>Also, Steve Jobs not doing a keynote isn't a big deal. Schiller will not be his successor (I thought at one point it was going to be Forstall but that idea went out the door), but if there's no big products to push, Steve might as well just hand it off to his lieutenants.

I'll take one more shot at it:<p>In order to attract prudent capital to a riskier investment, the projected rate of return must be higher than that of any available safe, or safer, investment. IOW, to lend to ""high risk"" customers, the credit card company has to charge some form of higher fees or rates. If they don't elect to offer lower rates to the ""low risk"" customers than those that they have to charge the high-risk customers, then someone else will come along and cherry-pick the low-risk customers.<p>Said only slightly differently, why would anyone choose invest at arms-length in something riskier if there were a safer alternative available with an equal rate of return? They wouldn't, and any attempt to compel them to do so via regulation is unlikely to produce a result that you'd be happy with. It will either dry up credit for everyone, dry up credit for only the riskier potential patrons, or result in #1, followed by the demand for changes to the bankruptcy laws to enable creditors to safely lend at the mandated terms to all comers.
