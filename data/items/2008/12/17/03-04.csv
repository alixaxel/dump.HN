That sounds great but I think most Nobel Ph.D. have 2 or 3 schools (if not more) in their background so it's really more like 2% which sounds about right for one of the top 25 science schools in the world.",1229486208

He's simply acknowledging a fact:  the economy of today is much <i>faster</i> than it has ever been before.  Scammers can effectively hide behind the speed of their actions.  That's new.<p>Once upon a time, regulatory agencies like the SEC had a fighting chance of catching stock scams, because the market was <i>slower</i>.  It was still efficient, but because there were fewer players, making fewer plays per billionth of a second, they had a chance of stopping crime.  Today, the best that the SEC can do is to (maybe) catch these guys in retrospect -- and there's absolutely no chance that they're catching all of them.  Thanks to modern technology, market manipulation can happen at the speed of light.",1229486195

Fears among climatologists are that if temperatures increase even moderately above minimum predictions these methane hydrates will start melting and releasing methane directly into the atmosphere.

Many scientists are afraid that if the ices start melting, it will create a feedback warming loop that will release even more methane.

I understand that people have credit card debt but to say no debt allowed in the country at all is just plain stupid.<p>You are basically arguing that massive across the board deflation of every good in the country and literaly putting every single person underwater on their mortgage is a GOOD thing. If house prices have to fall to the levels you want, everyone who owns a home now would lose so much money that the great depression would look like a cakewalk. Nearly every person with a mortgage would be bankrupt.<p>So this grand idea is to prevent a repeat of this temporary 50% reduction in our investments due to 5% of the people in the country defaulting on their mortgage? What?<p>Not to mention anyone that has a pile of cash today (i.e. those that are old enough to have paid off a mortgage and had the advantage of credit in their youth) would be able to outspend everyone else.

400505,comment,399670,400299,0,0,old-gregg,,,"Correction: shared libraries (DLLs) on Windows are shared between processes exactly the same way as it works on Linux, they're called 'shared' for a reason :-) They get ""mapped"" into virtual address space of every process, but physically there's only one copy, moreover, if you're running as an Admin, a process can alter the code in a shared DLL, causing it to work differently in all other processes that use it, that's one of the tricks that infamous rootkits do to hide themselves.<p>You are right, Windows processes are heavy. Moreover, context switch between processes on Windows is also a little slower, because NT-based kernels went ""maximum security"" route and perform full process isolation, that's also why Windows doesn't have a fork-like syscall, only environment variables, IIRC, can be cloned. (which is how, I suspect, Linux threads are implemented - they're probably share-everything fork calls).<p>On the other hand thread/fiber switch on Windows, I believe, is fastest of all popular x86 OSes.<p>All in all I like Windows process model a lot more. Clear separation between processes (share nothing) and threads (share everything except the stack) is well-known and well documented, and leads to a much nicer server-like application programming experience.<p>Although... I really like how easily you can nuke frozen processes on Linux if there is a problem. No programming tools/knowledge required. Dealing with hung threads would have been a lot harder.",1229484286
