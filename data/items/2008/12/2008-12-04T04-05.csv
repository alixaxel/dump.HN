  [..]
  Well, our entire country has been taking 20% time for at least the past five years.
  [..]
  We’ve overspent, taken expensive vacations, built absurd homes (in both scale and
  quantity), run our savings into the ground and skyrocketed our debt to
  record levels.
</code></pre>
Linking between Google's 20% time to our culture of hoarding and overbuying is unfair and tenuous to the extreme. The former produced a lot of R&D and contributed to the greatness of Google's products - the other was economically unsound stupidity by a consumerist society.<p>R&D can not be equated with wasting time and money. Anyone who does so is setting themselves up for failure when the economy rebounds.<p><pre><code>  Yep, move the standard 35-40 hour work week right up to 48 hours.
</code></pre>
More hours spent <i>at</i> work does not increase productivity unless you are actually <i>producing</i> for more hours (assuming your quality doesn't drop, which it will). France's productivity in the late 90s was a lot higher than the UK's, despite the former having an enforced 35 hour work week. Productivity and time spent at work do not correlate. Indeed, spending 10 - 20 hours more at work each week would probably hurt the economy further as people spend less on leisure activities.<p>If you skip everything until <i>In the technology industry, a 48 hour work week would be, for most, a vacation.</i> most of Jason's advice on what to do next is very good, however.",1228366348

385327,comment,384606,384606,0,0,bokonist,,,"Behind the success of most corporate giants is usually the not-so-invisble-hand of government connections.  The 1960's organization man economy was a result of the tremendous growth of government during the New Deal and the World War.  IBM was a small company until it received a giant  government contract to run the Social Security accounting system.  GE grew enormously from government spending on space, nuclear energy, and advanced   AT&T's dominance was a result of nationalizing the telephone industry in 1918.  The economies of scale for Wall St. companies are solely the result of the Federal Reserve's ""too big to fail"" policy ( and also regulatory costs).<p>I think that the early 1900's were a more economical natural time.  There were some big corporations, but the economy was largely dominated by small businesses and startups.  The 1960's were the anomaly, a direct result of the creation of the American mega-state.<p>Today the government and large government connected corporations have calcified.  Look at NASA.  It's not sexy to work there anymore because everyone knows that it hasn't done a single interesting thing since it put a man on the moon.  But because it is a government program, it cannot fail and be replaced with something more dynamic.  It's a zombie organization, not really alive, but unable to die.<p><i>But till recently this was an anomalous route that tended to be followed only by outsiders. It was no coincidence that the great industrialists of the nineteenth century had so little formal education. As huge as their companies eventually became, they were all essentially mechanics and shopkeepers at first.</i><p>In 1900, getting an education was anomalous.  Most smart people were mechanics and shopkeepers, and if they were ambitious and talented, they created successful startups. The hacker in 1900 viewed a college degree like a hacker today views an MBA - as an expensive way to rot your brain.  And finally, for those who got engineering degrees, I doubt starting a company was that uncommon.  Off the top of my head, the very first student at Stanford ( Herbert Hoover) did indeed start his own company.  So the tradition has been there for a long time.<p><i>Now I would guess that practically every Stanford or Berkeley undergrad who knows how to program has at least considered the idea of starting a startup.  East Coast universities are not far behind, and British universities only a little behind them.</i><p>In the 2000's your average ambitious Ivy league graduate wanted to work for Wall St.  The rest would go into consulting, academia, or get a profession degree.  Very few people think of doing startups.  If the Wall St. bubble never comes back, and graduates are forced to make an honest living, perhaps there will be a trend towards doing more startups.<p><i>Fifty years later, startups are ubiquitous in Silicon Valley and common in a handful of other US cities, but they're still an anomaly in most of the world.</i><p>Startups are an anomaly in Europe, Japan, and Korea because of government regulations.  China is filled with startups because it has the freest market in the world.  Startups are common in Sillicon valley because it is the home of the tech industry, which is the most unregulated industry in the United States.",1228366269

385295,comment,384606,384694,0,0,wheels,,,"I think the other piece that's missing is that the role of corporations in society has changed drastically.  I don't think they're fundamentally <i>for</i> the same thing as startups in the modern world.  Paul's essay mentions large companies  being less successful in the immediate future, but I don't think they're playing by the same rules, fundamentally.<p>Perhaps the closest example I can think of here is the transformation that happened in both Christianity and Islam with the rises of the Catholic church and the Caliphate, respectively.  At a certain point their religious function became incidental.  They were by and large instruments which brokered in power and influence.<p>You can see a similar pattern in governments founded through populist revolutions based on ideologies as they've transformed into world powers.  <i>Liberty</i>, as such, has for quite a while ceased to be the primary function of the US or French governments.<p>In the same sense, I believe that the modern trans-national corporation has ceased to be an entity that exists primarily for the propagation of products and services:  they are also brokers of power and influence.  There was a first <i>colonial</i> phase starting at the middle of the last century where corporations became powerful political influence outside of their own home territories and since the 70s or 80s they've extended to becoming powerful forces even within the machines of the modern super-powers.  Drawing another analogy, what I believe the modern renewal of small companies is effectively a reformation akin to what's been seen in religious institutions, where there's a sense of things getting back to the ideals.  I feel like it's still too early in history to see if this will be a fundamentally disruptive change, or merely a blip in the growth pattern.  Again, history provides some examples there for example in the Wycliffe-ian or Hussite movements, which preceded the more dramatic changes of the reformation and counter-reformation (and before those movements themselves began creeping towards instruments of power).  The real reformation may still be yet to come.",1228364229
