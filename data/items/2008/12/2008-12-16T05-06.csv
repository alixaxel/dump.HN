399233,comment,398913,398913,0,0,jmtame,,,"I found the single most effective thing to do in UI is this: iterate.  The average number of iterations I take for a single view is about 10 before I'm really happy.<p>You see #1, and it doesn't feel too bad.  Then you do #2, and it makes #1 look bad.  You get an idea, so you experiment and try to tweak it a little.  Before you know it, you've created something that just feels good at heart.  It looks good, it's appealing, it's usable, and attractive.<p>Some companies go extreme on this, I know Apple can go through hundreds of designs for a single product.<p>I have a few rules of thumb with this:<p>1) Never delete an iteration, including #1 which probably will look the absolute worst.<p>2) Just do #1, yes it will probably suck.  Do it and get it over with.  Then make #2 and subsequent iterations incremental improvements.<p>3) Don't stop until you're absolutely proud of the iteration.  Be honest, don't let fatigue be your reason for stopping or moving on.  True UI design is difficult and requires endurance, just like anything else that's difficult (sports, programming, writing a novel, etc).",1229405664

399230,comment,397808,399152,0,0,Dilpil,,,"As someone who is utterly convinced of the worthlessness of religious studies, literature studies, philosophy, ect, let me attempt to answer your question.<p>CS is a topic where every question has an answer.  We may not know it, but it either exists or is provably non existent.  Furthermore, CS is a field which advances- and when CS advances, life often improves for millions of people.  Lastly, taking CS and math classes means learning new things.  I know things I did not know at the beginning of the semester about the nature of information.<p>In humanities, while the questions are interesting, they have no answers.  Furthermore, the study of humanities does not advance, the fashions and trends simply change.  It is also entirely possible to go to a humanities lecture and learn absolutely nothing new.<p>It is not the CS majors who are brutes.  We are the scholars, the ones responsible for advancing human civilization.  Studying CS requires constant intellectual growth and expansion as you enable your brain to understand more and more complex topics.<p>Taking humanities courses is a major distraction from this pursuit.  I have never been exposed to an idea in a humanities class that I could not have understood as a 15 year old.  I have never seen irrefutable proof of something I was previously convinced was false in a humanities class.<p>This is why I have a complete lack of interest in humanities.",1229405452
399229,story,,,1,1,owkaye,"Ask HN: Vesting, equity, salaries, etc.",,"I'm preparing a startup and I'm hoping to learn how others have structured their equity sharing deals so I can consider my options intelligently.  I can imagine one of the founders 'slacking off' once the business starts generating substantial income and I think it would be a mistake to give a person like this too much equity in the beginning, but ...<p>How do you decide how much equity and how much salary to give other founders, and when they should receive these benefits?<p>Does it make sense to share equity (in the beginning) based on the number of hours each has contributed to the project in advance?<p>Does it make sense to base the future equity sharing on hours worked after the company is started, so that if we end up with slackers they get no more than they earn -- and so those of us who do most of the work get nearly all the equity?  Or is this more of a salary issue than an equity issue?<p>I'm particularly interested in how other companies have structured their equity and salary arrangements, especially when they work well and are appreciated by everyone involved:<p>- How is your equity sharing arrangement structured?
- Who gets what percentages and why?
- How much equity is reserved for future investors, etc?
- How much equity did you receive from the start?
- How much more do you get as the business grows?
- What determines the amount of stock you own?
- Do you receive more stock for more time on the job?
- How does vesting work in your company?<p>Someone once suggested that I keep most of the equity myself and only give out a small single-digit percentage to each of the other founders.  This seems too greedy to me, but he also said my equity would be the portion that gets diluted in a round of future funding so I had better keep most of it myself.  I have no idea if he knows what he's talking about.<p>In fact, I have no idea how long each founder should be required to work before they are 'vested', and perhaps even the issue of vesting should be approached as an incremental benefit rather than something that happens all at once.<p>Basically I'm looking for any insights or examples you can share that might give me some reasonable ideas for structuring our equity sharing arrangement.
