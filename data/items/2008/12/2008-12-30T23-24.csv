414848,comment,414330,414515,0,0,mmmurf,,,"Immigration:  I don't think you really disagree with Cato.  Arguing that immigration restrictions should be eliminated does not necessarily entail that one believes the restrictions should be lifted all at once.<p>Rent Control:  Rent control causes higher prices for everyone except those who happen to have a rent-controlled apartment, because it discourages improvement of existing properties and discourages building new properties.  It also encourages over-buying.  Someone may pay $2000/month for a 3 bedroom apartment that has been rent controlled since the 1970s, but only use 1 of the bedrooms.  That person could find a 1BR apartment within budget w/o rent control, and someone (maybe 3 room-mates paying $1500 each) could share the 3BR place.  Overall this is a more efficient distribution of resources, the benefit of which occurs immediately.  I don't really feel sorry for someone getting a huge apartment for way below market price.<p>Interest Rates:  I'm not sure I understand what you mean, since interest rates vary based on unpredictable Fed action and unpredictable market forces all the time.  Banks (lenders) hedge against this by buying/selling instruments to even out their Fed risk and by buying insurance to hedge against many of the other risks.<p>American Auto Industry:  What makes you think there would be a chaotic ""all at once"" situation?  That is part of the fearmongering on the part of the firms seeking rents (and the politicians they have bought).   Recall how Dubya told everyone that if the US didn't invade Iraq there was an ""imminent threat to US national security""?  The automakers used that exact strategy to obtain a bailout.<p>Stability is an interesting concept.  It's the essence of ""conservatism"", wanting to preserve the status quo.  Marx warned about this in his manifesto.  Anyone who has managed to get a leg up will fight to preserve it at the expense of productive change.<p>In today's world, this includes the people who thought they were investment geniuses because the value of their home increased 40% the year after they bought it, it includes the overpaid workers who convince themselves that a hard working person immigrating to the US is somehow unamerican, it also includes the politicians who enjoy the huge donations they have been getting from the financial services industry and don't want to see endangered.<p>So if you put aside the ""I want to keep my small advantage at all cost"" conservatism, and you do away with the Bush-style fearmongering about imminent threats to ""stability"", what you find is that the world really isn't all that scary, and often times the meddling that is done to try to prevent ""instability"" actually does far more harm than good.  The Iraq war is a case in point.<p>Note that ""stability in the middle east"" is the motto of those who want to go and turn it upside down with bombs and nation building!  The same applies to domestic policy.",1230680134

Rent control provides a disincentive to long term investments like new construction or major renovations to rental buildings.""<p>This doesn't make any sense.  Without the current rent-control laws, the incentive would be to keep the housing supply low and spike rental rates.  New construction would still be difficult (because it's NYC), plus current owners would spend their political capital on preventing it from happening to keep their incomes up.<p>""Incidentally, neither of the 'things that bother you about the free market religion' are actually part of the free market ideology. 1) only applies to efficient markets (like the rental market, with many buyers and sellers, and good information) and 2) is closer to the Clinton/Bush/Dodd/Obama ideology that ownership is something to encourage.""<p>Maybe I should be more clear, my fault.  My first point has less to do with pricing efficiency than with the basic idea that certain things with value can be priced at all (a person's contribution to the appeal of a neighborhood, for instance).  My second point was that there are other kinds of risk (living in a bad neighborhood for its cheap rent) that should be rewarded by society over ownership (the windfall that the owner of a slum stumbles into as the neighborhood appreciates in value).<p>""In some cases the people are completely unrelated.""<p>Of course, I never implied otherwise.  My next sentence after the one you quoted was that I wouldn't claim such a thing.  As for Harlem, I was almost going to use that to illustrate my point.  Prices there are a lot cheaper there right now than the location would suggest they should be, and (despite your experience) tons of people are starting to look that way.  Assuming living in the city stays cool, do you really think it's going to be as cheap as it is today in five years?  And everyone who's moving there right now, who are going to make it that super-desirable place to live?  They'll be priced out (see: SoHo, parts of Brooklyn, Hell's Kitchen, etc., etc).<p>""As far as who ""deserves"" to live on some place, it's a wash. So lets not favor any particular group over the other.""<p>I disagree, let's favor the particular group that was already there, that's already established the place as their home.<p>""As far as emotional appeals go, I'm not casting any group of people as assholes.""<p>Really?

First, at least in Visual Basic 6, functions didn't return values like in any other language I know of; instead, the function name was set to a value, like a variable.  This alone would not kick you out of the function.  You had to remember to type Exit Function, unless you were at the end of the function definition already.<p>Secondly, visual basic 6 (and .NET) evaluate the entire expression, even when it is obvious it cannot be true, which causes all sorts of issues to popup if the developer is used to C and similar languages that support short circuit operations, as described at the end of this article. For example, you could not rewrite the c statement if (n != null && n % 2 == 0) in visual basic 6 without using two nested if statements.  The overall product benefitted from Microsoft's backing and ability to easily use any of Microsoft's controls, which allowed for fast development.  But the language features themselves were atrocious.  VB.NET introduced two keywords, AndAlso and OrElse, that do support short-circuit binary operators, which I only learned about from googling just now.
