Assign the top ten companies as high a percentage of whatever as you like: it won't prevent people from seizing opportunity to create value at a higher rate than large organizations are able to do. The point is that the two barriers that largely prevented talented people from doing so in the past - cost of entry and cultural beliefs - don't hold sway anymore.<p>The fact that some markets have matured and been commoditized hardly implies that there is no new value to be created.",1228460191

Not to mention not actively destroying it.<p><i>obfuscation only makes sense in rare and outright terrible situations</i><p>Courage and honesty are what make sense in rare and outright terrible situations.

Ethics that fluctuate with one's career situation aren't ethics to begin with either.<p>Look... I wouldn't write this if it were just about critiquing your post.

To further complicate things, the Bureau of Engraving, still a different agency, is responsible for making bills. All these organizations are related to the U.S. Treasury, however.<p>Our system is much more complex than Ron Paul and fellow gold standard libertarians would have you believe. They exploit this complexity for their own purposes. Because the system is hard to understand, they try to convince people into thinking that a simpler one would be better. This probably isn't the case, however. Sure, some simplifications could take place, but they would potentially have large impacts on our economy and society. Our system has evolved to become what it is today and any changes should be made with much consideration and caution.<p>Macroeconomics is a very complicated field. There are many theories about macroeconomic behavior and none fully explain or predict all economic situations. In microeconomics, one can do experiments to test the various theories, but macroeconomics is another beast entirely.<p>I would be wary of anyone who tells you that they fully understand how the economy works and has solutions to solve the problems of our day. The economy of the world is a very complex system. I do not pretend to understand it, but know enough to see that changes can have vast and unforeseen consequences.",1228459312

I often used to tell retailers that they ""had"" to accept, say, 2 dollar bills or whatever because currency says ""legal tender for all debts public or private"".  I found out some years later that this is quite literal.  If I <i>owe you money</i> and I want to pay you in US currency-- that is, I want to use the money to pay off a debt-- you are legally obligated to accept it.  However, if, say, you offer to sell me a hamburger, but refuse to take anything but 5$ bills, that is okay.  (Unless you sell the hamburgers on credit...)",1228458924

386729,comment,385715,386206,0,0,netcan,,,"When I was finishing high school, I went through a bad patch. Nearly dropped out. I fell out with the math teacher at week one & never went to a class.<p>The school decided to let me have a chance at taking a few versions of the year's final. I took about 5 hrs 1-on-1 tuition with approximately 1.5 hrs preparation each + about 10 hrs of self study +  about the normal amount of pre test practice (maybe 20-30) hrs. That adds up to approximately 45 hrs all up compared to maybe 5-6 times that much pursuing the normal study path. I had similar examples at university (though not as sharp).<p>Assuming that 5 hrs 1-on-1 is probably cheaper the 1/30 X 1 year of teacher time, that's an efficiency. But you could probably have 7-8 hours of 3-on-1 with similar results. 1 teacher could potentially ""teach"" 10-15 students how to pass that test in a week.<p>Of course there what you have is a totally different experience. I was taught how to pass the mathematics test, not mathematics. My classmates were taught mathematics, but they still learned how to pass the test.<p>Universities have terrible inefficiencies. They basically subsidise research with tuition. The students receive some of the prestige gained via research in the form of their degree. But if you look at it from a purely educational perspective, it's inefficient.<p>In many subject areas attendance in lectures was about 40%. My own attendance was in no way linked to my results. What I did find important were the tutorials. But that was only about 100 hrs per year (10 - 15 students). Everything else, from lectures to course administration is very scalable.<p>I could have received a very similar education with 10 hrs per student tutorial time if the structure was behind it.<p>But if I had to place a bet on what the future disruptive innovation would be I'd say it won't be the same thing just more efficient. I think there is a lot of potential in separating education from certification.<p>The knowledge is accessible online for the most part. It still needs to be arranged. But that will almost certainly occur if certification exists separately to education.<p>I also think/hope that it will occur in the developing world. Employment is becoming accessible via the web already so the motivation is there. Knowledge is already there. I don't think that a situation where $1000 in hardware & internet access can take someone from a year 9 education to paraprofessional or professional level of education.<p>There is a huge amount for the world to gain. The biggest economic inefficiencies are barriers to trade, barriers to investment & barriers to immigration. Trade barriers & investment barriers can (& have) been lowered to allow the flow of capital, technology, products & services but not labour. Education is part of that.",1228457778
