(<a href=""http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial...</a> for those following along) When I started learning vim I printed it out and it's still hanging on my cube wall. It really captures a lot of the mnemonics and helped me get up to speed quickly.<p>I was forcibly introduced to vi when I was doing some system administration on some AIX machines. Emacs was not available and I'm not even sure if something as simple as pico was. Since I was going to be doing a lot of work on these boxes I decided to learn vi. It was one of the best computing decisions I've ever made. I've been using vim for about two years now and everything has just become instinctive. When I'm using another editor I just feel crippled. I still feel like there's a lot I can still learn - I try to pick up a new trick at least once a week.<p>Here's my current list of tricks from my .vimrc file.

152136,comment,151671,152067,0,0,rsheridan6,,,">People accuse me of working on ""boring"" business stuff. I prefer to call myself the ""digital Willie Sutton"". Why play roulette when the bank vaults are open?<p>I think there are two reasons:<p>Hackers tend to be male computer geeks who majored in CS or something like that, and they write for markets that they understand, so they're mostly concentrated in the same markets because they understand the same things.  Even within the Web 2.0 sphere lots of markets are ignored.  Here's an example of a site that serves knitters: <a href=""https://www.ravelry.com/account/login"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ravelry.com/account/login</a>\nThey've been around for less than a year and they have over 100K users.  I only know about them because my wife knits.  They have (or had when I checked it out several months ago) essentially no competition, because the intersection of people who are interested in hacking and knitting consists of very few people.  IIRC it was written by the husband of a knitter.<p>Second, dealing with businesses is kind of daunting.  I think I could write better software than my pharmacy has in a matter of months, but I would either have to sell it to risk-averse PHBs who don't understand technology or start my own mail-order pharmacy.  Just writing some web app and putting it up has a far lower activation energy, even if there is more competition and the market is ultimately smaller.<p>But if you know your market and are comfortable dealing with these businesses, you're in a great position.  I can't imagine that any software would be boring if it's for your own startup.",1207063963

The idea is to make it easy to find scalability issues in advance, like the signup scalability issue HN had when it was TechCrunch'd. The tests will require no hardware, be on-demand, and use an open source tool people might already be using. It should make the process ridiculously easy and scalable if I get things right.",1207062631

I think your comments help elucidate my point that evolution is not so simple as to be glibly thrown around as the reason for every human behavior.<p>>> Taken to the extreme, why have we even developed arms, legs, eyes, ears, and minds? Simple bacterial reproduction does just fine.<p>> I don't get what you are trying to prove here. What is your explanation for the fact that we developed those things?<p>Back to my point, everyone assumes that evolution simply means ""survival of the fittest"" or the ""propagation of the gene"". If that's all there is to it, there's no obvious explanation for the emergence of higher-order organisms, since bacterial reproduction provides by far the most efficient mechanism for copying genes. All this is to say that the devil is in the details and there is actually quite a bit more to evolution than what is taught in 7th grade biology.",1207062086
