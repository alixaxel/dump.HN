This comes up in any discipline that deals with human intent, such as forensics and law, signal processing, web search, spam filters, etc.<p>ID as a scientific methodology merely says we shouldn't arbitrarily limit where we can look for intelligence.  The only reason we currently have this limit is because of purposeful cultural transformations (see ""Closing of the American Mind"") and not because of any rigorous arguments or evidence.<p>Also, it needs to be said that ID vs evolution is a false dichotomy.",1208547933

That's a good 600-800 additional calories per day.<p>You still may have to make some diet changes:  sucking down sodas all day long is not a good idea no matter how much exercise you do.<p>The other thing to realize is that your body will try to adapt to exercising every day.

For example, instead of spending all day coding, break up the day by swapping your focus to an entirely different aspect of your startup, like finding potential customers or planning your pitch to a top blogger. Coding in the morning, strategy in the afternoon...and both should be done while drinking as much water as possible.<p>If you can't bring yourself to focus on a different part of your startup, write down exactly what is causing you to be angry (let's be honest - it's usually something to do with the code you've written) and list the possible solutions underneath it. Choose the best solution on gut instinct, and move on asap. Too much thinking is bad.<p>p.s.

There's a book called <i>The French (don't) Diet</i>. I haven't read it, but I know people who have. The basic idea is that French food (and presumably much of Europe's food overall) is naturally healthy. It's not filled with preservatives or infused with high-fructose corn syrup. Those artificial ingredients in most American foods are hard for our bodies to digest, so they move to fat where they are almost never digested. The French food is made of natural ingredients that our bodies can actually use for nutrition and energy, so we don't store the food away - we use it.<p>The funny thing is that in America, we don't have this artificial food because it tastes better. We have it here because it's cheaper.<p>On another note, why is this on HN? I know it's tangentially related to the hacker diet, but an <i>Ask YC: How do you lose weight?</i> thread doesn't seem like it would belong here.",1208546314

Trends and stereotypes are important factors in marketing. Pretty much everyone on this site understands that there are exceptions to every trend and stereotype.

I didn't say that.<p>Unless you're addressing an autistic audience, it is acceptable to say ""Women do X"" when you really mean ""Women do X more frequently than non-women, although of course some women do not do X at all, some have never heard of X, some hate X, etc."" For example, I am rarely corrected if I say ""Five-year-olds are taller than four-year-olds,"" even though it's trivial to demonstrate that this isn't true. If your argument is that the statement in question is not <i>literally</i> true, you are correct. But if you use that to conclude that the <i>tendency described</i> does not exist, you're stretching things.<p>The statement was not ""Women are nesting more than they used to,"" but ""Women tend to nest."" Whether they start nesting immediately or a bit later than they used to distracts from the point that they do it more than men regardless of timing.<p>>I know a lot of female professionals and I can't think of any without kids that spend any appreciable amount of time on handmade crafts.<p>I know female professionals who don't, female professionals who do, full-time parents who don't, and full-time parents who do.

Reading on the monitor was great for when I wanted to read during lunch - no need to try to hold the book and a sandwich at the same time. I also used the PDF version when I was somewhere with a computer and wanted to read, but didn't have the paper copy with me.<p>The rest of the time I would read the paper copy. I also print out longer articles to read - paper seems less fatiguing to read from than a screen.<p>The font, font size, column width, and line spacing seem to make a big difference with how tiring it is to read on the screen. The Free Culture PDF was one of the the easiest documents I've come across to read. The default WordPress and Blogger themes use similar column widths and line spacings - this suggests that there might be an optimum way to display text for readability.<p>This is a bit of a leap, but if you're designing a site that has a lot of paragraph-form text, mimicking the typography of a typical paperback will probably do a lot for your site's readability.
