157366,comment,157269,157269,0,0,tptacek,,,"From an ex-Pythonista a year in to Ruby, point-by-point:<p>* Ruby's Unicode support is indeed inferior to Python's; unlike Python, you need to explicitly use library calls to work with UTF-16 strings. Python does indeed bake this in to the language.<p>* I don't use multiline regexps. On the other hand, I do use normal regexps, all the time, and the fact that I don't have to call out to a library to use them, or deal with special ""match"" objects with their own API, is a plus. Ruby has more natural support for regular expressions than Python, where regular expressions are an afterthought.<p>* Ruby's documentation sucks. Full stop.<p>* I have no idea why I'm meant to care about what this guy thinks of Ruby 1.9 or Ruby 2.0. There's a Ruby 2.0?<p>* Python is way faster than Ruby. Not by a little bit.<p>* Ruby's scoping rules are a dream compared to Python's; it support real closures, instance variables and methods with encapsulation, and coroutines that were designed for more than just iteration.<p>* Ruby and Python are equivalent when it comes to internal consistency. Python delegates virtually everything to a sprawling standard library for which there is, most certainly, ""more than one way to do it"". Calling out the difference between ""print"" and ""puts"" is particularly amusing if you know how Python handles the same distinction.<p>* Ruby has a cleaner object model than Python, where virtually every feature of the language appears to have been built by exposing the raw symbol table to the language. The simplest way to observe the difference is by taking an existing class and wrapping it with an object that catches all method invocations, a la ""method_missing"".<p>* Both Ruby and Python support keyword arguments by giving functions a dictionary type of keyword/value pairs; Ruby has the added benefit of a Symbol type, like Lisp and Smalltalk. No Ruby program fails to use them.<p>* I'm guessing about, oh, zero people on Hacker News give a shit about SAP support.<p>* I never noticed that Ruby didn't print the actual line of code that threw an exception. It's true! Python does! I never noticed that, either! That's pretty neat.<p>* Apparently, despite having been largely ported from Rails, Pylons is more mature than Rails. Awesome.",1207616274

157354,comment,157269,157269,0,0,nickb,,,"I couldn't disagree more. Having tried both platforms, I felt like I was coding with one hand tied behind my back when I was learning Python, Pylons and Django. Web tools and the stack is a lot less mature than RoR stack and the amount of various plugins/gems available for both platforms was not even close. RoR plugins were so much more mature and multitudinous that after we started planning our app, we realized that we'd have to spend about 6 months(!!!) just writing the functionality in Django/Pylons that we were getting for free with Rails. Now this was about one year ago so things might have changed.<p>Since I don't have the time to go over each point that the author makes, I'll concentrate on a couple.<p>Lack of Unicode in Ruby 1.8.x. OK, so this might have been an issue before RoR 1.2 came out but since 1.2, RoR has introduced Multibyte and has been a lifesaver. Now, I don't have a clue how many Rails Unicode apps the author has written in his career but I can tell you for a fact that Unicode is not an issue in Rails anymore. We have an app in beta that uses Unicode for every string that we handle and we handle so many strings for so many languages that your head will spin. We haven't had any huge issues with RoR's Unicode support at all. So that argument is really a moot point.<p>As for language performance, who really cares?! Programmer's time is so much more expensive than servers so the last thing I  worry these days is how fast some specialized benchmark runs. As long as the latency is acceptable and you can solve the problem by parallelizing it, the performance of an interpreter is completely irrelevant.",1207615043
157352,comment,157269,157269,0,0,tptacek,,,"Well, this was interesting. My team just finished a Rails project that used Racc extensively (with multiple different grammars), made extensive use of cryptography, and spent several weeks up on blocks being tuned with ruby-prof.<p>Obviously, it also used ranges, keyword arguments (like <i>every other Ruby program ever written</i>), strings and string conversions, blocks, private methods, and yes, even Unicode.<p>I did notice that the documentation for these features was lacking. What I didn't realize was how much Ruby sucked, compared to Python.<p>I am now steeling myself to begin typing ""self"" in front of every instance variable, write ten lines of code every time I need a ""method_missing"", fish the gettimeofday equivalent out of 19 different libraries that return and manage time, re-learn whether I want to call popen, popen2, popenN, or create a Popen class, wrap my data types up in a list when I need code to close over them, condense all my anonymous functions to single expressions to work around Python's accidental support for lambdas (which, according to GvR, are evil), write my oh-so-thread-safe-code for an interpreter that serializes around a global interpreter lock, pretend that my classes have private methods by naming them differently, just like I do in my object-oriented C code, marvel over the amazing things I can accomplish with ""generators"", continue to format strings using ""printf"" semantics the way Kernighan and Richie want me to, and track down bugs that are literally invisible due to semantic whitespace.<p>Can't.

157345,comment,157269,157269,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I haven't found the argument about backwards compatibility to be true of Python, but it has been true of Perl.  Code that I wrote 5-6 years ago in Python has needed at least three updates to run in newer versions of Python (1.5->2.0 and 2.0->2.2 and 2.2->2.4--I no longer work in Python, so I don't know if they'd need an update to run on newer versions).  On the other hand, code that I wrote ten years ago in Perl still runs unmodified on Perl 5.10.  The only major upgrade problem I've seen has been the introduction of native Unicode in Perl, which caused anything that assumed scalars to be made up of 8-bit bytes to break, but that's a pretty broken assumption, anyway.<p>So, in short, I don't think Python is exactly a paragon of backward compatibility.  It may be better than Ruby, but it isn't a solved problem.<p>I also disagree with the assessment that TIMTOWTDI is a bug.  But, me being a Perl coder may have warped my judgment.  I find Ruby very intuitive--moreso than Python, even though I've written more Python code than Ruby.<p>That said, there are some serious deal-breakers in Ruby.  Lack of Unicode is one of them.  I wasn't among the folks criticizing Arc when it didn't have Unicode at first release...but if it had gone more than a year without Unicode, I would have joined the bandwagon of critics.  And, once again, I think Perl has solved Unicode better than Python.",1207614465

Pylons is a baby Rails and Python is a baby Ruby. Language issues aside, Pylons' architecture seem to be a little cleaner than Rails, but even that advantage largely goes away with all these cleanups done in Rails 2.0.<p>Pylons/Python are more ugly and less complete than Rails/Ruby:<p>a) Ugliness: passing ""self"" to each method, deriving from Object all the time and having __foo__() method names is ugly, ugly, ugly.<p>b) Incompleteness: URL generation/routing and SQLAlchemy are too primitive and require more coding comparing to Rails. Stuff like form_for(Model.new) isn't possible as far as I can tell. Moreover, Pylons application requires a lot of bootstrapping to get going, setting up DB access is especially tedious comparing to ActiveRecrod's magic. Ralis' soft inforcement and helpers' assistance with RESTful controllers can't be seen anywhere in Pylons as far as I can tell. The list goes on: Pylons is more like a very very old Rails version distorted by ugly Python's object system.<p>Pylons probably looks pretty sweet to someone who's starting on it with a fresh head, but after two years on Rails I am less than thrilled to work with it. I may not be Pylons expert by now, but man... it's been two months and it still doesn't show me any love :-)<p>I love Python though. I like CPython implementation and quality of the libraries.

This would be just as true if the library was only available 1990s Visual Basic, and is just as irrelevant a factor in the assessment of a language as a whole.<p>Beyond the availability of some particular piece of code (in my case the tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of legacy systems that I lack the resources to replace) there is literally no excuse for using Perl or for inflicting its insanity on another hapless generation of web programmers.<p>All of Perl's admirable qualities (convenient object-literal notation, first-class functions, correct Scheme-style lexical scoping, powerful and seamless regular expressions, convenient string processing and Unix integration) are available in other languages. All of them, period. Many of these languages do not share Perl's unforgivable faults (sigils to dereference variable namespaces, contexts, typeglobs, references, dismal error handling facilities, confusing and nonstandard object facilities). The only way to use Perl to build a large system is to lean on Conway's methodology, which consists of a book that reads like an airtight indictment of Perl by one of its chief implementors and a collection of CPAN modules that demonstrate a brilliant mind with a perverse allegiance to a cult-like cause. Do sensible class hierarchies without Class::Std, I dare you. Do reasonable try-catch-finally exception semantics without Error.pm, I dare you.<p>try { ... } otherwise { ... } finally { ... }; # works\ntry { ... } otherwise { ... } finally { ... } # no trailing semicolon, oops I just clobbered your next statement and produced a catastrophic failure that even an experienced hacker could stare at for hours without seeing<p>It only takes about two hours reading 'Perl Best Practices' to realize that it's a brilliant book, written by a brilliant mind to attempt to make Perl a workable language for building large systems. It's a shame because he comes so close, but it turns out you can't rewire a language like Perl with libraries alone, even if only because you can't compel others to use them.<p>Perl is a language for expert hackers only, no one else should be allowed near it. And even expert hackers are working harder than they need to because there is a constant intellectual tax on the inconsistency of the language. It only offers a little bit more power than Python, and actually less than Ruby at a much higher cost.<p>There is no excuse for Perl in the 21st century, and you clearly have not spent time trying to use it to build large and complex systems or else you would feel the same outrage that I do than anyone would continue to contemplate it.",1207613005
