Ergonomics (such as easy portability) are very important here.  Hook up large display and maybe more comfortable keyboard/mouse when appropriate.  iPhone provides another set of ergonomic trade-offs (even more portable, interface options even more constrained).  Non-volatile storage in these devices become more of a caching mechanism over time; more and more of our data will reside on a server somewhere we never physically see.<p>Then the universe of large scale processing power and data storage is The Network.  Amazon S3/EC2 and the like.  Most people on the planet will never physically see this hardware at all.  But we use these resources constantly as we browse, interact, communicate, and work on the web.<p>So, two directions for the future of computing.  Ergonomics is King for consumer devices (Apple is thriving in this market), and economies of scale (Google the poster child here, interesting in that they do not design or develop hardware at all, but write software to make commodity hardware scale in amazing ways).",1207161344

153197,comment,152836,152836,0,0,benreesman,,,"Can someone please explain to me how REST is anything but a pompous name for HTTP? Or how it has applicability to any kind of service other than document management? All of the criteria stipulated in chapter 5 of the Fielding dissertation are spelled out in the RFCs that describe HTTP and related technologies, and _they only apply to documents_. There are other verbs that need to be applied over a network.<p>I think the (sane) pro-REST argument can be summed up in the following: 'HTTP is a wonderful way to do CRUD operations over a network. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a catchy word to remind people that HTTP has a lot more to it than most people are aware of?'. This bollocks about REST being able to replace RPC is like having an argument about whether cars of airplanes are a better way to get around. And please stop torturing your service models to look like URLs just to be fashionable (I know, if I want upmod a comment I can POST to /comment/1234/karma/new! No, 'Upmod' is a distinct verb that doesn't have anything to do with GET or POST or PUT or HEAD or DELETE). If the thing you are modeling isn't a document in any sense, then don't try to model it as one.<p>What I think people really mean when they say REST is 'ad-hoc RPC over HTTP using reasonably lightweight serialization', which is quite a lovely idea in its own right. The decision about using SOAP or a more lightweight RPC really boils down to the languages on each side of the wire. If the languages are structurally typed with object literal syntax then you want to use something lightweight, as the impedance mismatch between a literal Ruby datastructure and JSON is low. If you are connecting two nominally typed (often early bound) languages then you want SOAP, because if you're into that bondage and discipline thing then you need a WSDL to make sure that no one's boundaries get crossed. And pulling the result out of an HTTP response in Java is a lot easier with Axis than trying to parse some loosely specified JSON blob (unless you're coding in Perl, in which case I'll take the JSON blob any day).<p>Don't debate SOAP/REST, if you must have some silly religious debate between two technology stacks which are both reasonable tools well suited to certain activities then at least debate Java/Python, the appropriate choice of RPC philosophy sort of falls out.",1207160412

So that gives .333 * 7, (assuming 7x), which is approximately 2.33 times the original money invested.<p>So every year if the investment is $100 and the eventual return on it is $233, that looks like an awesome deal. Why is everyone not doing it then ?? Whenever any scheme yields more than the long-term-market-average (approx 15%(?)), it is good to ask why and how it works, if it is indeed true. My guess is that there is way more risk involved and the one-third rule is an optimistic view as well as a very simplified theory.<p>So while it could hold good for a very good VC firm, it might not for every VC firm out there.",1207159875
153194,story,,,1,0,markpeterdavis,"Raising VC: The Due Diligence Process",http://www.markpeterdavis.com/getventure/2008/04/the-due-diligen.html,"The due diligence process centers around the belief that it is more effective to assess granular aspects of a business than a business as a whole.<p>To illustrate this imagine that you are an automotive mechanic. One day a car owner drives up and asks you to appraise the general condition of his car so that he can sell it. While seeing the shiny new paint job and hearing about the make of the vehicle, mileage and performance to date will be helpful, it is simply not enough information for you to guarantee that the car will perform well in the future. In order to make that assessment, you will need to evaluate all of the aspects of the car individually. You will check the breaks, test the engine and look at the tires. And then, if each of the cars key parts and processes seem to be in good shape you can conclude that the car as a whole is likely to perform well going forward. If all the things that make up the car are in excellent condition, you can more reliably conclude that the car as a whole is in excellent condition.<p>This same logic applies to conducting due diligence on companies. Investors that simply look at the type of company, how long it has been around and how it has performed to date will typically not make as reliable judgments about the future viability of the company as an investor who takes a look at all of the individual aspects of a business that are required to create future value. The process of conducting due diligence forces investors to carefully check the competency of the management, test the strength of customer demand and look at future competitive dynamics. If all of the parts of the company are well oiled, then it is safer to conclude that the company is ready to go the distance.<p>More at www.markpeterdavis.com",1207159835
