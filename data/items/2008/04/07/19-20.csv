157147,comment,156928,156928,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I've got different advice. Don't start with a full blown web app. Getting perl and apache and a db going can complicate the issue a bit.<p>Start by simply replacing some bash scripts with perl instead. Everything you can do with a shell script, you can do better with perl. When I was starting with perl, I started replacing my init scripts with better perl verions on my Fedora system. You'll be pleasantly surprised by how much shorter and more elegant init scripts become in perl!",1207598384

157145,comment,156928,156928,0,0,rplevy,,,"I agree with the advice to read Higher Order Perl, but read Wall's (Blue Camel) book Programming Perl first. Both are fun to read, but  I found HOP much more useful after reading Wall's book.  If you don't already know regular expressions, read Mastering Regular Expressions.  Then for additional ideas try the Perl Cookbook, also from O'Reilly.  For additional inspriration along the lines of Higher Order Perl, read On Lisp by Graham, which is not about Perl, but shows how the same concepts and more are elegantly applied in Lisp.  The web documents Higher Order Javascript and the Little Javascripter are interesting if you want to also understand that Javascript, like Perl is fun in the same ways that Lisp is.",1207598327

157143,comment,157068,157133,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"I was also surprised he doesn't mention this.<p>One thing that holds true, however, is that a browser won't make another request to a single server if two requests are still outstanding. So if, say, you have a COMET connection open and a long running server side AJAX request, none of your other AJAX requests will run. This might make the interface appear to hang, regardless of how many connections your web server can handle. I would say the general idea of returning quickly is probably a good one.<p>I'm sure a lot of you have seen this already, but I love it:\n<a href=""http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html</a>",1207598276

157139,comment,156963,157012,0,0,Retric,,,"Granted there is a loss of clarity when a sub class changes a parent classes behavior.  But, there are still times where it can be useful.<p>EX: You want to add a section to an online banking app that handles IRA accounts. It would be nice to reuse as much of the logging, balance transfer, and UI as possible but you don't want to alter well tested core classes.  So you use inheritance to get something that works and is reasonably clean until you can refactor a cleaner solution.",1207597901
157138,comment,157068,157068,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Not to nitpick (because I found the rest of the article fairly interesting), but it seems like he has a poorly chosen metaphor right off the bat.<p><i>""The key to solve this problem lies in the classical definition of speed. In Physics, speed is defined as the distance divided by time required to cross that distance. So we can make the requests run faster either by decreasing the time, but we can also do it by shortening the distance.""</i><p>If S = D/T, then to increase speed while holding time constant, you'd need to <i>increase</i> distance, not decrease it. I think it would be better if we thought about the performance he is talking about as what it really is... throughput.<p>If you have a big pipe spewing water, you can increase the throughput by either increasing the pressure of the water (optimized code) or by removing the rocks in the pipe (long-running/synchronous I/O threads). (Removing said rocks increases cross-sectional area.)",1207597819

157124,comment,156963,157116,0,0,raganwald,,,"The idea that different methods can have the same name but different signatures presents many challenges. IMO, if you are going to live with the drawbacks, you ought to be able to enjoy all of the benefits, such as you will find in full-features MOPs like in Common Lisp or pattern-matching languages like Haskell.<p>BTW, Ruby and Java both solve this problem. In Java, use the @override annotation. If you are not overriding a method, you get a compiler error.<p>Ruby ""solves"" the problem by only having one method per name. But you can mix in some magic and get pattern matching if you want.",1207595964
