I learn more by writing about things than by reading about them (of course, the former includes a lot of the latter, but it's so much more productive when you're reading towards a specific goal...and if the goal is explaining the subject clearly and entertainingly you really have to have a firm grasp of the subject).  It just seems to activate my brain in ways that merely reading never quite does.  Doing the exercises overcomes the passivity of reading to some degree, but writing down what you learned takes it up another notch.",1208552166

167637,comment,166905,166905,0,0,OpenWebU,,,"In my experience, emotional pain is as much a signal as physical pain - great you are paying attention.  Research shows that sleep is an important factor in mood and overall productivity - so don't skimp on that. It also shows that friendship and social interaction is important to mood - in fact, talking about issues/being heard prevents ruminating.  And, taking breaks is very important for creativity.  Your emotions may be messaging a need to be a bit nicer to yourself.  We all relate - hope that helps.",1208551564

You acted shocked that someone would suggest that women tended to 'nest', and then brought up ducks. I have no way of knowing your intended tone. It would be very rude to assume that you were being sarcastic if you were actually a non-native speaker who was legitimately confused about the idiom. Perhaps, whether you are a native speaker or not, it is considered acceptable to make fun of people for using words when the meaning is apparent but another definition could be used where you are from. So one could say ""The music was haunting,"" and someone in your social circle could respond ""Ghosts are a silly superstition!""

We do have hundreds of diets, but if you go to a doctor and ask the question you're not going to get a nice, uniform and consistent answer.<p>From what I read and experienced over time there are some conclusions to be drawn:<p>1. Most diets are short-medium term, and for long term they're inefficient or (if at least one study is to be believed) even detrimental.<p>2. Excercise does help. The single most efficient thing you can do, with long term results and no side-effects is to build up your muscle mass. Aerob (resistance) exercise helps too, but I'm not sure yet how much.<p>3. Meta-diets are more efficient. Instead of following a certain diet, make long-term smaller changes to the way you eat. A few things you can try:<p>- Add more variety. That's btw what all the doctors say: a balanced diet is a healthy diet.<p>- Switch starting/stopping a meal from external cues to internal cues. Eat when you're hungry, not when you are offered food or the favorite show is on. Stop eating when you're full, not when the plate is empty. If you can, don't do anything when eating, like watching tv or reading. Hurts the above-mentioned internal cues.<p>- Don't base your diet on willpower. Willpower is a limited  commodity, and it's best kept for other things (really, it's cognitive science).<p>A good way of combining all of the above is to plan what you're going to eat, but not from a diet standpoint but from a gourmand one. Eat only delicious food. Eat whatever you feel like at the moment. Enjoy eating. By that i don't men stuff yourself with the same hamburgers all the time, but cook your own food and actively search new eating places and foods.",1208548870
