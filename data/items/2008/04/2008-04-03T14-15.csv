153888,comment,153548,153548,0,0,redline6561,,,"I'm going to finalize this post tonight but in the meantime I want to elucidate the main point before the discussion gets off-topic.<p>I was really trying to write more about the fact that the implementations and communities we have (which are often harped on) are sufficient. The problem is a lack of community formed around sharing code and building tools, libraries, etc which I feel could be solved by a module system. It's a sociological issue. My Common Lisp comment was off-the-cuff but not meant to be as judgmental as it sounded. As I've said, it's an impression but I'll write more about the later. Let's keep the focus on how to solve the problem of sharing code between lisps. That's what I see as the big thing holding lisps (of all stripes) back.",1207234781
153887,comment,153812,153877,0,0,0x44,,,"Unless you're implying that each Lisp interpreter is its own language, I don't think your contention really applies. If I learn Lisp on Lispworks, and go sit down at GNU CLisp, I'm not programming in a different language - I'm using a different sub-set thereof. When I sit down to a Ruby program, and then switch to a PHP script - there are fundamental differences between the two languages that transcend the library or features either provides.<p>Ralphc's point wasn't about there being a clear winner in the dynamic language space, but that each of the languages mentioned had one canonical interpreter.",1207234595

153877,comment,153812,153869,0,0,brlewis,,,"Tell me, where's the clear winner between ruby and python?  Between python and PHP?  Between PHP and Perl?  Between OCAML and Haskell?  Plenty of languages have managed to rise in popularity through a time when you didn't know if <i>any</i> of your code might run on the future winner.  At least with Lisp implementations you know <i>some</i> of your code will work with the winner.  ""Waiting for a clear winner"" is not a reason for Lisp not to grow in popularity.<p>Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby -- none of these emerged from the womb with a full-grown development environment.  They managed to grow to the point where people wrote Eclipse plugins or what have you.

153872,comment,153812,153812,0,0,edu,,,"I like Lisp a lot, and from my own experience I think that the main reasons why people dislike Lisp are <i>prefix notation and parentheses</i>.<p>Sure, my experience is only anecdotal and not at all large. But always I've tried to introduce someone to Lisp (I'm talking of about 5 people, none of them have converted...) they seem incapable to see further than the parenthesis and the prefix notation, but specially the parentheses.<p>I tried to explain them the benefits of being such a regular language, how the source code is a list which makes it really easy to do meta-programming, the power of macros, the fact that using a good text editor (Emacs + SLIME) with an excellent indentation you really don't have to care about parentheses: you follow the indentation not count parentheses!. Not to speak about the prefix notation, which they seem allergic to. But all have been in vain.<p>Lisp is so esthetically different from the other Algol-derived languages that it, simply, does not fit their brains, which I think is really a pity. Four of them are Perl programmers, being Perl their blub. They belive and act like there is no language better than Perl, they can do everything with perl. Whey I explain macros and metaprogramming they reply that Perl can do that with <i>eval</i> and <i>strings</i>. I've tried that and is, at least, sadomasochistic!<p>So, after this rant (sorry), I've to restate: the main problem people have with Lisp are <i>parenthesis</i> and <i>prefix notation</i>.<p>PS: Some of them also worship Microsoft and argue that Windows XP is the best operating system out there far better than Mac OS X (which none of them have tried for more than 5 minutes in a row), and that Linux is only good for severs. Some times I think that they suffer from severe brain damage, but apart from that they're pretty clever. So... it's an enigma.",1207233179

Generally, ideas are not viral--you'll tell someone, and then, frankly, it's not interesting enough for them to pass it on.<p>There is a place for secret sauce, it's just that the existence of the startup and it's business model is not likely to be it.

153869,comment,153812,153821,0,0,ralphc,,,"I'll throw in my 2 cents...
Up until recently, one ""flaw"" that Lisp had that other languages didn't was one obvious best implementation. If you want to work in Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, etc. you knew where to get them, and you know they would work similarly across platforms, so programs you wrote on your Mac would work on Windows and Linux, etc. With Lisp, different implementations  did the ""interesting"" stuff (threads, sockets, FFI, etc.) differently, and hackers didn't want to invest time learning one implementation if everyone else decided that a different one was the best. No one wants to bet on the loser (Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD), so they stay away until a clear winner emerges. It looks like SBCL is becoming that best implementation, and once threads work on Windows so the web frameworks will ""work"", that will help greatly.<p>Another barrier is having to learn emacs/SLIME to have a decent development environment. That is a big piece of yak shaving for the average developer. Hopefully Cusp in Eclipse or something else will help.",1207232576

153866,comment,153812,153812,0,0,aggieben,,,"My hypothesis has nothing to do with Lisp itself, per-se:<p>People simply stopped paying attention because of the failed promises of AI - and in a nod to the parent, some of the talent base probably shifted to other technologies, and Lisp was left without an ecosystem.  It's starting to build up again.<p>Beautiful case-in-point:  I went to a developer's conference yesterday put on by one of the big software vendors that my company buys from.  I was carrying a copy of PG's excellent <i>On Lisp</i> to read during dead times.  Having that book out in the open started several conversations with people I wouldn't have met, incidentally.  Each of those conversations went something like this:<p><i>He: Lisp!  Who uses that anymore?  Didn't that die out a long time ago?</i><p>Me: Well, it was big during the 80's because of AI, but it's in the middle of a comeback that started sometime around 2000.<p><i>He: really!?  I thought it was a dead language.  Who uses it?</i><p>Me: There are a few companies out there that use it.  There are even commercial offerings of Lisp tools.  There's Franz, Inc. which sells AllegroCL, for example.  There are two or three others I can think of off the top of my head.  There are some open source projects that are very active, too.<p><i>He: but it's just a scripting language, right?</i><p>Me: No, it's really a general-purpose programming language that can be used for any number of things.  It's currently being used for writing web applications, among other things, but it could be used to write any kind of software, really.  Whether or not it is interpreted or compiled is dependent on the implementation and how you want to use it.",1207232243

Why would anyone focus on the businesses, though, when they're making a perfectly rational decision -- perhaps because the media are making the perfectly rational decision to outrage their audience using weak arguments that, as an added bonus, blame the big bad businessman instead of the average consumer.<p>I also don't understand how you can say that when I cite the obvious example of Greenspan hiring women. How did he survive when everyone was complaining about his bitch of a research assistant? How do companies that hire other minorities do it? Surely someone out there should start opening white-owned laundromats, to capture the valuable racist demographic which has somehow been convinced to patronize the many Korean-owned laundry companies in the US. I would argue the same about a gentiles-only investment bank, but even if banks like that <i>did</i> appeal to prejudice, they didn't do it especially well.<p>If that's your theory, what's your answer: how is it that racism explains how one ethnic group fails, but fails to explain how other ethnic groups are more successful than the racist whites who are allegedly holding them down?",1207232032
