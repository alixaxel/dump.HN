I have a project on Google Code and so far I am happy with it.<p>I also use github, so far has not seen problems. As ruby on rails moved to git, I believe lots of open source ruby projects may follow.",1208581111

167861,comment,167848,167848,0,0,alex_c,,,"I am not a solo founder, so I am not speaking from personal experience (well, I am to an extent - I am a founder whose startup is my job, but I do have a partner).<p>I would assume that motivation is a lot easier when the startup IS your job as opposed to an evening/weekend project, even for a solo founder.  Unless you're already rich, chances are you're not doing it exclusively for fun - you're doing it to earn a living somewhere down the road, so you're racing against time.  Even if you have savings, they won't last forever, and there is always the opportunity cost ticking away in the background.<p>That's a lot of motivation, when there's no lifeline.  You sink or swim, where sinking likely means having to go back to a day job.",1208581052

167857,comment,167848,167848,0,0,cperciva,,,"How do I get funding?  I haven't -- I was introduced to one ""angel"" when I was first getting started, but the draft MOU he put onto paper had almost nothing in common with what we had discussed in person, and after that experience I realized that I didn't really need funding.  My costs are kept down by living in my parents' basement, using a 4 year old laptop, not hiring anyone else to help me out, and using Amazon Web Services instead of buying/renting discrete servers (although I spent the first 15 months writing code on my laptop before I got to the point of using AWS).<p>How do I keep myself motivated?  The same way as multiple founders do, I guess -- by telling people what I'm doing and knowing that they expect that I will succeed.  The fact that I turned down a six-figure job at Google to do this also helps keep me motivated -- I need to succeed here in order to make up for all the money I'm not earning at Google.<p>Why do I believe that this is the right way to go?  I don't think it is, for most people.  I'm unusual both in terms of my clarity of vision and my expertise in this particular area.",1208579841
167856,comment,167255,167255,0,0,nonane,,,"I've lost nearly 60 pounds in 7 months. I did that by making sure I walk for atleast 1 hour a day and changing my diet. Yes, just regular walking - no running because 15-20 minutes of running kicks my ass whereas I can walk for 1-1.5 hours without getting too tired.<p>Aside from that I've made sure I'm comfortable with my diet throughout the initial weight loss. To maintain the loss I've realized that I need to decide to change my lifestyle and my diet permanently. So that excludes diets that deprive my body off essential nutrients and which I can not maintain long-term. I've started to eat more salads for my meals - the salads always include protein (grilled chicken or grilled steak) and sometimes carbs too (sweet fruits). I always make sure my meal contains some form of veggies. I try to avoid fat and greasy things totally (but not always). For desert or just increasing my sugar level when I'm feeling lethargic I take sugar in the form of fruits - mostly apples, oranges or anything else that is sitting in the fridge. I've developed a new appreciation for fruits and veggies during the last 6 months. For breakfast I've shifted to having boiled egg whites and recently have started to include brown bread too.<p>I think the first comment hit the nail on the head - to maintain the loss you need to change your habits permanently. You should pick a routine _now_ that you are comfortable with and plan to carry it with you long term. You can keep tweaking the routine to suit your needs as you go along but anything that you can not carry with you long term should be avoided.",1208579651

167849,comment,167255,167255,0,0,makecheck,,,"I've made just a couple of simple changes, and I'm slimming down.<p>One, I now walk for a long time (1-2 hours) every few days.  I go around the neighborhood, up hills and such, so it's not a huge strain but not trivial either.  I find a 2 hour walk all at once is much better than, say, 4 days of 30 minute walks, because your body only has to ""ramp up"" once and spends most of the time at a higher metabolic rate.<p>Two, I reduced, but did <i>not</i> eliminate, the ""bad"" things from my diet, permanently.  For example, I like soda; but I drink mini-bar cans (100 calories) instead of bottles.  I'm slimming anyway; soda is <i>fine</i>, as long as you don't drink so much that there's no calories left for real food.  Sure, maybe I could slim down a week or two faster without it, but I wouldn't be happy, so why go through that? :)",1208578569

Or in other words, how do you keep yourself motivated to keep doing a startup. I'm not talking about projects that you do on the side, while you have a full-time job or are in school. I'm talking about where your startup is your job, whether you have funding or not.<p>It seems specifically hard to get funding if you are going solo. How do you go about getting funding? It also seems harder making those first key hires.<p>Why do you guys believe that this is the right way to go? Share the experience.",1208578356
