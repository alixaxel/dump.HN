177164,comment,176789,176789,0,0,donw,,,"Having read the article, I think the problem isn't that having a college degree is overrated, just that some people aren't cut out for school, and that this is okay, because there are plenty of good jobs that don't (or shouldn't) require a college education.<p>What boggles my mind is the guy in the article who spent eight years and over a hundred grand, all to end up forty-five units (three semesters) short of a degree?  I can understand taking eight years -- that's how long it took me to finish up both of my degrees, because I worked, so that I could finish school with no debt.<p>Mr. Sob Story wasn't going to college.  He partied for eight years, washed out, and now wishes he had made better use of his time.  Rather than admitting this and learning from it, he makes the university system the scapegoat for his own lack of self-discipline.",1209516595

I'm trying to move up but the company doesn't seem to want to let me. This isn't the way to turn me into an ""alumni"". Instead I'm going to be bitter at the company that gives lip service to career growth but isn't willing to put its money where its mouth is.<p>If a company wants employees to say for ten or more years, like they claim, then they need to be willing to pay up. Otherwise I would prefer the ""you will be here for three years, then move on"" talk on my starting day.",1209516287
177161,comment,176456,176508,0,0,cowmoo,,,"We were also among the group that were invited for a interview - but received at the end a rejection e-mail. As graduating college seniors, we had banked a lot on pursuing our startup idea. I spurned a offer to work at a blue chip company that would offer full-rides and time off for grad school in CS; my partner for the YCombinator application decided to skip his final presentation in a major class taught by his thesis advisor (effectively garnering an incomplete mark on his transcript and less-than-favorable reception for his future grad school recommendations) for our presentation.<p>We certainly do not blame Paul Graham for our setbacks. Our motto had always been, ""you win some, and you lose some."" We won some when we received an invitation to Mountain View. We lost some when we received a rejection e-mail from PG afterwards. But then, we won some more, when we decided to take the free advice offered by PG (think bona fide corporate consulting) and go ahead with our startup idea anyways. Thanks to YCombinator, we have learned a lot from our trip to Cali and our first presentation to VC's, that we are going to take away and put to use,<p>- The Silicon Valley is just a place. Coming from a sleepy college town on the East Coast, we relished the idea of coming to the tech mecca where everything came together. But driving down San Jose/Pal Alto on $4/gallon reminded me of the suburban sprawl/commercial park/new development of Washington D.C/Boston/Philly; riding the $12/one way VTA light rail and BART and witnessing scores of IT workers getting off at Cisco Way reminded me of the scenes of my arriving for work at BigCo, back in Connecticut. But I was reminded that unlike those around me, I didn't have a ID badge, all I had was my idea and the thrill of following through or failing with my idea. Being Silicon Valley did not dazzle me with its ""glitz,"" but my idea was still exciting to me.<p>- Doing startup's sucks, in the ""conventional sense"". As a college student, you can't help but compare yourself with your peers; I secretly maintained a secretive competitive streak with my friends, who will be going to med school/law school/wall street firms. While I have been outwardly conceding that they will be obscenely rich soon in comparison to my ""poor"" startup-wanabe self, I was hoping that getting accepted into YCombinator would put me ahead of my lame corporate-sellout friends. As an result, I poured a lot of time in writing the application and preparing our presentation. Now that we have been rejected, I relish of having the opportunity to once again, sit in my school's computer lab - late at night, coding away.<p>- How little rejections matter. We were heartbroken when we initially read the e-mail from PG on Saturday evening. But the next day when we woke up, I and my partner went our respective way's for more startup job interview's we had lined up for our trip to California. On our flight back home, we discussed how we could address on our own, the valid concerns that PG had brought up regarding our startup. When we got back to Connecticut, I fired off a e-mail to my mentor for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) that my plans for VC funding fell through, and that I will be able to work on my GSoC project full time during the summer (Any GSoC people here?). During the course of my writing this, my partner in crime caught up with me in the computer lab and showed me some of his plans for the back-end of next iteration for our startup website.<p>I've just realized how lucky I am, and how much the trip to Mountain View was worth all the time and troubles I went through.",1209516191

177157,comment,176789,177142,0,0,donw,,,"I think the disdain for academia comes from having to participate in the cesspool which 'liberal arts' have become.  The words 'liberal arts' <i>used</i> to describe someone who was skilled in both the sciences and the humanities; now it just identifies people who hated real work so much that they opted for the degree program that had 'Finger Painting' listed as an upper-division course.<p>Ok, maybe I'm being a bit hard on the Liberal Arts people, but when you busting your tail to finish classes that are actually hard, watching people coast through in easy degree programs can be very, very demoralizing; in fact, I was quite bitter towards academia for a few years because of it.<p>This almost caused me to give up on wanting to get a graduate degree, even though I love the subject, because I never wanted to become one of 'those' people, and the only thing that kept me going is that grad school is a really, really good time to try and start a company.",1209515831

My color inkjet has been sitting around for six months, waiting for me to admit that I will never fix its clogged cartridges again, because everything I print works just as well in greyscale.<p>I suppose I could use an inkjet to print color photos. But is there ever any actual reason to print a color photo at home, besides just being so old that you can't accept Flickr?

177153,comment,176789,177067,0,0,donw,,,"That is an incredibly patronizing attitude to have.  They are 'limited' because they use a very sensible method to screen applicants?<p>It is very true that not having a degree shouldn't be a bar to employment, but the process of getting that piece of paper does display a level of discipline that is very important when it comes to getting things done. I know that someone with a baccalaureate in mathematics or any of the sciences has had to work very, very hard in order to get that degree, and that they have needed to do a number of things which they considered obvious and boring, because those things were essential to getting the job done.<p>I know there are people who don't have degrees who have that sort of dedication; in fact, one of my friends fits the bill perfectly. These people will demonstrate their value in other ways, but the majority of people who blow off college are, frankly, lazy and disorganized, and often think that they are <i>much</i> more skilled than they really are.  This goes double for programmers, who already have a natural habit of overestimating their abilities.<p>From the perspective of an employer, I would think very carefully about hiring someone without a degree.  I would probably not even consider hiring someone without some college experience, unless they had a stellar work record and about a mile of ironclad references.",1209515062

177151,comment,176538,177141,0,0,drinko,,,"Thanks Erf<p>The reason that I think it is actually useful is that although joe six pack may think that facebook, myspace, friendster and second life are all social networks and therefore the same type of product, it is clear that small differences in product management have led to big differences in the real world outcomes.<p>For example: facebook/myspace (real names/screennames)
second life / facebook /friendster (imagined identity vs real identity)
myspace/facebook (self expression through profile hacks and bling/facebook apps)<p>In addition, I think that the actual products when verbalised, sound quite ridiculous. However, they have been enormously successful. There is a lesson there.<p>Finally, the video showed me how fragile the social network space really is as the cycles of innovation change. My perspective has shifted from that of a facebook fanboy to  a FB hater a la Matt Maroon, and I now think that facebook is much more vulnerable that anyone would have thought 12 months ago. This video reinforced that for me.<p>Apologies to those who felt antagonistic towards seeing this here. I think that it eloquently sums up what is often discussed on blogs like Matt's, but in a much more visual way.",1209514828

177148,comment,176866,177001,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'd interpret this differently: The fact that the industry has converged on the ""don't give significant raises unless you change jobs or job titles"" model is a subtle attempt -- perhaps even an unconscious attempt -- to implement the ""up-or-out"" model that the original submission recommends.<p>By not giving substantial raises, you're encouraging the best people to work at your company for a while and then quit. You're even giving them a good face-saving excuse to quit. It's far more amicable for an employee to say ""I'm leaving because I can get another $25 an hour across the street"" than ""I'm leaving because I've been here for three years, I've done all I can for you, and now our relationship has become dysfunctional, and you never listen to me, and I'm bored to death"". Similarly, it's easier to tell an employee ""I'm afraid we have no budget for a big raise this year -- curse our penny-pinching accountants!"" than ""You've been around for four years, your value to the company is static or declining, and we all just kind of wish you would leave"".<p>Which of these scenarios is more likely to produce happy ""alumni"" -- former employees who might be willing to network with you, refer other talented people to you, or even come back and work for your company again (presumably at a somewhat higher rate)?<p>If you <i>expect</i> your best employees to either move up or move out, pay raises are irrational. If you offer large raises to everyone that stays in the same position for five years, you're basically pouring more money into the metaphorical ""dead sea"". (This assumes, of course, that the ""dead sea"" model actually applies to your company and your industry. The model should be taken with a grain of salt...)",1209514496
