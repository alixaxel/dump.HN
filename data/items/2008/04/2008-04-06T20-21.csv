As the Harvard Lampoon's <i>A Harvard Education in a Book</i> wryly observed, ""Immanuel Kant is most famous for his great contribution to the study of ethics, which is: 'What if <i>everyone</i> did that?'""  A better summary of the Categorical Imperative, I've never seen.<p>I'll take the ants any day.  At least they wouldn't turn me in if an axe murderer showed up looking for me.",1207515292

156412,comment,156180,156222,0,0,lg,,,"within philosophy's ""core areas"" (epistemology/metaphysics/ethics) and popular subtopics (philosophy of mind/science), there's a lot of really great work (and really smart people) to learn from. You see many intricate, well-thought-out arguments, conversation with other fields, and in ethics you have the ""applied"" versions and political philosophy.  outside of those, it's a little more of a crapshoot.  philosophy of language is dropping off the radar, and logic is branching off into a field of its own.  further out, intelligent and rigorous work in, say, aesthetics or ancient philosophy is uncommon.",1207514914

The divide is between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy.  Programs strong in analytic philosophy are great.  They will provide a strong grounding in formal logic.  Continental programs, while they might have there own set of virtues, are full of bullshit.<p>This is only good news if analytic leaning philosophy departments are seeing the big half of the bump.",1207514882

I also seriously doubt eliminating lead from solder is really that important for the environment, compared to everything else we do.  It's certainly not worth the problems it will cause when our already densely-packed electronics doesn't last more than a year due to tin whisker growth.<p>On the other hand, maybe they know <i>exactly</i> what they're doing.  It's not enough that that TV will be obsolete in a few years - let's make sure you can't even use it after 2.<p>Could be good for me though:  I may one day be able to pick up TVs, computers, and all sorts of ""broken"" electronics for free; five minutes running a heat gun over the boards to melt the tin whiskers and suck them back into the solder joints, and voila! It works again.",1207513346

You can get cheap plans that include an unlimited amount of text messaging, most people don't have landlines anymore, and quite a few use their phone as their only means of hooking up to the Internet - you can get 7 mbit and free traffic pretty cheaply with your 3G phone.<p>I noticed a few of the startups mentioned here that did wireless stuff that we've seen years ago over here - there has even been a story of a startup that did a wireless location service, and was touted as super-smart and innovative. A friend of mine did the exact same thing over here back in 2003.<p>Unfortunately we have a small home market, a broken investment system for startups, and are terrible at selling ourselves.

156383,comment,156177,156355,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I think the authors ideas are less about time discounting, and more about non-linear relations in quantity of problems.<p>The authors example is a man who's car has many dents. Utility might behave like U(0 dents) = 1, U(1 dent) = 1/2, U(n >= 2 dents)=0. If a car has 5 dents, the marginal utility of repairing one dent is 0 (U(5)=U(4)), so the owner does nothing.<p>Of course, in real life, most utility functions behave in the opposite way. Going from homeless to a studio apt? Major gains in utility. Going from a studio to 1 bdrm? Nice, but not as fantastic.",1207512633
