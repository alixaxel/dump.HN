I'd like to put in a plug for one other kind of show that can be a blast: jam bands. Yeah, there are generally huge throngs of people, and yeah, lots of people are getting high. But the artists go out of their way to make the show fun for the audience, often trying out new arrangements, delving deep into the catalog, and playing interesting cover songs. Plus, the venues are often either small or full of character. It's fun seeing shows out on a lawn somewhere.<p>Also, there can be some really unexpected highlights, like the time I saw an MMW show back in '01 or '02, and nobody really knew much about this opening artist named Norah Jones because her album hadn't really taken off yet. Highlight of the show: MMW backing her in a version of the Sly and the Family version of ""Que Sera, Sera.""",1208118574

Of course I haven't used SimpleDB personally and perhaps people have found a way around that limitation.",1208118508

I'm usually so bored a quarter the way through I start skimming looking for some point worth reading.  Paul's writing on the other hand is of a much higher quality, doesn't assume the reader is so dense that he needs to keep hammering on the point, and recognizes that I don't care about fluff, but look for the meat.  Yeggi thinks every though he has is worth reading, Paul knows better.",1208118018

It seems that 95% of the public are really ""artists"" (not that you could tell from anything other than the passion of the aesthetic opinions) just working to pay the rent.",1208117382
