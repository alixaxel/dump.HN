If I can push through it and get something done, that might pick me up, but more often it's a signal that I need to take a break and get off the computer (things like reddit or stumbleupon don't count as a break, they just turn my brain into mush).",1208490673

But I do get tired and unmotivated now and then.<p>When I catch myself procrastinating, I just say ""OK, I'm going to procrastinate for the next 30-60 minutes"". Then I set the timer and goof off without guilt. When the timer rings, I go back to work.<p>Minimal exercise is really important: some stretches/calisthenics in the morning, occasionally pushups or pull-ups as 5-minute breaks.<p>My social life is limited, but I see my girlfriend every day and that helps a lot.",1208490330

166939,story,,,3,7,amrithk,"PHP coding question",,"To all PHP hackers out there, \nI have a basic PHP question. The application I am working on currently allows a user to upload a jpeg or gif image only. My code for enforcing this rule is as follows:<p>if($type!=""image/gif"" || $type!=""image/jpeg""){\n				$error = ""Your image needs to have a gif or jpeg format"";\n			}<p>$type in this case is obtained from $_FILES['file']['type']<p>However, this does not seem to work. Non-JPEG images get rejected properly. However even JPEG images are rejected. Any ideas on how I can check the type of the image.",1208490025

A lot of these are really cool, but now that I've started having to collect these things and refer back to them, the non standard ones have a tendency to get pretty annoying.  In particular, the smaller cards (there seem to be a lot of people with the same size small cards...) have a tendency to get lost amongst all the standard sized cards.  The other thing that can be really annoying is cards that you can't write on.  Either they are dark on both sides, or too glossy, or whatever -- if you can't write down a note on the card, it becomes significantly less useful.",1208489965

The largest (known) Rails site isn't even in the top 500!<p>I'm curious how this compares to other technologies. Someone should write a script that crawls the top sites attempting to detect the technologies they're built on.<p>I can think of a few heuristics, like URL patterns and file extensions (.php, etc) and cookies (PHPSESSID for PHP, _session_id for Rails, JSESSIONID for J2EE, etc)",1208489666

166928,comment,166905,166905,0,0,pg,,,"Writing is much like being a single founder.  I find the single most important thing is to be aware of how motivated you are, and to adjust the work accordingly.  If you try to work on hard stuff when you're low, you'll just procrastinate.  But if you start working on easy stuff, getting something done will put you into a better mood, and you'll be able to move on to harder stuff.<p>Hemingway used to leave something easy unfinished in the evenings, so he had something to start with in the mornings. That works for me too, with both writing and hacking.",1208488895

It's likely your moods will be out of phase, so that when one is down the other can be the motivating force and vice versa.<p>Also accept the fact that doing a startup is an emotional roller coaster - one day you will believe you are about to take over the world, the next you will wonder why you are wasting your time.

I've found recently that when i don't want to code, it's because i don't understand something. I've been picking up a pencil and paper and just working out things i'm nervous about a lot more often lately. it's been a nice productivity boost.<p>2. avoid crap that will piss you off to no good effect. I read reddit.politics from time to time and lose an hour just grumbling over some comment. huge waste of time.<p>3. i like running. i don't do it often enough... but a couple of miles will really turn down the volume on the rest of the world. very nearly a reset button for me.<p>4. by all means, stay up late and hack. However, for me, more than once a week is very detrimental. Sometimes, it's worth being a little slow the next day.",1208488492

Experience has taught me that an hour on the wrong task is better than an hour wasted procrastinating the right one.  Eventually my motivation will return to whatever it was that I <i>should</i> have been doing, and at least then there's not a pile of stuff that's accumulated.<p>As for frustration ... dancing.  Seriously.  I tend to go out dancing once a week and just shut off my brain, chat with my friends and forget about everything productive for a few hours.  It just helps me reset.",1208488078

You get all the functionality of pretty much <i>any</i> Java library out there for free, without all the cruft of Java.<p>However, I did a quick benchmark of Rhino, Spidermonkey, and JavaScriptCore (WebKit's engine) and jscore beats the crap out of Spidermonkey and especially Rhino. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was something like this:<p><pre><code>    JavaScriptCore: 0.5 seconds\n    Spidermonkey: 3 seconds\n    Rhino: 6 seconds\n</code></pre>\nTo be fair, the benchmark was very specific to the project I'm working on and involved a lot of regex and string manipulation. Rhino's regex implementation is known to be pretty slow.",1208487869
