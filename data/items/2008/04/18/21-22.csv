There is little chance the treadmill will actually last through 5 years of 5-8h daily usage, so I expect to get my value out of the extended warranty.  The whole thing cost about $950 delivered.  Far less than a treadmill that's actually built to tolerate this sort of long-term usage.",1208554902

TechStars hasn't yet proven they can provide significantly better outcomes for their startups...they might, but they haven't done it yet.  YC has definitely proven they provide better outcomes, and Silicon Valley and Boston are both better places to start a tech company than Colorado (though Boulder is lovely--too cold for me, but many folks like it).  Of course, having neither backing you is probably an even worse likely outcome...so maybe it's not such an easy choice, after all.<p>But, if you make it to the interview with YC your odds of getting in are quite high (greater than 30%, certainly, and probably closer to 50%).",1208554166

167673,comment,167255,167255,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I gained 40 pounds over the course of 3 years working at a startup. I lost this weight in three months by hiring a personal trainer. She helped me design a diet and exercise plan.<p>The exercise plan involved a lot of balance, stretching and unconventional weight training. For instance, rather than just pumping iron, the trainer had me do things like stand on a wobbly platform and lift ""kettlebells.""<p>Prior to getting fat, I was relatively athletic and went to the gym regularly. I would use the treadmill and lift weights. The new training methods my trainer introduced were much more effective than what I was doing on my own, and I'm now much stronger and more flexible than I ever have been in the past.<p>I highly recommend this approach if you are serious about getting into shape. Look for a trainer who is into balance, flexibility, ""core fitness"" and who knows something about nutrition. Most hackers I know are very DIY-independent and are skeptical about hiring someone to help them achieve goals. I am this way, but I found that having a trainer really helped me much more than I was able to achieve on my own.",1208553890

I've found Django's documentation to be ok, but often outdated and non-comprehensive. The development team is still making changes that break backwards compatibility (example: the changes to how to enable the admin interface for a model), and these changes are not always reflected in the documentation.<p>Django's as the potential to be a great framework, but it's still very immature. The fact that large parts of the framework get rewritten makes me think Django's not ready for someone to be the ranch on.",1208553243

AdUni provides a full series of video lectures and quite a bit of course material.  Nearly all of the AdUni.org stuff is awesome (though the ancient Abelson and Sussman lectures are far better than the Yanco lectures at AdUni.org) and a great supplement to self-study.  It's mostly taught by MIT grad students (which is what you'd get if you were taking the courses at MIT, so not a bad deal).",1208553034

I ordered the DVDs a couple of years ago and acquired all of the recommended texts (the ones that aren't available for free online, anyway), but only got through a few of the early SICP classes before getting sidetracked by other projects.  This has inspired me to dig back in.  I'll copy a few of them over to my lappy and head out to the park or a coffee shop--I'll enjoy the gorgeous weather and get some studying done.",1208552556

There are a lot of films produced here that make it into festivals that are produced on grants of under €20k.  If it were done in connection with a rethinking of the way that films are distributed and was done all digital rather than using real film stock, I think you could produce some interesting results for relatively cheap.",1208552500
