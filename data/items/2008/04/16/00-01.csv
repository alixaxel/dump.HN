A site that provides information may not want the information to be indexed.<p>For example, an escort girl's website may just want to show portfolio of pictures to her potential clients, but she will not want Google to index them.<p>Information is to be consumed by human. Sometime we may just want to keep machines to access it.",1208307388

That presupposes they used to be there, but left.<p>No, it's always been like this, modulo the foolhardy dot-com bubble.<p>The thing is, there are two types of potentially successful start-ups.  The first kind is start-ups that have the talent and capability but who, if they don't get a helping hand, will quietly fizzle out.<p>My impression is a lot of YC groups are like this; getting into YC determines whether they <i>go for it</i> or just stay in school, for example.  If Reddit didn't get in, would they be millionaires now?  The risk here isn't YC missing the boat, but the boat never departing in the first place.<p>The second type is the start-up where they are <i>going</i> and you had better get on board or get out of the way.  Steve Jobs personifies this approach.  Jobs would beguile, needle, browbeat, or otherwise force the issue or pressure anyone he needed to get things done.<p>Ironically some VC successes aren't based on their BOLD choices so much as being strong-armed into getting over their risk aversion by someone like Jobs.",1208306584

Well... no.<p>That's where 2% of the money is. Maybe 5%. Out there, in the big wide world, there are tens of thousands of other lifestyle niches, other places to see. Take a look at that Nokia guy's blog,<p><a href=""http://www.janchipchase.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.janchipchase.com/</a><p>Nokia pays him to wander around the world learning about people and how they use things including but not limited to cell phones.<p>The whole B2B boom, just before the .com bust was a moment of insight... ""wow, people outside of the home shopping by internet niche can use the internet to buy things.""<p>So. Ideas.<p>First thing, get the hell out of San Francisco. Stay away from TechCrunch. Go to Iowa or Brazil. Spend two weeks walking or bicycling around. Call it a vacation. If you take a computer, don't look at your usual sites, turn off your RSS feeds, don't take work email. Put yourself in a new state of mind and then, if money is the goal, ask yourself ""what would these people like their computers to do?""<p>But the space of ""software for technohip 20somethings"" is heavily swamped right now. It's a saturated, clogged, grossly overfilled demographic.<p>You want a freebie? An integrated software/hardware/services combo for old people's homes. Does email to help residents talk to their families, prints out pictures when they are sent automatically so people can take them back to their rooms, reminds people of calendar obligations like their grandchildren's birthdays. Maybe even supports some kind of mediated e-commerce which has a credit card account which can only be spent at a known-good list of a couple of hundred stores, so that they can't get phished.<p>Yes, it would take some selling, but the improvement in quality of life for the residents, and for their families is not insignificant, and business is booming for old people's homes.<p>Get out of your demographic. That's where the money is.",1208306321

164703,comment,164109,164463,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If it's for digital devices, your next set of cables ought to be the cheapest ones you can find that meet the spec that you'd like them to support.  It is pointless to buy fancy cables--in digital, it either meets the spec and works, or it doesn't meet the spec and fails to work.  More than 10 bucks for pretty much any short-run cable would be nuts.  HDMI 1.3 spec (the kind that'll carry 1080p and even higher) cables can easily be found for under 10 bucks.<p>Even in analog signals, a quality pure copper cable of sufficient gauge with quality connectors put together correctly, is all that matters.  All of the BS from Monster Cables (and other ""boutique"" cable vendors) has clouded the market with ridiculous nonsense.  Blue Jeans Cables appears to eschew that nonsense, and build quality ""normal"" cables.  They are a little pricey, but not terrible, I guess...maybe two to six times the price I'd pay, vs. the 10 to 100 times Monster charges.  What amuses me is that if you were to buy one of the ""low end"" Monster cables (which are relatively small gauge), it would perform measurably worse than bulk 10 or 12 gauge copper cabling from an electronic parts outlet and cost significantly more.",1208305568

164690,comment,164506,164613,0,0,Shooter,,,"I think people are assuming that he is working on a startup exactly like they are (the same equity structure, type of business, roles, etc.)  The author really isn't very clear about what he contributes or how anything is structured.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, although his second bullet point does make me nervous.  He may have a performance-based equity arrangement...who knows?  Some programmers are 10X as effective as others supposedly, right?<p>""You think you're that much more effective than other founders that you can pull it off part-time?""<p>Well, I do.  I'm not the author, but I have a similar approach in regard to his first bullet point.  I may have a different structure (I hire employees with equity more often than I work with 'cofounders', and I have a somewhat formal VC-ish corporate structure with outside investors for each project, but 95% of the software/internet related ideas we execute are mine, and I'm actively involved in every aspect of the companies.)  I think the difference between our approach and that of most startups is related to this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Myth</a>  The need for 'monomaniacal' focus from every cofounder is largely a result of having limited resources...if you can't afford an attorney, you have to learn to do it yourself.  If  you can't afford a designer, you have to learn to do it well yourself.  And so on.  You have to be a Jack-of-All-Trades out of necessity.<p>But, once you've had a financial success or can line up backers based on your past experience, you can focus on marketing, innovation, and strategy.  You work ON your business instead of IN your business, as the saying goes.  I don't worry about cross-browser compatibility anymore.  I have an expert for that.  I don't worry about A/R, I have people for that.  I don't worry about log analysis, and so on.  I'm capable of doing those things and I know what to look for to monitor that things are running smoothly, but it is not a good use of my resources to actually do those things.  There are people that are better than me at all of those things.  I DO monitor the systems and deliverables of my coworkers, but I don't get lost in the nitty gritty details.  I work on the things that I think matter the most for success. I occasionally do things I shouldn't (such as write production code) because I enjoy them, but I really wouldn't if I were optimizing everything.  You'd be amazed at what you can accomplish when you aren't bogged down in minutiae.  Once you have systems in place, you can really scale your expertise across a number of companies.<p>I think my employees, cofounders, and investors are happier with this structure than they would be otherwise...but I KNOW they are  wealthier because of it.",1208304266
