Someone did a test of various compression tools and found that while they had wildly varying sizes <i>before</i> GZipping, they all came out to roughly the same size after GZip, except that I think raw+GZip was a bit bigger than JSMin/Packer/YUICompressor+GZip.  So there's no reason to pay the extra decompression & debugging overhead that Packer entails.<p>You'll probably want to concatenate all your JavaScript files together to save on HTTP requests.  I wrote a dependency analyzer that reads dependency info off the JSDoc and automatically topologically sorts them to get the correct ordering.  I'll probably open-source it and put it on the web when I get a chance to do some code cleanup and documentation.<p>I don't use anything for CSS; I probably should, but it hasn't been a big problem.  I've heard that Dreamweaver will automatically remove whitespace for you, but I get annoyed by that kind of munging, and my guess is that GZipping will eat up all the bulk anyway.  Just follow all the normal rules about factoring your CSS for maintainability - you want to actually think about what you're trying to accomplish, and assign rules based on the semantics of the page.  The worst CSS bloat I've seen has come from coders just copying & pasting some CSS example off the web whenever they have a problem.  Understand what you're doing & don't cargo-cult.<p>HTML is easy: use semantic HTML, understand what you're doing, don't add superfluous tags or attributes unless you need them.  And GZip it, of course.  I've never known HTML to be a problem, bandwidth-wise, unless you're serving up massive amounts of content.",1208370807

165411,comment,165276,165387,0,0,nikiscevak,,,"Paul, why do you call the firms clones? Aren't you a clone of a seed stage incubator? I absolutely love what you do but to say that there are clones in the investment world (where there is zero scale) is a weird way of looking at the world. You probably have enough money to fund every good idea in each intake but you certainly don't have the time to spread out across those ideas. So if you have inspired more capital to come into this stage then surely that is a good thing for founders?<p>If there is competition, then founders only win out in the end. If someone was 'pressured' into accepting before other options played out that should be a huge signal to the founder that the firm is less than desirable.",1208369264

I guess I'm just not quite clear on the downside of growth outside of this community; more useless comments?  Comment spam?  I also wonder if blocking those Yahoo and MSN crawlers would make it harder for them to compete with Google, because I consider competition a good thing.  Eventually, by allowing them access, they may continue to improve their search product.<p>Perhaps most importantly, I worry that blocking these crawlers might be seen as a political statement against Yahoo and MSN, one which they might take into account when considering the acquisition of a ycombinator funded startup.<p>-- Fred",1208369225

If the business is not capital intensive there's no real reason to go public, growth market or not.<p>I see nothing wrong with focusing on the ""flip"" if the business fundamentally needs a lot of capital or a big parent company.  But nobody ever even mentions dividends or buybacks at private valuations.  It indicates to me that people are most focussed on taking advantage of a possibly irrational market rather than building real businesses.",1208368987

165401,comment,165279,165316,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Not evil at all.  Letting someone crawl your site is a business decision.  If you think the resource cost on your servers is worth the added traffic that the search engine can send, then go for it.  For this site, I would guess the resource cost is more (because of storing continuations) and the benefit of traffic is less (since pg doesn't even want it).  Therefore, it's a good decision on pg's part and Yahoo's loss.",1208368874

Getting good people to work doing software stuff at a non-software company is much harder, I'd say.  Even if you had great working conditions and got to use innovative processes and technology to do things, which not many non-software companies do, you're still going to get hit the ""talent attracts talent"" problem.<p>Talented people want to work with other talented people; otherwise it's a vicious cycle where the best people leave and cause the rest of the good people to leave, and new good people that come in don't want to stick around.  The only real way to combat it is to start with a bunch of talented people and then keep your standards high; otherwise, the feedback loop spins you down towards mediocrity in a hurry.",1208368842
