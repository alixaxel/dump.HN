164769,comment,164506,164613,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"In response to your point: <i>Doesn't seem that eccentric except the first bullet point.</i><p>The eccentricity stems from the extreme adherence to the principles.  Like I said in the post, “I think a lot of entrepreneurs follow these principles to some extent, at least some of the time. But I take their adherence to the extreme.  And I think that is where the sustainable competitive advantage actually arises.”  Some examples:<p><i>Do as much as possible, myself.</i> Startups usually silo tasks functionally, even if all co-founders are somewhat exposed (via emails/meetings/etc.).  Usually X is primarily responsible for sysadmin, Y for the ""front-end"", Z for ""marketing"" or whatever.  Not so with me.  I'm in everything 100%.  I also am quite reluctant to outsource things that other startups usually outsource, and it has helped me in the past in countless ways (scale easily, get to optimal configurations quicker, generate innovative ideas faster, etc.).<p><i>Question everything, all the time.</i> Startups usually move on when things are done, at least until the next “major revision.”  For example, a team may do the “design” of this page or that, and then not touch it for quite a while.  I consciously try to think about everything as much as possible, and I tweak little things (like individual words, a pixel here a pixel there) all the time.  It is a much more rapidly iterative process.<p><i>Only trust data.</i> Startups generally are not doing A/B testing and other experiments all the time.  But they should.  And I do so whenever I have the sample size to get meaningful results.  And even if not, I try to change things up and get anecdotal evidence to point me the right direction.  Again, I mean even down to little tweaks, like one word changes and their impact on various conversions.  I think this is an essential part of moving to optimal solutions faster.<p><i>Don't seek funding unless there is a good reason for doing so.</i> Startups generally take some money to pay for salaries and what not.  Not me.  It has to be a “good reason.”",1208310903

164741,comment,163552,163552,0,0,JamesMitchell,,,"As noted above, the VC firm Charles River has a seed fund that invests $250,000 per deal:<p>www.crv.com/AboutCRV/CRVQuickStartFAQ.html<p>This is a brilliant idea! Ycombinator has been a true innovator -- they saw a gap in the capital markets, they had the guts to go out and fill it, now a lot of guys are copying what they do, but they will always enjoy first mover advantage. Charles River is doing the same thing, filling a gap that everyone knows exists but no one so far has actually filled.<p>One of my reactions to the Ycombinator standard approach -- $15,000 for 3 months of funding -- is that 3 months is a very show time frame. I am pretty good at what I do, I frankly have a lot more experience than the kids who get Ycombinator funding, I typically work about 70 hours a week, and I know I am quite productive at what I do. I don't go for home runs but at the same time, I don't go for singles. I go for doubles, that is a risk/reward range I am comfortable with. I find it takes about 12 months to get it running reasonably well, and I have done it several times before. I would not want to work on a 3 month time schedule. If I did, I would be going for singles and singles just are not that interesting.<p>To me, a single is a deal where you end up with $1 million cash out after two years. A double is $5 million after two or three years. A triple would be north of $10 million, no later than four years. Anything north of $25 million is a home run. Anything above $100 is a grand slam home run.<p>I do not need financing, I just fund them myself, but if I did, the Charles River deal would be much more appealing. Assuming I needed the money, with $250,000, I could get two partners, we each pay ourselves $60,000 a year, perhaps burn  up another $50,000 in expenses in one year, for a total burn of $230,000,leaving us $20,000 margin (admittedly, not a lot). But in one year with two really good partners, we could do a hell of a lot of work, perhaps a triple rather than a double.<p>I really like what Ycombinator is doing but so many of their investments seems unambitious -- two smart college students who whipped something up in a month. Perhaps they might build a company from that, but in some cases, I am skeptical.<p>James Mitchell\njmitchell@kensingtonllc.com",1208309239
