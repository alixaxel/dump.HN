Having made many contacts when in Japan, all the work is now done over the web in an apartment in Jerusalem.<p>I do web development, but I find that meeting people over the web to do this is not easy.  Anybody could be anywhere and trust is a problem.  Some people have a talent for self promotion, and some don't.  The web is loaded with self promoters and spammers.  Standing out on the web is hard.  Business tends to be about personal relationships and personal trust.<p>I observe that the people who make contacts on the web are very talented bloggers.

The STL and Boost make C++ feel almost like statically typed python, (while occasionally driving you mad with pages full of template errors).<p>An example (g is a graph):<p><pre><code>  list<Edge> to_remove;\n  BOOST_FOREACH( Vertex v, vertices(g)){\n    if (degree(v,g) > 2){ //Try to remove some ambiguity\n      BOOST_FOREACH(Edge e, out_edges(v,g)) { \n      ...Do some euclidean geometry...\n      if (...Geometric constraint not satisfied...){\n         to_remove.push_back(e);\n         }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  BOOST_FOREACH(Edge e, to_remove){\n    remove_edge(e,g);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis is almost a direct translation of what I'd write in python (if python had graphs as a data structure), except of course that to_remove is a list <i>of edges</i>.<p>Some people insist on programming C++ like it is c. I.e., they will build an <i>array</i> (hoping it's big enough, sometimes they will even error check if it's not), cast the edges to int's, keep track of how many array members represent edges and how many do not.

It's OK if it's a focused need, so long as you're not addressing a market which is <i>too</i> small. The world of people who research online is big enough. The world of Web 2.0 developers is not.<p>b) Careful listening to user feedback. Often users of one of my products have given me an inkling of the need for another. This will happen if (1) the original product works well, (2) the new product appeals to a similar audience, (3) you make it easy for people to give you feedback, and read it religiously and with empathy.<p>c) Being in-the-know about breaking trends. Make sure you regularly read (or at least skim) some high quality international publications. I read The Economist cover-to-cover every week, along with BusinessWeek.

I've been a part of 2 consulting startups and 1 product startup, and most recently raised a Series A for my company.  I know of many startup companies in Dallas, but the scene is very different from Seattle and the Valley.  VC money is non-existent, with a few exceptions.<p>While many companies are started in Dallas every year, most of them are focused on non-software industries.  On the software side, here are a few current ones I know about:\n1) Swarmforce is a content system using swarm AI\n2) Roov is a social network for the faith community\n3) MileMeter sells auto insurance buy the mile\n4) Viewzi provides view-based search<p>A list of some others can be found at <a href=""http://www.texasstartupblog.com/2007/12/17/founders-in-dallas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texasstartupblog.com/2007/12/17/founders-in-dalla...</a><p>A good way to get involved in the Dallas software startup community is to visit Refresh Dallas, Dallas BarCamp, and Dallas.rb   Reading texasstartupblog occasionally provides insight to a new local company.",1208356543
165165,comment,164560,164560,0,0,taylorbarstow,,,"There is a reason why the web 2.0 social apps that you cite are so impressive - it's because they were made to ""scratch an itch"".  Indeed, they were made by the very people who use them day in and day out.<p>Note that this pattern is seen at the sub-application level as well, in the emerging agile frameworks like Rails and Merb, where developers got fed up with the old way and decided to create a new way instead.<p>So how do we bring this to business?  How do we break through the metaphorical gate?<p>First we have to realize that this ""scratch an itch"" pattern simply cannot play out in business exactly as it does in the social web.  There are two reasons for this:<p>1. Business people - i.e., the people with an itch to scratch - are generally not programmers on the side\n2. Even if they were programmers on the side, the applications are so big that if they decided to start programming one, they would have no time for their day job!<p>So how can we (a) know enough about the space we are working in and (b) think enough like our users to build compelling, user oriented business applications?<p>To my mind the answer is both simple and obvious: by involving the customer as often as possible.  Only by getting feedback can we fill the gap between users and developers.  And the more often we get feedback, the better.  Here we converge on the agile methodologies that have seen a rise in the past 6-8 years.<p>Couple this with a startup that is fun to work for, and that attracts the smartest, most creative web developers, and you just might have a solution.<p>Of course there's still one missing piece: a couple of passionate founders who can attract that kind of talent to this kind of software business.  I guess that's left up to the reader, as an exercise.",1208356440
