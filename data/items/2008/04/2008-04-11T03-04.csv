I use git exclusively for all my work now (and use git-svn to integrate with others at work that use svn). Some of the benefits are:<p>merge tracking: this will also come to subversion in the future (but you'll have to migrate your repository)<p>having the entire repository checked out locally for offline use (being able to code on the train on the way to work is great)<p>fast branches - branches are really fast, especially since they're done locally, and there's basically no excuse for not quickly creating a branch when you want to try something out, and merge tracking<p>forking other open source repositories (including svn and cvs ones) for hacking and maintaing patches (until they get accepted upstream). git is nice and will attempt to always rebase your patches off the latest HEAD (and let you resolve conflicts if they occur).<p>git bisect for binary searching for the revision that broke something (can do a binary search over revisions to find out which revision broke a certain test).<p>did I mention that it integrates with svn?<p>git svn clone <a href=""http://svnrepo.com/trunk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnrepo.com/trunk</a>

For example, I am currently working on a project in which all the developers are solely interested in working on the software; as a result, the website hasn't been updated in 7 years, and up until recently the Windows and Mac download links were buried somewhere in a wiki page. I recently put in a few days' work to redesign the site, and I think the impact of this redesign will be pretty big.<p>It has been very satisfying to work on this project, and I'm looking to find others that could use some help. Can you guys think of other projects like this, especially those that have websites that scare off or confuse new users?",1207885499

160689,comment,160408,160508,0,0,Goladus,,,"I rarely used Yahoo, but I used metacrawler.  It claimed to gather results from a half dozen different engines.  But it was still a fundamentally different way of using the web.  When I first started using the internet, which was when I was in high school, I'd log in, go to a search engine, and just think of something to type in.  I'd just go exploring, basically.  I'd gather a big list of websites and visit them one at a time, generally reading each one.  I was young, and absorbing information like that was easy and I enjoyed it.<p>As I gradually shifted from browsing aimlessly towards finding something specific, I began to appreciate Google's advantages of speed and reliability.  The only time I ever tried another engine after trying Google was if I didn't find what I was looking for.  That wasn't very often, and usually the other engines didn't turn up anything interesting either, so I gave up after awhile and just used Google for everything.",1207885166

In fact, I bet up to 50% of the people on this board couldn't name the capital of America's largest trading partner.<p>It's not so much the random facts that are the issue. If you're not interested in the Middle East because you think the conflict is self-perpetuating, you might not bother to remember that Jordan sits between Israel and Iraq.<p>The problem is that many people just don't know how to think. That's the meat of the matter, and it's certainly not being exaggerated by the author.<p>Take a look at my question: The people on this board in large part will think that the obvious answer would be Beijing. They're also smart enough to deduce that I probably wouldn't have suggested that 50% wouldn't know it if the answer was that simple. So they'll examine what they know about the US's trading relations, and probably remember NAFTA. If they also know that Canada is in the G8, they'll conclude that the answer would be Ottawa. Those in the south might lead towards Mexico, but at least they're thinking.<p>That's what's lacking with many people today, primarily because it isn't taught by parents and more importantly, at any level of our education system.",1207884093

160677,comment,160613,160613,0,0,gcv,,,"The author makes a decent argument, but I don't think he addresses the entirety of the issue.<p>Scaling a database has two components: reliability, and performance under heavy load. Accomplishing these goals typically requires some form of redundancy, but few RDBMSes give developers and administrators any tools to accomplish anything except dumb read-only replicas. Even Oracle RAC, a high-end commercial product, provides no data redundancy; it just lets multiple database servers talk to the same physical database. This means that, with lots of money to throw at RAC backed by a SAN, not to mention a team of admins to run the whole thing, you can scale up and not worry about data loss. Hopefully.<p>A team which doesn't have 1M USD a year to spend on storage software, hardware, and support, but still must store large datasets, must spend a lot of time partitioning the data and working around the problems inherent in querying it out of multiple database servers. And frankly, that stinks. That's why I personally think RDBMSes don't scale: because, as a tool, they utterly fail to save me time and effort in achieving scalability.<p>I'm very impressed with how fragmented Mnesia tables work: you tell Mnesia how many replicas and fragments you want, add enough nodes to fulfill your requirements, and it takes care of pushing enough copies of your data to enough nodes for things to fly. That's how a database should work these days.<p>I agree with the author that simplifying data access and reducing the number of ridiculous joins (I've worked on an app which normalized its data to the point that it needed an 8-way join before anything would work at all) is important. However, even once you do that, operating on anything where all the code which talks to the database has to traverse the entire cluster and aggregate results at the application level is not good. That's one reason I think GAE is quite attractive.<p>Let's see if MySQL 5.1 brings any improvements to the table, and if they come with strings attached.",1207883761
