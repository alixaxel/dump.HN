153722,comment,153080,153309,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> the US is a definitive leader in pharma, entertainment, technology, and education.<p>The technology claim is a bit dodgy.  The US runs a net trade deficit in all categories of scientific and industrial equipment.  The US has a few pockets of highly valued intellectual property, but even this edge is slipping away.  Pharma has big profits from activities in the US, because Americans have turned sedentary gorging and subsequent suicide pill popping into a subsidized national past-time.  I wouldn't put this under the ""strengths"" category.<p>The US is not a metaphorical man on an island.  It is is a nation of wage earners.  The best way to thing about the big picture situation is to simply observe that 200 years ago the average working man earned more or less the same wage anywhere in the world.  Then the West shot ahead.  Now this disequilibrium is being corrected, and it's fairly easy to argue that real wages in the West will fall and it won't be rising wages all 'round.  There isn't sufficient iron in the earth's crust to support the car owning standard of living the whole planet now aspires to.  As global wages rise, Americans will be priced out of their current standard of living.",1207205930

The same sentence caught my attention.<p>I can only speak for the East Coast, and in microeconomic terms, but Google has definitely put a hurt on the market here. They are worse than all of the banks put together. The cream of the crop here---people who are too smart to veg out in a bank---are more than willing to go to Google, when they would otherwise be furthering some smaller and more important project, be it a startup, or just something else useful and in real need of a bright, computer-oriented mind. They're all funneling into Google. Google got them all right out of college, and they're probably going to keep them.<p>You cannot argue that we are better off this way. Google certainly is, but as a whole we are going to lose out. Clumping all those people together is not going to improve technology. It's going to make it worse, because there's a huge opportunity cost in taking all these people and sticking them in a mill. That's just how software works. If they were out in little groups in a lot of different areas, they could be making a huge difference. Google doesn't need 10,000 engineers who know Bellman-Ford and Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Miller-Rabin. It's too much overlap. And Google certainly isn't providing offerings in a quantity great enough to justify the overlap. They've hired well---too well---and now they're going to be having a great number of these people performing well below where they would if they were arbitraged out to somewhere else. The benefit of adding just one of these engineers to a smaller shop is incalculably higher than the benefit of giving him to Google.<p>That efficient asset allocation, and the providing of liquidity, have been grossly exaggerated in terms of their benefit to society in order to justify the poaching Wall Street does each year, is a truth generally acknowledged. Trading makes a few people much richer, but it does not make <i>us</i> richer, not in equal part. In fact, if you want to get nasty about it, the latest round of bailouts is costing us a great deal...<p>Now we've traded the Wall Street problem for the Google problem. Do we really need the top sliver of our graduates working on destructively taking market share from PayPal? Or fighting black-hat SEO fueled and exacerbated by the search-monopoly problem they created? Or contributing to an advertising arms-race at a growth rate much higher than that of the underlying market?<p>What project are they pushing forward that could possibly justify sitting on all this talent? I feel like if it was anything suitable I would've already heard of it by now.",1207205914

153711,comment,153253,153592,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK, the single biggest problem is there's way too much happening.  Do you really need SEVEN tabs for each trend?  I can discern no difference between four of them (overview, the pitch, the buzz, in depth)...they all seem pretty much like the same thing.  And, if you're a socially generated site, isn't it ALL talk?  You should probably have no tabs and a simpler view all-around.  If you do have tabs, maybe just ""Media"" and ""Talk"" with the first page remaining ""Overview"".  All of that other stuff just seems to just be people making a few random ""Yeah, my idea is awesome!"" comments.  If you want people to have that kind of ownership, maybe let them have personal profile pages where they can just say ""Yeah, I'm awesome!"" and then let the trends stand alone with just the talk and media.<p>Likewise for the front page...""What's Next?"" and ""The Wire"".  I can't even begin to guess what the difference between the two concepts might be.  Too much going on, and I'm just confused.<p>But, if your users can make sense of this stuff...maybe I'm just too old.  But I'm definitely very confused, and often irritated about not finding the interesting bits easily.  As I mentioned, the Browse page is actually pretty cool...and made me want to click through.  But once I clicked, I regretted it, as I didn't find what I wanted to find on the other side.  (Partly because idiot users are not interesting, and partly because I was just overwhelmed by the number of links off to nothing...one can more safely assume that half of the tabs will lead to empty pages than that they are worth clicking.)",1207204691
153710,comment,153080,153678,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> Dollar devaluation: It's actually a good thing for the US economy and the US consumer<p>I agree with everything but this claim about the falling dollar as a benefit.  The falling dollar is a way to default on international debts.  It is also outright theft from those who have saved in dollars.<p>This idea that a falling currency means boosted exports is empirically challenged.  If you measure in terms of the devalued currency, then yes, more money is received.  But it's money that is worth less, so the change is essentially meaningless.  In terms of actual physical exports, with a couple exceptions, falling currencies have not boosted manufactured exports in industrial economies.  The more obvious historical correlation is a trade surplus and a strong currency.  A falling dollar will probably boost the share of existing commodity production that is exported more than it will stimulate new manufacturing.  That is a bad thing in that it basically means Americans are finding themselves outbid on their own crops.  It means people eating less meat because they can't afford it anymore.",1207204565
