And you don't really understand something that's not in your brain: all the neural links just don't exist on paper.<p>It's the writing that helps. I'm not entirely sure how, but something about putting thoughts into sentences makes the thoughts themselves more coherent. Maybe because it forces you to think them in new ways => more connections => better understanding.",1208112954

This means the musicians will be more authentic (no more Monkees) and producers will not make a point of dumbing the musicians and us down so as to have a large common denominator.<p>Some people talk about this fracturing as a bad thing, but this is the good side.  Mass production had to lower everyone's tastes out of necessity, and now the trend can reverse.",1208112904

162559,comment,162467,162467,0,0,slapshot,,,"Except he's entirely wrong if he's talking about the US.<p>The only thing you don't need a license for is for purely speculative work, generally interpreted as nothing more than idle curiosity.  Even research (such as trying to build a new invention out of an old one) is technically patent infringement unless you have a license.<p>Here's the actual law:<p><pre><code>     Except as otherwise provided in this title [35 USCS Sects. 1 et seq.], whoever without 
     authority makes, uses or sells any patented invention, within the United States
     during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.

It tried to argue that non-commercial research use should be protected in the case <i>Madey v. Duke University</i>.  It lost.  The Federal Circuit (the court that deals with patent appeals) held that research use is still use of the invention and still violates the law.

     in a patent infringement lawsuit against Duke University, signaling that academic
     researchers may be liable for use of patented equipment and processes even without
     use for commercial purposes. The court declared that the noncommercial character
     of the research in Madey v. Duke University was irrelevant. What matters is whether
     the research ""is in keeping with the alleged infringer's legitimate business,
     regardless of commercial implications."" In the case of a university, noncommercial
     research is ""legitimate business,"" subject to the patent laws.

162556,comment,162367,162394,0,0,yters,,,"pg makes a point of devaluing the classics in his essays.  I don't know why.<p>Let's assume there are consistent patterns to how people work, and these patterns are consistent because people forget about them.  So, the best way to learn about the patterns are by reading the classics and history.<p>Now let's come back to the present day.  People give this idea lip service, but no one really takes the classics seriously anymore.  Because of metanarratives like evolution, we think progress happens automatically and that there is no intrinsic human nature.  We don't realize this worldview is very recent and people thought it was a bad idea in the past.<p>Consequently, our worldview becomes a local optimum that limits us from looking for anything else.  This is called hubris in classical literature.  Think Oedipus.",1208112319

They care that you came to the show, and will work hard to entertain you.  There are no programs, only passionate people doing what they love.  If you like to recognize the songs being played by the folks on stage, check eMusic and Amie St. and MySpace for the bands that you're going to see...you'll find them there.<p>The huge mega-rock show is a pointless exercise in soullessness and has been for as long as I can remember (I swore off of them soon after high school after seeing a couple of arena shows of bands I liked and being disappointed by the tiny, tiny people bouncing around on stage while I looked on from the distance thinking ""I could see something more entertaining from my couch"").<p>But, every weekend, in every reasonably sized city in the world, there is a concert happening in a small to mid-sized club that you would enjoy.  It's a unique experience that you can share with 100-1000 like-minded music fans...a few of whom will be a little drunk, but no one will be heavily drugged up because the small clubs don't tolerate troublemakers.  Beer is usually a couple of bucks, and the wait is often less than a minute.<p>Oh, yeah, club shows cost anywhere from FREE to about 15 bucks.  The best shows I've ever seen, in a lifetime of loving rock concerts, cost $12 (Flaming Lips on the Satellite Heart tour), $8 (Fishbone on the Reality of my Surroundings tour), $15 (Mission of Burma reunion), $10 (Spoon, many times at Rudz in Houston), $12 (Spoon, at Emos in Austin), and lots more.  $300 will get you an awful lot of great live music if you give it to folks who are really passionate about music.",1208112217

It looks like the author read Joel Spolsky's ""Painless Project Schedules"", wrote a GUI to do that, then exposed all of the plumbing to allow endless tinkering.<p>Sure, the interface is pretty sadistic for Yet Another Scheduling Tool, but maybe the original goal wasn't to make another FogBugz -- maybe it started as a prototype to explore different ways of munging data from project schedules. Comparing the original Joel article to the current Evidence-Based Scheduling approach of FogBugz, it's possible that even the HCI wizards at Fog Creek hacked together a few obtuse prototypes before finally settling on the right combination of plumbing and porcelain.",1208111594
