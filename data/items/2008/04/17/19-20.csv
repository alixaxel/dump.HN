I have less personal experience with social sites, but it seems to me that the more information about your relationships you build, the harder it becomes to leave.

Many walls are glass at Clark. If you go to the bathroom or down the stairs or to get a coffee, the chances increase you'll run into others, even if you want to remain fixated on a program.  It's whether the workplace maximizes cross-talk for innovation vs focus on implementation.  Yeah, ideally you'd want both in the same workplace.  A coworker at Clark purposely created his cave by asking for a ""worse"" spot.  I could be convinced it's better to build the workspace for cross-talk and leave it to people to make their own caves.",1208460323
