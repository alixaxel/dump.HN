Secondly, this is being served by a very old server which, from empirical testing, wouldn't cope with this type of protocol. Thirdly, I have to keep borrowed bandwidth to a manageable level during business hours, which ideally means making it tend to zero in the long term. I was anticipating a mirror to continue serving this data but it would have been rude to ask.<p>Anyhow, I was expecting at most 20 concurrent connections before traffic decayed. I wasn't expecting concurrent connections from 56 unique IP addresses. The server is in London and it is transferring 1.7MB/s, mostly to European users. However, latency and routing to US clients seems to drastically reduce throughput to those users.<p>Most of the HTTP 206 [Partial] requests seem to be from Internet Explorer, despite this being a relatively obscure choice on this forum. I can only suppose that IE is quite inclined to re-establish connections after a connection briefly stalls. The latter would be because the httpd state creeped 39MB into virtual memory on this 64MB RAM server. This would also be why TCP window scaling didn't occur.<p>Anyhow, I knew it was risky to use this server to serve relatively large files but it will be used in the future for posting smaller tidbits.",1209084154

Likewise, a sale or IPO aren't the only ways to derive value out of the startup, but they're the ones that get the most focus, because they're the fastest way to get the desired results (lots of money). I think that this point of view was pretty clear in several of the talks at SS08.<p>Do I necessarily think that that's the only kind of ""startup"" that exists? No, not at all.

It wasn't as if Zappos was a small time shoe store that decided to put up a web storefront and somehow magically scaled up its operations into a billion dollar business in the course of 5 years. Zappos was started buy a guy who had 250 million dollars from selling a software startup to Microsoft. It was specifically started to corner the online shoe market, in the same way Amazon was started to corner the online book market.
