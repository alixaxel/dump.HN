The key of course will be the definition of ""wildly successful"". We could use twitter as an example.<p>Is there any one on hackernews that believes twitter won't make any money when they finally decide on a revenue model? Anyone who is willing to say publicly that 37signals will be worth more as a business than twitter in 12 months?<p>Just to be clear: if your product is very popular, finding a way to make money will not be difficult. You might not make a lot of money (but DHH says that's ok right?) and you might have to sustain a huge level of traffic to stay in business, but you won't go broke.",1209157036

I have been thinking about ways to alleviate my costs as I am currently relying solely on student loans and help for my father. The following is what I have come up with, and I am seeking the opinions of this community.<p>I have noticed that while there is some quality instructional videos on YouTube and places like MIT's website, I still think there is a lack of good quality educational videos. I would like to create a series of lecture videos with a textbook or two written by me and create a means of donating money to offset some of my expenses. In addition to that, if I have any money left over I would create a scholarship for math and computer science studies at Bowling Green State University. Do you think this is a viable plan? Could something like this be turned into a non-profit where more than just math and computer science lectures are posted?",1209156490
