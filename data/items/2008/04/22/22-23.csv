My 'equity valuation' of someone was often in direct contrast to my 'general appreciation' of them as a person, and to such an extent that it was difficult to keep two such incongruous ideas in my head at the same time.<p>What was surprising was not the overriding tendency to appreciate people for economically unrelated traits, but the gross effectiveness with which I could evaluate someone as soon as I viewed them purely in terms of financial opportunity.<p>I was reminded of the experience I had had with the Socratic method. When first presented as an idea---""You just ask questions""---the Socratic method is comically simple, almost ripe for derision, and easy to dismiss. But applying it, and seeing it applied, you notice that it has a powerful effect. The thoughts we arrive at on our own are immeasurably more meaningful than the thoughts pressed on us by others.<p>By the same token, this method of evaluation was unexpectedly effective. As long as I was thinking critically about who I would buy stock in, I had a clear picture of who the most valuable people were. But just as soon as my own assets faded from consideration the ordering became very different.",1208904676

SF is pretty psychotic.<p>* What areas are walkably friendly got that way by gentrifying and bleaching out the culture and neighborhoods from the city. Live in San Francisco? When was your last block party? Can you name your neighbors?<p>In my neighborhood the block party is in September but the SOMA block party is in a couple of weeks. I know all the people who live in my building (there are only 5) and three of my good friends live on the same block.<p>* Strong indie music scene? I guess it depends on what you like --- you could caricature me as a Pitchfork fan. Admittedly, comparing to Chicago, most other cities save New York and Seattle are going to suffer. But go read JWZ's blog about the DNA Lounge and form your own conclusions about how vital and diverse San Francisco's indie venues are.<p>- JWZ is grouchy because he was hoping to open up an industrial club but instead has to cater to asian gangsters coming up from Daly City. The scene he is into (industrial dance music) was never big enough to support a club the size of DNA and pretty much died out entirely 10 years ago. Everyone who was into it is now 40+ and doesn't go out anymore. I will admit that I don't go to many shows but the bands that I like (Autechre, TV on the Radio, Cornelius, are a few shows I've seen) seem to play here as often as anywhere else. The LOCAL music scene isn't that awesome, IMO. Most people are trying to be DJs rather than be in bands.<p>* If your friends all work at startups, a big chunk of them live in the South Bay, which means you will rarely see them, because facing a 45 minute commute (that's without 101 traffic) at 12:30AM is a strong deterrant to an impromptu night at a bar.<p>I guess that would be true. However most of the friends I have at startups work at startups in the city.<p>* Your office on Howard Street --- presuming it's a real office --- is not cheaper than what you'd pay in Chicago. Let's compare notes. You first.<p>We pay $8850 for 9000 square feet.
