I have a steady practice of sitting for 20-30 minutes every day at around the same time, and find that it helps a lot with the various problems you've discussed. It feels great to have small period of time each day to work on steadying the mind and all its incessant thought loops.<p>Meditation is obviously not a panacea, and doesn't give much in the way of immediate results -- which unfortunately makes it easy to abandon. But after sticking with it for a while, I think you'll find that you'll have fewer emotional peaks and valleys, and will therefore be a bit more productive (amongst other things).<p>I'm glad you had some good luck with the Hacker's Diet. I too have been following the methods in that book for a couple years now, and have steadily lost a good amount of weight. I think the main thing that I took away from it was how important awareness is. Just recording my weight each day and plotting a moving average gave some insight that I never previously would have considered. And I think the same is true for meditation. You'd be surprised what new kinds of awareness about your own emotional state arises when you are just sitting with nothing but your mind.",1208541557

I understood ""not doing too much in the gym"" to mean ""don't work too hard."" If instead you meant use your time in the gym wisely, then that I agree with. But if you want to see continued improvement, then you need to increase the intensity over time.

The most important thing: no sugar, and when I say no I mean no! No yoghurt with sugar, no drinks with sugar and also no artificial sweeteners. They ruin the taste and you will always want sweet things. Better have two bad weeks without any sweet things. After that sweet tasts ugly. This is one really big step. If you don't like sweet any more, the whole diet will become more healty.<p>I do understand this is very hard to achieve in the US. But for me this is very important. Without sugar I can eat enough without high calorie intake. Similar things are true for alcohol. Especially in the evenings its billions of calories.<p>I run twice a week (10 miles) and swim twice a week (1 mile) . My weight is 145 lbs at 5ft 10. Running and swimming does not burn a lot, but the regeneration phase does (repair, build muscles, refill energy reservoirs etc.). Plus you 'll soon be in great shape and can take the stairs instead of the elevator ;o). Or the bike instead of a car.<p>Well, and it takes a lot of time and patience. But in the end it works.<p>Monks life? ;o). Not at all. Fresh milk with cereals and fresh fruits (strawberries, melons) in the morning taste absolutely great. Fresh salad with barbecued fish and a glass of chilly white wine is fantastic in the evenings.<p>Good luck.",1208541115

So you need a prescription, and most people are unaware of those options entirely.<p>Hormones are extremely influential when it comes to fat storage.  If your stress level rises, your body will automatically store fat to compensate and burn muscle for fuel.<p>So getting rid of stress is critical.<p>If you are already tired but force yourself to work out, it may help your mental stress, but it does add MORE physical stress so your body may break down muscle and store fat.  A lot of people have heard about overtraining but don't realize you don't already have to work out a lot in order to overtrain yourself.  Simply being stressed/exhausted can cause overtraining with any vigorous exercise you perform in that state.<p>Avoid processed food.  The more fresh whole foods you eat, the harder it is to <i>overeat</i>, and the vitamins and minerals will make your body stop feeling hungry in a way that doesn't happen when you eat something processed and devoid of nutrition..<p>Any kind of sugary drinks are a big problem.  This includes fruit juice, which typically has all the sugar with none of the fiber.

167426,comment,167255,167255,0,0,strlen,,,"I've lost over 50-60 lbs since last year. Bulk of it (30-40 lbs) was within ~5 months. The way I did it was mostly through exercise: at the peak, I was doing an hour of cardio a day, 5-7 days a week.<p>I began (in December of 2006/January of 2007) with 15-35 minutes of cardio, three-four days a week (with intensive weight lifting). That got me back into the pace of exercise; weight lifting created muscles which consume fat when I do cardio. I also targeted the muscles closest to the biggest fat deposits (abdominals, legs) more. After I built up more strength and created a pace (roughly March 2007), I switched to nearly daily work outs with 30-45 minutes of cardio, which grew to an hour of cardio. At this pace I was doing at least 3500 calories a week.<p>In mid-to-early May, I've reached my initial goal, a normal BMI (for my height it's 174 lbs, down from 200+ lbs). Weight loss became even more rapid after that. 165 lbs by mid-to-late June, 155 lbs during the fall and (stably, since mid-December) 145 lbs. I've remained at that weight since. (The only way I know the dates is I've kept a private diary).<p>It's been the second greatest improvement I've made to my life (the first greatest improvement would be going to college): I've gained enough confidence to resume dating, I've found myself having more time, I've found myself having more energy to do work. I work 8-10 hour days followed - with occasional crunch time and hackathons - while doing a masters part-time: about equivalent, if not greater, work load than one would have as a startup founder (This brings me to another point, yes you do have time to work out).<p>As for diet, the only real changes were:
- As little white flour as possible (substituted with whole weat). There is minimal difference in taste/enjoyment, but there are less of the ""bad"" carbs.
- As little refined sugar as possible, no high fructose corn syrup at all. Splenda in it's place. In reality this means: make your own tea, drink water (and in the worst case, diet Coke). Dump the junk drinks (and that means dump Bawls and Jolt Cola too - diet Rockstar).
- Moderation: don't eat when not hungry, don't starve myself (starvation only puts your body into an energy conservation mode). Less eating at night, less snacking. Smaller portions.<p>In case you want proof:

As long as you don't have money, it makes it that much easier to figure out what you ought to be doing day to day, which for many people is no small thing.",1208538377

I exercise regularly (run, lift), and if anything, I've only gained weight while on an exercise-only program.<p>On more than one occasion, I've made relatively mild cuts to my caloric intake (say, 250 Cal/day), and lost significant (>10 lbs) amounts of weight in 1-2 month time periods (and I've kept it off for years).  Right now, I maintain my weight (6'2"", 180lbs) by eating about 2,300 Calories per day.  I don't count Calories anymore (I can estimate pretty well), but by weighing myself daily, I adjust what I eat to maintain.<p>People think that calorie restriction doesn't work, because they don't give it enough time, they aren't careful about it (i.e. sloppy record keeping), or they cheat.  But if you're diligent, patient and honest, it's the most effective weight loss routine you can establish.  I recommend using something like  calorie-count.com to keep track of everything that you eat for a week or two, then cutting back on that number by a small amount (say, 250-500 Cal.) for a month.  You'll be surprised at the results.",1208538068
