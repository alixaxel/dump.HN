I worked for a company in the SEO business, and I have to say that 99% of it just seemed patently obvious once you took some time to really think about the problem.<p>Don't over-abuse keywords<p>Keep your content fresh/relevant<p>Make sure the link text to your content reinforces the key terms you're trying to rank on (to the extent you have control of this).<p>Use sites like digg and stumbleupon to expose users to your content.<p>And so on.  SEO is ""dead"" in the sense that basic HTML is ""dead"".  It is no longer the mysterious domain of specially trained tech individuals.  SEO is just something else that you have to know and do if you want to have any hope of your website and company being noticed in todays consumer world.<p>SEO <i>is</i> dead, but thousands of SEO consultants who are still trying to make money by making SEO out to be more than it really is are viciously fighting this fact.",1226336370

359339,comment,359056,359184,0,0,Locke,,,"I made one small demo app in Merb about a month ago -- so, slightly pre-1.0.  Overall, it was a good experience and I intend to continue exploring Merb.<p>A few points:<p>* Not as much documentation... sometimes it takes a while to find the Merb equivalent of some Railsism.  The interfaces for Merb are very similar to Rails, though, so usually just trying the equivalent is enough.  The differences I encountered were usually improvements over the Rails approach, IMHO.<p>* Smaller community.  So, fewer plugins, fewer examples, fewer HOWTOs, etc.  Hopefully this will change.  But if you're uncomfortable developing something without a ton of resources to leverage...<p>* More flexible.  I used Datamapper instead of ActiveRecord, and was <i>very</i> happy to have a choice.  I was also very happy with Datamapper itself.  I'm not sure Datamapper is mature enough, yet, for large scale projects, but the future is bright.<p>Overall, I think Merb benefits strongly from the ""hindsight is 20/20"" adage.  It takes the best of Rails and rethinks its shortcomings.  Where Rails was more revolutionarly, Merb is evolutionary.  I think the improvements are worth the trouble of learning another web framework.  I intend to use Merb for any new projects I start.<p>My demo app is <a href=""http://ifrotz.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifrotz.org</a> -- not that it's at all enlightening in a Merb vs Rails debate.",1226334443
