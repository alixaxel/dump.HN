352674,comment,352540,352540,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Reasons not to vote:<p>Voting for federal candidates is an affirmation of the legitimacy of the power of the government, which you may reject.  Your vote will make you complicit in the next federal campaign to blow up foreigners, or the current campaign to imprison millions of Americans for victimless crimes.  I assure you Obama WILL blow up innocent foreigners; every president finds some excuse to do it at some point.<p>A vote for ""none of the above"" IS a vote.  The politicians NEED sufficiently high turnout to legitimize their power.<p>Elections are about as genuine as pro-wrestling.  They never have anything to do with how government actually proceeds after the race.  Rhetoric has consistently contradicted actions in my lifetime.  Pretending you participated in an informed decision making process is delusional.<p>You're stuck choosing between coke and pepsi when you really want a glass of milk.  The republican and democratic parties have locked up the racket for themselves.  They are different brands of the same corporatocracy and mostly create the illusion of choice with careful marketing.  Every couple years they push the right buttons to get their brand's simpletons whipped into a sufficient frenzy to trek to the polls.  Then they proceed with business as usual.<p>Voting, emotional investment in the political process, and keeping informed about the political process are distractions from far more socially productive activities.  If every campaign volunteer had resolved not to vote or really care about the election, and instead spent their time doing something of value on their block, the aggregate outcome would far surpass the positive difference in outcomes between any pair of candidates.<p>Lastly, your vote really doesn't matter, statistically speaking.",1225753127

The Walmart shopping experience, as it is today, would be unfathomable to someone from even the 1970s.<p>Consider the success of ""no frills"" groceries over the last 10 years (a success that is increasing due to the credit crunch). Many who wouldn't leave their chosen brands for certain products are migrating to cheaper alternatives with incredibly dull packaging. It's a bit of a conceptual jump for toys to be the same, but I suspect it'll happen when we realize how superficial the 90s and 00s ""were"" (speaking from a, say, 2020s perspective).",1225749943

Here are a few things you can't easily get in stealth mode:<p>- A partner/co-founder: The idea makes all the difference for people who might consider diving in with you.  Potential partners don't have time to meet with all the stealth-monkies to sign their NDA and hear about their (usually uninteresting to them) idea.<p>- A customer: In stealth mode, you'll never meet anyone who will say, ""Holy crap that's cool.  Can I sign up to be a pilot customer?""<p>- Wisdom about how to talk about your product: Every time you pitch your product to ANYONE, you get better at knowing what people want, how to talk about it, and where they get confused.<p>- A random referral: In stealth mode, you'll never hear ""Oh!  You know who'd be the perfect co-founder/investor/employee/pilot customer for you?!""<p>- A great idea that makes your idea BETTER.  Of course, a lot of stealth moders have serious idea-hubris, so they probably couldn't imagine their idea getting any better.<p>- An investor.  No investor will sign an NDA.  Most would punt you if you even asked.<p>- SEO benefit.  Backlinks and site age both effect rankings.  Start building now.<p>On the other side of the coin, would your competition REALLY change their execution if they knew you existed?  ""Oh no!  Two guys armed with Ruby on Rails!  We're DOOOOMED!""",1225749906

They are focusing heavily on the numbers though, rather than the system - and it's the system that's the problem.<p>I don't vote because my single vote carries no weight, as the article demonstrates. However, if <i>proportional representation</i> were used, I would vote because my vote would count for <i>something</i> even if very little. With First Past The Post, my vote is more like buying a lottery ticket.. if I vote for the loser then it counts for zero - which is why we end up with two party systems.",1225749720
