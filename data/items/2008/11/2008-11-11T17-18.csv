Everyone here encourages thinking that differs from ours.<p>I suppose we are generic in the job posting (I really appreciate the feedback) and again, as I stated, we're trying to find someone who is looking for more than just money, someone looking for place to work where they fit in and feel at home.<p>If you were trying to meet a decent girl with values, would you go around waving $100 bills and wearing diamond pendants?<p>We're not trying to flash around our new funding and put emphasis on our fancy office and wii and ping pong table and couch and full kitchen.

I have since seen systems built with the many layers of indirection (and pass through service layers) and they are very difficult to maintain. Simple interation bugs become hard to discover because the leaky abstractions built on top of one another interact in complex ways.  They are also very difficult to optimize for scale- if you don't own your data, it's hard to invalidate your cache, as just one example.<p>This onion stinks. If you are obsessed with creating a service layer, stick with Fowler:

360703,comment,360033,360352,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"How about nice documentation of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, which was a puppet trial and they executed people for 'unprovoked war' and 'aggressive warfare' which even today isn't a war crime.<p>This is not to mention that the US military protected Japanese scientists of Unit 731 who knew they were committing war crimes by exposing civilians to bacteriological and chemical weapons, which after WW1 were considered to be war crimes. None of the people who actually committed a war crime was prosecuted by the American governments, they were pardoned and protected so the US military could get their research.<p>I believe that Hiroshima and the completely pointless bombing of Nagasaki should be shown in context. In that context it should also be shown that the US military exposed innocent people to the most cruel deaths humanly imaginable.<p>I'm sorry but the inhumanity of Unit 731 is far outweighed by the US protecting them.<p>This isn't to mention that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings actually killed allied POWs and even Japanese-American citizens. That exposure to extreme gamma radiation causes scar tissue to separate from ordinary tissue and any injury from even decades before to reopen and help the person bleed to death, that's if they don't die from shitting out their bowls (literally) or dying from the flu as the radiation destroys their bone marrow. This not to mention the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission refusing to give medical aid to the survivors of the bombing so that they could get better results.<p>Oh and how about the US military personnel who mutilated Japanese corpses and took home trophies from corpses. The civilian fear of this was so great in Japan that it caused the mass suicides of Saipan and Okinawa.<p>My personal opinion on the war is that both the US and Japanese committed enough crimes between them that there should never be forgiveness over the events. It's a great shame that the US military didn't get punished for its war crimes, just like the majority of the Japanese military didn't and just like the majority of the German military didn't.<p>War is inhumane and full of atrocities, just like what's coming out of Iraq and Afghanistan. The simplest way to avoid war crimes is to simply avoid war.",1226425720

360701,comment,360574,360681,0,0,jd,,,"That's definitely a valid point. Even if you had the money to pay above market rates, you still wouldn't because you know people exist who are willing to work really hard for less than market rates, if that gives them the opportunity to make a difference and build something great. In your case, you have to pick between extra runway and salary. That's a no brainer: 2 months of runway can be the difference between profitability followed by success and failing.<p>About the end justifying the means: Scaring off people you don't want to hire in the first place is easy. The problem is that by doing so, you're bound to give off bad vibes to people who would otherwise consider your company. Bear in mind that the people you want to hire are -by definition- in high demand. That means that they can (and should) demand a lot from you.<p>Just like in dating, people need only one reason to dismiss you as a qualified employer/so. Don't give them that reason.",1226425561
