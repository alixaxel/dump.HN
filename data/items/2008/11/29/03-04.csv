Some colos are down at 15 amps per rack, many seem to be in the 20 amps per rack, and some you can get up to 30 but you will pay for that one way or another.<p>Even at 30 amps per rack, for the kind of machines that you're talking about you are still likely to be less than about 20 machines per rack.  I just spec'd a build out of the same horsepower & ram but with more juice for e.g., FC cards to a SAN and the safe limit was 16 machines in a 30 amps per rack colo and 8 machines in a 15 amps per rack colo.<p>Shopping around for power information can be tricky because some of the colos like to play marketing games to get you to think there price is better than others but the power charges can eat you alive if you need more than what they allocate in their base charges.",1227930341
379841,comment,379379,379740,0,0,spoondan,,,"It is absolutely false that ""scientists were freaking out about Global Cooling"". In fact, thirty years ago, the scientific consensus was for warming, and there was grave and growing concern about the effect of greenhouse gases. Any review of the scientific literature from that period will prove this definitively. Fleck, Connolley, and Peterson have published on this point; you can probably find a summary of their findings online.<p>Moreover, even if ""Global Cooling"" was not the lie it is, this argument is meaningless. History is littered with discarded scientific theories. This is not cause for concern. It is the way that science works. What matters is whether current theories are correct. It is interesting to note, then, that current climate models accurately describe--among many other things--the cooling period you mention.<p>Finally, the statement, ""Climates have always changed and they always will,"" is not informative. It's a blatantly bunk argument that since climate change is a normal occurrence, any change in climate is normal.",1227930155

This is important because if you are creating anything at all rich you are going to have designer and coders working on your stuff. Constraining them to a single platform reduces the amount of people who would be willing to work on it.<p>Flash also now has Flex which allows you to code and compile. Depending what you are doing this is great to have designers and developers on the same project.<p>Finally people are used to building stuff using the Flash IDE. While Silverlight might be the best thing since sliced bread I'd rather use a technology I know I can just find a contractor for in about 10 minutes.",1227929976

379833,comment,379372,379445,0,0,patio11,,,"I think that blog's ""About"" page is one of the best pieces of academic writing I've ever seen, on a per-word basis:<p>>>\nThis is a blog about my research on privacy and anonymity. The title refers to the fact that there are only 6.6 billion people in the world, so you only need 33 bits (more precisely, 32.6 bits) of information about a person to determine who they are.<p>This fact has two related consequences. First, a lot of traditional thinking about anonymous data relied on the fact that you can hide in a crowd that’s too big to search through. That notion completely breaks down given today’s computing power: as long as the bad guy has enough information about his target, he can simply examine every possible entry in the database and select the best match.<p>The second consequence is that 33 bits is not really a lot. If your hometown has 100,000 people, then knowing your hometown gives me 16 bits of entropy about you, and only 17 bits remain. But the real danger is that information about a person’s behavior, which was traditionally not considered personally identifying, can be used to cause serious privacy breaches in a variety of different contexts.\n>>",1227929573

I knew in advance it wouldn't actually get deployed, despite everyone up to the Task Force Commander loving it and touting its importance. The day came when it was ""done"" (of course I had become attached and there were a million things I wanted to add) and ready to be deployed... then the red tape tied it up until it was time for us to go. As is generally the case, our replacements weren't planning to do things our way (the country has gotten much worse since we left, imagine that) so the project was basically sunk.<p>I worked on it because I love programming and trying new things.

379826,comment,379379,379428,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"I'm a ""Lomborg skeptic"". Bjorn Lomborg takes the IPCC predictions on Global Warming and shows that the costs of current proposed policies are likely to be much greater than their benefit in actual mitigated warming. He points out that much more good can be done if a fraction of the money currently earmarked to fight global warming instead went towards AIDS prevention, malaria reduction, and nutrition efforts in the third world.<p>Of course, it is not popular to discuss costs and benefits when discussing Global Warming. The kind of leftists who are the big green alarmists don't look kindly on economic arguments. However, I believe they are essential to making rational decisions. We should all have the goal of doing more good than harm.<p>Here's his TED talk on the subject.<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/bjorn_lomborg_sets_global_priorities.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/bjorn_lomborg_sets_global...</a>",1227929303
