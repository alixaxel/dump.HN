You're not. The assumption that you are is elitist in that you've decided you can get away with public disrespect for somebody else.<p>Subjective salaries I understand. However, you're not making a ridiculous amount of money. To mock somebody for inquiring primarily about money, when you're an unknown company with no reputation whatsoever, and when you're <i>not</i>, in fact, making a particularly grand amount of money, is wrong on a few levels.<p>You're a code monkey with no equity. You might be happy working where you are, but your original post implied that you were somebody with power and that you were being a jerk about it. Now it seems that you don't have any power, and that you were being a jerk without any qualification.<p>There <i>is</i> no average web dev, as I've come to realize here. There are some people here who are huge into open source, who run completely open software and write for it and modify it. There are others who run Windows or OS X and pay excesses of money for things which they might not exactly need. Your ""I am like most people reading this post"" remark set me off, partly because I'm not like you whatsoever. My interests? Aestheticism, high-quality writing, and typography. Furthermore, I'm younger than you and have less professional experience. The fact that your original post seemed immature even to me is a bad sign. I wouldn't call it atrocious, because - as you say - everybody makes mistakes. I didn't comment on the original thread bashing you. However, it irritates me that your follow-up wasn't ""Sorry, guys, I've done something terribly stupid, we've removed the original post and we'll maintain radio silence until we at least start talking about our idea,"" but rather an attempt to justify yourselves, followed by another appeal for job applications.<p>Considering you've got three people, you ought to easily be able to at least launch a beta of your product. Other people have criticized you for hiring too soon; I'm not qualified enough to talk about that without sounding like a hypocrite. It seems to me, though, that if you're going to hire you ought to hold off until you've announced yourselves, so that you get applicants that might actually be interested in whatever Dashboard is.",1226523475

Realize that AmEx employees are some of the highest paid in America, while Mervyns' people are among the lowest paid.<p>A government loan (by definition on more favorable terms than what they can get in the market) to AmEx is <i>inevitably</i> a subsidy to those high paid employees. Mervyns having to raise funds at 15% or 25% or whatever loan-shark terms they could get - yes, entirely their own fault - means that by extension, their low paid employees have to bear that interest burden on the company.<p>Why should we the taxpayer subsidize AmEx? Why not let the do the write down of their bad assets? In what sense Mervyn's management mistakes more punishment worthy than AmEx management mistakes?<p>Here is a modest proposal: any company requesting a government loan should accept civil service pay rules for their employees. Would AmEx employees put up with it? They can get the fuck out of they don't like those terms and find <i>real</i> private sector employment.",1226520595

I my case its because there was a security issue with Google Checkout…the worthless redundant buying service that I signed up for to get 10% off some gear. What a fool. The Googlesphere is inherently evil and here’s why. They promote trust that lures users with awesome free cloud computing service. I foolishly trusted Google and used Gmail, Docs, and Picassa to safeguard my data. Now, because of some BS Checkout problem, they’ve locked me away from my data. IMAP made the situation far worse, since I now have lost 3-years worth of email data. INSANE. I blasted the cheerleaders at Lifehacker who promote all things Google. I suggest that anyone who suffers a similar fate do the same. The word needs to get out that Google can’t be trusted.",1226520556

There's also a question of how much he has to offer to the founders, and how much the founders have to offer him.<p>If these two biz dev guys can make the company successful no matter what the quality of the product, then he's not very valuable.  If that's not true, though, then his work has a very direct impact on the value of the company, which generally means that he would have equity. The former case seems unlikely, so it seems like he's getting a raw deal.",1226520286

What the report is actually saying is that a few components of the curriculum are good, but the courses overall suck. If you read the rest of the executive summary, it absolutely shits on the AP. This might be couched in academic language, but make no mistake about what they're saying.<p>Now obviously if the courses are made to be completely different then advocating them might not be a bad thing. But right now all that's happened is the NSF has given the college board a small amount of money to reform the curriculum, a process which just started this summer. Right now we have no idea if any changes were actually made, and if so what those changes are and whether or not they are really inline with the NRC & NCTM standards.<p>Anyway, all we know is that right now the president elect is advocating a curriculum that has kids going through the motions of science and math without actually learning the principles of either subject, and without learning what it means to think like a scientist or a mathematician. And these are just the science and math courses. There is every reason to think the other AP courses, the majority which are not being overhauled, are just as bad if not worse.<p>Further, even if the science and math courses are overhauled, there are still lots of problems with them. For example, the assessments are inauthentic and norm referenced, and there is no reason to think this is going to change.",1226520138
