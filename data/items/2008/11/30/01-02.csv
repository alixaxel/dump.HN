380539,comment,379942,379942,0,0,bborud,,,"Since you are just 21 I think you should try to motivate yourself to finish a degree.  Because 5-10 years down the road it is going to be a lot harder to go back to school.  If you think motivating yourself is hard now, it is nothing against what it is going to be like in 10 years.<p>I can understand that you find going to a university boring and uninspiring.  I did.  I fund it painfully boring and eventually I quit because I didn't see the point in torturing myself with horribly bad lecturers.  But I had a few advantages.  First off, I already had about 10 years of solid work experience when I quit.  Second, I stayed at the university and worked there for about 5 years after I quit.  Meaning I had the benefit of getting to know a lot of people.  Third, just because I stopped following the university program didn't mean I stopped studying.  It just meant that I could focus on what I found interesting.  Now this is risky, because university programs are diverse for a reason.  Luckily the stuff I was interested in turned out to become immensely important later and I had a head-start when my classmates graduated a few years later.  But, of course, I didn't have a degree.<p>Meeting people is critical.  I cannot stress this enough.  During your time at the university you are going to meet a lot of people.  If you hang out with the right sort of people, it will greatly affect your professional life later.  For the past 15 years I have ended up working with a <i>lot</i> of people I got to know during the university years. I did a startup with some of them and I have worked on a few world class projects with them.  Many of them were great -- extremely few of them would have been great if they had been on their own.<p>Your network of talented people whom you know personally is more important than what they teach you at school.<p>This is something not a lot of people think about when choosing universities, but it would be a good idea to pick a university in an area you would like to stay later.  Preferably somewhere people care to go when doing startups.<p>Also, at 21 you might think that you are hot shit because you have some software development knowledge.  The short version is: most likely you are not.  In all likelihood you are an above average newbie.  Swallow your pride and let it fuel ambition instead.<p>There is no replacement for having a broad and diverse professional background and in the years to come, you are going to look back many times and think of your self ""what a naive idiot I was"". That is normal.  It shows that you are developing and maturing.<p>What people look for when hiring senior developers is track record.  What have you delivered before?  What role did you play?  What are the strengths that make you stand out.  Are you able to plan 12 months ahead?<p>There are hundreds of thousands of people who would do well in programming contests, but who are only fit for entry level software engineer jobs because of lack of maturity and experience.<p>My advice is:<p><pre><code>  - finish a degree.  if you are smart enough: try to keep\n    your scores well in the top 5%\n\n  - work on a challenging open source project while going\n    to school -- become a visible/key contributor.\n\n  - work as an intern during the summers.  aim for top tier\n    companies that have challenging work and name\n    recognition.  do well.  don't coast.\n\n  - when you graduate, prioritize getting a job where you\n    can learn a lot over an easy, dead-end job where you\n    can earn more.  your first few years in the business \n    should be about learning and gaining experience.\n\n  - if you are doing a start-up, understand the risks, be\n    prepared to work your ass off and talk to other people\n    who have done startups.  most important of all: make\n    sure you know the right people to involve.  also, dare\n    to fail.\n\n  - be retrospective/introspective.  take notes and read\n    them years later.  you will discover how much you\n    mature over time and it will make you more grounded\n    and more humble.  it will also highlight that you need\n    to learn *constantly*.</code></pre>",1228009795

I provided an example of such a change. I also explained in another post (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=380300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=380300</a>) why I picked this example: by some ad-hoc means, I was able to dig up the original language.<p>Also, your analogy is ridiculous.

380523,comment,379942,380432,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, bravo for you for being enthusiastic about your field! If the original poster had more people like you around he might not be so depressed. Feel free to argue that the original poster should transfer to UIUC, which would doubtless be a great idea.<p>Yeah, I misspoke when I used ""work in CS"" as a synonym for ""developing software"". (Though I suppose I could argue that all of us who write software are ""doing CS""... some are just doing it with more ignorance than others. Of course, by that logic, my cat ""does physics"" all the time...)<p>I <i>am</i> aware that real CS exists. I don't actually know much of it, and while I enjoy picking up bits and pieces as I go along and occasionally sleep with a copy of Knuth Vol 1 under my pillow it would be nice to have had an actual grounding in the subject. Alas, I didn't encounter anyone who was really able to explain what the hell the field was all about until I was more than halfway through grad school in a different subject. I sampled the CS department as a freshman in college, both the intro course and an assembly course, and all I saw was a roomful of people struggling to write the Pascal programs that I had taught myself to write in middle school. (If only the web had been invented <i>slightly</i> earlier... or my university's intro course had involved SICP instead of Pascal. Ah, what might have been. Incidentally, I forgot to ask the original poster: Have you read SICP yet? It's free on the web now!)<p>But the reason I'm being harsh on true-blue Computer Science in this thread is that I'm in coaching mode. I'm trying to give advice to a guy who either can't find the real CS at his school or can't understand why he should care. Perhaps he should just look harder, but I trust you and every other CS major in this thread to convince him to do that. That's your job. I feel that it's my job to point out that there really <i>are</i> other things than CS in college, and perhaps he should try some of them before he just quits.",1228007253

380521,comment,380377,380377,0,0,mixmax,,,"Been there, and it's tough.<p>Based on my own experience I would recommend the following:<p>- Make sure you're ok, it's hard emotionally taking a hit like that, but it happens to all of us. As ksvs said in one of the other comments even Joel Spolsky hit the wall during the last bust. Realise that it's not your fault, talk to friends, enjoy life.<p>- get out of debt, it's a killer. I've been in worse debt and it's not as hard as you might think to get out of it. Talk to your creditors, tell them the situation and be straight about it. There's a good chance that you might be able to negotiate a deal where you don't have to pay it all back, or get lenient terms. Creditors like straight talk and hate excuses.<p>- when you're past the first two points start a company - the education that you have just finished by going broke with a company is worth much more than a cs degree. You have just improved your chances of success considerably. Almost nobody succeeds the first time, but the ones that start their second company have a much higher rate of success.<p>Good luck.",1228007125

380518,comment,380377,380377,0,0,dotBen,,,"Like others have said, I would contact the server company and do what you can to cease the contract.  I personally think the advice given of 'turning up in person and begging for mercy' is a little odd and I wouldn't do that. I'd call up, ask to speak to someone about renegotiating the contract (ie someone who can make the decision, not the sales rep) and explain the business has gone under and that you would rather conclude the relationship now rather than be in a position not to be able to pay and have to have them join your list of creditors.  That should pretty much do the trick.<p>Now, the one problem with that is that it means the product you've built will no longer be running, which means you can't sell it.  However, I think it's a funny time right now for lead generation anyway and IMHO better to be out of the game for a little bit to see how things settle.<p>In the meantime, I would weigh up your best opportunities between consulting and getting a job - what will make you the most money (to pay off the debt).  I'd also factor in what will keep you involved in the industry - ie might be better to go contract or a slightly lower paying job in lead generation/online advertising than to get a higher paying job selling insurance (just an example - point is it's something that doesn't move your career forward).<p>I would look to pay off at least the minimum payments, just to stop the debt from increasing - but really you should try to pay what you can off per month.  The budgeting ideas are good.<p>Finally, I would tinker on your project in your spare time - as long as you feel you are moving forward with it and creating value.  If it makes you feel miserable, which it might, I would leave it dormant.<p>We really don't know where we are with the economy right now and so playing a safe game for the next 6 months is vital IMHO until we know what things really look like -- then we'll be able to see the opportunities and begin to capitalize on them.<p>On a personal note, I just want to say I feel for you. I've never been in debt, but I've also never really embarked on a risk taking entrepreneurial venture like you did. I moved to Silicon Valley (from another country) to do it, and 2.5 years later I'm still scared to try it. Scared of the failure, especially economic.<p>My point is you have tried it, you have learned a lot and you have the life experience which many don't.  I hope that simply empowers you to get back on your feet and try the next one.  I wish I wasn't as paralyzed as I am as my window of opportunity, age wise, is closing.<p>Best of luck to you.",1228006855
