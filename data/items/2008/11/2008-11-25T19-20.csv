There is no time frame for how long your test program can run (in the clients wishes), so even if there is an infinite loop in the program fed in - your own test program also waits infinitely. Because your program never stops, and is basically still doing it's job, the client cannot tell you that your solution is wrong. He can only tell you that your solution is wrong if you return a wrong answer, but you never do.<p>So while the halting problem cannot be solved, the clients requirements can be fulfilled (logically).",1227642845

I recently interviewed with a large well-known software company, and I told them about some of my schedule limitations (due date on an existing offer), and the HR person seemed dodgy about it at best. My interviewer loved me, but told me that the company generally was unable to respond in less than 4 weeks.<p>If you want your potential hires to feel valued, move through the recruitment process at a good pace. There is absolutely no reason there should be a 4-week gap between first and second interviews. I've seen plenty of companies that have gone from first interview to offer in the space of a single week - that includes flying the candidate in.<p>The worst part is that I emailed the HR contact reminding them that this deadline existed, and to this date (a week and change now...) I have not yet even received an acknowledgment on their part.<p>Oh well, I'd been warned against that company to begin with.",1227642773

There's beauty in type safety.  And there's most definitely beauty in a language that will make correctness guarantees at compile time.  But then again, I've been using C++ long enough to have some perspective.  I remember when Java was the silver bullet; now it's Ruby.  This too shall pass.<p>Most of the complaints that I hear about C++ come from inexperienced programmers, and most of those complaints boil down to <i>""I don't understand it""</i>.  That's fine, and to be expected -- I didn't understand anything either, when I first started.  The tragic mistake comes when you begin to assume that type-safety, encapsulation, access control, and other <i>""bondage-and-discipline""</i> features of the language were put there simply to make your life more difficult.<p>There were (and are), talented C++ programmers, and I think it's possible that some of them know what they were doing.",1227641728
376677,comment,376486,376642,0,0,evgen,,,"The post is factually incorrect because the items listed are _expenditures_ and that means it is money which was spent, the bailout is a loan guarantee and we will get a lot of it back (and in fact might make a profit on the whole thing.)  If you take out a loan and spend it on comic books then that is an expenditure, but if you take out a loan and invest it in something there is a possibility that the investment will pay out and you will be able to pay back the loan and potentially make a profit on the venture.<p>The claim that no attempt was made to calculate the social and economic dividends of any of the other ventures listed is a complete fallacy, there are numerous hand-waving (and a few well-researched) papers describing the long-term costs and/or benefits of each expenditure.  The difference is that in the case of the other ventures there was very little known at the time about the cost of doing nothing but we can see quite clearly that the cost of doing nothing now will be far greater than the amount we are proposing to use to prop up the system.",1227641640

It's about helpful, courteous, and respectful, vs uninformed, detached, and unconcerned. A lot of HR people don't seem very invested in the position whereas the direct manager might be, so maybe that's where the stereotype comes from, but I've had many, many, many contacts from engineers (usually at smaller companies) who weren't so hot on the people skills.<p>On one occasion I worked with HR people. They were sharp and had their stuff together. In meeting them before interviewing with the engineering team, they were well dressed and very professional. They were courteous.<p>At all points I was aware what expectations I should have for notification, what the timelines were, and what the next steps were. In salary negotiations they were very respectful and it didn't feel like they were trying to find my lowest spot (though presumably they were).<p>This was extremely impressive to me. I've worked in plenty of situations where the engineers are good but the organization is poorly led or otherwise dysfunctional. I can talk to the engineers and tell if they know their stuff. That'll come in due time. It's harder to tell, does payroll go out in time? Is this an environment that will treat me like an adult?<p>When I ask for time off, am I going to have to e-mail ten different people for all the projects I'm in (I'm someone that can be useful in multiple areas), or will there be some structure there?<p>These things are harder to tell. Some people might like to be more seat of your pants. I personally expect competence at all levels of an organization, and not knowing these fundamentals is a red flag, and demonstrating them, conversely, is a good sign.",1227641461

People are not equal, and some nations are definitely ""worse"" than others in some respect.<p>Remember that I'm not saying that an Indian in London, for example, would be likely to be more difficult to work with. I know several Indian people in London, and some of them are better coders than me. I'm talking about Indian outsourcing businesses in India, and making an aggregate judgement of what it's like to work with them (not about whether they'll mug you). I think that's fair.<p>For instance, ""Be careful about going on holiday in Somalia"" is an equally generalising statement - not all Somali's are pirates or warlords - but it's a fair statement because if you're gonna set foot there, there's a reasonable chance you might meet one of them, so you should be forewarned.",1227641415

I can chip in about what I actually meant.<p>I don't think simple CSS bugs are beyond the skills of even the below-average Indian outsourcing shop (though I'm sure some of them fail even on that level, and depending on how finicky you are about your CSS, maybe no one can do it but yourself).<p>However, in my experience, the more complicated the task, the less likely it will be to get done via a simple outsourcing contract. A huge consulting company can successfully outsource very complex things, because they can invest in ensuring they hire quality resources.<p>Someone who has personal contacts with people whom he knows are competent can also do it, because they already know where to find the quality.<p>For the rest of us, though, there is a sea of bad options (the kind that often charge a few dollars an hour) and a few islets of quality. It's very hard to figure out which ones are the good ones, and these islets get smaller the more your task is complicated. Past a certain level of complexity (e.g. ""put together a synchronous framework for a tool like Etherpad"") you might as well not bother, your chances of hitting land are so low.<p>This is not specific to India or Pakistan, it applies to China just as much. Eastern Europe is less of a problem for me because there are fewer communication barriers. My point, clarified, is then: Outsourcing complex tasks to a remote location with which there are communication difficulties is unlikely to work.",1227641126
