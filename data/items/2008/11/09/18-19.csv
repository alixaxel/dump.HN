And absolutely those things are enjoyable.<p>The difference is that I don't rely on stuff like that. I write, I program, I design things, I read, I try to write music and shoot films. I don't feel the need to drink once a week, or to go out and randomly hook up. And that's because I have so many things I can do at any given moment.<p>If you don't have that stuff, you're forced to rely on sex and drugs. And those things are both easily abused.",1226257098

So I don't think they're really banking on the smartphone market -- at least as we've defined ""smartphone"" in the US.  Especially when their high-end phones are selling for double or triple the price of the too-beat offering (iphone).",1226257001

The majority of college educated people I know have never had a friend of less than middle class origins.  The statistics show we have a society of increasing class stratification; people never marry down anymore, for example.<p>College and credentialism is also reinforcing an elitist attitude to manual labor.

We're getting MORE social division, not less.<p>And let's not kid ourselves about the real level of diversity in colleges.  Hispanics are WAY underrepresented, and probably always will be.

It's like saying that most programmers never make anything of worth: yes, it's true, but it doesn't make the entire career irrelevant.<p>That quote, however, is spot-on. Anything that doesn't focus on the best and brightest hurts the best and brightest in a way.

We tend to admire those who are far better than we are, and we like working with them because it enables us to learn an incredible amount fast. There's no point in envying the guy who is five times better when it's possible to study up, practice writing good code, and eventually be as good as he is.

He's not socially awkward. He's arrogant and annoying and makes terrible design decisions, despite the rather obvious fact that Facebook's rise, <i>at the expense of superior competitors</i>, is entirely the result of fortunate position (Harvard). Most of us wish he would just go away. There's no ""hate"" for him; we just don't like seeing a person of such mediocre talent and poor decision-making mettle being lifted to the status of our generation's emblem of success. I'd rather let him have his millions and get him out of the way.<p>++ Edit: did not realize I was replying to Paul Graham when I wrote this.

358385,comment,358256,358361,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>This idea that there's something special about four years of the much longer process is a bit silly.</i><p>The idea is that a, colleges move to you places you'd never be (I have friends at NYU and Dublin who absolutely are getting more out of the locale than they are anything else), and b, because college is specifically made so that people can learn, you'll attract a purer blend of people, all of whom are interested in learning.<p>For the most part, that latter point is absolute bullshit. College has become so psychologically mandatory in the United States that people go to college whether or not they're truly interested in learning. And while I love the idea of liberal arts learning, and while hopefully if I stay I'll learn things I'd never thought to learn otherwise, the fact of the matter is that as colleges defocus themselves, there's less of an emphasis on really bright people who are going to blaze through early college to get to a meaningful level. In my classes, I'm learning to program in Processing and Scratch, for instance: one is a kid's language, for crying out loud, and for the other, I can't see the point of using Processing rather than Java. In my other classes, I'm learning to use Photoshop and Final Cut Pro, both programs that I have a good deal of familiarity with. It's an absolute waste, and my professors absolutely realize this, but they have no choice because other kids don't know a thing about programming, and the course that I'm in makes these classes absolutely mandatory.<p>As for the kids being enlightened and focused: don't get me started. At the time of this writing, one kid is in trouble because he brought tons of kids to his house and they threw up and now he's refusing to apologize to his parents because, as he puts it, ""I'm in college. This should be expected behavior."" Same kid told a real knee-slapper about stealing four thousand dollars while working at a Target. I mean, it makes for an amusing story, but it's despicable. And I'm in a pretty top-notch school, for what it's worth.<p>No, people who are really fascinated in learning nowadays tend to try and be practical about what they know: I'd bet that the brightest people of college age are doing things like trying to create start-ups, or at the very least trying to earn a living with the skills they've got.",1226255093

If after school care centers are about to become flush with government cash, perhaps they'll need some kind of software to help them grow.<p>The downside to this article is that most of it is based what the Obama administrated has stated it ~wants~ to do.
