This file becomes the 'auction log'.  If the auction fails to complete because of technical issues we simply purge the data from RAM, re-schedule the auction and try again later.<p>There's no need to write data to disk during the auction itself because of this 'try again' policy if anything screws up.  I also think this eliminates the need for a separate re-do log since each bid can be time-stamped and stored in the auction log that's written after the auction ends -- but this brings up a question:<p>Can timestamps be created to the nearest 1/100 of a second?",1226562056

362842,comment,362626,362730,0,0,netcan,,,"Well you look at probable revenues, & guess.<p>Say facebook can bust up their % of the online display ad market. Now I believe this is a relatively arbitrary market. There are budgets. A certain amount is allocated to online ads. Their effectiveness will never be like Google's. In fact, Google has nothing to do with this. Search ads are different.<p>Google is like hotel booking sites or product comparison sites or Yellow Pages or anyone else who controls what item people find within a category. YP controls(ed) what businesses get found, hotel sites (and travel agents before them), what hotels get found & Google contols which sites get found.<p>Linkedin controls what business people get found, so it's different. Facebook controls which people get found.<p>There's no business model there. If you want to get a business model out of that you'd need there to be people willing to pay for friends. I doubt there is. Facebook just isn't part of this game. That's unfortunate because it is a more elegant & valuable game then the 'display advertising' but there you go.<p>So let's get to the business of guessing. What can happen if we think positive?<p>- The display advertising market can just grow buy itself. Budgets get bigger, their 1.1% is worth more. Likelihood? I'd say 60/40 for (just guessing). But how much bigger? I'd guess not much. Definitely not more then 200% 300%. There's also a chance it'll get worse. Especially this coming year.<p>- Someone else may figure out how to make these more effective. Google has a lot invested in generalist 'impressions.' So do a lot of other smart companies. They may figure out a way to make direct response display ads work. But they haven't yet, and that's telling. What are the chances? I guess I'd say under 50/50.<p>- Facebook will figure it out for themselves. They have the bulk to have a go. They might find a way to leverage data & connections between people & maybe smart advertisers might figure out cool things to do with that given some cool tools. I can think of scenarios: A 1% very interconnected segment of Texas knows all about some new energy drink. it seems to them that everyone knows about it. Everyone seems to be drinking it. But outside their circle, noone is.<p>- maybe. This last one is the wildcard. I don't think the chances of pulling it off are great. If they do there is potential upside. But how much? I dunno. I can't see them ever pulling in the $5b per year revenue. There is doubt as to whether they'll every hit $500m, but they probably can.<p>So what are they worth at $250m revenue what are they worth at $5b. The chance of maintaining at least $250m I say are at least 90% the chances of hitting 500m are 70%, 1b>> 50% 5b >> 10%. That's just guessing & I think I'm being generous. What are you willing to pay now for facebook with those numbers?",1226561639

You might be in a legal predicament if (a) the system coredumps or (b) someone sues and you don't have a log of each bid or (c) both.<p>This might be a challenge for your in-memory approach. You might need to keep a redo log that can be used to replay/verify the auction after the fact.<p>EDIT: ps. The startup I was at used this approach. In memory, with redo logs. The client was a Java Applet - JavaScript wasn't an option in those days.<p>Is it real money changing hands? If so you need to be concerned about security. e.g. You might need SSL or another cryptography technique.

Few organisations I can think of could move their entire infrastructure to another provide from a hard shutdown in that amount of time.<p>I also find it surprising that the obvious barrier exist to shutting these operations down. Since they seems to have a handful of these hosts shut down a year the impact on (illegal) spammers is minimal given their turn around time to redeploy on a new host.

362829,comment,361738,362590,0,0,thwarted,,,"Go the other way.  Assume two strings of length k: string a composed of english words, and string b generated by reading /dev/random.  String a will be more compressible, length(compress(a)) < k.  You can now add MORE ""information"" to a and compress it until length(compress(a)) = k.  Since you can't compress b any further, it already contains the maximum amount of information.<p>I put ""information"" in quotes above because the actual ""information per bit"" of English is pretty low, and that's where the ability to both compress it and comprehend it, not as single bits but as groups of bits, comes from.  Still, compressed data is still comprehensible once you uncompress it, so it's a measure of the surface comprehensiblity.  It's really a measure of information density.  Compressed data has a high information to space ratio, whereas random, uncompressible data has low information to space ratio (or perhaps negative).<p>You can experiment with this yourself:<p><pre><code>   cat > /tmp/string.a
      (paste in some English text cut and pasted from a web page)
   dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/string.b bs=1 count=`wc -c < /tmp/string.a`
   bzip2 /tmp/string.*
   ls -l /tmp/string.*
</code></pre>
Experiment with the above for corpora of different lengths.  You'll see that as there is more English text, which is information rich, it can compress better than shorter English text (as a compression ratio), and will compress better than random data (which we know contains little information) of the same length.<p>A string composed solely of 27 As would compress down to perhaps 2 bytes or less (not including the size of the decompressor).  You are right: there is not much information in it.  Less than 16 bits of information in 27 As.",1226560737

My current concept is that I would receive (for example) 15,000 bids during a one-second period and I would store them in RAM as they are received.  Then at the end of this one-second period I would have the software process the batch -- which probably means updating the position of the current unique high bid, determining the status of each of the 15,000 bids in relation to this new position, and creating and delivering 15,000 unique HTTP responses.
