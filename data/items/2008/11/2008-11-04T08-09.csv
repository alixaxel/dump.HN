If I wouldn't vote, I would contribute to undermining the system I support. Contrastingly, the less other people vote, the more important my own vote becomes; if I were a democracy's last voter, I would make all the difference. What's not to like?",1225788677

I tried multiple times to understand linear algebra and every time I ended up at the picture in the first few pages of the book.  Each page built upon the previous page and there were no pictures to anchor on.<p>A year later I took an OpenGL class then a grad class in Computational Geometry.  Once I had pictures and application I was fine.  Morphing space and w/ matrix transformations and drawing in  it in OpenGL was all I needed to snap the semester of symbol manipulation into focus.  Strang to me was like man pages.  Great for reference, terrible for learning.",1225788210

353223,comment,353072,353072,0,0,swombat,,,"Summary: Joel Spolsky discovers that people matter more than processes.<p>I use fogbugz for my start-up's bug-tracking, and that's something I've ""felt"" through the application - Joel Spolsky (and, by extension, Fogbugz) believes in what I'd call the ""analytical"" approach to software development. I know that works for certain kinds of projects - I come from a big consulting background, and I've seen large projects being successfully delivered with those methodologies.<p>However, I think a not-so-new approach that also works, albeit with smaller teams, is the ""just have a handful of super-productive guys with a loose mandate and good motivation"" approach. This can be called ""agile"", but it's not quite that. Agile is not a lack of process - on the contrary, Agile can in fact be more process-heavy than traditional methodologies! This ""put great people first"" approach is what I'm using on my current start-up, and I believe it works great. You don't know where you're gonna end up or when, but you know that it'll be a great place and that it would have been impossible to plan your way there.<p>I wonder if larger corporations will ever adopt this model of development (which, imho, is far more effective, though so much less controlled).",1225788092

353211,comment,352540,352540,0,0,swombat,,,"I am a Swiss living abroad and I always vote by mail-in ballot. I don't vote out of a feeling of social obligation, I vote because I believe it does make a difference, however small, and that if I convince myself and people I know to vote, that difference keeps adding up.<p>If I didn't have the mail-in option, however, chances are I wouldn't vote - even if I was back home in Switzerland. I don't vote for a social perception, I vote because I care about the issues being voted about (note: we don't vote on people very often, we mostly vote on issues; I don't usually vote on people).<p>Obviously I can't argue with the results of the study. Perhaps mail voting does decrease voting likelihood. At the same time, I'd argue that people who vote out of a sense of social obligation rather than because they have an opinion on the issues at hand would be better off abstaining. If you don't care about the outcome, don't vote. Chances are, if you don't care, you won't have bothered to research the issues anyway, so your vote would merely be statistical noise or, worse, uninformed ""vote like my party"" trash. We're really better off without your vote then.<p>This article would be disturbing if it wasn't so pitiful. The only thing proven by this article is that the economist's perspective is awfully limited, and completely inapplicable when it comes to deciding how to behave in the ""real world"". If everyone behaved like economists as described in this article, most social functions wouldn't be able to exist, and we would probably soon devolve into a collection of pitiful warring tribes.",1225787339

How do you expect them to pay for services? And let's not forget that ""the government"" isn't some magic entity, it's made up of <i>the citizens</i> of the country itself. I'm pretty sure the US government employs more citizens than any other organization in the US.<p>I would say that many of the services and infrastructure the government typically provides are considered ""natural monopolies"". It doesn't make sense to have a bunch of parallel roads when you can have one. Same with water, electricity, etc. With the government providing a single ""set"" of infrastructure you may need X miles of road, pipe, power lines, or whatever, if you had 4 companies competing you would need 4 times as much, which would end up costing the end user 4 times more.<p>But in fact, the government doesn't have a complete monopoly on roads, since there are privately owned <i>toll roads</i>, which you have to <i>pay</i> to drive on. Would you prefer all roads were privately owned, and the owners could then charge arbitrarily high tolls?",1225786322

His standard reply is, that if he would have ever given way to ""compromises"" by being less ""dogmatic"", GNU/Linux would have never happened: it would be infested with proprietary blobs all the way through giving control to others, rather than you, the proprietor, to the detriment of your freedom. Maybe I  am wrong, but I tend to agree, if you compare the popularity of GNU/Linux vs. any other Unix, notably the FreeBSD and its variants.<p>Finally, I like the door knob analogy of Jeremy Allison:<p><a href=""http://twit.tv/floww14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twit.tv/floww14</a><p>to which e.g. Mark Shuttleworth would also subscribe: this is the only reason for the popularity and explosive growth of Ubuntu.
