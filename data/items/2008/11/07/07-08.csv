356534,comment,355659,355659,0,0,delackner,,,"I would really like to see more research on the relationship between metabolism and aging (not passage of time, but actual cellular aging, I think referred to as mitochondrial aging?)<p>I had thought that low metabolism, meaning a low pace, or clock to the body's energy consumption, would imply a slower aging action, but a cursory search on google immediately turned up some research that says it may be just the opposite: that high energy consumption (not food consumption, energy use by the body) in mice seems to lead to greater longevity...<p>Anyone with a more detailed understanding, please?",1226044607

You don't know which traditional ones would work if you don't try. And if you're big enough -- here's the magical part -- you can even get to try non-traditional routes that might just click. That's the whole point of drafting up business models and financial projections and replacing it when need be.<p>But if you can get 110 million users in 2 years, can cover overhead for 200 top notch engineers and a legion of sales/bizdev team as well as world class infrastructure, hey, I'm not going to be calling you out for not having figured out how to make money on it.",1226044603

356527,comment,356356,356356,0,0,jhancock,,,"What follows is a pretty harsh opinion, but I'm going to attempt to state it:<p>In the 80s when RICO laws were being extended to drug dealers, my strict judicial process viewpoint was that you simply cannot take away property prior to a conviction.  Over the years, many courts and subsequent laws have supported this practice and now its part of our legal fabric whereby many thousands of drug dealers have seen _all_ their assets seized prior to trial (and that includes anything they put in other peoples names).  A judge doles out from the seized assets to allow the accused to pay attorney fees throughout the legal process and if found guilty, the gov keeps the bounty.<p>As this practice has become standard and well vetted by our court system, I think its about time we start applying it to those that destroy our economic fabric and treat them in the same fashion we would treat a drug kingpin.<p>Ken Lay should have never had a house in Aspen to go to to die after being found guilty in Texas.  He should have had no assets and been escorted straight from the courtroom to a holding cell to await sentencing.<p>If Paulson and many thousands of others are found guilty of fraud or gross mismanagement or collusion, we should wipe out their entire fortunes in addition to the 5 to 20 years of prison time.  And God forbid we find out they illegally offshored some money...we'll need to tack on extra years for that.<p>I am a hard working entrepreneur.  I invent real things that create sustainable jobs and tangible assets.  People that only flip money around while defrauding investors should be treated the same as drug dealers.<p>I know many will think that those cheating the system are doing so ""semi-legally"" in that if there were no or few regulations, then they didn't technically violate the law.  However, most states have ""fraud legislation"" that defines fraud as ""what 12 members of a jury think it is.""  I think its about time we start putting some of these massively wealthy people that have fleeced the public in front of a jury of ""our peers"" and give them a fair trial.",1226043674

356514,comment,356050,356374,0,0,iigs,,,"I can't imagine PG directing that essay either toward a business the size of facebook now nor toward someone with the intent of telling them to get to facebook's size before having profit (let alone revenue) figured out. It's one thing to have an application and not have the price points figured out. It's an entirely different thing to not have any idea <i>at all</i> how you'd substantially monetize your customer base. In fact you might not even consider it a customer base but just consider it an expense base.<p>Of course I've nothing against charities. I think I might have a problem with it if I invested with the expectation of a <i>direct</i> ROI. The parent to my comment seems to contend (evidently? am I being trolled?) that it's ok to be five years into a business without not only not having a notion of how you might profit, but not even having a clear source for a plausibly profitable source of revenue.<p>On second thought spending money without the notion of a return is not even a charity, it's consumption.",1226041310
