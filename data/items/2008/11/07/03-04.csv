And they do it from ads, mostly.<p>If you gave away DRM-free music on an ad-supported site, and found a way to make people want to click those ads, you'd have a good model - providing you found a good way to provide DRM-free music that people wanted. For Facebook, the problem is that they took a long time getting an ad model to work. Their new one is a pretty effective one that takes advantage of the best parts of Facebook.

Because it worked for Google so incredibly. They forgot that Google works because they target massively relevant ads to people who are looking for links to begin with.<p>Interestingly enough, Facebook's revenue plan involves making money off of Live Search ads, as of the last month or so. Essentially, they're ripping off Google as honestly as they can: by emulating them.

356413,comment,356360,356401,0,0,unalone,,,"Yeah. The rule for Macs, I think, is that your app only should close if the window is inextricably linked to the function. iPhoto, for instance, where the window lets you look at pictures and modify photos, and that stuff happens instantly when you're looking at the window. When you close it, it means you're done using it.<p>With a music player, you should be able to close the window and still have the music play: the app is linked to the music, in other words, and not the window. Similarly, if I stop the music and close the window, it shouldn't close, because music being stopped is just as much a function of a music player as is music being played.",1226028523
