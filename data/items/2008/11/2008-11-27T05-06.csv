Seems like almost every car I rent is a GM, and I always notice something flaky or broken about it (which is sad considering they rarely have more than 20,000 miles or so).<p>I own a Toyota, but ended up driving someone else's Chevy for a while this weekend.  I couldn't believe how cheap all of the components felt, not to mention how much my body ached after driving it for 2.5 hours.",1227765124

To keep myself stimulated I am working on my native s-expression php syntax (I wouldn't call it ""a lisp"" but it does lend itself to much more elegant constructs and the ""transmogrifier"" [takes s-expresisons and fwrites to ""normal"" php including expansion of special forms] is written in php alone) hahah!",1227764584
378457,comment,377468,377468,0,0,tptacek,,,"We've got something similar in Ruby (we're not the first, and ours is nowhere nearly as mature as CorePy). We use it for building ad-hoc debuggers for reversing targets that don't support native debugging and tracing interfaces.<p>Ruby is an excellent language for this, because it gets out of the way. Here's a Rasm snippet:<p><pre><code>            @epilog ||= @prog.add {
                push ebx 
                mov ebx, retv
                mov [ebx], eax
                pop ebx
                xor eax, eax
                ret
            }
</code></pre>
Obviously, that's all pure Ruby.<p>Once you have a class mapping for each of the instructions in your target ISA --- <i>way</i> easier than it sounds --- getting your code to jump into a runtime generated buffer is pretty easy.<p>We're starting to throw code onto Github; I've been thinking about publishing this, but didn't think it would be very interesting, except as a hack.",1227764563

378440,comment,378003,378266,0,0,mahipal,,,"That is a really good looking app. I like the color / value overlay and the simple, clean interface.<p>Don't let the low first day sales discourage you. I saw my biggest spike on the 2nd day of sales. I think it has to do with how long it takes to percolate through to all the international App Stores.<p>If you just released yesterday, you should go into iTunes Connect and tweak your release date to reflect that. Your app is on the 3rd page of your category already, and that is going to severely hamper you sales. (The pages are ordered by release date by default.) I've noticed my sales decline as my app slips further back into the deeper pages of my category. Once you hit about page 10 or so, consider doing a trivial update so you can land back on page 1 of your category.<p>Lastly, for what it's worth, I think it's a little overpriced for what you're selling. Most of the apps that compete with you in this niche are at the 0.99 price point. In fact, there's one that's very similar (but much uglier) for free.<p>At any rate, I bought it and left you a 5 star review, since it does exactly what you claim. I feel every independent iPhone developer should have a few people setting the bar high on the first few reviews. Best of luck!",1227762563
