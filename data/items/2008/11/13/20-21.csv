Their education system has not yet caught up to the fact that the name of the game is ""value added"".<p>Also, now that ""peak credit"" has hit (shortly after peak oil last december) I do not see the trend of American families buying a brand new car every 1 to 2 years continuing.

Moreover, most programmers will simply use high level primitives from some library where concurrency is deep buried, so they won't need to worry about it at all.<p>I suspect that people that talk about everybody using concurrency by themselves haven't thought what the future applications will use CPU power for. 3D graphics, IA, image and voice recognition... all these applications are susceptible to be encapsulated in some black box and used through a simple API. In fact, how many programmers are using <i>right now</i> complex APIs? I think it's a tiny fraction.

If you never heard of the verb 'to be' or any of it's forms, and never thought in those terms, quantum physics would not contradict our intuitions.  Easterners raised on the I-Ching and Chinese language do not find quantum physics as counterintuitive as we do.  When viewing western portraits in art, Chinese pay more attention than westerners to the background and less to the object.  Never mind our intuitive sense, this 'cop-out' is what we keep seeing time and time again.  Our intuitive sense arises from the way the unconscious rules in our grammar shape our thinking.  It's not that our intuitive sense clashes with quantum physics, but the much weirder situation that any single sense we could possibly have about it does not conform to the experiential reality.<p>Far from being a cop-out, it's the bravest intellectual view you can take, and your only hope if you aren't down with the mathematics used in quantum physics.  I wouldn't take it quite as far as reading the papers as only 'we found cool math'.  Instead try 'we found experimental results such that no one set of mathematical models can (possibly!?) account for our experimental results.""",1226609020

I used Matlab for several years prior, but got really annoyed by the limits of the language when you try to do anything beyond matrix manipulation.  Python + scipy + pylab is a pretty effective replacement for matlab prototyping and data analysis, with a much better general purpose language and FFI.

Nearly all of the guys that work on SciPy and Matplotlib came from using Matlab in some capacity or another.  I've never worked with Matlab, but from the examples I've seen, I much prefer the Python version of things to the Matlab version.<p>I'll also mention that SciPy is in use at some of the biggest companies in the world, and because of its stronger programming language base, it can be used for much larger problem sets than Matlab.  Massive fluid dynamics computing projects, requiring clusters of machines, for example, is feasible (and being done) with SciPy.  Likewise for geological data analysis.
