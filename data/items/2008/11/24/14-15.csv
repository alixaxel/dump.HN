Removing the Glass-Steagall Act is a large part of why the government felt the need to dump 700billion in the financial markets.  We could let Leamon Brothers fail because they where not tightly coupled with the rest of the market, but AIG was tided up in so many market's they felt they had to save it.  Which IMO demonstrates why you need more regulation on large companies than small.  When a 50 person company fail's not much happens but when a 50,000 person institution fails the ripples spread throughout the market.<p>I think Sarbanes-Oxley was over regulation, but letting a 50+ billion$ company get leveraged 30x is stupid.",1227538224

Often times, you want to offer stock so that the people gaining the stock stay with you and have an investment in the acquiring company doing well with what they've bought.
