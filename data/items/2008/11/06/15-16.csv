355786,comment,355685,355685,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"It's worth knowing that David Bellamy claimed that he was no longer on television for other reasons (in 2002):<p>---\nHe tells me how he got talking to a man on a train some time before the 1997 election and told him he was torn between voting for Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour party and the Referendum party. The man told him he was an agent for the Referendum party, and soon after he got an invitation to lunch from Sir James Goldsmith, its founder. ""It was the most fascinating lunch I've ever had. A bloody good lunch. I said: 'Why have you suddenly become a goody after being a baddy?' And he said: 'You go into a fish restaurant and the fish are full of poison, and that's why I'm dying of pancreatic cancer.' And I said, 'Well, I don't think you can prove that.' And he said, 'No, I can't prove it, but you say some bloody stupid things too.'""<p>It was then that Goldsmith asked him to stand against Major. ""In some ways it was probably the most stupid thing I ever did because I'm sure that if I have been banned from television, that's why. I used to be on Blue Peter and all those things, regularly, and it all, pffffft, stopped.""<p>Actually, he says, his TV career had stopped some time before that - he made his last BBC series eight years ago. Perhaps he is too scruffy for telly these days, I suggest. He gives me a look. ""There are some bloody scruffy people on television these days. Very scruffy in what they think and the way they talk."" \n---<p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/sep/30/broadcasting.academicexperts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/sep/30/broadcasting.aca...</a><p>He tried to become Prime Minister of Britain running on an anti-Europe platform.",1225986901

Since we know Galileo was right, the reader is of course supposed to assume that Lomborg will also turn out to be right in the face of blind dogma. Therefore Crichton doesn't have to address the actual criticism towards Lomborg.<p>However if Lomborgs book is indeed bad science, then the strong rebuttal from scientfic circles is fair.<p>By the whole framing of the issue Crichton imples that it is SA and the ""consensus"" which is politicized. However Lomborg is himself a political figure (advisor for the right-wing Danish goverment in environmental matters). That does not make him wrong, but it implies we have to look at the actual content of the rebuttal to determine who has the better case.",1225986800

It's not that Americans have suddenly gotten genetically less intelligent in the last fifty years, but rather the reason our political system has fallen apart is (largely) because corporations came to control the media. Noam Chomsky has something to say about this in Manufacturing Consent.<p>In fact until fifty years ago working class Americans used to read the paper as much or more as upper class Americans. What happened is the papers of the rich started being subsidized by advertisers, so the working class papers couldn't compete and all went out of business. (Ads are worth much more in papers that target the wealthy, so the papers of the wealthy had a bigger ad subsidy, and thus sold for less money at the newsstand than the papers of the working class.) That's why poor people are largely illiterate and uneducated today, whereas only fifty years ago it was the working class that drove the progressive movement.",1225986492
