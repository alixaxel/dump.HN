364898,comment,364219,364886,0,0,rms,,,">Marriage is only meaningful because of the function it fulfills: provide a hospitable environment for reproduction.<p>That's where you are wrong. It's an issue of rights, not of function. Why would it make the slightest bit of difference if anyone cares about anything? It's just a word that you want to take away from people: separate but equal.<p>Lots of straight marriages don't exist for the purposes of reproduction. And no one reputable disputes that gay households raise children just as well (if not better, on average, because of higher incomes and older partners) than straight households. Why would you want the children of gay parents to be raised in unwed homes?<p>At this point, it's completely and entirely an arbitrary decision, made because people like you feel like there is something special about this word marriage that gay people don't deserve. The best solution is to completely eliminate marriage at the federal level: civil unions for all. But that obviously isn't practical. That leaves us with an obvious violation of the Equal Protection Clause in wake of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia</a>.<p>You know you are going to lose this issue in the long run. You can't win. Conservatives never win, because change always wins in the long run. We're about 12 years of voter demographic shift or 2 US supreme court seats from winning this issue that doesn't even deserve to be an issue.

Pretty much zilch, i.e. the number of people co-habitating vs marrying in England.<p>So, if gay people want an official marriage because marriage is special, they are undermining themselves by helping to destroy the institution they value.

(3) requires less code to do the same thing, which means fewer lines to document.<p>There are a bunch of great languages out there that are far more powerful (in terms of abstraction) than C++ or C.
