353040,comment,352248,352928,0,0,jerf,,,"Your last paragraph seems to imply that you believe that somebody, somewhere is claiming this result is ""real"". In fact, nobody claims the theorem has any applicability to ""reality"", because the real world is quantized. You can't cut an electron in half. (So far as we know.)<p>Everybody knows the theorem isn't real. Now, I'm not just being pedantic here, because the fundamental and obvious failure of the theorem to have any connection to the real world is at the heart of one of the philosophical questions about the nature of math it engenders, along with its good friend the Axiom of Choice. While there's nothing wrong  with either thing mathematically, does it really matter when anything that invokes the Axiom of Choice basically just opted out of concrete reality entirely?<p>Basically, I'm saying that the  contents of your post are true, but trivial; there's no interesting argument about correspondence to reality to be made. The fun lies at the next level. I have no easy answers for you there.<p>(Personally, I have no problem breaking math into ""Things that Might Be Practically Useful"" and ""Things to Entertain Mathematicians"", especially since the latter tends to migrate to the former at quite surprising times, but many people seem to have trouble with giving such a rich meaning to the single word ""math"".)",1225776288
