I personally only work through my network when I'm searching for a job.<p>The other key is to move fast. If you want one of these people, don't waste their time with phone interviews and things like that, just get them scheduled to come in as soon as possible.<p>At my last two companies we would bring people in for an afternoon of interviews and have an offer ready for them at the end of the day if things worked out.  That's the kind of process you need to have to snag people like this.<p>As a simple case study, the last time I decided to get a job I had 3 offers within two weeks.  All through my network.<p>Currently, I left my last startup in the middle of last week. I haven't started actively looking for something else to do yet, and I've already had one offer through my network.",1227567491

375575,comment,375417,375417,0,0,callmeed,,,"Yes, it works. How well it works really depends on a lot of things. It does take patience and you do need to know your market.<p>I actually think you don't need to be in a huge market to be hugely successful. We serve a niche market (professional photographers) and, by most accounts, are successful with strong growth.<p>We have 2 main products/services that have a monthly fee. The first isn't a true SaaS (it's more Saas+web hosting), but we have several thousand customers paying monthly.<p>Our most recent product (nextproof.com) is a true SaaS and is also doing well. We launched in June and should hit the 1,000 account mark early next year.<p>The thing I like about being in a smaller/niche market is that it's easier to find and present to your target market. If you're product is good, it will sell–you just need to make them aware.<p>Here's some things I would suggest based on experience:<p>* Find some ""connectors"" in your market and partner with them. Give them free accounts and VIP treatment in exchange for referrals
* If you need some cash up front, consider selling a limited amount of ""lifetime"" accounts. They pay $500 (or whatever) and get an account for life. We've done this and people jumped all over it.
* Explore the possibility of tweaking your app for even a smaller niche market.<p>I've got lots more ideas ... but that's where I'd start. But, yes, I'm a firm believer that it can work.",1227567304

If so, what kind and how are you dealing with them?<p>I wasn't sure what effects we would feel at the startup where I work (a ""high tech"" startup with physical products), as we already had a number of long-term contracts.  Our company is self-funded/bootstrapping and apparently has been getting loans to cover payroll.  This is where we've been hit, as we can no longer secure those same loans, according to the founder.  Needless to say, that's led to major work hours reductions for some and some layoffs (the chief engineer was the most expensive employee...).  They've put a lot of employees in a difficult position,which is that they don't think they can pay them (non-core employees) until the next product ships.  The problem is, of course, do you work now, hoping to be reimbursed (assuming the company will still be around), or go looking elsewhere...<p>Edit: What struck me was that this wasn't really a primary problem of our business (or at least our core technologies), but that we ended up getting hit by the wider credit problems anyway.<p>Any other stories?",1227564449

Don't look at 37s or JoelonSoftware as successful models-- they have built in advertising for their exact target market with their blogs/content.<p>Can you spare $500 to find out?  If so, do this:<p>1. Get an adwords account.
2. Research keywords with their keyword research tool.  Are people searching for what you're building?  How much advertiser competition is there?  This will give you some idea of demand (this part is free-- or $5 for the account setup).
3. Build a landing page that explains your value prop as best you can and your pricing.  Have a sign-up button that is BIG at the bottom that goes to a ""we're in private beta right now"" page with a ""give us your email address to get an exclusive invite"".
4. measure how many people click on the ad.  Then measure what percentage click on the signup button.  That's a pretty good indication of demand and pricing sensitivity.  The email is a bonus-- if you dash someone's hopes and they still are eager enough that they give you an email addy, then there might be some classic ""hair on fire"" problems that your purporting to solve.<p>Oh, and +1 for businesses.
