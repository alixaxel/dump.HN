353719,comment,353536,353536,0,0,tom_rath,,,"A piece of paper with boxes printed beside the names of those running for office -- we’ll call this paper a ‘ballot’.<p>The voter receives a ballot from those managing their place of voting (after showing identification or a registration card of some sort), has their name physically crossed off a printed list and then, after moving behind a screen or other mechanism to allow for privacy, places an 'x' in the box beside the name of the individual they are voting for.  The voter then folds the ballot and places it anonymously into a box used to collect the votes for their district.  A ‘ballot box’, if you will.<p>Once the polls close, volunteers for the place of voting manually count the paper ballots for the individuals running for office and report the count to a central election office.  This manual count rarely takes more than an hour or so to complete.<p>Simple enough?  Votes remain anonymous, the paper ballots create a permanent audit trail and, as long as the ballot boxes are supervised by reliable third-parties minimally affiliated with those running for office, the voter will be assured their vote is counted towards their intended result.<p>This is how most of the developed world handles elections.  It saves us a ton of trouble in close races.<p><i>""Premature optimization is the root of all evil -- Donald Knuth""</i><p>There are some things which should not be optimized.

353683,comment,353491,353491,0,0,shimon,,,"This article briefly hints at the less regulated internet transit industry.  I worked for two years at a company that sold competitive intelligence tools to large ISPs, and what I learned about the global telecom business was pretty eye-opening.<p>First, internet transit is incredibly competitive.  The protocols are designed from the ground up to support changes and redundancy in network routes, so there is not a lot preventing any company from switching ISP service aside from their contracts and the constraints of what wires reach their data center.  Because of this competition, prices are always getting lower and vendors are constantly working to reduce costs.  Geography is a very significant variable, of course: getting a lot of bandwidth in rural Idaho is going to be much much more expensive than getting it in New York, London, or Seoul because you won't have many options.  The most expensive, of course, is in markets that are regulated monopolies; many African countries have absolutely ludicrous bandwidth costs for the same reason they are expensive to fly to.<p>On the bright side, though, ISPs are constantly working to make the network more efficient.  One mechanism for this is peering, where two ISPs agree to exchange traffic that is bound for destinations on each other's network directly, rather than each individually paying their provider to do so.  It used to be that only large ISPs would bother to work our peering agreements among each other, but over the past 10 years peer-to-peer traffic has dramatically increased traffic between different ISPs in local and regional markets, so those smaller guys have learned to do peering as well.<p>What does all this mean?  I'm no libertarian, but it's hard not to be awed by the efficiency and power of the unregulated global internet.  For whatever reason, tens of thousands of companies are working together around the world in an amazingly cooperative and efficient way, even though many of them are fierce competitors.  We could certainly stand some of that in the domestic telephone market, and we'll probably get it eventually, if only because the cost of VOIP transit will probably round to zero within our lifetime.",1225822892

It's based on transcripts from Richard Feynman's conversations and is a funny but thought-provoking read (both should be read). It's probably the only book illustrating how a true genius was shaped through his life. He developed a serious lack of respect to authority, which is why he became such a monumental figure in science and probably the reason he was the only one on the Rogers Commission into the Challenge disaster that didn't trust NASA's engineers.<p>I'll explain his key point in the Rogers Commission. NASA engineers figured a rubber O-ring in the SRB's had a less than 1/50 chance of failing. So to avoid this they installed three O-rings, assuming that 1/50 x 1/50 x 1/50 = 1/125,000 chance of failure, or something equally ridiculous. In reality the rocket still had a 1/50 chance of failing because 1 O-ring failing would mean all would fail. He then showed that under the conditions of the Challenger launch the O-ring had a 1/1 failure rate; the NASA engineers ignored the fact that material strengths change below freezing, the O-rings shrank and allowed hot gases on ignition to burn through all 3 O-rings well below the temperature they were rated for.<p>I also have Jared Diamonds 'Collapse' on the go. Ender's Game and probably whatever else is on my bookshelf when it grabs my attention.<p>The most important book I've read was The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin. I was around 15 when I first read it. The story starts near the end of his life when the woman who's been trying to date him for years finally gives up and leaves. He progresses to the point where he's suicidal, but then he crosses a magicians house who he knows and goes in. The magician tells him, you can relive your life and try to make changes or you can work for me and actually change it. The rest of the book follows his life as a relives it with the knowledge of what's going to happen, but as he lives it (as the magician warns him) he gets so engrossed again that he makes the exact same mistakes and only realizes he knew what he did wrong moments later when he remembers. In the end he finds himself back at the Magician who basically says 'I told you so' and says if he keeps going back in time to try to fix things the universe will eventually overwrite him with someone who'll act. The magician then tells him he can either serve him for a hundred years (in a very devil-esque scene) or he can relive his life again and he won't intervene. He takes the deal with the devil and then the story ends.<p>This book made me realize that there were no second chances, and that just doing nothing wasn't an option. That summer (at 16) I got a job as a reviewer, I decided that I wanted to move to Canada and that I didn't have time to waste with the 'friends' I had. Now at 20, I've worked as a reviewer for 2 years, I've had a couple of short stories published and I'm currently writing my first novel while I can't work because I'm immigrating to Canada.<p>So for the last part of your question, I definitely think my life would be a lot worse if I didn't read. In fact, I don't think I'd ever have got the motivation to actually -DO- something. I'd probably be in university getting into debt and would have got stuck in the town where I grew up in England.",1225822230
