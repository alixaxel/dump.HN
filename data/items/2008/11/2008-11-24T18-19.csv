Do you see him as a way to get some high quality development done in a cash-poor situation, or do you see him as someone who would contribute in every possible way to the success of your startup?<p>If it's the first, then you're using equity as a way of paying him.  You're essentially saying: ""Your work would normally be worth $20,000 to me.  However, I don't have the money.  So I'd like to pay you in shares that have a chance at being worth a great deal more than $20,000 down the line.""<p>In the second case, you're saying ""I need a partner, especially one with a technical background.  I see you as having the ability to make this venture a success, in ways I can't even anticipate right now.  This is a very early stage startup, with all kinds of risk.  This thing will consume your life for at least a few years, so you'd be coming in as a cofounder"".<p>It can be pretty difficult to get well employed, well paid programmers to take <i>either</i> deal you're offering, but I'd say the second is probably the best bet in terms of getting him to agree to come on board.  Mainly because working equity usually means you end up working for nothing.<p>However, I would also caution you against making someone a cofounder simply because you need his tech skills and can't afford to pay him.

375144,comment,374722,374722,0,0,webwright,,,"Isn't this level of interviewing kind of excessive and time-expensive?  If I were Google, I would do the following:<p>1) Have the first interviewer be the best/most-appropriate interviewer for the position (manager, lead dev, whatever).  Have them write down in a sealed envelope a ""hire"" or ""no hire"" statement after the interview.<p>2) At the end of the assorted interviews, measure how often the first interviewer is correct in his hire/no hire assessment.<p>My theory is that interviewing is a great opportunity for ""thin-slicing"" (a la Blink) and that you'd get 98% of the value with 10% of the time invested.<p>Related anecdote (from gladwell dot com):<p>One of the stories I tell in ""Blink"" is about the Emergency Room doctors at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. That's the big public hospital in Chicago, and a few years ago they changed the way they diagnosed heart attacks. They instructed their doctors to gather less information on their patients: they encouraged them to zero in on just a few critical pieces of information about patients suffering from chest pain--like blood pressure and the ECG--while ignoring everything else, like the patient's age and weight and medical history. And what happened? Cook County is now one of the best places in the United States at diagnosing chest pain.<p>Not surprisingly, it was really hard to convince the physicians at Cook County to go along with the plan, because, like all of us, they were committed to the idea that more information is always better. But I describe lots of cases in ""Blink"" where that simply isn't true. There's a wonderful phrase in psychology--""the power of thin slicing""--which says that as human beings we are capable of making sense of situations based on the thinnest slice of experience. I have an entire chapter in ""Blink"" on how unbelievably powerful our thin-slicing skills are. I have to say that I still find some of the examples in that chapter hard to believe.",1227551829

To counteract our carbon emissions, you have to cut down and bury 10,000,000 km^2 of forest <i>per year!</i> Even if we do 1% of that, that corresponds with the average deforestation over the past century. That's an industry larger than the forestry industry, because we need to grow all of those trees, and then bury them.<p>Regarding global warming, it may not be catastrophic, but it's... absurd to call it a hoax. Average temperatures are rising. Do you have another explanation for the receding ice caps, then? Do you have a different prediction for the greenland glacier?

If the Greenland ice is melting then unless Antarctica is growing, the sea level will rise. According the geological record, the ice caps grow and retreat in a nonlinear way; suddenly, in other words. According to the wikipedia:<p><i>""If small glaciers and polar ice caps on the margins of Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula melt, the projected rise in sea level will be around 0.5 m. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet would produce 7.2 m of sea-level rise, and melting of the Antarctic ice sheet would produce 61.1 m of sea level rise.

375121,comment,374390,374984,0,0,gecko,,,"I honestly think most of it's just ignorance.  I don't honestly think that anyone who has used Mercurial in anger can seriously be unaware of merge customization, or of the fact that Mercurial has simple revision numbers in addition to hex codes, or that Mercurial can clone from HTTP, but I can definitely see missing those features if you just messed around with it for an hour when you were trying to evaluate the two systems.  Likewise, even someone who had used Mercurial fairly heavily could easily be unaware of Launchpad-like sites, or new back-ends in upcoming Mercurial versions and the like.  At any rate, I don't think that the bzr team is being malicious; just uninformed.<p>The one point that I do think they're guilty of intentionally bending the truth are their claims of speed.  bzr goes to great lengths to have more thorough history and merge tracking than either Mercurial or git.  It pays for that by being slower.  That's a perfectly viable trade in some cases, but bzr needs to own up to it.  Instead, rather than simply admit that bzr is slower, its supporters generally try to explain ways to get around the fact bzr is slow, and then claim that the slowness doesn't matter.  For example, initial clones (""bzr branch"") with bzr are simply atrocious.  A bzr supporter will tell you that you don't do clones that often, and besides, there are work arounds--e.g., since bzr works with whole-file hashes like git, it can share file objects and revisions across all of the repositories on your system, making branching repositories you've already brached at least once go more quickly, and for ones you've not yet, you can just download a tarball of an existing clone and use that as the base.  These arguments are weak, sidestepping the issue.  I'm reminded of git in its early days, when you had to manually run very, very slow gcs every once and awhile, and its supporters shot back with, ""Well, yeah, but you can totally just stick that in a cron job.""  Mercurial's not innocent, either; I remember its dev team trying to argue why it didn't need named branches, when everyone using git (including me!) thought that git's branching was one of its killer features.  bzr needs to do what those projects did: quit explaining away the bug, and just fix it.<p>bzr's merge algorithm is better than either Mercurial or git's, its GUI (QBzr) is best-of-breed, and its online operational mode makes it a drop-in replacement for Subversion for sites that are trying to migrate away from old habits slowly.  It also happens to be significantly slower than the competition, to the point that, much as I personally believe that Mercurial has a better power-to-usability ratio than git, I think bzr has a bad power-to-speed ratio compared to either git or Mercurial.  Whether you agree with my assessment is up to you.  I just wish that their comparison pages were more honest about what the trade-offs are.",1227550678

Instead of these top-down strategies, why not go completely bottom-up?",1227550260

But if I were part of a community which found such an article interesting, I would find it more useful in terms of understanding both the posters and the cultural nature of the submission to take the argument on face value and submit a few kindly-worded criticisms.

375106,comment,374747,374747,0,0,shimon,,,"Both Obama and McCain talked about improving/increasing regulation because that's what they thought the public wanted to hear.  Obama was able to do it more credibly, which helped his campaign.  He was always quite unspecific, though, leaving his administration the option of e.g. improving enforcement or oversight rather than just writing a bunch of new rules.  Obama never really promised to be a liberal, but both people who wanted to love him and people who wanted to fear him for that were able to hear what they wanted.<p>The lesson here is how important it is that politicians ignore their campaign promises.  In Alan Greenspan's book ""The Age of Turbulence"", Greenspan expresses surprise that the Bush administration wanted to follow through on the tax cuts and rebates they promised when the government was running a surplus even after that surplus was projected to vanish.  Other presidents, he recalled, were always willing to throw out campaign promises that no longer suited the circumstances.<p>This is where Obama's vagueness, stern rhetoric, and large margin of victory are reassuring.  We probably won't give him too hard a time if he doesn't add a bunch of regulations, or if he decides to change his tax plan a bit.  Hopefully this will help the experts do their job.",1227549966

If you wanted to do this as a startup what you'd need to do is to lure away someone who's specifically connected in the lighting industry.  I think access to the distribution channels would be much more important than money -- and I'm not even convinced that if you did have money that you could automagically solve the distribution problem.  There are of course fabrication expenses, but I can only assume that the original poster has taken those into account.",1227549912

Think about it when every startup starts launching their each feature announcement on Hacker News?<p>Just because you are a YC alumni startup, does it make sense to launch every feature here?<p>Another thing which annoys me about YC startups is - to get immediate attention, they add ""(YC Summer/Winter 08/09)"" in the title of their post, and other YC alumni vote up immediately. And the post comes to the front page. I'm tired of these tricks!<p>Please, there are many startups launching many features every single day. Launching search feature is not a news. Launching a startup is a news. So I would appreciate if you can limit such releases to your blog only. If we are interested, we will follow your blog for feature releases.<p>Please don't take this personally.
