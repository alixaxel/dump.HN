379214,comment,378927,378927,0,0,cturner,,,"I have more success with pyinstaller than py2exe because it's not targeted at a particular target platform. There is a complication where you need to configure pyinstaller itself for the target platform and then build the app. I scripted this though and now it builds seamlessly every time I need my app (which uses wxpython as well) to support a new platform.<p>I found this more practical than having different packaging systems for each platform. With those scripts I can now package even for systems I have zero experience with but which python runs on (e.g. AIX, HPUX, QNX).",1227863899

As long as we allow politicians enormous and ever-increasing power to pick winners and losers and grant special favors to friends and interest groups, the money will keep flowing into the system.  Money flows to power (as long as it remains a good investment).  The problem is the unrestrained power, not the money.",1227863259
