369247,comment,368580,368580,0,0,syntax-case,,,"> Ultimately, this is why I like Python. The belief that best practices shouldn't be optional, and that they shouldn't be difficult creates a community where you actively want to go and learn from people's code.<p>This place I know was one of the earliest adopters of Python, and the code they barfed up must be the buggiest, ugliest (GUI), slowest in its class software I've ever seen. It's so buggy, it's insane: typos, calling methods that don't exist, assuming arbitrary user input does not have 'keywords' in them...<p>They couldn't write code in C, so they thought the problem was with the language and switched to Python.<p>I say, lousy programmers, if they don't want to look for another occupation, should stick with Java - at least the typos will be caught more frequently.",1227076225

369243,comment,368476,369158,0,0,tsally,,,"Fair enough, and perhaps I am being a bit too harsh. :-)  I would point out that I haven't wished anything but the best for this guy, and have congratulated him several times in my comments.  I also like seeing a Second City showing in downtown Chicago as much as the next guy :-).  I can't say I have any specific criticisms with regard to entertainment.  What bothers me is when things of little value are assigned a very high value.<p>I will say this: entrepreneurs are people with particularly powerful talent; with that power comes a responsibility.  Imagine the choice between developing a Facebook application that lets friends buy digital icons of drinks for their friends (why not just real drinks :-p) versus an Facebook application for FreeRice [1].  A responsible entrepreneur would develop the FreeRice application, even though profit might be smaller.  A more concrete example can be seen in Google.  They own the most valuable piece of real estate on the internet (their homepage), yet they don't monetize it.  Their restrictions on content on AdSense are stricter than they are required to be by law.  The list could go on.<p>As tdavis pointed out, there will always be people looking for a quick buck.  Let them monetize the things that don't really matter.  Instead, skilled entrepreneurs should tackle the more difficult problems and monetize things that create value and have real impact on lives.<p>I may be stretching your analogy, but I would compare Google search to the works of Claude Monet and most Facebook/AppStore applications to paint by number.  If the media keeps sensationalizing paint by number, eventually people will believe in it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://freerice.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freerice.com/</a>",1227075761
