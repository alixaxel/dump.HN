367976,comment,367554,367554,0,0,scrollinondubs,,,"so this is not < 64 words and less of a description of OO and more to your solicitation of ""inspire me"" of why you should care about it.  The critical distinction IMHO:<p>Procedural programming is like a recipe- you program a sequence of instructions and while there can be if/then, loop and other logic constructs, it still runs like a ""choose your own adventure"" book. Since you have an imperfect view of the world and how requirements will evolve and you're providing what are essentially sequential instructions, it's brittle and unforgiving to unanticipated requirements.<p>OO is less about writing instructions and more about creating a representation of the world (or at least the aspects you care about) as objects and having them interact with each other to achieve things. Because you're modeling the entities involved and having them interact rather than imposing a prescriptive set of instructions from above, it's cleaner and more resilient to unanticipated requirements.<p>Granted it's overkill to use OO for simple tasks when a script will suffice. But if you're building a system that involves interaction of different entities and will need to be adapted & maintained it will almost certainly be more productive to use an OO approach. Btw, I found this book provides the most concise and useful primer on OO I've seen: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Object-Technology-Managers-David-Taylor/dp/0201309947"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Object-Technology-Managers-David-Taylo...</a><p>sean",1226991128

I'm not sure whether $375 is fair in that respect - I'd have to see the math.<p>But what I find disturbing (and inflammatory) about this post is the accusation of 'protection racket'. By Arrington's logic, the following would also be protection rackets:<p>1. The driving license assessment fee, for operating a motor vehicle on public roads.<p>2. Assessment fees and membership fees paid by professional coaches (e.g. to make sure your ski instructor is up to standard)<p>3. The requirement that porn stars have regular STD test to minimize infection. These are paid for out-of-pocket by the actor.<p>I am glad that we have all the above three, and am happy to see Facebook App verification added as a fourth.<p>It is however important to ensure that the cost is reasonable. Perhaps Facebook could allow developers the option of having their app verified by a 3rd party? That way market forces would make the pricing 'fair'.",1226990964

Also, fundamental to the understanding of composites is the transmission of loads from the fiber to the matrix. This load is transferred via shear pressures along the length of the fiber at the interface with the matrix. The net result is that the load is transferred along a very large area and results in a low shear pressure in the matrix. Composite engineering is a tricky business, but even with current fiber materials, you can build a part that has ~7 times the strength/weight of metals, much lower modulus of elasticity, and a linear fatigue curve.<p><i>you need to construct the...counterweight in space as well...and we don't have an elevator to GET it there until we make the first one</i><p>Most current plans actually unwind the tether from the middle. Then, in much the same way as cables are strung across canyons starting with a bow and arrow and a string, this initial tether is just strong enough to haul up another larger line, and so on. A single launch using any of the heavy lift vehicles in service today would be sufficient to launch the starting material into a suitable orbit.",1226989203

At 150 times the tensile strength of steel, for example, you could make a pressure vessel that holds 150 times the pressure that you can with steel. Taking the densities as similar (sigma/rho is the relevant parameter) that should make pressure-fed rockets not just viable, but hugely preferable to turbo-pump-fed systems. It seems like you'd recoup your capital outlay much more quickly, even if you did (eventually) use more material to launch an equivalent mass of payloads.<p>For reference, in Engines of Creation (iirc), Drexler outlines a personal launch vehicle that weighed ~100 lbs and could lift a single occupant to leo with one stage.
