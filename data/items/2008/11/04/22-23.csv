I did a lot of creative writing in college and beyond, and the spectrum for what works is exceptionally wide.  Some people are paralyzed without an extremely detailed outline and keep almost everything the write, while other people fill hundreds of pages with no planning and slowly filter out the words, expecting nothing more than a few dozen usable pages.<p>Software is usually more collaborative than writing, so it's not quite the same thing... but in the end, maybe we shouldn't be surprised when talented people end up producing great things with almost contradictory approaches, and when talented people using similar approaches often produce great results and total catastrophes.<p>Programming is still mainly art, after all.  The only thing that really matters is that you actually <i>do</i> it, and you finish it.  There was the advice I read: ""you have to write, you have to finish what you write, and you have to publish what you write.""",1225837616

It would be more cost effective to use sawdust from wood mills, corn stalks, etc (things normally seen as waste materials) to make fuel than it would be to go out and chop down trees.  Not only would you have to expend a lot of energy to chop down the trees and transport them, but you would have to process them into a more usable form.  I doubt it would work well to simply coat an entire tree with a fungus and wait for it to be decomposed.  You would want to grind the tree up into smaller bits to increase the surface area the fungus has to grow on .",1225837374

353951,comment,353309,353502,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I totally disagree with this! It isn't a fault of the curriculum, it's the fault of your teachers. I had my entire HS/college education in India. And if I may say so, I would put myself in the ""exceptional"" category as well: I was in the international math olympiad, and rarely scored less than 100% in school tests.<p>Anyway, I found the math classes thoroughly enjoyable. The teachers pretty much let me do whatever I wanted as long as I didn't disrupt the class. I'd usually be a few chapters ahead, or helping out the kid next to me, or something like that. Very often, the curriculum was challenging even for me. We had Fermat's infinite descent in the eighth grade! I distinctly remember ruler and compass construction problems in my ninth grade that I'd have great trouble solving even now.<p>The good thing was, the super-hard parts that I've mentioned were all optional and were never on the exams. It worked out perfectly -- students who were both smarter than average and self-motivated would spend most of our time on those parts. My teachers were happy to answer my questions about that stuff after class, even though it was irrelevant as far as our grades were concerned.<p>One teacher in particular was amazing. She rewarded outside-the-box thinking, and if there was more than one way to solve a problem, she let us present them all. She acknowledged when she was wrong. Damn, writing this has made me all nostalgic and want to find her and thank her :-)<p>One time, I was working through a textbook that was two or three grade levels ahead. I had a question that she couldn't answer right away. She went home, did her research, and helped me out the next day. How awesome is that?<p>We had one horrendously bad teacher. They fired her after two months.<p>Some other great memories.. we all learned to program in the fifth grade. That was tons of fun. A computer cost more than a building back then in India :-) Vector calculus in the ninth grade. And so on.<p>Of course, everything except math and science was a disaster, but there's no way there was anything wrong with the math curriculum. I'm quite aware that 90% of my friends at other schools had completely unmotivated teachers, but again, not a fault of the curriculum.",1225836927

In fact I went down the the LA public library and picked up 10 stellar titles just this weekend, I highly recommend all of these:<p>- Perspectives on Free and Open Source Software [MIT]\n- Prisoner's Dilemma [William Poundstone]\n- Thinking Strategically [Nalebuff]\n- Co-opetition [Nalebuff]\n- Cluetrain Manifesto [Searls]\n- Open Sources 2.0 [O'Reilly]\n- Innovator's Dilemma [Christensen]\n- Net Worth [Hagel]\n- Democratizing Innovation [von Hippel]\n- Fooled by Randomness [Taleb]<p>Other books I always keep around are ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"" (a history of DJ's and electronic music), The Singularity is Near, and some Calvin and Hobbes ;-)<p>All the reading is most definitely worth it, if you don't feel that way you're not reading the right stuff.<p>The best book I've ever read is probably Anna Karenina (Magarshack translation, not the Oprah version, which is ironically much drier).  Other very influential books on me include The Wealth of Networks, Shaping Things, and Free Culture.  In fact, all 3 of those were given to me at different times in my life by the smartest person I know (a family friend of my parents)<p>Maybe the key to the non-fiction reading is having an agenda.
