However, there is a good reason why I haven't just skipped schemas (schemae?) One to Six. There are a lot of people in the world who actually think like this. This is their for-real, no-joking conception of ""marriage"". They do not grasp that men and women are interchangeable, as a result of which homosexual marriages create repulsive integrity problems in their heads. ""But if they're both guys, which one is the wife?"" How sad.</i><p>-- And this:<p><i>Finally we are reaching something which is non-stupid and non-sexist enough that it might actually exist somewhere in reality. This schema is reasonably sensible assuming you live in a fairly God-fearing administrative district.</i><p>-- And this...<p><i>As an aside, I have actually considered that laws against (or implicitly disallowing) gay marriage are, actually, sexist. For example, suppose I lived somewhere with antihomonuptial legislation. As I am a man, any woman in that district has the right to marry me. (As well they should.) But any man in that district who wanted to marry me does not have that right. The women have a right which the men do not have. Likewise, if there was a nubile woman nearby, I (and any other man) would have the right to marry that woman. But any nearby woman would not have that right. The men have a right which women do not have. Sexist!<p>Anti-gay-marriage laws throw a very real legislative dividing line between two sets of people on the world, and say, ""all marriages must cross this line"". But any law which divides men from women is clearly sexist, and, as I've stated above, closed-minded towards unconventional gender assignments who don't clearly fall on either side.</i><p>And there's plenty more I won't quote for the sake of brevity.  The article has a full freaking ASIDE with personal opinion weighing into the issue of gay marriage, it's pretty damn obvious this is just political opinion.

If you want I am sure you can find some webhost that offers you some webspace + domain name for around 20$. Will that be a very good webhost with lots and lots of space/traffic?

I wrote it off as me just not paying enough attention to e-mails and notices.<p>Then I realized right near the end of college that I was actually was missing a significant portion of my e-mails. This was due to the fact that while I normally used the webmail client, one time I had logged into the Exchange client to try it out. Apparently when that happened my e-mail was being randomly grabbed by whichever server was the quickest at that particular moment. Since I never checked the Exchange account I didn't realize until after the fact that it contained hundreds of important e-mails that would have made my college life much easier if I had known about. I'll, I'm probably partially to blame if I missed some warning somewhere during the process that indicated that this could happen.<p>Still though, I would have much preferred not having to deal with the school's e-mail system so this type of change is definitely for the better in my mind.<p>Edit: Plus, as others have mentioned, you generally lose access to that e-mail address once you graduate, meaning you need to transition all your contacts to a new account anyways.",1227291733
