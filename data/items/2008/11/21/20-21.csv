372317,comment,371880,372282,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I actually don't drive :) But based on my experience in that car plant, here are some pointers, just IMHO:<p>- Avoid Pontiacs at all costs. The quality difference between, say, a Sunfire and a Chevy Cobalt is <i>ridiculous</i>. Even ""higher end"" cars like the G6 are somewhat questionable. Chrysler are built cheap. The radiator motor that I worked on while I was there was timed to stop working after about 4-5 years (brushes in the motor will wear out).<p>- Avoid anything built in Mexico. This is not a knock against Mexicans, but my company's Mexican plant was completely devoid of precision manufacturing. Where an American plant would laser-guide parts into their fittings, in Mexico they're <i>literally</i> eyeballed (and malleted!). A full 80+ percent of warranty returns were due to parts built in Mexico.<p>- The high-end Chryslers are actually pretty good in terms of quality, and when I was working there the Ford Fusion was still under development - and based on what I saw (of the radiator design) Ford seemed like they were willing to pay for good parts. A good sign I suppose.<p>- <i>Nothing</i> beats Mercedes and BMW in quality. You do get something for your money, regardless of what people might say. Whether the cost per unit-quality is low enough for you is your own decision though :) Where GM was running brush motors, BMW runs entirely brushless (e.g. theoretically infinite lifetime, will run as long as your solid state electronics and assemblies hold together), and they're powerful to boot.",1227300832

Doesn't that break any model of using lambdas and list comprehensions?<p>That's ok. Sharing is fine; references are fine. If you and I point to the same string, the fact that the string says ""Hello"", we don't need to have 2 copies of ""Hello"", we can share the same copy, so long as we don't change it. It's not sharing that's the problem, it's effects. If you share references to values that are immutable, everything is cool. If you share references to mutable values and you mutate them, everything is very uncool.</i><p>I got my ass bitten in python by this a few times, i had a few objects with a few references to them, and i assumed that all of them pointed to the right objects, but i soon discovered that some of them pointed to copies of the objects from a previous time, and that they staid the same, while the other ones changed, and i assumed they all had the same value. This took a whole day to debug, and i managed to do it by writing the program in a functional way and the functions that changed the state of the objects simply returned new objects, and i got rid of the references, i just called functions, that returned the current ""state"" of the objects. pretty much i minimized state, that got rid of the bug and made the game easier to understand, as Mr.Jones points out, learning a functional language(scheme in my case) does make your imperative programing better :D",1227300680

In fact, build several (requires access to a very extensive machine shop, and unless your founders are all exceptionally talented machinists, you have to pay unionized labour more money to get this done)<p>- Now build several hundred more prototypes. These will go through performance and reliability testing. This will require access to heat testing chambers, sound testing labs, strength testing machinery... you name it. Each of these labs can't really be rented, and cost tens of millions to build and staff.
