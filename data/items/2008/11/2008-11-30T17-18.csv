Where as previously you may have been shy to tell your hosting company you can only pay $100 instead of $600, now you may have NO OTHER OPTION but to pay $100 instead of $600.<p>Of course the hosting company can refuse and pursue another route such as collection. But from my experience, most small businesses aren't looking to pick a fight if you talk to them genuinely and explain your situation. In hosting, this is even more true because it is a high margin business. ie. the $600/month you are paying may only be costing the provider $50/month.<p>We have weathered similar situation on more than one occasion in last one year. What has usually worked for us is to go ""broke"": tell the folks you need to pay that you cannot pay until x date or that you can only pay $y/month. Most vendors will work with you especially if you have been doing business with them for some time.",1228067272
380962,comment,380758,380815,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Is it news that a government agency is poorly run and corrupt? Look, one-third of Medicare equipment expenses are fraudulent. The executive branch gives out no-bid contracts to firms that used to employ its top members. The Pentagon has lost track of hundreds of billions of dollars, and NASA its billions.<p>In general, our response to a corrupt bureaucracy is to make it bigger in hopes that it will still get the job done despite the waste and graft.<p>It's nice that they are conducting these kinds of internal reviews. However, the FBI did one such review and determined that it had improperly used its PATRIOT Act powers 1,000 times for every time it used it properly. I don't think much changed after the report.",1228067252

380949,comment,380681,380681,0,0,jherber,,,"Amusingly horrible question.  Functional programming languages don't typically have class-based or prototype mechanisms, so why on earth would a named set of object interaction mechanisms be relevant - let alone displaceable?<p>I also think it is funny the status quo in language design is to effectively combine objects and functions but programmers and writers are not acknowledging this  fusion.  Ocaml, Javascript, F#, Scala, Ruby, Nemerle ... with varying ease, these languages all let you create lambdas, compose functions, functions as values.  Even mainstream languages like C# and Java are awkwardly moving in this direction.<p>Scala does some crazy stuff to make ""fusion"" interesting.  They allow objects in pattern matching by providing a specific mechanism for allowing an object to expose encapsulated behavior (extractors).  Functions all belong to a parametric set of classes and have an ""apply"" method e.g. def add(x:Int,y:Int) = x+y is really Function2[Int,Int,Int]{ def apply(x:Int,y:Int):Int = x + y }.  Likewise, any class or singleton object can invoked as a function by providing an ""apply"" method implementation.",1228066069
380948,comment,380823,380879,0,0,trominos,,,"Dunno about that.<p>I read the first seven (I think) chapters of Outliers, and I can only remember Gladwell using two statistically relevant pieces of information: that sports players are born close to the cutoff line for their sport, and that violinists who have a chance to become virtuosos have uniformly practiced about 10000 hours, while the merely ""good"" ones have practiced about 8000 hours and the bad ones have practiced 4000 hours. (Incidentally, I don't really believe the second one -- because it implies that all kinds ""effortful practice"" are exactly as efficient as one another.) I'm not saying that there weren't others, just that I can't remember them.<p>I can remember at least eight statistically irrelevant anecdotes, though, and certainly I think anecdotes (and boilerplate) made up at least 80% of those first seven chapters. Plus his anecdotes kind of sucked. The Beatles prove the 10000 hour rule? Okay, I guess. Bill Joy? I don't really think so. Bill Gates? Hell no.",1228065843

380943,comment,380823,380823,0,0,petercooper,,,"Andrew Orlowski has made the typical geek mistake of dismissing the value of presentation in relation to content. Gladwell may well twist soft scientific insights into ""intellectual comfort food"" (as said by Alex3917 above) and this might not be particularly challenging or clever, but it's easy to read, gets readers, and gets most of us thinking about the bigger picture. He's just joining dots in a way that helps idea and an interest in social sciences to flow.<p>Gladwell, Godin, 37signals, Merlin Mann, pg, Hugh MacLeod and 1001 other well known pundits and ""idea spreaders"" do not claim to be making significant scientific discoveries. They are the lubricant of science, programming, design, management strategies, creativity, or whatever their respective niche is. They give us ideas that are easily digested but then force us to consider our own positions and ideas on their ground. This is valuable in itself.",1228065404
