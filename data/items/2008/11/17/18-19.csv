I am down at Supercomputing 08 with Tom and others and we will be discussing this topic on a panel this evening,.  The discussants include NVIDIA and Intel (and SUN and IBM and AMD) so clearly this is an issue of concern to ALL computer manufacturers.  If you are in Austin - come to room 10B this evening (Monday, Nov 17).  If you are not, we are doing a live webcast on the subject <a href=""http://is.gd/7Rvz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/7Rvz</a> on Thursday Nov 20.  \nI would love to be able to carry discussion on this topic further.  One idea  would be an open forum using some kind of internet voice/text app.  Not sure which yet.  I know I could drag some Intel folks and I'm pretty sure I could get a few folks from elsewhere in the industry and acacdemia to join in.  Maybe we could even make this a semi-regular and continuing discussion on broader topics – you guys clearly have both the opinions and the savvy.  So let me know -post something on my blog if you like the idea <a href=""http://is.gd/7RyX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/7RyX</a> and we'll figure out how to make it happen.\n.",1226946526

My argument was very straightforward and you haven't taken the time to understand it.<p>Besides, you can't tell something to evolve.  You can tell someone to intelligently design something, though.  Is that what you mean?",1226946219
367158,comment,364219,365113,0,0,yters,,,"Thanks, that's more helpful.  I can see I wasn't as informed as I should be, but none of the previous arguments seemed so convincing.<p>But still, does a gay relationship need all the same rights as a marriage?  I don't know the details of the law, but I suspect that many of the rights civil unions do not have are in reference to providing a good environment for families.<p>So, I still stand by my original thesis, that the intent of marriage as an institution is primarily for reproduction, so a gay relationship doesn't require the same rights.  I'll do more research to determine whether I'm right, but if you happen to have any info that can help I'd appreciate it.<p>Also, in response to matt and unalone's point, yes they are not equal and should not be because they are not functionall equal.  Your position just begs the question when it comes to the crux of the debate.  If marriage is functionally defined, then relationships that don't accomplish the same function shouldn't have the same rights and societal support.  Really, how difficult is this for people to understand?  Show me anything else with the same level of institutional support for something as ephemeral as ""love,"" and I'll buy the argument that marriage is essentially about love.",1226946081
