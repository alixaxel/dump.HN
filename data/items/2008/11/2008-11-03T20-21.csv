If you can send the same thing in a smaller package, this means you can fit more packages in a singe shipment to the warehouse, ship more things from a warehose to the distributor, and also send more things in a delivery truck at the end of the delivery process. Everyone saves along the way, meanwhile the customer gets a ""furstration free"" package, which truthfully, is probably easier to open, incidentally.",1225745758

Therefore your example implying that XML was the wrong choice for KnitML is based on a lack of understanding about what the language's intent.<p>Also, you seem to imply that an ""extra 30Mb in software"" has something to do with the fact that it's processing XML. That is a pretty wild assumption and is simply not true. First of all, the 30Mb is in reality too large because of a Maven bug which duplicates JAR file dependencies in a ZIP archive. The true size of the app is about 15Mb (and the upcoming release will in fact be much smaller). Secondly, JiBX is the only third-party code which does XML processing. The rest is built into the JDK.

352445,comment,352069,352069,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There are a handful of companies in YC (aside from my own) that I would love to personally invest in (if I were in the position to invest).  Weebly is definitely near the top of the list, and was from the first moment I saw it during Winter '07.  They're totally pragmatic, and just get things done...not one information astronaut in the bunch.<p>And they work in that space where nobody wants to be: technology for newbies.  A couple of folks in this thread are criticizing Weebly for the very things that make it so explosively successful.  I'd advise anyone who thinks they're smarter than the Weebly folks to pause for a moment, and think about traffic, and what it means for there to be 1 <i>million</i> websites at Weebly.  That's one million occasions where someone browsed to the site, filled out the form, and went through the process of creating a website.  How many people have signed up for your web application?  How many made it to actually using it to do real work?  And how much money does your app make if you imagine 1% of those users being willing to pay you a monthly fee?  When the number of people committed enough to create something with your site reaches a million, you almost can't <i>not</i> make money with it.",1225742702
352444,comment,352199,352328,0,0,chime,,,"Correct. But where does the WOE ID come from? Are people manually typing those in or they are using something like <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/</a> to come up with the WOE ID? If WOE ID is generated based on latitude/longitude of a place, then all they are doing is a plotting data originally retrieved from their own DB.<p>Say I have a table of 40,000 zipcodes in US. You take a picture in zipcode 33708 and ask me for WOE ID / state and I say ""Florida"" and then you upload the picture. Now do this ten million times for every zipcode. Now I will look at every picture with WOE ID / state = Florida and find a list of zipcodes and map them. Obviously they will map out the entire state of Florida. After all I gave you all the state names.<p>Not that this isn't cool or anything. Just trying to determine how cool it is. If they had used latitude/longitude + tags to generate this, then it would be super-cool indeed. But if they did it by the method above that I described, it is cool but it's also a big ""duh.""",1225742668

I think he might be trying to turn ""Smart, and gets things done"" into a two-tiered system so you can clearly decide that, in some cases, it's okay to go with the bright guy with an unimpressive resume, and in others, you really need to dig for someone who is exceptionally talented and has enough experience to teach rather than learn.",1225742632

Unless somebody directly tells me about them, there is no way I'd find them.<p>I was thinking of creating a platform where users can create a brand page giving information about the brands history, products, reviews etc. Each brand will have links to ""similar brands"" so that they can all be connected in  one giant web of insanity :p (my biggest struggle is that once i find a cool brand, its hard to find others like it).<p>I think a cool business model would be something similar to Yammer and giving brands the ability to claim their page, they can then produce updates and notifications for users who are interested.<p>I know fashion is about as far away as you can get from hacking, but this is a super group and I'd appreciate any help you can  give.<p>Thanks",1225742591
