However you want!<p>The first few chapters of Paul Graham's `On Lisp' does a great job covering closures, which can provide elegant encapsulation. But even in Java or C++, objects aren't the only modular or reusable components - consider packages or name spaces, for example. Data types such as streams, arrays, and trees don't have to be classes, either - take a look at Haskell's data types.",1226980743

I think that it's the pro-welfarists and socialists that seem to have a problem accepting that.<p>To me, wanting minimal government interference in private choices is purely a matter of practicality, not one of morality. I'd prefer that the government not be a nanny to the entire population, constantly at the ready to wipe the nose and dry the tears of anyone who gets hurt. I do agree that <i>if</i> the government is going to serve that purpose, then they'll pretty much have to take away the rewards for good choices, as both a disincentive to take large risks and equally importantly, because it's going to be damned expensive to prop up everyone who chose poorly, someone's got to pay for it, and only those who chose well can afford it.<p>We're pretty far afield of hacker news at this point, and I suspect we understand each other views at a gross level and simply disagree on where the optimal point for a society's government to strive for is located. If it's any consolation, despite having made good choices, I have no say or sway in the matter and that people who think more like you are in power and are determined to wipe the noses that ""need"" wiped and dry the abundant damp eyes, so you'll get your way anyhow...",1226979155

Yahoo's search engine is their main product but really they collect a lot of data, use it to provide useful services, and then try to monetize it- like Google.  They are both really information companies, not just search engine companies.<p>When I said their product isn't the same I meant they are no longer the main info collectors of the web.  When considered on the international stage they are still players, however, they have a downward trajectory right now- Google is gaining on them and has all of the momentum.<p>Consider this: Yahoo is #1 in the WORLD based on traffic (Alexa.com).  But nobody will touch their stock?  The writing is on the wall.  Like I said, there is a downward trajectory there.  Good companies find a way to leverage a #1 ranking into dollars and dominance.
