If they didn't keep adding new stuff, everyone would complain that they were stagnant and falling behind the times. So they add popular new features to C# like lambdas and such, and now they're bloated.<p>4.0 will not essentially be a dynamic language. They're making it much easier to interop with dynamic languages by adding some dynamic constructs, but it's still as statically typed as ever. 'dynamic' is a shortcut to save you time, not re-invent how you work with C#.",1226887161
366493,comment,366151,366439,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Yup. The $1,000/month comment is only to show that it can be done, not that I'd want to only have that level of income. But it provides flexibility by letting you start small. I need to keep my day job for a while because it will be a long hard slog before my side business can come remotely close to providing me the income I need :-(<p>The stuff I build is industrial monitoring devices, so I purchase off the shelf Bluetooth-serial interfaces and incorporate them into my products. Google the Sena (Parani) and Roving Networks products. They are easy to use and reliable. Being able to monitor a process without needing to run cable to it is a killer app waiting to happen!",1226887097
366492,comment,366151,366151,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"His comments on undercutting Sega are exactly incorrect. You, a random developer, have little expenses and can stand to make $50k off of an app. Sega, on the other hand, has a ton of expenses, spends probably millions just to make a Super Monkey Ball, and can't afford that.",1226887056

In other words, how do we measure what we're doing? This question begs another set of questions, which is: What do you value? Do you value what you do? More often than not, I find money as a poor system indicator for determining the value of what people are <i>doing</i>.",1226886422

There are people with philosophical objections against say genetic treatment for diseases, and I think certain developmental disabilities will remain with us for a long time.<p>(Plus, oftentimes people who are immensely smart in one respect are lacking in others, so perhaps there will always be room for, say, math savants who can do little else.)",1226886040

Plan A needs to build something and get it out there - it needs to be the plan where you work hard and deliver.<p>If Plan A involves others coming to the party (e.g. a sudden investment) you're tying yourself to too many intangibles. Plan B should be ""what if some investment comes along""?.. Your plan A needs to be flexible enough to accommodate these things when they come along - they can't be built-ins.<p>In my view - Plan A needs to be the most likely, if slightly pessimistic scenario.",1226885790
366474,comment,366193,366193,0,0,frankus,,,"I understand where he's coming from as an investor, but it's kind of a shame that there doesn't seem to be a mechanism by which these sorts of features can be turned into reality.<p>Companies can't really accept unsolicited ideas from the general public due to the IP can-of-worms that that opens, and it's a huge amount of mostly wasted effort to build a company that's essentially a clone of another firm but with this one extra feature.<p>Unfortunately you can't un-know an idea once someone tells you it and you decide it's not worth what they wanted for it. And nine times out of ten it's probably not worth what they wanted for it in the first place. So maybe the problem is inherent.<p>One probably-unworkable solution would be a sort of IP escrow company, where, say, Facebook tells them every idea they've ever had, and when an unsolicited idea comes in, they compare it against the list and advise Facebook whether it's worth paying for. But conflicts of interest in that sort of setup are probably unavoidable.",1226885633

366471,comment,366233,366233,0,0,timr,,,"The point of Gladwell's book totally whooshed over the writer's head.<p>We know the robber-baron industrialists were born in a particular decade, but is that the <i>cause</i> of their success?  Obviously not.  Gladwell isn't making an argument about the particular reasons that they were lucky -- just observing that they were.  They had good timing, and that translated into economic success in their time.  Everything else is speculation.<p>Nobody knows what's going to be ""lucky"" tomorrow.  Maybe this time around, <i>nobody</i> will get rich.  Maybe <i>this</i> time, we're creating a new economic paradigm where wealth will be more equitably distributed.  Maybe this time, 30-somethings will get rich, because they've had a decade head-start on the 20-somethings to save cash.  Maybe this time, <i>everyone</i> will go bust.  Maybe this time, risk-takers will get squashed by the market, and savers will be rewarded for their conservative moves.  We don't know, and we can't know.<p>Trying to extrapolate useful information from Gladwell's observation is antithetical to his thesis -- once you've controlled for practice and skill, a lot of the ""secret"" of success boils down to dumb luck.  You can't reproduce luck.  The best you can do is work hard, practice a lot, and hope that someday, lightning will strike you too.",1226885271

Perhaps these problems are due to GWT.  What you have is probably good enough to test the idea, so I won't beat this into the ground.<p>As for the model, I think users are much more likely to fund software that they already know and use.  Once software is actually released, it develops a community of users, some of whom may be willing to support it.  Asking the small fraction of users with the foresight to anticipate using a program to bear the entire cost of developing it may work for a few cases (e.g. device drivers, or cloning existing software) but there are many other software projects that would have more success if they can rely on donations after they have been written and released.<p>A model that finds a way for developers to work on credit against donations from future users would be interesting.",1226883954
