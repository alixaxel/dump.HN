I can still picture the SmallTalk hot air balloon and the C toolbox. But the mag I <i>really</i> miss is Micro Cornucopia.

I hope you are using different landing page for small business, enterprise and personal with an incentive and a lead capture form (just in case someone wants to leave).<p>Buying cheap traffic can convert better than Adwords sometimes, specially if you have a free product.<p>Affiliate networks are great as well. Although they are not sexy, sexy companies such as Apple use them all the time.<p>Asking the bloggers to use the proper anchor text will help as well. Most of these blogs have a high PR and they will use your company name as an anchor text which is pointless. The anchor text should be those keywords that you target.",1227237477
