Namely:<p>- create barriers to entry (the best way to do this on elance et al is to serve your good customers well, they'll become attached).<p>- differentiate (prove you're better and worth extra money).<p>- focus on a niche (prove you're the best choice for a specific kind of product or service).",1226458796

361316,comment,361153,361281,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"From what breif comments I've read on Lisp's condition system, it sounds much better. Containing and isolating the error, as soon as possible, then passing information about the error higher up like an exception might propagate, until a level high enough to know the goal of the operation and what to do in case of errors, then passing a response back down, and being able to continue in a useful manner or tidy up gracefully.<p>A great big codesplosion spraying you with a several hundred lines of stack trace and a ""Your program has encountered an error an needs to close"" is not ""sensible behaviour"".",1226458528

I could even have reddit-like comments discussing the merits of replying to a message.<p>When @TechCrunch looks at the message, he can click on the link to see how well it ranks in his inbox. He can also see who voted up/down.<p>At this point, @TechCrunch may be convinced to reply to the message or some other one ranked higher in his inbox.<p>If @TechCrunch agrees a lot with your votes about what is worth replying to, he may start following you on twitter.
