102653,comment,102254,102331,0,0,gscott,,,"> a lot more people by using your wealth than you can by volunteering your labor<p>My wife volunteers a hour a week at a local school (about 3 miles away) the school has really low state test scores (about 65% lower then our own kid's school state test scores).  By volunteering her time she shows something that is worth more then money could ever, that people care.<p>Some money is often needed but you really cannot replace volunteering your own time.  You can volunteer your time at what you are good at, not the soup kitchen but some other capacity.<p>With OfficeZilla.com I am able to support charities like MercyShips.com which has 20 gigabytes of files uploaded to the system.  Granted they use the materials to seek donations, but if they didn't have 300 volunteers on the ship they would have seek even more donations then they have to do now.  So much more in donations they might not be able to continue on.",1201067409

Doctors actually don't wash their hands as often as they know they should (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24wwln_freak.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/magazine/24wwln_freak.html</a>).  Engineering failures occur with sufficient frequency to merit a civil engineering dailywtf (<a href=""http://www.icivilengineer.com/Failure_Watch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icivilengineer.com/Failure_Watch/</a>), though thankfully not updated daily.<p>This is not to say that the failure of those professions to live up to their ideal should excuse us. We equally have a responsibility to the quality of our code. The solution is nothing so easy as an unread code of ethics or a well-it's-just-money justification for sloppiness. A lot of code actually does risk lives -- fly by wire systems, automated storm dams, anything in a nuclear power plant. The risking of lives isn't sufficient to make surgeons follow well known infection prevention protocols. For them as for us there have to be cultural changes which value slow and steady repeatable processes over wunderkind acts of brilliance.",1201067398

If quitting your job without funding isn't an option because you've got a family and no savings, it would seem that you are way <i>more</i> likely to succeed working on your startup after hours than simply doing nothing, at least to me.<p>Yes, it's an unfortunate position to be in. You are at a huge disadvantage. But the answer isn't 'don't do it' - which, without other options, roughly equates to 'give up'.",1201067381

A 1930's style depression is unlikely at this point because so much of the worlds wealth and means of producing wealth is now located outside of the USA.<p>The USA is still a major player in the world economy but it is no longer the center. That said this downturn may bust us Americans down a notch or two on the world stage, perhaps even enough that we have to make some serious lifestyle changes. So the question emerges: If I can't drive my hummer down to Mickey-D's and supersize that please... is it a disaster or what?",1201065722

Merely writing applications isn't enough, or maybe it is, but it can take a decade of personal trial and error to discover rules that can be digested in a semester with a qualified teacher.<p>I take issue with some of their tone. They seem to dismiss all of the cool things people have made using rapid development tools, only valuing the contributions of military grade correctness provers. I think there's room for both in our industry.<p>However, if you're young, and you can go without sleep, use your energy to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of code writing. It's easier to learn theory now than to unlearn bad habit later.<p>Finally, don't get tricked into thinking you have to choose one or the other --  you will be coding regularly if you study theory.<p>And don't get tricked into thinking geniuses don't need to study. Those aren't geniuses pushing that theory.",1201065333
