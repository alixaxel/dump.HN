Either way, you're encouraging people to spam their friends -- not because they think their friends would be interested in this particular app, but in order to get some miniscule personal benefit ($500 divided by how many users?)<p>Personally, I'd be happy to see the ability to send invites turned off altogether. If any friend of mine really thinks I'll be interested in a particular app, they can damn well take the time to write me a message about it.",1201578295

Now the Patriot act is a touchy subject because the revisions Obama wants are much better than the ones Bush had. The war on drugs, imho, is a good thing. Just because he did drugs doesn't mean a damn thing. He knows first hand how bad they are. If anything that is better than someone fighting something they haven't experienced.",1201576706

105963,comment,105470,105470,0,0,Shooter,,,"You would think that just asking your potential users what they want is best, but then you have to worry about self-report errors.  As has been noted. (Customers lie. To you and themselves.  Accept it.)<p>I'm fairly stupid and I don't possess a crystal ball...but since I also don't want to waste my time on things that don't pan out financially, I've spent quite a bit thinking about this question.  I like to keep things simple, so I will generally only start or buy a company if it does one or more of the following (the more, the better):\n1.  Make the user money.\n2.  Save the user time.\n3.  Save the user money.\n4.  Get the user laid.\n5.  Save the user's life/improve their health.<p>There are a few other rules.  Numbers 2 and 4 should never exist only on their own.  Number 5 is often one of the most difficult to execute because prevention is harder to sell than solutions. And all of the potential ideas have to be a superior enough solution that they outweigh the switching costs for the customer (including the switching cost from nothing, inertia is a bitch!)  Number 2 is the most likely to suffer from the ""unwanted solution"" problem (for various reasons, an outlining of which I suppose would better address the original question.)  Multiple streams of income and multiple customer bases are always good things, just to hedge your bets.",1201575947
