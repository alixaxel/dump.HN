I also ended up getting very good at pacing out the same spot in the front of the car :)<p>I ended up stopping about once every 40 miles or so, although I did some night driving and there was a fair bit of rain, so I wasn't able to get 100% of the pictures taken.<p>The parts where I took pictures of me jumping were in Nevada, absolutely gorgeous setting.",1200949151

101797,comment,101703,101703,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It will never be easier or safer for you to start a startup.  In five years, you might have a family to support (not necessarily so, but odds aren't against it), and the decision becomes remarkably harder to make when your own needs aren't the only ones to think of.  That ""one year"" of savings will last a month or two if you have kids.<p>There are many businesses that are recession-proof, and many that can still pay you a salary during a downturn, though your current job isn't necessarily in one of those businesses (and your startup might not be in one of those businesses either).  Without a lot of experience, it may not be immediately obvious to you what businesses will weather the recession well and which will run into trouble.<p>Having a job now does not mean you'll have a job in six months if the recession hits hard.  Don't imagine that your job is permanent if things go badly for your current employer.  There are no guarantees in anything.  At least with a startup, assuming you build something people want, you'll have something people want in your possession rather than just a last paycheck.<p>That said, I'll tell you what I wish I'd known at 23: Have fun.  Do exactly what you most want to do.  If that is starting a company, traveling the world, starting a band, writing a novel, getting another degree, or some combination of these things, do it.  You will never be in a better position to do exactly what you want to do.<p>Your mother worries about you, and thinks about basic needs first.  You live in a time and society in which basic needs are all but automatic: you can work two days a week at a crap job and make a subsistence living as long as you're single and live frugally.  You can always get a crap job if you need it later.  Since you're college educated and presumably a nerd, you're even better placed...contract work pays enough to get by on a few days a month.<p>As mixmax pointed out, the old saying that you won't regret the things you did but the things you didn't do is probably as true as any truism ever said.  When you're 30 you'll begin to get a sense of this...I suspect that when you're 40 you'll have an absolute certainty of it (I'm not yet to 40, so I don't know for certain...but I passed 30 a few years ago, and it only seems more true each day).",1200948298

101795,comment,101760,101760,0,0,carpal,,,"This is mostly bullshit.  The guy is trying to do things in Rails the <i>wrong way</i> and complaining about it failing.  He does have a few legitimate points, but I guess I'll go at it point by point, because it is fucking long:<p>-AR find works fine for me, in most cases, in those cases you can always fall back directly to SQL (has happened a total of two times for me).  The guy very incorrectly states that the :group stuff will choke in Postgres. It does not. There is a separate driver for each database that will make the queries compliant with the specific DB.<p>-When using joins, you're supposed to use :include, or has_and_belongs_to_many.  These are NOT read only, and work very very well.  He's complaining that something he is doing the wrong way does not work.  That is because he is doing it wrong, and it isn't SUPPOSED to work.<p>-I agree with his point about understanding Rails and the options hashes.  At this point, I really wish that Ruby had named arguments, as the options workaround gets really annoying.<p>-I don't understand what he means by quality assurance.  Rails has an incredibly large automated testing suite.  I've been using Rails for two years and I've found <i>one</i> bug.  I really just have no idea what he's trying to get at.<p>-On the last point, about the ""big-picture"", he is provably false.  If you've written a Rails app and there is even ONE XSS injection opportunity, you've done it wrong.  Spend two seconds in the API docs and you will find this function called ""sanitize"":: <a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#M000936"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/Saniti...</a><p>It helps if you read the fucking documentation before you criticize something.",1200947997

The first of which I'd argue is you can get shit done fast!  For startup founders, this is essential.  Make something.  Put it in front of users as fast as possible.  See what they like and dislike.  Fix it.  Repeat.  Rails makes this super fast and easy.  Once you get to the point where you really care about any of the things this guy mentions, hire a team to rewrite it.

101791,comment,101760,101779,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"MVC, while a valuable application design principle, is not really tied to 'writing webapps.' The article mentions things like the stateless nature of HTTP requests, which are very much bound up in the idea of writing software accessible over the web. Something like Seaside (a Smalltalk framework for developing web apps) is much more aligned with the request-response cycle that is the web. It uses the continuations feature of Smalltalk to map that cycle into a natural language idiom. Neat.<p>Rails is certainly not the be-all and end-all of web design. Lately it seems to be the 'cool' thing to bash Rails, but I'm not sure that that's warranted either. It seems to be a backlash against all the hype that Rails has generated along the way.<p>Time will tell whether or not Rails will become a piece of timeless software or if it will simply fall to the wayside.<p>Until then, go forth and write great software!",1200947796

It outlines why people like me are former professors, especially the tendency for departments to dial the math way back in favor of attracting students, keeping them happy, and graduating them to show the dean how much growth the department has experienced. When I covered recursion equations and how to solve them in introductory data structures and algorithms classes, most of the class proceeded to bitch and moan about it. When I assigned them exercises to implement associative data structures, the ones who used pre-built Java libraries and received 0 marks complained loudly.
