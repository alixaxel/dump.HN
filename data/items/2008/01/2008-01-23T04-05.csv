Including our wealth -- we are getting richer, despite all our taxes.<p>Another issue is that if we are on the verge, then, for example, the UK is already too far gone.

They probably don't buy jeans there because those are status items, but they do buy things like electronics, movies, books, magazines, food, etc.<p>The business magazines are probably the lowest sellers, but for Walmart that means millions upon millions of purchases. It's still an enormous blow to those magazines. But probably not enough to put them out of business, of course.",1201063888

102634,comment,102251,102251,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I think this will be pretty damaging.  The average cost of a magazine goes up if sales go down.  A 20% cut of retail sales could lead to greater losses down the road, and if other stores follow suit, magazines start dying out really fast.<p>The might go the way of the buggy whip; I could see them being obsolete if screen resolutions improve.  I wonder how they'll try to resist the change.  They'll probably say computers are a nerdy format, it's nicer to read on paper, and it's got better content.  I hope they don't start trying to get protection laws passed.  It may be tempting for them, given that magazines have a lot of reach.  It would be unpleasant to see them try to get protected, and disappointing if they succeed at everyone else's expense.",1201063790

In case it's not obvious why this methodology is fatally flawed, here is some evidence:<p>See that dip in Java in 2004? They claim that is because of a change in Google's indexing. That such a change can affect one language in vastly different ways than the others indicates a methodology problem.<p>For example, suppose that in 2007, we saw the number of programming job postings on the web go up 2X. That would inflate the numbers for languages that are commonly mentioned in job postings.",1201063670
102631,comment,102186,102572,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Good link. Yes, in fact I did pull that number out of my... well, you know.<p>It was merely to illustrate that such a point exists. After a certain absolute percent, raising taxes will REDUCE tax receipts and wreck your economy at the same time. I'm certain were all the way down the back side of that curve near the ""wreck your economy"" shoulder. Yes, even though our absolute tax is lower than some smaller countries whos economies have evolved to operate at a greatly reduced rate.<p>It does also miss many of the 'hidden' taxes we still pay. For example, everyone in this state has to get a silly sticker on their car every year so the mechanic can pretend to look at the breaks and then try to charge you $35 for a $5 light bulb. The sticker costs $25 but I've never made it thru in less than an hour. The price of the silly sticker AND the wasted hour is a tax. There's one $25 fee and at least one wasted hour for every car in the state. This kind of thing is particularly noxious because they could have just had a little courage and added the $25 to the regular car tax, but instead wasted 100's of thousands of man hours a year on what is almost always a fictitious ""inspection"".<p>You should see what it takes to be able to build a shed in the back yard for your lawnmower...<p>Inflation is usually a tax as well. If a government needs money, can't borrow it, and its not politically expedient to raise taxes again, it can simply print up some money and steal a little from each of the other dollars that people already have.<p>There's also start of and end of life taxes that have to be amortized over the years of the life of a person. If you make a little money or live in a place that sees real estate rise, this is non-trivial.<p>Even the tax code ITSELF is a tax. The ever increasing burden of compliance is nothing but dead weight for individuals and businesses.<p>Finally, there's a stack of extra tax and extra man-hour-wasting hassle headed your way if you have the audacity to try to work for yourself and not simply settle into a nice job in an industry with lobbyists and get your w2 like everyone else. This is probably the one that interests the readers of this forum the most.<p>One slightly other off subject comment on the article. The government using taxation as a vehicle to transfer wealth from the ""rich"" to the ""poor"" is a recipe for economic disaster. Ever dollar ""robin hooded"" is a dollar sucked directly and completely from economic growth. Its a near perfect disincentive for innovators to innovate.<p>Sorry to slasdot/troll the issue but I am passionate about this particular area! The point of all this is, there are better ways to fix the economy than an interest rate cut!",1201063104
