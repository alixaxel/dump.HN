We are still at a point where people are undecided what is better long term the Euro or the Dollar.  This is going to drag the dollar so low when it perks back up people may not switch back out of the Euro.",1201136365

But they're uniquely well positioned to push a lot of these things along, and it's a bit disappointing that they opt not to.<p>Plus, selling genomic information from your customers, in aggregate or not, is a rather evil thing to do given the potential for misuse.  Hopefully there will not be any phenotypic information provided, but if they somehow manage to run out of money, who knows?  Not all phenotypes require a whole organism, as I'm sure you know.<p>Also, I'm not saying ""wait until we know everything there is to know"".

103186,comment,102876,102876,0,0,pg,,,"I think there are two separate hierarchies, one based on wealth (desperate, nervous, coasting) and one on education (reads nothing, reads <i>Time</i>, reads <i>The Economist</i>).  Hundreds of years ago the two hierarchies were tied together because only the rich could afford education.  In the 20th century they drifted apart.  The interesting question is whether they will converge again, pushed from the opposite direction-- i.e. not because wealth causes education, but because education causes wealth.",1201135089

The male play-ethic has less to do with brains or ability, and more to do with desire and a compulsion to play with technology as a means of having fun.  Women rarely exhibit this sort of behavior.<p>I don't think the industry is particularly sexist.",1201135083

They find out that we're running on EC2 with backup to S3, and they want to locate the equipment.  How in the world would they do it?  I have no clue where the hardware is that hosts our service.<p>Much easier to break into someone's office and get the equipment directly, or to break into a smaller host and grab the equipment.  With the cloud, finding the actual hardware in use seems extremely difficult - which seems to dramatically increase your security against a hardware theft as opposed to self hosting.",1201134417

I would want to see more than just 3 or 4 sites that have scaled well.<p>Three or four seems to prove the feasibility.<p>> hiring - will I be able to find talented people to work on the codebase?<p>Yes.  The people you find who hack Scheme or Common Lisp tend to be very talented.  If you want to ramp up to 1000 programmers quickly, yes, you would have trouble getting experienced people.  But if you're doing a startup, no sweat.  Or so I think so far; watch this space.<p>> libraries<p>PLT Scheme and Common Lisp actually have big libraries, though not as huge as Java's.  In most cases, though, the equivalent library in Scheme (and CL, too, I imagine) is much better than it's Java counterpart.

But 23andme aren't (at this stage) lying to customers about what it does, and I'm pretty sure most customers will be interested in the knowledge not simply the utility. Also ruling out strongly genetic diseases is probably quite interesting to a lot of people, regardless of how useful it is in a public health sense.<p>Most likely their initial scan procedure isn't of great utility but does set up a market for people based on their genetics. A whole realm of industries could spring up which could be very interesting. I don't know why you think its 23andme's job to carry the entirety of biotech research, but if no one can make any money from personal genetics until we know everything there is to know about the genome then I doubt we'll advance the field at a great pace.",1201133469
