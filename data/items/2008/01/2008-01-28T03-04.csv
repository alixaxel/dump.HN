Applications requiring support for these components are usually more at home in with a Java EE application server such as JBoss, Geronimo, WebLogic, WebSphere, or Glassfish. Many Java EE application servers actually use Tomcat as their Web container.</i>",1201492183

105316,comment,104919,105302,0,0,curi,,,"> How can culture cause a disparity between things that the culture doesn't even know about?<p>There is all sorts of knowledge in our traditions, which no individual person understands. So, for example, suppose culture contains a trigger which causes parents to be more discouraging of one type of children's book than another, for girls. They could do this without understanding what's going on at all -- all they have to know consciously is that they like one book more than another.<p>Even if we don't know what kinds of books encourage people to become chemists, certainly we can imagine some books pull more in that direction than others. Because, for example, the skills they help create are more useful to doing chemistry, or lead to more trains of thought that bring up chemistry, or are more useful to understanding explanations of why chemistry is interesting and important. This is all very plausible, because we already know that books can help learn skills, help bring up trains of thought, etc, and already know that there are skills which help one become a chemist, there are trains of thought which help one see why becoming a chemist would be nice, etc And 'book' and 'chemistry' can be substituted with other things, like game, toy, activity, law, physics, etc, and still have similar effects.<p>---<p>By what mechanism does testosterone cause aggressive personalities?",1201491324

Although a child can probably acquire a language in less time than that, it is also true that the child will lose the language if he or she stops using it before adulthood.  I have seen many arguments for the value of learning a second language, but they all strike me as flimsy.   Please tell me why 
a student who already knows English or even Spanish or Mandarin should invest thousands of hours learning a second language when there are more than enough sciences and practical arts with much clearer educational value to last anyone a lifetime of learning.",1201490646

105305,comment,104919,105291,0,0,curi,,,"We have a culture that (sort of) causes ugly people to get depressed. There is nothing innately depressing about being ugly, the whole idea of being depressed about it, and indeed of what is ugly or pretty, is in our culture.<p>So, our culture has code to have people detect certain traits caused by genes, and act differently in their presence. Just like it detects mountains, and has people act differently in their presence. But no one goes on and on about how mountains control human personalities and determine gender differences (or mountain-raised-near differences).",1201490533

105302,comment,104919,105256,0,0,angryprofessor,,,">It's easy to make up and describe a cultural factor that would explain the data. For example, the previous shift was about how adult women were treated in public -- open discrimination. The second shift will come when parents (and others) treat young children more equally in subtle ways. That's one possible cultural explanation, of many.<p>You still need to explain why this affects physics, but not law.<p>This idea seems very weak when you look at gender gaps within fields. Most people barely know the difference between physics and chemistry (let alone theoretical vs experimental, or condensed matter vs high energy), yet there are gender gaps between them. Compare also web design to programming.<p>How can culture cause a disparity between things that the culture doesn't even know about?<p>>But for biology, there does not exist a single reasonable explanation that can account for the data. In particular, in must detail by what mechanism the genes effect the personality of adult women. That is, ""there is a gene for business"" wouldn't suffice, without saying specifically how that gene works.<p>For business, aggression would be my best guess.

That includes, among many other things, what gender of friends they are encouraged to have as young children.<p>Why aren't there more variations in culture on Earth? First, there is a lot of shared culture across a lot of the Earth, like Abrahamic religions. Second, perhaps the logic of the situation (e.g. men being stronger) lent itself to certain simple gender roles. If so, that isn't why they still exist today in any form. Third, the general logic of memes can create common points across cultures. Fourth, Earth is a small sample size.",1201490131

In America, intelligent black people will tend to choose high prestige, low-risk career paths more often than not.  A lot of it is about the uncertainty of failure; In black communities, a lot is expected of the really smart kids.  They're seen as not just representing themselves, but also their communities and, to an extent, their race.  It sucks, but it's the truth.  So a lot of them choose to be doctors, lawyers, etc, because you're viewed differently by society.
