100214,comment,100170,100189,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"The privations of the Chinese people are related to trade imbalances because if the Chinese government allowed their huge trade surpluses to go towards buying goods (heating, vegetable oil, etc) for the Chinese people (thereby reducing trade surpluses), then most Chinese people would have higher standards of living.<p>Instead the Chinese government forces these trade surpluses to go towards buying US Government bonds (i.e., lending money to the US Government in exchange for low returns (negative returns if you factor in the exchange rate and inflation)). This doesn't raise standards of living for the Chinese people. In fact, it loses them money.<p>Yes, when you owe a banker a million dollars, he's in trouble. But he's only in trouble when you declare bankruptcy. At which point, he may be in trouble, but you're in bigger trouble.<p>And that may be the only way out of this financial mess... The US Government declaring bankruptcy. That would mean China is in $1.4 trillion worth of trouble, but the US would be in a lot, lot, lot more trouble.",1200640660
