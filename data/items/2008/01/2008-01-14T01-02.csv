POF is many things, but it <i>isn't</i> a dating site.  Seriously.  How many other dating sites run their competitors' ads?  How many have a 30% <i>monthly</i> attrition rate?  When you look at it critically, POF is little more than a glorified banner ad for other dating sites.<p>IMO, that's the real reason why Markus doesn't have to invest in user experience.  It's actually <i>better</i> for his bottom line if they bounce to one of the many other dating sites who advertise (prominently) on POF.  It remains to be seen if a free dating site that focuses on user experience can thrive, when the only vetted revenue model involves selling your ad space to the non-free players in the same industry.",1200275575

98027,comment,98009,98009,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Heh, I feel that pain. I tried to install Vista about a week ago after not having run windows since 2001. I never did get it all working right, plus thanks to (I think) not having some drivers right, my 2Ghz dual core with 3 gig ram was so slow it was unusable.
I'm out of time for now but I'll try agian later in a few weeks after I buy some ""vista ready"" gear.",1200275132
98026,comment,97904,97904,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I checked into this last year.  If you want to develop software for the desktop, and become an ISV like Xobni, they actually have some really good deals to help get you off the ground.<p>And, I tend to be fairly OS agnostic.  I like to use whatever technology is the best fix for the problem. I'm certainly not shilling for MSoft, I'm doing all my work on Linux at this point.  But, I might decide to switch in a couple of years, we'll see.<p>I forget if it's through their Start up Accelerator program, or another program, but you can get an ""Action Pack"" of Microsoft software:<p><a href=""https://partner.microsoft.com/US/program/managemembership/actionpack/mapscontents"" rel=""nofollow"">https://partner.microsoft.com/US/program/managemembership/ac...</a><p>And, you get all of this software for the low low price of $299.  I'm sure that Xobni is using this.  It's a very cheap way to get a bunch of Windows Licenses.  If you don't mind being Windows based, it's a great way to lower your Licensing fees while you're getting off the ground.<p>It's a pain to develop for the Windows Desktop, but there is a good bit of money to be made.  And, if they keep developing Languages like PowerShell, IronPython, IronRuby and F#, it might become less painful for language geeks/hacker types in the next couple of years.  C# already has some pretty cool functional programming features.",1200274663
98025,comment,97829,97829,0,0,noonespecial,,,"The biggest thing to keep in mind is that you will be transitioning into a world of ""butt time"". Your employer will care far less about what you do than where you do it. You could institute world peace and make your company a billion dollars from your arm chair at home and your boss will still call it vacation.<p>As a bit of advice for working in this world...
You have no control over when you work, so you must regulate the density of your work in order to keep from burning out. What you would do in a single day at your startup takes people at ""normal companies"" many days or even weeks to accomplish.<p>Also, guard your time off like For Knox. If you are willing to ""sacrifice for the team"" your boss will gladly steal as much time from you as you are not willing to defend. Work ends at 5, anything further will need further compensation, be it overtime or extra vacation. Your boss asking you to work extra with no extra reward is stealing, pure and simple. Use more tact to say that to your boss, but make no mistake, this is what it is.<p>Lastly, try not to think too much. 90% of what goes on in an office is inane nonsense having nothing to do with the bussiness at hand. Its just part of the deal. Dwelling on this will only frustrate you. Get your zen on and roll with it.<p>Good luck.",1200274301

98023,comment,97709,97994,0,0,dcurtis,,,"In a perfectly beautiful capitalist society-- that is, a small community-- I would create a better site and put him out of business. But due to the sheer number of users he has now, the switching cost (for each user) is almost assuredly too high for me to compete with him barring some great publicity or a large sum of money. I might still do it, though, just for kicks.<p>I don't think it's a good idea to compare his company to YC-funded/inspired sites, because he didn't set out to make a successful company; he made a site to learn a language, and people gravitated toward it over time. He got lucky by entering his market accidentally at the right time, with the right features.<p>Some people voted me down, I assume for saying that I ""disrespect"" him. But I really do. Any businessman who doesn't believe in advancing society with the power and responsibility that comes with business ownership deserves no respect nor success. But the fact is that whether or not someone deserves something, they sometimes get it; and he did.<p>But in the grand scheme of things, looking at plentyoffish.com makes me want to vomit, and that's why I highly doubt it will remain successful indefinitely. The only problem with overtaking its lead is that it's a user-to-user business, and competing with a company like that is hard for someone new like me, because at first there is zero benefit for signing up due to the lack of users. The first few thousand users might not even get anything. So you end up with an alarmingly high switching cost.<p>In the war between beautiful design and achieving benefit from the product, the latter almost always wins. At least in the short term.",1200273997

Anyway, unless you're using a geek linux distro, you really shouldn't be having such a hard time. Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or (my favorite) Fedora 8 should all be really easy to install.<p>Also, what exactly is the problem you're having?
