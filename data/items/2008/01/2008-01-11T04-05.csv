This algorithm is O(n log n) because of the sorting. It generates the list in order of frequency.<p>There is an O(n) algorithm that first picks some random item as pivot, then does a partioning like QuickSort where items with higher frequency than the pivot are moved to the front of the array and those with lower frequency to the back.<p>If the first partition has more than a 100 items, then the algorithm only has to recurse into that part. If it has fewer (<i>k</i>), then it prints everything in the first partition, and recurses into the second to generate the 100 - <i>k</i> best items.<p>This is expected O(<i>n</i>) and will not generate the list in order of frequency.",1200026472
