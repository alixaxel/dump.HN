In consequence, we should torrent some martial arts PDFs and then write a 3d app in C to simulate the techniques. Once we add a slow-motion feature, and an evolutionary AI to figure out the best strategy, we should be safe from punches.",1201055295

102565,comment,102186,102326,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Actually in classical macro theory, lower interest rates (which amounts to the Fed increasing the money supply) leads to greater investment due to cheaper credit, leading to higher output growth in the short run and subsequently lower unemployment. With higher demand for their labour, workers will ask for more cash leading to wage inflation. And because wages are a major input into goods and services, higher wages will cause firms to raise prices - hence price inflation.<p>That's the theory anyway. There's been alot of criticism on it, but macroeconomists in reserve banks around the world tend to subscribe to this theory when using interest rates to control growth and inflation.<p>The relationship between interest rates and the dollar is via the interest rate parity condition (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_parity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_parity</a>), which is a feature of open markets (to take into account arbitrage opportunities). Lowering the value of the dollar doesn't cause inflation directly. I suppose it does so indirectly by stimulating exports and raising output growth, which leads to lower unemployment and so on.<p>Lowering interest rates will likely increase inflation, but hyperinflation is a bit rich. Current US inflation is 4%, which is high, but a long way from hyperinflation (see zimbabwe - 1000%+).",1201054235
