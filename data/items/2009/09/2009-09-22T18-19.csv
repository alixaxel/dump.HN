I learnt a lot from programming an apache2 module. Supposedly the apache code isn't the best C project available, but there are some interesting real-world aspects of it.",1253643290

Laid off yesterday, starts a new software venture today.  0 income.  And probably won't have any income for a few months at least...<p>So yes, new businesses are probably being born at a rapid clip just because people don't have any other options for employment at this point, so why not start something?  But the vast majority of those businesses being started now won't show any income for many months... and many of them will just go under (as is always the case).",1253642908

Hopefully it can be rewarding in many ways (including financial return on your investment in addition to a sense of satisfaction).<p>I'd encourage you to aim for something that can 'go big' in terms of employing many many people. One that can potentially attract assistance (be it public or private), and something that leverages local skills. Try to find some arbitrage.<p>Example: perhaps investigate whether there is an in-sourcing opportunity by hiring Californian IT people and running American call centers with the best of silicon valley answering the phones. It's unpatriotic not to use them. Ok, silly idea.<p>Most jobs seem to have been lost in retail, construction, manufacturing etc. Perhaps start with the people you want to help most?",1253642687

There are technical or college or even graduate degrees in subject related to what needs to be done in IT. It is just sad that after ignoring them for so long, they now turn to these commercial offerings who often don't focus on the real problems at hand in the sense that the problem is rarely technical.<p>That and also that several people (and I don't want to generalize because they aren't all like that) I have met with such certifications have belief that there is a ""one true way"" or recipe of doing things and are uneasy to adapt or step out of this course.
