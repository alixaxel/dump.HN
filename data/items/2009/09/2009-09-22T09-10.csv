In our ""developed world"" however, there is such a large availability of calories, that some people get more than enough. For those, being able to burn more, would be an advantage. Unless they are planning to go on a polar expedition anytime soon :)<p>I agree with your general sentiment though. Whether you could burn 500 calories more or eat 500 calories less isn't much of a difference. However, a drug that makes you burn 500 more calories and allows you to enjoy more eating is probably something that you can sell to a lot of people. Telling them to get their act together and eat right isn't that easily translated into profit.",1253613533

The most common causes have been either the gov't cutting off supplies to ""rebels"" or politicians beholden to poor urban masses holding down food prices so much that farmers can't sell their crops for enough to break even, so they grow only enough for themselves (or both together, with other stupidities thrown in, like current Zimbabwe).",1253613073

If Bob has 50 grams of brown fat in his body and John has 0, how does Bob have an advantage over John? My perception is that Bob now has to eat 500 more calories per day than John just to survive. That doesn't seem like an advantage to me.<p>Am I missing something?",1253612481
836613,comment,835581,835772,0,0,billswift,,,"The problem is that the declining population is temporary.  Every area with declining population, except perhaps Japan which I don't know enough about to say, has sub-populations with higher growth.  Eventually, those populations are going to become large enough that the population as a whole will start growing again, and will continue increasing until it reaches the rate of the high-growth formerly-sub population.  It's just a hiccup.  Unless something external - singularity, war, whatever - intervenes.",1253612420

I am moving to the SF area and wanted to ask a few questions.<p>If you were looking to hook up with a startup and start meeting people in the community where would you live? From my research I think mountain view would be a good place to live that is not super expensive. I am working on a few of my own startup ideas and am bootstrapping it myself for the first few months. My work related stuff has already won a few awards so would love to network with any rails/django coders in the area.<p>Since I really don't know any of the areas in SF except from what I read online about where new startups are going. I would like to find a place that would be within easy driving distance of meetups and other social/tech functions.<p>I know this is not a normal HN type question, but I think perhaps it could be of use to others that are coming to the area and need a bit of info to make the jump. (I know it would be at least useful to me)<p>Thanks for your help in advance.",1253611965

It is part of the free movement of persons and one of the four economic freedoms: free movement of goods, services, labour and capital.<p>But of course is only applied within the European Union. Foreign workers can actually expand an economy - not contract it (See US, Austalia, Canada). By restricting immigration, the jobs get exported rather than stay home. Would a more permissive immigration policy by the US have kept these jobs home? I believe it would. The world now has reached a stage where goods, services and capital almost move freely but not the last resource the labour. By slowly opening the gates the world will slowly adjust to a new Global Economy.",1253611616

Food independence!<p>I just don't see why division of labor would decrease. In the past it's pretty much always increased with growth of technology. As Robin Hanson said in ""Dreams of Autarky"" <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html</a> :<p><i>I suspect that future software, manufacturing plants, and colonies will typically be much more dependent on everyone else than dreams of autonomy imagine. Yes, small isolated entities are getting more capable, but so are small non-isolated entities, and the later remain far more capable than the former. The riches that come from a worldwide division of labor have rightly seduced us away from many of our dreams of autarky. We may fantasize about dropping out of the rat race and living a life of ease on some tropical island. But very few of us ever do.</i>",1253610848
