814528,comment,814199,814400,0,0,lutorm,,,"There are no images that mimic the color response of the human eye, though you could approximate such an image by combining many images in filters covering the visible colors.<p>But they would still not be ""unaltered"". Astronomical objects have an extremely large dynamic range in terms of brightness. If you've ever looked at a galaxy through a telescope, you'll see what I mean. You just see a blob that's the bright central bulge. The brightness distribution in a galaxy falls off <i>exponentially</i> with radius. If you amplify the signal to see the faint outer parts, the central part would hurt your eyes (or, practically speaking, saturate).<p>We made a movie of a simulated galaxy merger for a competition last year: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agqLEbOFT2A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agqLEbOFT2A</a>  In this rendering, the colors are approximately realistic, but the brightness is not. For my own education, I made an alternative rendering with just a fixed linear stretch that should more realistically (barring monitor gamma) mimic what the eye would see. In that movie (I've been meaning to upload it), you basically only see the centers of the two galaxies, nothing else.<p>So the bottom line is, to see any detail you <i>must</i> ""manipulate"" these images. It's reminiscent of High-Dynamic Range photography [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging</a>], where you compress the range of brightnesses to be able to convey a scene in one image.",1252551455

In iTunes, I'd often have to go back to my folders to find a file, figure out how that file was tagged, then go back to iTunes and find it again!<p>When I find mp3s online or get them from friends, I never bother to edit their ID3 tags, but I often sort them using a simple tree-structure that's built into almost every device called a <i>file system</i>. I'm used to storing documents, photos, and source code this way. Why should I learn a new way just for one app?

I don't think there is really anything special about (apart from the degree of complexity of the human body). If a computer has an algorithm that says<p>if(user hasn't typed anything for 14 days) lonely = true<p>then it has feelings, too. It might sound absurd, but only because it looks so simple. But imagine an enourmously complex program, and the information ""lonely"" trickles through it. There might be a routine somewhere<p>if lonely = true connect_irc_channel(#depression)<p>and so on and so on. From a certain level of complexity onwards, it won't be so obvious anymore, and we won't be able to prevent feeling that the computer really feels.",1252548692

814448,comment,814094,814315,0,0,netsp,,,"> Sure it is, spam makes search less useful for users, keeping it out is most definitely a quality assurance issue.<p>Not exactly. Site X with text links on it is not (necessarily) less useful then a site with declared ads on it. The quality assurance issue is the effect these have on Google's ability to analyse the web. Google's way of preventing site X from doing this is by intimidating. They are <i>not</i> removing the site because it is so spamy that they don't want it on their search results (a case that is equivalent to HN deciding to ban a site). They are doing it because they want these sites to comply with some sort of practice. It is the publicity and threat of these penalties which are their 'raison d'etre.'<p>I have no problem at all with Google using whatever policies they want to make up the search results. Including kicking sites off. I do have a problem with Google threatening to do so in order to achieve some other goal.<p>> Which hurts Google's users as well, spam hurts us all, spam sucks. Google is correct here in removing sites which partake in such practices.<p>Perhaps. But it is doing so by exercising its power to shut down the internet (for that site) to enforce a standard. Google decided at some point that all paid links need to be marked in a special way. This is the standard for disclosure. They then use their power to enforce it.",1252548440
