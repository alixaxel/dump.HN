In what they do, they're ahead of everybody else by margins that are almost baffling. Hell, the closest they come to having a competitor is Google against Facebook's Bing ads.<p>I think that what's happening is more simply that Facebook saw Twitter had something cool, and instead of making a set of features that were similar but slightly different in irritating ways to set itself aside, it took Twitter's ideas wholesale and credited them instantly.

816459,comment,815513,815513,0,0,Mz,,,"I doubt the world even knows enough about Richard Branson's personal subjective world and internal wiring to know if ""desperation"" is even the right descriptor. (I certainly don't.) Whether that kind of pressure motivates or demoralizes a particular person depends in part on the person.  In my own case, I am very risk averse and only take risks when that is the conservative answer.  My oldest son loves it when we have some crisis because he knows I will rise to the occasion and find some creative solution I would never try if a more conservative option were viable.  I hate, hate, hate it and feel tortured by such situations.  But I am trying to make my peace with it because it is obvious that some of my best ideas come out of gambles made when there was no sure thing available.  Other people seem to perceive me as combative, risk-taking, and so on.  I don't.  I see myself as forced into such choices at gun-point and someone who would far prefer to NOT have to make such choices.<p>Another thought:  If you are dramatically more competent than almost everyone you meet at some things, no one can realistically tell you what you can or cannot do.  You have probably been told a jillion times ""you can't do that!"" when you already had done it.  I know I tend to find my limits by falling on my face because failure is the only sure measure of what I genuinely cannot do.  I have been told so many times that I could not do something when, in fact, I absolutely could do it that I just can't take the word of other people concerning what is a reasonable goal.  I also loathe this aspect of my life.  This is not how I want it to be.  But it would be insane to behave more ""conservatively"" when there is a mountain of evidence showing that what other people believe is ""impossible"" is often just difficult for me but not impossible.  This gives other people a certain perception about me reminiscent of what I am hearing about Richard Branson but the public feedback I get about how people see me is very different from my own view of myself.  So just because outsiders look at Branson and view his life as lived in a ""desperate"" state does not mean that is how he experienced it.<p>PS -- My computer is back from the shop.  Woot! :)",1252626479

I was wondering how to do the awk-style structure in perl; it was unfair I didn't research it.<p>Maybe it's just me, but I find it much harder to read than the awk syntax, I think mostly because of the dollar signs.  I think it's pretty crowded as a four liner.  Awk's condition-action syntax helps a little here too.<p><pre><code>    BEGIN { open(VOCAB, "">vocab""); }\n    if (!$imap{$ARGV}{$F[0]}) { $imap{$ARGV}{$F[0]} = ++$I{$ARGV}; }\n    if (!$jmap{$F[1]}) { $jmap{$F[1]} = ++$J;print VOCAB $F[1] .

But at least we can make the living think a little bit about the consequences of their actions.<p>The country that I live in (nl) does all kinds of unspeakable things to foreigners (jail them, make them take tests to prove their going to be good dutch people and so on), in short discriminates against them left, right and center.<p>For gays, lesbians and 'others' (no, I'm not forgetting you this time), the battle here (nl) is mostly won, there are plenty of others that still need doing.

But it's 'cost free' because it does not actually go at the expense of one of those things, and it may help in the future to avoid stupid 'mistakes' like these so that at that time there will be less important stuff that needs dealing with.",1252623845

It's pretty disheartening; I have a bunch of things-I'd-like-to-do but no money, and have never been good at talking up money or even asking for it. Indeed, part of the problem is an excess of belief in the 'do what you love and the money will come' ethic. It might, but you've got to be good at marketing, plus there are times when you will simply get ripped off.<p>Not blaming the system or anything like that, but if you start out from the wrong place or make a few bad decisions at non-obvious but critical turning points, burning desire isn't always enough. EDIT: I don't mean in the sense of I'm going to lie down and die now, but that effort + ambition doesn't always translate to a successful payoff.",1252623712
