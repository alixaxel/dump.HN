If bands attract more fans, these fans are more likely to pay to go to another concert the next time they go through town (the concert tickets are <i>not</i> pay-what-you-can). Even if Terra Bite was selling coffee accessories, but the actual coffee was pay-what-you-can, I would expect that they would have a hard time making ends meet.<p>In the case of bands, they are 'giving away' one product to promote another. Not only that, but when people come to a concert they are committing an entire slot of time, and throughout the concert the band builds that emotional bond/connection with the audience. When you go someplace for food, a <i>lot</i> of people are just going to pop in, grab some food and pop out. I'm sure that a lot of the 'coffee-house regulars' type people paid a fair price (or more) for what they got at Terra Bite, but not nearly the same.",1253577513

It's soooo much easier (and more pleasurable) to prototype in Python versus chasing down null pointer violations all afternoon. At least for my simulations I have always found that 90+% of the execution time is spent in one or two routines which can then be factored out into C (or FORTRAN, which is faster.) Also, it's much easier to inspect and graph your data in Python; when I develop in C I tend to skip these things because they're such a PITA.

There's no way around that. Even if this device was powered by a wad of used chewing gum it would be hard to hit a $300, $400 or $500 price point. Let's assume it's not powered by used chewing gum and speculate you need a CPU capable of handling modern web technologies. I believe Flash support was promised? Double, or triple your baseline CPU specs. Flash isn't getting any skinnier as the years go on. So you have this wonderful device with a huge touchscreen and a fast CPU that magically costs only $300, er $400. Great.<p>How's the battery life? Turns out good small form factor battery technology isn't cheap. Unfortunately that big LCD touchscreen and fast CPU need lots of power. Let's assume you want the battery to last at least 2 hours (which would be on the low side of acceptable for a modern laptop) but you don't want the device to be 2 inches thick. Maybe with a really good battery and some serious power management tweaking you can get your 2-3 hours. (just don't watch a flash video with your backlight turned above 50% or cut that figure down to 45-60m)<p>Don't forget industrial design. No one wants a 2"" thick tablet so figure almost everything in the device has to be carefully designed to fit into you enclosure. Make sure it doesn't overheat. Make sure it gets good radio reception. Make sure there isn't a design flaw that causes the battery cover latch to break and fall off due to repetitive stress. Make sure you built it out of durable plastic. It's probably going to be bumping around in people's backpacks a lot. You might also want to include some boring stuff like BlueTooth, 802.11 wifi, at least leave some space for a GSM/CDMA chip and antennas. Probably wouldn't hurt to include some storage so you can run an OS. Oh you need one of those too.

My friend Sean and I carried the fiber splicer used for the initial rollout as a carry-on.<p>From my biased and limited perspective, the challenges in bringing internet access to Rwanda are hardly technological, but overwhelmingly political.<p>I'd rather not go into the details of the political problems here. But here are some things I'm pretty sure are true and partial causes to The Problem of Bringing Internet to Rwanda:<p>- Rwanda has a very unreliable power infrastructure. I remember standing on the roof of building that Terracom was in, watching a blackout roll across the city.<p>- Last time I checked, there was no IX in Rwanda.<p>- Terracom deployed a very extensive fiber network. But, much like the fiber network owned by the City of San Francisco, this network is hardly used. Most of the schools have unplugged equipment racked in a closet.<p>- The cell phone network in Rwanda is amazing, I was very upset when I returned to the pathetic offerings in the United States. Shortly after I left, Terracom and MTN both offered high speed links over their cell networks, but ...<p>- Because it is a land locked country. Getting high bandwidth, low latency connectivity is capital 'H' Hard. Satellite links are expensive, and have a minimum of 1000 ms latency. Running fiber to the coast and tapping in to a undersea cable is out of the question. See also: o3bnetworks.com",1253575658

835823,comment,835759,835759,0,0,skolor,,,"Ha-rumph. Allow me to call them out on their ""three points"":<p>1. The networks are running at capacity. Well, maybe they are, I don't have inside information as to the big ISP's networks. What I do know, however, is that other countries have networks with 5x the bandwidth that the fastest internet connections available here have.While it may be prohibitively expensive to roll that out all across the country, there is no real reason not to have it available in major cities, except to create an artificial scarcity of bandwidth.<p>In addition to that, traffic shaping doesn't help the problem, it makes it worse. There are two ways an end user sees the speed of their connection: latency and throughput. Traffic shaping works by lowering the throughput of bandwidth-intensive applications, so that there is more bandwidth left over for the rest of the users. However, if all of the bandwidth intensive applications are being shaping, and slowed down, then the overall throughput the user sees will decline sharply. In addition, latency, or the overhead time it takes for any request to be processed goes up when traffic is being shaped, making it take longer for individual pages to load too, and make the service seem slower in a non-quantifiable way.<p>2. We can't enforce it. This is simply not true. Its relatively simple to check to see if your traffic is being shaped and/or impeded, and several applications have been released to do so. Sure, it would be difficult for the government to do so, but if the average user can quickly and easily check, that is not nearly the problem the article makes it out to be.<p>3. Ok, you have a point there. Having regulations does add bureaucracy into the situation, which is rarely a beneficial thing. <i>Now the FCC is proposing taking a free market that works</i> Except that it doesn't work. The ISPs are already threatening to close down their networks, and make things much more closed off. We already regularly have ISP peering problems, there is little to stop them from just cutting off portions of the internet at their whim. Blind faith in ""Free Market"" is not infallible, it requires the public to be well educated, both in how the service/product works, and in the alternatives to it. At this point, neither of those are true. Your average user understands how an ISP works to about the point of: ""It gets me my Youtube and MySpace"". On top of that, there largely aren't alternatives. Want high speed? You have one, maybe two options, depending on where you are. Live out in the country, and you're lucky to have one.Sure, you could have some kind of satellite setup, but that is slow and expensive, and generally harder to set up/keep maintained.<p>I am generally against government regulations, but with something like the internet, I think Net Neutrality is a necessary thing, and that the government needs to step in and make sure ISPs don't start abusing their networks.",1253575468
