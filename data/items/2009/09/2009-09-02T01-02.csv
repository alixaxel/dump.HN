799298,comment,799050,799208,0,0,rimantas,,,"Actually there are two different things—the parser and the rendering mode. The choice of the former depends solely on the MIME type—no matter that docypte you use if your page is served with text/html MIME it will be parsed by HTML parser. And keep in mind, that every slash in ""/>"" is treated as invalid attribute by this parser, so serving your XHTML page as text/html may be not the best idea. BTW, do ""view source"" of such page in Firefox 3 and you will see all slashes in red.<p>And if you did happen to server XHTML with proper MIME there could well be the case that your page would take longer to load on Gecko <1.9 — it did not support incremental rendering of XHTML so your document had to be fully loaded before it could be rendered.<p>HTML engine choses rendering mode (standards, almost standards, quirks) depending on DOCTYPE (for XHTML parser it is always standards mode). HTML engine must be always ready to recover from markup errors (and HTML5 does a good job describing what to do), XHTML parser can just die on the first error it encounters.",1251856636

The number of companies that distribute software, whether compiled or as source, is really quite tiny when compared to the number of companies that <i>use</i> software.  Not to say that the GPL isn't a problem for some companies, and it's hardly surprising that said companies would pull out this metaphorical splinter if that is viable for them, but it seems implausible to me that (e.g.) Nike is horrified at the thought that their website is completely dependent upon GPL'd code.<p>I don't think there are many sane people who expect corporations to stick their necks out for the GPL as a matter of principle; that said, I don't think many people really care.

It's not clear yet that his proposed stages of development are as invariant as some readers of his books, think, either. MIT professor Seymour Papert actually studied with Piaget when Piaget was still alive, and this is what Papert says about how little Piaget's developmental hypothesis constrains profound giftedness: ""The case [of Jean Piaget] has a mild irony in that this man, so often quoted as the authority on what children cannot do because they are not at appropriate stages of development, published his first scientific article at age eleven!"" -- Seymour Papert, The Children's Machine: Rethinking School in the Age of the Computer (1993).",1251854602

But on the scale of years, there are turning points at which there is a HUGE amount of drama and VERY high stakes for the ensuing years.  Cinderella probably had her boring days once she was ""living happily ever after"", but the week or so it took to get hitched by the prince WAS just as dramatic as all that, and the outcome was worthy of the drama.<p>I think because high stakes and high drama processes DO happen in real life, we simulate them with vicarious experiences of narrative so we can be ready mentally.  If we don't digest stories beforehand, we won't have a model for when we discover we have cancer, risk losing a job or a deal, court a loved one, try to get accepted to an ivy league school, etc.<p>And if there isn't SOME drama in your life with real stakes and real risks, you probably need to go out and take on some challenges.
