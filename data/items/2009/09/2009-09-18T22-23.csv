Like all cultures, they are resistant to being changed unless that change comes from within.<p>Given that, acquired companies tend to be mis-matched in trying to contribute what they know. Even if some of the company listens, there are many areas that aren't interested in what they have to say.<p>The best thing that could ever be hoped for in an acquisition is that the acquired company is run as an independent subsidiary, simply required to funnel money to to parent company. Any time the two companies are asked to merge in any real way, the result is inevitably, regardless of how it is done, the loss of the bought entities ideals, culture and business practices is inevitable.",1253314582

Here's bumpf from their site....<p>--------<p>What are compute cycles?<p>Compute cycles measure how much processing time your applications require on the Rackspace Cloud. Using 10,000 compute cycles in a month is roughly equivalent to running a server with a 2.8 GHz modern processor for the same period of time.<p>How many compute cycles will my applications use?<p>Since web applications vary so greatly, it's hard to make a perfect guess. However, there are some guidelines that can help. First, you can think of 10,000 compute cycles as being about the same processing power as you'd get from a decent dedicated server or Amazon EC2 instance. For example 10,000 compute cycles would power:<p><pre><code>    * about 2.1 million page views using a database-driven content management system

    * about 11 million page views of rackspacecloud.com

    * about 25 million requests for a static 15KB image</code></pre>",1253314468

What we are actually discussing is the idea of limited liability - I apologize for the mistake.<p>Anyway, I guess what you're saying that that the issue of shareholders' limited liability is bogus because they can't be profiting from criminal behavior they don't know about, and when such criminal behavior is discovered it is stopped so there is no profit.<p>I am unpersuaded. This is like saying that if I am arrested immediately after robbing a bank, I should not be penalized because I haven't had an opportunity to spend any of the money yet and therefore derived no benefit from its theft. Surely, when a company is found guilty of some abuse (eg Pfizer's recent $2.5bn fine), haven't shareholders already enjoyed the profits in the form of dividends? OK, so after such a fine there won't be any more fat dividends for a while, but this is of no consequence to the shareholder who has already sold his holdings I'm afraid I see the doctrine of unlimited corporate rights but totally limited liability as a clear case of moral hazard.",1253314364

One of the major advantages to having a corporation is separate bank accounts.  Basically, the corporation, as a ""person,"" can own money and property that is legally separated from its owners'.  This means, among other things, that if a corporation is sued, the owners don't lose money out of their own bank accounts.  But it also means that they can;t give that money to a campaign in their own name.  If they want to use that money, it has to be given in the name of the corporation.

""Nine mouth-breathing idiots"" is an exaggeration, but in the dot-com days you'd get one brilliant guy, two experienced coders, six recent grads who barely passed their sophomore data structures class, and one person whose role in the project was completely baffling.  (He can't even read code, much less write it... he doesn't write documents... he doesn't know the design... he doesn't know what's going on on the project... is he a bodyguard?  A chaperone?

I'm obviously a huge fan of ""I bought it, its mine, stay out of my way"".  Additionally, as a fan of the potential of free markets (we rarely get to see one in action, so who knows, maybe I'd change my mind if I actually lived in one), I feel Apple and other's behavior potentially creates less-free markets (its one of the many things ""I believe but can't prove"").<p>Let me setup a really crazy example:<p>A home builder AppleHomes is selling high quality homes at hefty discounts from other builders.  Made in China, ""designed"" in California.  About a year into selling a few million houses, AppleHomes turns on their AppleCam network.  A million homes live for everyone to enjoy their reality fetish.  Sorry, you can't turn off your ShowerCam, its embedded into your product.  Doing so is a violation of rule 234.43B in the 1984-page ThinkOfTheChildredAct.  AppleHomes is being quite generous in discounting your AppleEnergy power bill with 50% of the revenue it generates from viewers of your AppleCams.<p>This example is meant to sound crazy.  But according to your views on business can do what it wants, isn't this scenario just as possible (though hopefully not probably)?",1253311343
