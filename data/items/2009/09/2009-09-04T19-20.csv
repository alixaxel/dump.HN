While 14-20k isn't that much, it does provide enough money not to have to think about bills for months. Perhaps even more importantly, taking someone else's money (esp. when that someone else is PG) is a pretty strong incentive to actually produce something.<p>2. Environment. When you physically move somewhere with the sole purpose of working on your startup, it's a lot more difficult to screw around. Not to mention the fact that you're constantly around your co-founder(s), and other startup founders, and the natural thing to do at that point is ""work"".<p>3. Distinction. Because YC is well known, people around you will recognize it. You will have some real level of clout, more so than being a part of a newborn virtual combinator clone. Albeit this one can probably improve with time..<p>Decent idea though. I personally wish there were more YC type people here in LA.",1252094026

It has a two-fold approach of both blocking the blood path the tumor is feeding of and using a localized chemo treatment. Wouldn't this approach be more effective than the actual ways?
I have another question. Since you claim that localized toxin causes the recurrence to be much more difficult to treat because the 1% that survives is resistant to chemo, wouldn't an unlocalized toxin be much worse because not only it would also not kill these 1% that was resistance, but also it would kill less of those 99% susceptible and would also kill some healthy cells, making the body weaker and the recurrence to occur sooner?",1252093905

Combat facing only.<p>Why?<p>Despite the (incorrect) Hollywood caricature of military leaders being shoot first ask questions later seim-psychotic  blowhards, the military rewards everything you want in a leader and at the same time aggressively weeds out all but the strongest performers.<p>A good military resume will almost without exception create the following person:<p>1. Analytical observer - the fog of war keeps these people asking ""what don't I know"" even when it seems clear that they have all the information about a decision point.<p>2. Good Planner - Data gathering is important in order to make the right calls.<p>3. Decision Maker - These folk are always able to make calls - yes sometimes the wrong one - without knowing certain details.<p>3. Decisive Action Taking - Once the call has been made, these folk see that the Action is executed immediately, and attempt to gather information regarding the effectiveness of the action as soon as possible.<p>4. Results focused - These people appreciate and reward high quality results, which means they tend to breed people like them.<p>However, the most important quality is:<p>5. ""In contact leadership"" - Combat leaders tend to have a significant ability to think on their feet in reaction to the changing environment. In my experience, this never seems to be properly learned in a civilian in the same way. I suppose it has something to do with the magnitude of the choices being made, but even non-combat military folk seem to be better at this than the average manager.<p>Yeah, I'm a veteran.

805525,comment,804974,805170,0,0,Novash,,,"I believe that there is a serious incentive on prevention and efficiency. However, there is a much louder voice for curing and expansion. I can offer you two reasons why.<p>1) Lack of better knowledge in the past:
For a long time people thought smoking was fashionable. Today we know it causes lung cancer, but it is now too late to tell all those people that have been smoking their entire life. This can be said about nearly everything in every other field. I would not say that we have better knowledge about many things now. Science is still not sure if eggs are good or bad for you, neither why many people develop lactose intollerance after their childhood. Because of that, prevention is pretty much a luck guess by now. We look at those who have survived and try to figure out why. Then we tell people to do that and see if it works, but there are so many factors that 'I' feel that prevention is in many cases just a gambling game.<p>2) Lack of knowledge of economy of scale.
When the industrial revolution started, steam was on its heydays, and all that, the idea of recycling and efficiency didn't exist AT ALL. People really thought that Earth could take everything that was thrown at it and its resources would last forever. Only now, with a population of many billions that we are seeing that Earth is panting, trying to catch up with our wasteful ways. The idea of 'reduce, reuse, recycle' to save resources is very new and there is a lot of social and economical mommentum it needs to overcome before it becomes mainstream.",1252092969

805513,comment,804716,805084,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Why are you upset that more men than women can change a tire?</i><p>First, because it mostly isn't true.  I don't know any women of my generation who have waited helplessly for someone to stop and help them; that's an absurd thing to even imagine.  I <i>do</i> know women who changed their first tire by following the owner's manual in the glove box -- women aren't helpless in the face of technology (except when they decide to be.)<p>Second, because when it is true, it's an abominable thing.  Being able to change a tire, via instructions or otherwise, is an important skill for anybody who drives.  Any woman who accepts this limitation for herself (or anyone who encourages it in a wife or daughter) shows a blatant disregard for her safety.  It just isn't safe for a woman to hang out on the side of the road waiting for a man to notice her helplessness.  Let's set aside the indignity of a woman needing to solicit help from a strange man for a job she could physically do herself, <i>simply because a flat tire falls under mens' purview</i>.  Let's not consider the absurdity of a woman standing beside her car for an hour waiting for a tow truck driver to come do a job she could handle herself in ten minutes.  Forget about all that.  <i>It just isn't safe</i> not to be able to change a tire.  What if the guy who stops to ""help"" her is attracted to her helplessness for the wrong reason?  (It's always dangerous to act like a potential victim.  A woman who can't change a tire screams, ""I can't take care of myself; take advantage of me."")  What if you get a flat tire on a busy highway where you can't pull very far off the road?  (The faster you get the tire fixed, the less time you spend on the shoulder waiting for an inattentive driver to drift over and hit you.)  What if you get a flat tire in a remote area?
