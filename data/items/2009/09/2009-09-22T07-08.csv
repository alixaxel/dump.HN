It is the choice of a large portion of the smartest people working in technology.  If we were talking about success amongst the hoi palloi (like, say, Windows), then your point would stand...but we're not.  UNIX has seen its fortunes flounder and flourish multiple times over the span of 30+ years, and yet, today, UNIX runs the most important technologies on earth (Google, Amazon, the majority of all other web applications, the best smart phones, most smart devices with anything more powerful than a simple microcontroller, and a whole lot more), because the people building them chose UNIX.<p>So, is UNIX technically sound and superior?  In the general case, I would say, unequivocally, yes.",1253605394
836517,comment,836308,836308,0,0,korch,,,"A decade ago I picked up a copy of the La Berge book that Ferris mentions. I highly recommend it as it seems to be the canonical book on the topic since La Berge was credited with being first to medically prove in a lab that lucid dreaming even exists. It takes like 3 months of daily dedicated practice to get the knack, but once you've trained your mind to do it, it gets easier to induce with repetition. Regular lucid dreaming is an incredible experience, and I can't even begin to explain the impact it has had on my own creativity and self of self. If you haven't done it--GO DO IT!!<p>And I agree with what others said about using LD'ing to aid in learning. For me it is hugely useful to get unconstrained ""practice"" time to quickly go through steps I need to remember when awake. I call it dream kata. I mean both mental steps, like learning math proofs in my case, and steps for physical things, like learning to rock climb(falling off cliffs and flying away is seriously fun). What's weird is after routinely LD'ing such practice scenarios, when I go back to regular dreaming, I will have non-lucid dreams of doing the same kinds of practices. We dream about what we regularly do each day, so it's a way of tricking the mind to watch and mimic itself. Somehow it engages a part of the subconscious to constantly practice and learn.<p>While LD'ing sounds trivial, the time can add up and I think it has huge potential to give those who employ it an edge. Let's say you lucid dream for 2 hours every night for just 3 years--then you've got 2k+ hours of practice time in whatever you do. Take Gladwell's book Outliers and his account that ""geniuses"" in any field excel simply because they have had so much more raw practice than others. While we don't know how common lucid dreaming is amongst these ""geniuses"", it might be another explantion of this ""practice == genius"" phenomenon. The way I see it, if you can get 20% of the way to 10,000 hours just in your sleep, there's no reason to not be doing it.",1253605390
836516,comment,834314,834314,0,0,spoondan,,,"The HTML5 Working Group needs to reassess their rationale for choosing this API. The justification remains that this API originated with IE and is already implemented in both IE and Safari. Yet, between missing features and rampant bugs, the extant implementations are nowhere near the specified behavior. While specifying the correct behavior can help vendors fix their bugs, it's unclear why any vendor should invest their time and money into an API that is this complex, that no one likes, and that is missing required functionality.<p>In general, I think the HTML5 Working Group needs to be more aware of how standardization of deficient solutions can hurt the web. In this case, many people were blissfully ignorant of IE's awful drag and drop implementation until HTML5 threw a spotlight on it. It seems to me that the Working Group, then, has significantly raised the chances of this horrible API becoming further ingrained, rather than merely allowing it to die in deserved obscurity.",1253605367

836512,comment,834267,834267,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I made it pretty well despite having a somewhat challenging childhood. So did many of my friends. Here's two quick stories:<p>- My most influential mentor was born in the ghettos of London and dropped out of middle school. When he was 12, his home was raided by the police and he had a gun to the back of his head as his brother was arrested for dealing drugs. He can't read or write very well and he's dyslexic. He became a construction worker. Now he's running one of the most profitable construction firms in the Middle East and owns properties in five or six countries. He makes about $20,000 per month in salary and bonuses, not including his investments.<p>- My best friend had the hell beaten out of him by his father, until he got big enough to fight back and eventually kicked the hell out of his Dad, which then ended in an uneasy truce. He dealt drugs in high school, got into college, and dropped out. He became a self made millionaire at age 24. He's 29 now, lives in Bel Air in a three million dollar home, and in a bad year he makes $200,000.<p>Me? I dropped out of two high schools and left home at age 16 or 17, just scrapping here and there to get by. I then dropped out of another university. I didn't have what you'd call an easy childhood, but I did okay too.<p>A lot of my friends and mentors are like this. We're all self-made - we get along sort of okay with old money people, but fit right in with entrepreneurs and self made people. Many of them come up from hard times. An acquaintance of mine is 60ish, Polish, and spent her childhood in a concentration camp. Her family became wealthy black-marketing goods past the Communist lines for sale, and eventually a branch of their family came to America. She's a psychologist, her husband is some sort of businessman.<p>Everyone successful I know internalizes their problems - that means they blame themselves and take responsibility. This is key - if other people are doing things to you, then you can't change that and you're stuck. But if everything is your fault and responsibility, you can change that and win. So, dyslexic? Up to me to deal with. Racism? Up to me to deal with. Grew up poor? Up to me to deal with. Spent childhood doing forced labor in a Nazi factory? Up to me to deal with. Abused? Up to me to deal with. Speak very lower-class English? Up to me to deal with. No English? Up to me to deal with.<p>Now, I remember some sort of study that quoted: ""People who internalize failure and externalize success are less happy but more successful. People who externalize failure and internalize success are more happy and less successful.""<p>The ""it's my fault, and my problem, and I'll deal with it"" attitude makes you more successful and less happy. As a bonus, everything good that happens is luck and a blessing and can't be counted on. You'll be less content, much less content, but go much further.<p>So me? I always blame myself. ""Partner stole a lot of money? That's my fault, I should've been paying attention to the finances."" Success? ""Got an important order? That's good luck, can't count on that in the future.""<p>Most people do the opposite. ""Life is hard and unfair, but everything I've achieved despite that is because I'm awesome."" Everyone successful I know - ""I've been dealt a good set of cards, I'm extraordinary lucky, and every mistake and hardship is on me."" Less contentment, less surface happiness, much more accomplishment and triumph. It's the only way to the highest levels of accomplishment in any field.",1253605091

That applies more to trade and specialisation.<p>The basic laws of supply and demand (price of labour will adjust until all labour is employed) should theoretically be enough to cover it. But I don't find this to be sufficiently explanatory of what we observe in the world.<p>For one thing, you would expect that the price of labour be extremely volatile, especially at the bottom, in response to technologically driven change. This is not the case. The price of labour tends to be stable and rises slowly across most categories at the bottom (though it does not necessarily keep pace with the economy).<p>For another, in such a world one would expect the effects of minimum wage on employment levels to be easy to predict (like price restrictions on the consumption of goods and services). They are not. We can play games in the extreme margins (see what happens if you set minimum wage to $1000 p/h), but in the moderate ranges, the effects are usually pretty foggy.<p>In any case, citing some fundamental economic principle is not what I meant when I said explanation. I meant at least to some idea of how the mechanics of that principle apply in this case.<p>Labour is different to most inputs in that production of its raw materials is not really sensitive to prices or market forces,. It is, from the market's perspective, arbitrary.",1253604857

This is not science fiction. We are starting to see that happen with energy with things like rooftop solar panels and less expensive wind turbines. We are nowhere near where we need to be, but it is obvious that eventually everyone will be able to produce his or her own energy.</i><p>I don't think that's going to happen.

A microkernel can be just as bloated, in it the bloat is just not in the kernel itself, but in the processes providing the services a monolithic kernel would provide. If anything, a microkernel is always more bloated because of the extra code needed to do all the process sync.<p>Linux being a microkernel would make the situation <i>worse</i>.<p>(What we need to do is to start spending more time on cutting features.)",1253602942
