804245,comment,803899,804205,0,0,pvg,,,"That's possible especially since I'm not a 'security practitioner' and I'm essentially talking about a subjective personal impression - that it's taken less seriously, is less reported and incidences of specific vulnerabilities or exploits in specific apps are not tracked in the way they are for operating systems and major applications. This may, in part, be because in the case of web apps fixes are immediately available to all users. On the other hand, you can head to the RoR download page right now and click your way to downloading the current vulnerable version of RoR. At no point will you get a suggestion to check for recent security advisories or patches.",1252036721
804244,comment,803816,803816,0,0,thristian,,,"The main problem with using a proportional font for terminals is that so many programs use spaces and tabs to align text in different rows to better convey the structure of the information they present.<p>A secondary problem is that the control sequences that tell the terminal where to move the cursor are all defined in a grid-based coördinate system - if the terminal receives a ""move the cursor down one line"" sequence, its new position will be different depending on whether you choose to conserve the horizontal coordinate measured in characters or in pixels.<p>Of course, it would be perfectly possible to design a terminal whose control sequences made no such assumptions, but the DEC VT100 and its multitudinous offspring have been with us for a very long time now, and probably always will be.",1252036498

I don't really do these competitions so took me about 2 1/2 hours but still those guys are fast.  Here are my thoughts on the problems:<p>A) Trick was to reverse the problem.  Instead of checking if different permutations of the test cases matched the dictionary, see if you can build each dictionary word out of the test case.  My python solution finishes the large input in about 6s.<p>B) Nothing tricky here, like others said it just required some debugging.<p>C) A dynamic programming problem.

804213,comment,804158,804158,0,0,CamperBob,,,"Here's what I sent her (quoting):
""Only a year on the books and the California hands-free cell phone law is virtually ignored.  I see people everywhere and every day driving and talking on their cell phones. There seems to be three types of people; those who do not use a cell phone in the car at all, those who use a hands-free device, and those who don’t.  I was wondering why so many people seem not to care if there is a law?""<p>Respect for traffic laws is regularly degraded by feel-good measures like unreasonably low speed limits, obvious speed traps that have nothing to do with traffic safety, 20-mile-long highway ""work zones"" with no workers but plenty of cops, ""traffic calming"" devices such as unnecessary stop signs and obstacles, and countless other signs of governmental indifference to drivers' everyday concerns.  Traffic laws are treated as optional because they are often completely unrelated to safety.<p>""Is it because they think the ticket is so cheap?  Is it that their chances of getting caught are so low?""<p>There have been numerous studies suggesting that hands-free devices are no safer when driving.  This is undoubtedly because when it comes to traffic safety, your presence of mind is far more important than where your hands are.  Perhaps more drivers realize the truth of that idea than you might think.<p>I violate the hands-free law frequently, but never in a context where I'm likely to need the missing brainpower.  I wouldn't behave any differently with a hands-free device because I know it would still be hazardous for me to do so, based on my own driving abilities and general absentmindedness.  Michael Schumacher can use his phone anywhere he wants, but I'm too easily distracted to get away with that!<p>I think it was Jaron Lanier who defined virtual reality as ""the place where you're at when you're on the telephone.""  Virtual reality, whatever it is, doesn't sound like a good place to be when you're driving.  My suspicion is that hands-free laws don't work for anyone except legislators who are pandering for votes and/or desperate for revenue, and cops who are always looking for excuses to stop people who aren't doing anything wrong besides driving in the wrong car, in the wrong place, and/or with the wrong skin color.",1252034823

  o They're taking the time out to hit 
     all of those airports.

  o They came up with a theme ""Stories

  o They put together a website - clean graphics, 
     nicely laid out fonts.

  o They're reaching out to JetBlue Executives, 
     promoting themselves, getting a nice HN exposure.
