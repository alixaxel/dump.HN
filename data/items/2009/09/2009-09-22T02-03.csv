Browsers typically won't open more than 2 simultaneous connections to the same host, so too many assets can quickly lead to noticeable delays.<p>The one exception I can think of is if you have a lot of JS code, but some of it needs to load faster.  In that case you may want to split the code into several files based on load priority.  If you go that route you may want to also use multiple asset subdomains or ideally a CDN to minimize latency.",1253588390

Working through all the implications and trying to create a robust set theory took a lot of time, and involved a few unexpected complications. 'Course it all looks simple now from our 21st century perspective, but it didn't happen overnight.<p>I suspect the theory of causality will be the same way; yeah, a quick approximation that works most of the time is readily available (almost enough information in that post for a mathematically-inclined person to work it out, after all), but working through all the nuances will probably take us somewhere unexpected. For example: What will it mean when someone proves there is no one theory of causality, like there is no one set theory? (Obviously, I don't know this will happen, but from a strictly mathematical point of view it sure wouldn't surprise me much; for a similar example, see Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.

836133,comment,835991,835991,0,0,n8agrin,,,"Always use ""var"" to define a variable, unless you know exactly what you are doing. e.g.:<p><pre><code>  var foo = 'bar';
</code></pre>
When you don't use ""var"" the Javascript interpreter breaks out of the current scope and continues to do so all the way until it hits the final global scope (generally the window object in browsers).  If it does not find the variable, it then defines it.  If it does find it, it will trample the found variable with the new value.  For example:<p><pre><code>  var foo = 'bar';

  function baz() {
    foo = 'baz';
  }

  baz();

  // now foo == 'baz';
  console.log(foo);
  >>'baz'
