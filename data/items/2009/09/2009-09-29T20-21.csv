Some people like minimalism, some don't.<p>>> ""There are more people in the comments here saying Campfire needs to be superseded. Why?""<p><i>everything</i> needs superseding at some point, it's how things improve. Surely. Unless they are actively superseding themselves with new versions. You can't really stand still.<p>Is campfire still being developed and improved upon? Is it really the best it can be? What features did they add in the last month?<p>There's certainly space for a lot of webchat apps, and I'm skeptical that campfire is 'the best webchat can be' (And neither is Mibbit for that matter).<p>I can't speak for the other webchat developers, but in my case, working on mibbit is just plain fun.

It isn't ""wah, I have to fix bugs before my program works"" so much as, ""translating my entire design into types upfront is slowing down my brainstorming too much"". I'm not convinced waiting ten minutes before the code has to get past HM would cause a big increase in bugs slipping through, but it really does help make the language feel more flexible.<p>I think a better time for such static analysis (not just type-checking) would be when the code becomes a module and the programmer is already thinking about what to export, etc. Requiring a chunk of code in a scratch buffer or REPL to fully type-check is probably a bit too strict, except checking calls to existing libraries.

It makes about as much sense as actor/programmer.<p>The perverse incentives this creates are massive. Universities hire scientists rather than teachers in order to get their hands on half the scientist's grants [1]. Scientists waste their time masquerading as teachers because they can't get grants if they don't work for a university [2]. This is harmful both to science (I'm not doing research in class) and students. Of course, they don't put much effort into teaching because they are judged on their ability to get grants. Actual teachers are squeezed out, since there is no room for them.<p>My proposed solution? Completely decouple research and teaching. The NSF can subsidize science, the DOE can subsidize universities, and teaching institutions will no longer have an incentive to hire scientists as teachers.<p>[1] If a scientist gets a grant, the university will take about half as ""overhead"".<p>[2] Not strictly true, due to a few national labs, but close enough.",1254255178

I had issues with using this and offlineimap to sync... Sometimes when I moved a mail from one 'folder' to another offlineimap would delete it from one folder and then create it in another, but Gmail's IMAP server would see that the mail had no labels on it (in the middle of the operation) and then move it to the trash instead.
