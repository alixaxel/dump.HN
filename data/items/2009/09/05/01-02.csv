It not only gets the basic feel of our work across to a normal person very succinctly, it also gets across something of why we like it.  The conversation can proceed to details and interesting examples, or not, but either way, the person has learned something truly important.<p>Fantastic.",1252115824

806033,comment,804935,805541,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""You want leaders, go military.""<p>There are as many bad ""leaders"" in the military as in any other organization. Viewing military experience as providing some kind of extra leadership credentials is naive. Veterans like to think this is true. There is no real evidence it is. (feel free to provide some).<p>Your list provides a handful of characteristics <i>good</i> leaders have, irrespective of field of activity. Such leaders exist in all fields where competition among groups of people exists. Military history is full of incidences where rigid, dogmatic commanders led their men to disaster, alongside many instances where inspired leadership made  a difference.<p>As btilly pointed out above, the military ""leadership"" style depends on a command and control organization where orders are (ultimately) obeyed even when they seem senseless.(""take that hill"", the charge of the Lighr Brigade). Hardly good training to lead a group of free thinking professionals.<p>At least in the software industry the best leaders by and large <i>don't</i> have military experience. For good reason. Leading people who can ""vote with their feet"" anytime is a very different kettle of fish from leading a group of people who are duty bound to obey you even at the cost of their lives. Good hackers in particular don't ""take"" well to military style command.<p>""You want leaders, go military.""  makes about as much sense as ""You want leaders, go politics."".<p>In both fields there are good leaders and bad leaders and there is a ""ruthless weeding out process"". (As a reductio ad absurdum  argument) A case could be made that people who've been successful in politics (sure, frontline only, if you want it that way - in this case people who've stood for elections and been elected to office) are much better placed to lead a team  than people who've been successful in the military. After all they know how to listen to people, harmonize interests, evolve a consensus, communicate decisions and so on.<p>""A good military resume will almost without exception create the following person:""<p>replace military with ""sports"" or ""community organizer"" and the list remains unchanged wrt to the leadership <i>qualities</i> required (though their expression will change depending on the filed of activity).<p>The key word in your sentence is ""good"" not  ""military"".<p>""A good X resume will exhibit leadership qualities""  where X is any group activity with a competitive element.",1252113915

806031,comment,805901,805901,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Well, good for the court, but I have a rather different take on this.<p>As far as I can tell, based on the information given, the ""hackers"" (no, I don't like this use of the word, either) didn't steal money from the woman. <i>The bank did.</i><p>Consider: Do I care how much money my bank gives to someone who is using my identity? Not much, really. Of course, I'm generally in favor of my bank guarding its resources prudently, but, really, $26,000 is a drop in the bucket compared to the assets most banks have. If my bank wants to give $26,000 to some random person who happens along, well then, I think they're stupid, but it's not a huge problem with me.<p>However, for the bank to claim that <i>my account balance has been reduced</i> by $26,000 as a result of their stupidity, well, that <i>is</i> a problem. Giving out money to random people is dumb, but covering their stupidity by taking money from me -- that is theft.<p>The conceptual error occurs when you say that the ""hackers"" withdrew money from my account. No, only I am authorized to do that. These people obtained money from the bank by means of fraud, but the fact that my identity info was used, is not relevant to my account balance.<p>Another way to think about it is that the bank does not have a box somewhere with my name on it. Instead, a savings account (for example) is a <i>loan</i> from me to the bank, on which the bank pays me interest. The account balance is the amount the bank owes me. So, the bank got stupid and gave some money to some nasty person. Does that affect how much they owe me? Nope. Is the fact that the bank <i>thought</i> they were partially repaying my loan, relevant to how much they owe me? Nope.<p>A final thought: suppose the tables were turned. I owe the bank money (I have a mortgage). Suppose someone came to my door and said, ""Hi! I'm from your bank, and, for your convenience, I'll take your mortgage payment."" And I'm stupid, so I stuff a wad of bills into this person's hand. Now suppose that this person is not really from the bank. Does their action affect my mortgage balance? Of course not. Further, in this situation, would any reasonable person claim that my visitor stole <i>from the bank</i>? Of course, not, they stole from <i>me</i>. If I refuse to pay back my mortgage now, then <i>I</i> am the one ripping off the bank, not my visitor.<p>I conclude that, again, the problem this woman has, is not that some ""hacker"" stole her money; it is that <i>the bank</i> stole her money.<p>UPDATE: Started reading the article again. The more I read, the more ridiculous the thinking appears. Look at the first sentence: ""An Illinois district court has allowed a couple to sue their bank on the novel grounds that it may have failed to sufficiently secure their account, ...."" Dumb. I think they should sue the bank for taking their money and wrecking their credit without cause. Why should the bank's security have anything to do with them?",1252113636
