It's so practical compared to old-school GUI development, and so it pulls you in and mushrooms into a scaling/integration/maintenance fiasco unless you can say ""no no no!"" to every non-essential feature.

Real change is a development, certification, marketing, sales, and accounting system that lets drug X actually help people. Ideas are cheap. Execution is tough. I might have a drug that cures cancer, but if I can't prove it, if I can't get funding, if I can't get certification, if I can make the drug, warehouse it, distribute it, etc -- it's just an idea.<p>This is why the argument does not work against general science.

Employment pays taxes, puts rooves over people's heads, causes stress and worry (what if I lose my job!?), informs societal choices regarding basic social services (tied to company healthcare).

Bullshit.  The ambitious kid will find a way.  This isn't about him.<p>This is about all the people struggling on the lowest rungs of a profession, trying to enter it.  They can't find a job, so they'll jump at any chance they can to be ""working"" in their chosen field, even if they don't get paid.  They're strung along with the promise of an actual job down the road.  And guess what?  As soon as they want money, they're out, replaced by someone else who's willing to work for free.  This is about having too much supply and not enough demand for a profession, and free labor only makes the problem worse, by masking the real market condition.<p>This is about a lot of things.  It's about ambitious kids, it's about struggling people, it's about flux in employment conditions.  You can bring in mentions of the apprenticeship model of yore, but you'll probably realize pretty quickly that there are some big differences.<p>But let's drop that bullshit and call it what it is, Mark.

YC themselves are good at pointing out that most start-ups have to change direction/pivot multiple times before being successful.  That's why it's about the people/founders imho.<p>I also suspect that there is little correlation in terms of success or not for companies accepted/not accepted into YC. The one exception worth exploring is that moving to SV for 90 days for non SV companies and working in one living room might increase focus and hence chances of success.

806591,comment,806563,806563,0,0,rapind,,,"It may not be a popular opinion but I agree with the US gov on this one. Everyone wants something for free.<p>However, I think the big problem is how the compensation is valued. If the experience gained by the intern is more valuable than minimum wage, then yes, the law seems broken. However for every job that would actually provide meaningful experience and benefit the intern there are probably many other internships that provide very little if any benefit to the intern. Since the gov really has no easy way of measuring the experience / networking compensation, if they attempted to, it would be to the detriment of the mojority of iterns, who would end up working for free for very little if any benefit.<p>I don't have any numbers to back up my claim of non-beneficial v.s. beneficial free internships. However, I also don't have anything to gain either way and it's just my impartial gut feeling that any system that tried to solve his problem would create more problems for the majority of these free interns, or end up costing tax payer's a lot to police the practice.",1252163523
