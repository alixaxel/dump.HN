Before we got (expensive) group health insurance, we lost a large portion of our most promising candidates over health insurance concerns.<p>I say this on HN constantly because it bears repeating: if you want to understand the problem with the current health insurance system, assume that a normal family of four cannot get private health care coverage at any reasonable price, or in some locales <i>at all</i>. It doesn't matter how much extra you pay your employees. There are many reasons, a bunch of which devolve to ""we don't want to cover women with functioning uteruses"", why a typical family cannot get covered outside the group coverage system.",1253739568

OO with its ""unifying"" attributes and methods is like a language with preformed phrases rather than words, and which can be modified in only limited, preset ways.

840078,comment,839830,839830,0,0,tiffani,,,"That article has a point, but it doesn't serve any purpose other than highlighting a problem we already know about--let's leave the dead horses alone.  As a minority (black female), it's nothing new.<p>> ""Attracting students' interest to fields where they have been traditionally underrepresented is a challenge, Ms. Bozeman said.""<p>It's a challenge for reasons the article doesn't even mention.  A certain elementary school I volunteered at during college in DC brings to mind why it might be an issue with minorities.  The school was predominantly minority--hispanics and blacks--and it seemed like the school system had forgotten about the kids.  (Yes, we know many DC schools have serious problems.)  Some of them didn't know their ABCs, had trouble with numbers, and couldn't even write their own names.  Granted this was a kindergarten class, but it wasn't as if my friends and I showed up to volunteer on the first day of school for them either.  We asked some of the kids if their parents helped them with their homework, etc. and most of them said no.  The school itself lacked basic supplies (no pencils with erasers for kindergartners??).  The problem starts <i>wayyy</i> before we've even gotten the kids to the college level and by then, I tend to think it's a little late to be thinking of how to deal with it.<p>Kids have to be set up earlier than high school and college for this stuff.  And I don't mean pulling a <i>few</i> kids aside from each class for academically gifted enrichment activities.  There definitely needs to be a wholesale overhaul of education in such a way that all kids think about those kinds of careers.<p>With that being said, I think the basic premise of the article is flawed, too.  I think we're experiencing a brain-drain all across the board and it just happens to be the case where minorities stand out once again.  I grew up in a pretty diverse environment (military brat) and I can't say all of my white, asian, and indian friends were flocking to AP Calculus either! lol.  As a matter of fact, most of my non-minority friends from high school who were considered by teachers and students alike to be smart actually didn't even go into fields like math or science--they tended to prefer journalism or law--with the <i>occasional</i> biology major.<p>This is an issue affecting everybody.",1253738454

It's about funding programs that will help attract and <i>retain</i> minority students in stem majors. If you don't understand that key difference, let me know. And if you don't understand the value of such programs, then you fail to realize what it will take for any company or country to compete globally.<p>Second, there are too many factors at play to just dismiss a student's abilities to start the next google, for example, by just assessing standardized test scores--especially, to assess his/her potential by how well on average his group/ethnicity performs. parse_tree, go back to my first point.<p>Such programs, I don't think, are intended to have immediate results. The goal is to retain as many people who are interested in stem majors as possible. Yes, but I think the biggest impact will come as a result of their kids having much more exposure and such people understanding the value of such programs that they reach out to others.<p>Finally, I think a lot would be best spent at an early age--early in a child's development. If you think a person's abilities are tied solely to genetics, you're wrong. Nurture plays an important role, and I've seen enough evidence to support that. Funding programs that compensate for parents not having an adequate education (and thus have to work multiple jobs, don't read enough to kids, etc) to offer their kids a good start.<p>Quick poll: of all you hackers here, how many had parents in stem majors?

840049,comment,839830,839996,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for the reply. Now what you haven't shown here is whether the actual persons who do score high enough to major in math (by the way, is there any evidence how high that is?) have been exhausted in current practice, or whether some (from whatever ethnic group) are turning to other careers. In other words, even if a decade from now there is still an ethnic score gap at high-school-graduating age, there may be some underutilized talented young people among the highest-scoring individuals in the lowest-scoring groups who could beneficially be encouraged to study math. Answering this question takes actual numbers rather than just mean scores--especially because the distribution of scores may not be the same in each ethnic group.<p>As the other participant who replied to your comment (the parent to this comment) mentioned, causation of the group score gap is still very unclear.

At which time he famously said that if anyone had a problem with it he'd '...see their resignation on his desk in the morning.'<p>EO 9981 was not simply a political move.  Our military strategists saw during WWII that it would be decidedly foolish for us to continue fighting wars with one hand tied behind our backs.<p>Around this same time, a wave of statutes swept the nation that made it illegal for most Americans under the age of 16 to drop out of High School.  Do not suppose that these things are coincidental.  They are common sense steps that had to be taken to address the new realities that were rapidly developing in the post WWII world.<p>The world is today, again, undergoing a process of rapid geopolitical and social change.  Strategists deep in the bowels of the American Government have looked into the future, and again, they find themselves wanting to change what they see looking back at them.<p>FACT: China has more high school honors students than the United States has high school students.  That's right.  If you take every high school student in the US, the poor students and the good students, China has more students than that in ONLY its high honors programs.<p>Look, the global economy will be the battlefield of choice in the future.  We do not intend to charge onto that battlefield with one hand tied behind our backs.<p>The only thing wrong with this article, in my opinion, is that it excludes the recruitment of white Americans.  We SHOULD be making sweeping policy changes to address these issues.  Immigration is not going to get us out of it.  I work half the time in Ningbo or Paris myself.  How long before Indians and Indonesians figure out that the smart CVs are flowing to China not California?  They are not blind.<p>I feel like Truman, if you have a problem with being more aggressive with American students with respect to instilling the disciplines of math and science, feel free to leave the country.

He's not really stating anything one way or the other about the free availability of papers online.  That's an issue that will exist whether papers are published in journals or in conference proceedings.  (Both options are expensive and time consuming, just in different ways.)<p>The main idea here, paraphrasing Fortnow, is that computer science needs to put more emphasis on publishing longer-form pieces representing bigger chunks of work in a context that allows for them to receive more thorough review.  The conference publication model is fine for an emerging field:  everyone is still sorting out the basics, so publishing small bits of work frequently is a good idea.  But, Fortnow argues, once a field becomes established, encouraging frequent publication of small chunks of work in settings that have become highly competitive leads to incrementalism, low quality peer review, and other ill effects.  Encouraging longer submissions, each representing a larger chunk of work, and each of which can receive more attention from reviewers, will hopefully have the effects of encouraging researchers to pursue riskier work and of putting reviewers more at ease with less derivative papers.<p>I think that's what he was saying, anyway.

",,"Last weekend I was working on a Rails project and realized that I was creating the same utility function for the third time in a row. In the spirit of DRY, I figured it was time to package it up into a gem that I could drop into any project.<p>The basic problem was creating a place to quickly and easily shove config values and application wide state. CONSTANTS in the environment work ok, but can't be modified by the run time. What I ultimately wanted was memcache, with persistence.<p>So I created the entity_store gem, which allows you to drop a persistent key/value store into any rails app in about 5 minutes. After initialization, you can use commands like:<p># Get key value.<p>e = EntityStore[""testkey""]<p>e = EntityStore.testkey<p>e = EntityStore[:testkey]<p># sets key named 'happened' to a Time object of now<p>EntityStore[:happened] = Time.now<p>EntityStore[""happened""] = Time.now<p>EntityStore.happened = Time.now<p>Everything syncs instantly with the database, so state is preserved even if the server goes down. Additionally, it allows you to initialize with some defaults for keys - which works great for getting initial state going on your app.<p>Overall, packaging up and publishing the gem in a decent state online took longer than actually writing the functionality.
