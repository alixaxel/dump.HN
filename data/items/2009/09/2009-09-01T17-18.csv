        var memory = {};
        return function memoized(arg) {
            return arg in memory ? memory[arg] : (memory[arg] = f(arg));

The big thing Lisp has left is reader and compile-time macros, and other systems [1] might be able to do both better pretty soon. Yes, Lisp has a lot to teach people who think that programming languages are passed down immutable from the superior minds of GvR or Stroustrup, but once you realize the enormous variety of decisions made in designing a language, it becomes clear that almost no number of languages will fill the space of possibilities.<p>A lot of ways, languages are like religions - they're part of social structure, and part of people's identity, and they tell you how to pray, when to fast, how to allocate and free memory, how to traverse the call stack, etc. But when you think about it hard enough, it's clear that all of these decisions are better made by individuals, not committees or institutions.<p>1. <a href=""http://piumarta.com/software/cola/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piumarta.com/software/cola/</a>",1251827967

But another point to make is that on Ubuntu, another 20 minutes, maybe an hour at most, gets me a fully loaded system, while on Windows I'm swapping CDs for days. Of course, I don't have to do that Cisco VPN stuff he complains about.<p>- An issue that he doesn't touch on at all is the general ""scriptability"" of the system.

The whole point of GCD is that it's trivial to use, therefore making it easy to benefit from multicore machines.<p>> Does your Erlang example take into account the overall work the entire OS is doing on each individual processor core, adjusting the number of threads as the amount of overall work changes — or does it just take the Erlang-program's own work into account?<p>In the erlang view of the world, the erlang runtime is the OS. And within that context, Erlang takes in account the overall work of itself (in fact, it more precisely doesn't give a damn: it spawns a scheduler thread per logical core -- or more or less if you ask it to -- and then dynamically maps Erlang processes on these OS threads the way GCD dispatches queued tasks to its threadpool).",1251827463

If you look at the stats of the forum they get very little traffic (relatively), and the forum itself is pretty barren.<p>Therefore, I highly highly doubt that the majority of the revenue is coming from the community itself. Rather, it sounds like the forum is a legitimizing component that is essentially a front for the money making schemes behind the back.<p>This happens a lot with affiliate and domain sites.<p>You have some lucrative affiliate relationships that you can hardcore SEM against, however you need a site that looks good if the advertisers ever check you out. So what they do is usually purchase a respectable site, has the air of a community, looks good, etc. And then they have this shadow site that runs off the same domain that they arbitrage against with pages that are super ad/affiliate heavy and make tons of money.<p>Combining a legit domain/site with an SEM shadow site is also useful for making sure your AdWord rates stay lower. If your domain has more authority and natural SEO traffic/PR then it seems like Google won't charge you as much to get higher SEM listings.<p>It's actually a ""simple"" model and can be EXTREMELY lucrative. However, it doesn't really add much value to the world, and they can go out of business in an instant if the CPC rates change in any direction.",1251826544

Actually, the main success of lisp comes from its purity its scientific deepness. If you try to follow another goal, you just lose vision for your actual one.
If somebody really needs an ""everybodys"" language, for example because he is a lawyer or something else, okay. There is Python, Javascript, Java and many other languages who try in different ways to be for everybody. And all of them are important. As is Lisp, how it is.",1251824697
