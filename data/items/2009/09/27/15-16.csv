To me, ""ideology"" refers to the values that drive us-- the reasons we do things. Certainly, Stallman is driven by ideology, but isn't Eric Raymond as well? Aren't we all?<p>I understand that there are non-ideological reasons for things-- like you started crying because you learned your dog had died. You're having an immediate, emotional reaction; there's no rational thought involved. But I don't understand the distinction between ""pragmatism"" and ""ideology"" in the realm of rational thought, like choosing software licenses. In my experience, when someone asks me to be ""pragmatic,"" it is the same as someone asking me to do something that seems like a bad idea.<p>They're usually requests like, ""Let's just copy a little bit of this code off Sourceforge and act like it's ours. They won't mind. Come on, be pragmatic."" Or maybe, ""If you would release that code under the BSD license, we could use it in our proprietary commercial applications. Come on, be pragmatic.""<p>I'd love it if someone could give me a better way to think about the difference between pragmatism and ideology, or help me understand why I continually disagree with other people about this sort of thing. My best guess is that people who ask me to be ""pragmatic"" are just full of crap, or at least some of them are, but I'm also open to the possibility that I'm just misunderstanding the world.",1254065975

I don't think hiding comment scores will have that effect, though it might make it more difficult to recognize when it happens.<p>The one thing in this experiment that might (I intuit) help discourage groupthink related behaviors is hiding one's own score from oneself, because people will then be less emboldened when they're being idiots just for expressing popular opinions.  Unfortunately, this will also (I intuit) discourage people when they're being smart from as readily taking another look at whether what they've said is idiotic when others recognize the idiocy.<p>This strikes me as something of a parallel to when people sometimes claim that programming languages should be made ""safer"" at the expense of power provided for the programmer, and does not seem like a good direction to take the site.",1254065753

846907,comment,846699,846788,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> Consider the patents held by MPEG LA (MPEG codecs, Firewire, H.264, etc.) These patents represent years of R&D work by their member companies and describe inventions that are non-frivolous. Surely these companies deserve some kind of protection for their work to encourage them to continue to invest in such research and publish it.<p>There are two separate issues here, (1) whether patents are necessary to encourage innovation, and (2) whether companies ""deserve"" patents.<p>To answer the first question, the existance of non-patent-emcumbered codecs, such as Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora, demonstrates that software patents don't need to exist for these things to exist. (I sometimes half-jokingly refer to arguments of the sort ""but without copyright/patent incentives, X wouldn't exist"" as ""the Linux-doesn't-exist theory of intellectual property"").<p>To answer the second question, why would companies deserve patents? So they can make bigger profits, presumably? But why is that a good thing? The purpose of the economy isn't for companies to make profits, it's for the economy to make things people need and want. Companies making big profits is a good thing if and only if it leads to the economy making things people need and want -- so if people want to make money they have to make something people want, not game the patent system to no-one else's advantage. And since software patents aren't necessary to produce good software, and since they in fact overall harm progress in software rather than help it, in the interests of the economy they shouldn't exist.",1254064475
