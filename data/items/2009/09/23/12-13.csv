There will be a major f(x) that captures most of the movement of the graph, but the spikes and other weird happenings can be modelled by another function h(x), which however, does not describe the main trajectory of the initial function, because it's describing another effect.<p>For example f(x) could measure the success of a film based on the amount of marketing money spent on it. h(x) would describe the success based on the day that it was released. f(x) does not consider h(x), so there would be small bumps that are dependent on the day it was released. When h(x), which by itself would be a very poor predictor, seeing as it only factors in the day of the week.<p>But combined! They fix each other.",1253710640

With that as the dominant round in many areas it makes sense to use a compatible rifle.<p>- The AK variants with stamped receivers are very inexpensive to manufacture.<p>- The gas piston system is more reliable for rifles that are not cleaned regularly.<p>The M-16 and derivatives are common within the US's sphere of influence though.",1253709925
839126,comment,838673,838773,0,0,catzaa,,,"There is a flipside to this. In my country murders are the highest in the world even though we have extremely strict gun controls.<p>The problem is that criminals often do not follow the (gun control) laws. And it therefore gives them an advantage (since they are sure that their opponents do not have guns). What also happens is that policemen and soldiers rent their guns or sell their guns.<p>You should bear in mind that guns are used for less than 50% of murders. The percentages of illegal guns used for this are much lower.<p>What often happens is that criminals target old people in rural areas. They are often seen as soft targets since they cannot put up physical resistance and they are far from help (police, neighbours, etc…). Our neighbour was murdered with an axe and a panga. I cannot help but think that guns would equalise this situation.",1253709862

That said, I really prefer buying off private sellers, especially when they're the ones that bought the car new. They might be pulling one over on you, but it's easier to judge the history of the car when you meet the owner, see their garage/driveway.<p>If you just need a car to get you from point A to point B, there's no reason a 5-year-old Honda won't work for you. Especially if you're a two-car family.<p>Obviously, though, there are other considerations. If you drive 50,000 miles a year for work, a new car is probably smarter.

839120,comment,838646,838646,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Coincidentally, I happened to pick up an issue of ""Psychology Today"" while in line at the store tonight. Most of the magazine disappointingly turned out to be completely un-cited guesswork and bunkum, but it did have a headline article that applies exactly to this situation.<p>They claim that in human behavior, other people can be better judges of certain traits related to behavior -- like whether we come across as friendly, aloof, curt, etc. -- but the individual is more aware of things like <i>motivations</i> than anyone else can be. In any situation where an individual is unaware of their motivations, the best that anyone else can do is make wild guesses. The article called these ""dark areas"".<p>I can't say whether there's any actual support in research for the content of that article, but it does agree with most of the other pop-psychology garbage I've read, like ""Blink"".<p>Regardless, you and I have absolutely zero information about other people when it comes to guessing their motivations. We don't know their backgrounds, and we usually don't know them well enough to understand their personality. We certainly don't know an entire class of people well enough to tell them what their motivations are.<p>The best we can do is conclude that their stated motivations don't make sense given some other information about them.<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but using yours and pg's justifications for this, I could tell you right now that you're defending pg out of a hidden desire to win recognition from him, since he has influence and resources. (If I were an actual real-life psychologist, I would probably also trot out some lame garbage incorporating ""evolutionary psychology"", and would conclude that you're behaving this way because ancient peoples who behaved this way had some kind of evolutionary advantage in the imaginary environment I've invented for them.)<p>You would probably object to that, and then I would grin and say, ""Ah, but you don't understand your motivations as well as I do! If only you were more honest in your self-observation, you would see that I was right.""<p>So, yes, while I agree that in some cases the stated motivations don't make sense, I disagree that we can assume that we know what the actual motivations really are -- especially without a shred of supporting evidence.<p>Hell, why not assume that Arrington draws fire because he's the founder and figurehead for TechCrunch, and people dislike TechCrunch because it sometimes picks on their buddies' startups? That conclusion has exactly as much supporting evidence as the one that pg drew. (None.)<p>Wait, I know! People <i>actually</i> dislike Arrington because he said he would debut a really awesome tablet PC by now, and where is it? We're all disappointed, and <i>that's</i> why we hate him. That conclusion, too, has exactly as much supporting evidence as yours or pg's. (...None.)<p>I don't dislike Arrington individually, and I don't even have a very strong opinion of TechCrunch, so I can't explain any motivation for actual hatred on my part. But, I also shouldn't think that I can explain any actual hatred on anyone else's part.",1253709545

This really sounds like the duties of one dedicate individual with a background in business and/or marketing - not sure what your friend's backgrounds are.<p>I've been in this situation before and it comes down to a simple decision: do you want them around any more?<p>If so, sit them down and tell them they need to start pulling their weight. Maybe they lack direction and need you to provide that for them (which is worrisome, since one of these guys is supposed to be fulfilling the CEO role at this point).<p>If you want them gone, draft up some paperwork stating that they are bowing out, they want nothing to do with the company, and you don't owe them anything for ever and ever amen.<p>Just reading your situation here, it sounds as if the latter is your best option. You are basically doing all of the work yourself it seems and dragging 2 friends along with you. Add another hour to your schedule each night for a week and you could complete all of the work they've done the past 8 months or hire people freelance to take care of some of that for you.",1253707364

Some people find C easy to comprehend, and think naturally in terms of pointers. Not me.<p>Gnu Ed's source code is quite easy to read. Plan 9's utilities also have very clear, concise source code.",1253707262
