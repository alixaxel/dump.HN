The original ""simplicity"" of their service was entirely accidental; if I'm not mistaken Sergei either didn't know enough html or didn't care enough to bother making it any more complicated.<p>Religiously testing will only lead to a local maximum and ignores the possibility that the design may have not been great to begin with.<p>Google's homepage is not even remotely close to the standard a highly competent minimalist designer would offer. Little attention to detail, remedial typographical choices, a 90's looking poorly executed Logo, random UI elements with no clear purpose. It's very much like an engineers interpretation of what a minimalist designer would do.. which is exactly what it is.<p>All of their products are on the utilitarian end of minimalist design and could stand to be improved significantly from an aesthetic perspective without actually changing the interface noticeably.",1253210390

828514,comment,828142,828192,0,0,n8agrin,,,"NYT does a great job of pushing the limits in infovis, but they don't always hit the mark.  This vis seems to show an approximate fixed scale on the y-axis, which is good. It means the differences in heights between the blobs are relevant.  The fact that they layout multiple charts along the y-axis seems acceptable, in fact it allows for quick comparison between graphs.  However, the x-axis is unlabeled and unclear.  It seems to roughly represent time, but has no origin. One can sort of deduce approximate time but without a clear label I can't dive deeper into the information.  This seems to be the failing of many info visualizations I come across these days.  They either optimize for the ""quick glace"" or the ""in-depth analysis"" when you can get a happy medium by usually just tweaking one or two aspects of the display (in this case I would argue a labeled x-axis).",1253210134

828511,comment,826163,828011,0,0,andreyf,,,">> @When things are truly late-bound, it makes as little sense to split computational instructions into these ""language"" silos.<p>> I can't understand you. Can you rephrase?<p>Oops, think-o, that should have said ""it makes as little sense to split computational <i>abstractions</i> into these language silos"".<p>To clarify: there are ""languages"" like Haskell/Ruby/Python/Java/C that make an enormous number of decisions about the kinds of abstractions we use to describe <i>what it is a computer is to do</i>. A ""language"" is a set of decisions about syntax, type systems, functional or object-oriented abstractions, memory allocation and garbage collection, call stack traversal. If one decides to compile to a VM instead of machine code, that introduces another set of variables - from JIT compilation techniques to the kind of VM specifications you publish (do you publish a reference VM like Squeak, or a bunch of papers and tests like the JVM). ""The Java language"" is a set of hundreds of those kinds of decisions. So is ""the Python language"". Comparing the two is <i>really</i> difficult, because for almost <i>any</i> problem, some subset of Java's decisions will be better, while another subset of Python's decisions will be better. But these sets of decisions aren't atomic (they can be split!).<p>Every time you late-bind a decisions to the user, it removes a dimension from the decision space that the ""language"" lives in. It <i>expands</i> the <i>power</i> of the language to span that entire dimension. Hence, the most powerful language is one that makes the most irreversible decisions.<p><i>talking [...] in broad strokes undermines attention to good engineering and striving to be great engineers</i><p>That sounds right, and I should avoid it if it's needless. However, it's also important to always try to <i>unify concepts</i> to simplify our models of things. The important thing is to make sure the simpler model is just as accurate.",1253210112

I have heard it countless number of times.  Though at any given period of time you have to have predominant focus otherwise you will get lost in your choice and will never try either path.   The way I solve it, I just act upon the situation, circumstances and intuition coupled with my desires at particular moment of making a decision.   I wanted to get PHD in CS but ended up getting master because I was not sure what to concentrate in.   Well, now I am in the business world wondering what is next(I might still go for PHD but likely in different field than I though or have successful start up if not both) .   I have changed my directions several times but unless you try one you will never know if it is something for you or not.(and there is no negative outcome, you learn on the way plus get understanding if these is something you want or do not).  Just try what you believe is desirable and most optimal at this point, listen to your intuition and keep your eyes and mind open to opportunities when they are to come(you will know it).\nOther thing I noticed, is depending what direction you chose your priorities change so your choose are likely to change along the line.

""At any point in time"" is a key item there, as can change the two characteristics chosen as the DB goes through its various states or at different layers in the transaction.<p>OTOH, saying partition-tolerance is unimportant is only partially-true if your db is only going to run on a single lan.  This is often the case (i.e. basically saying that ""distributed"" is another word for ""cluster"") but if your db is going to run across a wan then sacrificing partition-tolerance can have unpleasant consequences.  I do a lot of work in Erlang and its built-in distributed db (like the language itself) was designed to run in a phone switch among SBCs and blades that shared a common backplane.  In this case a partition meant that something extremely bad was happening and graceful shutdown/failure in the face of a partition was a good choice.  Now that a lot of us are using these tools out in the wilds of the internet we are discovering that sacrificing partition-tolerance has some unpleasant side-effects too: running mnesia across EC2 instances, for example, is not a trivial undertaking because you need to deal with inevitable network problems by shutting down auto-rejoin features of the db and effectively turn off availability for a short period during the rejoin.",1253207539

GSM call quality tends to be poorer, but only because GSM uses less bandwidth per call. That's not really a problem with the codec, just a decision by the cell companies. Besides, all my calls these days are over 3G GSM, which uses much more bandwidth, and those calls sound great.<p>On top of that, since GSM uses time division (as apposed to time division, which keeps the radio on for the whole call), batteries last a lot longer on a GSM device. I remember when I first switched from a CDMA network to a GSM network. I was amazed that my phone would last the better part of a week when I was used to charging it every day. I could see this being tough on device makers. People really hate phones that can't hold a charge. But they hate large phones even more.<p>CDMA does seem to penetrate buildings a little better, in my experience.",1253206984

It seems very much something that Martha Kanter would propose - and rightfully so, as California's community colleges are especially feeling the budget crunches.<p>What's worse is the whole timing of the thing. The trend is generally that the less money there is available to the school district, the more students state-funded community colleges get, which in turn hikes up their operational costs. It's hard to get a more vicious cycle than that.",1253206944

So in general, we'll set up accounts for sites in that size, but don't do much support.<p>""Elephants"" tend to also require a lot of hand-holding -- not because they don't have good tech teams, but because they have specialized requirements.  They also typically have slow decision making processes, usually involving several meetings, conference calls, etc. and the really big sites, especially when dealing with a small startup, are usually more interested in buying your company than buying your product.",1253206801
