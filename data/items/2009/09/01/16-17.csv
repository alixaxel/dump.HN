Programming languages need to be designed for the very best programmers -- they are the ones that need the productivity boost.  For me, not understanding the language is never a problem.  Making something ""easier to understand"" will not help me write software that goes together faster or ends up more reliable.  It often has the opposite effect; Java's lack of ... everything, for the sake of simplicity, really slows me down.  Comparatively, learning a new concept is much easier.  If I start using a library that uses Arrows, I read the Arrow paper, spend a few days playing with it, and then I have one more tool that will help me be more productive every day for the rest of my life.  Making a language that doesn't have arrows saves me reading a paper about them, but it wastes my time every day for the rest of my life.<p>So, ""simple"" programming languages -- do not want.  I am not saying that you should start your ""intro to computer programming"" class with a long lecture about category theory, but I <i>am</i> saying that you should never hide things from people that want to know about them.",1251824288

For instance, suppose the frontal cortex of a precious 8-year-old looks more like that of a ten-year-old. They could have simply developed faster but will regress to the mean by the end of maturation (early twenties). Or they could continue to be more advanced for their age.<p>Conversely, I'm more interested by the kids who are ""delayed"" in their cortical development. Those are the kids that get shunted into remedial programs and stigmatized throughout their schooling. It's perhaps an undeserved regressive cycle rather than the progressive one in the case of gifted kids.<p>One thought I can't shake: Imagine a day where kids are sorted into classrooms, and subjects, based on the state of their brain development. Of course, there's a simplifying assumption in there that it's a passive process of cortical development. Still, we can do so much better than sorting kids based on age and IQ.",1251823868

I want to see the peer-reviewed publication that says so. This is the kind of mental test that Galton and James McKeen Cattell did a century ago, and those tests were found to have no valid correlation with intelligence.<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>This further paragraph in the submitted article provides better information:<p>""The team wanted to evaluate several intelligence tests, including their own. So they recruited 77 gifted children through the Parents’ Association for Gifted Children in Switzerland. A previous intelligence test, taken about a year-and-a-half previously, had won them entrance to gifted primary schools. So how many of the kids still classified as gifted just eighteen months later? Only half, no matter what test was used. (And that was using a relaxed cut-off line, to account for standard deviations in testing.)""<p>This is in accord with many findings by many researchers in many places over decades: preschool IQ tests have remarkably poor reliability for predicting subsequent school-age IQ scores. By the way, the Newsweek blogger's terminology is incorrect. Where Po Bronson wrote, ""to account for standard deviations in testing,"" he should have written, ""to account for standard error in estimation,"" which is a different concept. A ""standard error"" is something different from a ""standard deviation.""<p>The later paragraphs somewhat rescued this casual blog post, but I fear that most news reporting on IQ testing is at the level of excessive credulity found in the earlier paragraphs. It takes time and effort to read and understand the better published literature on IQ testing<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/iqbooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/iqbooks.html</a><p>and alas many journalists don't bother to make that effort.

I don't think the sales channel was 'murdered,' and frankly, telemarketing (and 'house ads,' for that matter) are not the only sales channels. Radio, television and outdoor advertising are all channels that newspapers, in my experience, are reticent to utilize, preferring their own in-house methods instead.<p>Also, the one major flaw in this argument is that the article states: ""As a result of the registry, newspapers have cut that figure down to 50 or 55 percent..."" from 60-65% Significant? Sure. Dead? If newspaper executives let a 10-15% drop in ONE method of obtaining subscribers kill their business, they probably shouldn't be a newspaper executive.",1251821034
