810237,comment,809686,809686,0,0,abalashov,,,"I wonder if smoking prevalence among ""hackers"" is higher than in general population (about 20% aggregate in the US) and over standard deviation over the mean.<p>Anecdotally and completely unscientifically, my experiences  suggest yes, first and foremost as a former smoker who tended to take notice of the distribution of professionals who also took smoke breaks in the half a dozen or so places I worked in three years.  Seems like the same sorts of tendencies that make nerds responsive to caffeine probably apply to stimulants in general, especially noting the long-held poetic association between creative, focus-based tasks and tobacco. I also know more than my fair share of ADD types (in a noticeably classical kind of way) who sincerely regard it as a form of viable self-medication.",1252382214

And then, you make yourself feel better by coming up with some explanation for why you were wrong: ...And so you keep on making predictions in the same way — which means you never get good at it.""<p>I think this also applies to many macro-economists",1252381915

That's a good article and sums up some of the major debates around latin american microfinance.<p>The problem with for-profit microfinance is that, as a general rule, financial performance increases with loan size, and that's why commercialization is a cause for concern, along with a lot of the other baggage that comes with commercialization like pressure to increase profits and employee incentive programs that negatively impact service toward small clients.<p>Compartamos accounts for the problems of the small loan market (notably the inability to determine which borrows are good or not) the same way moneylenders needed to before them, by charging very high interest rates. But this ends up screening out lower end borrowers, hence the discussion of ""mission drift.""<p>Commercial banks have long dabbled in elements of microfinance, but there are fairly concrete obstacles, mostly operational and information-related issues, that make it tough to be profitable, and even tougher to approach it as strictly for-profit while continuing to be actual microfinance.",1252381001

Under the aforementioned cirucmstances, it transfers ownership once it the bona fide customer buys it from someone, not once the bona fide customer tries to connect it.  They could purchase it on eBay before the owner goes from thinking it is misplaced in their house to thinking it is stolen, and it becomes theirs as soon they pay, and then the victim blacklists a device that they no longer own while its still in transit.
