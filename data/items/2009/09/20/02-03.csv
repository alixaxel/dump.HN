When I query about what percent of founders this applies to, I hear numbers like 10% or 20%.  What numbers are you hearing?<p>Unfortunately your challenge is flawed of finding investors that have experienced health care as more of a problems than immigration.  The health care argument is that people won't consider quitting their day job because of this problem so they never reach the point of showing up on an investor's radar.  I know far more well qualified U.S. citizens that would love to start their own business than there is money to fund them.  Health care is generally the number one reason cited for them not leaving BigCo.<p>The founder's visa argument is there are not enough founders to invest in in the U.S.  Some people, myself included, are simply trying to point out that not only may there be far more than immigration reform could provide, but that legislation is currently in progress that might alleviate a big part of the reason they are not ""on the market"".<p>I am commonly ""self-employed"", at least from the perspective of Health Care insurers.  I have insurance, but mostly to appease my wife.  Do you know the stats on cancellation for an ""individual"" policy if you actually do get a serious illness?  Its well over 50%.  I know my insurance is most probably useless, as I said, I pay for it to appease my better half who is more risk averse. Most founder-wanna-bes do not have enough money socked away to spend as I do.<p>I agree that immigration process is insane and unfair to the immigrant.  One big problem I have with this proposal is it is highly self-serving to investor desires and doesn't put leverage on the more important issue of simply treating all legal skilled immigrants more appropriately.",1253415485
832643,comment,832383,832630,0,0,ilkhd2,,,"Of course it is true. And of course it does not make common sense - common sense usually made by brain/mind.\nIf you cannot mirror properties of target machine - you cannot optimize code for that target - period. Any computatiuon made in compiler will be potentially different from the same, nonoptimized computation made in target. The more computations have been optimized in the compiler the bigger probabilty you'll get wildly different code.<p>However, if you do not have the target datatype you dealing with during compilation, you are destined to simulate them.<p>Example: ((unsigned char) 2) + ((unsigned char)255) = 1<p>That is in C. In ruby you'll have to manually check for overflow, and do it for each operation. You can invent classes all kind of things, but why? Use a language with types, and the check will be done for you by you Core Duo.",1253415410
832642,comment,832475,832621,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't know which statement you mean, and it's a bit unnerving to be defending HN's gold medalist of curmudgeonry twice in one day, but I was going to comment on this anyway:<p><i>90 percent of programming is more ""typing"" than programming because the work is straightforward.</i><p>This may be exaggerated, but it has more than a grain of truth. If you take it to mean 90% of programming <i>as actually practiced</i>, as opposed to 90% intrinsically, it's not even that much of an exaggeration.<p>Working on harder problems in higher-level languages than I used to, I felt <i>less</i> productive for a very long time. In some ways I still do. I eventually figured out that this was because I was spending much more time thinking and much less time typing. Typing feels like good-old-fashioned-work in a way that thinking doesn't. That's why people feel satisfied after cranking out thousands of lines of code, when in reality they may well have made an unmaintainable mess (and thus destroyed value rather than created it).",1253415398
832641,comment,831958,832611,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Interesting that it's been dropping since the 50s.  The article posted a few days ago arguing that innovation since 1959 has been much less significant to peoples lives than the innovation from 1909 to 1959 comes to mind.  Ending many infectious diseases, an affordable, stable food supply, wide spread home ownership, telecommunications and automobiles seem unambiguously positive, or at least would have in 1959.<p>But when you start getting traffic jams and long commutes, high fructose corn syrup as the main ingredient in the food on supermarket shelves, the constant temptation to stare at one screen or another rather than interact with the world around you, the interruptions enabled by ubiquitous communications, the lack of exercise due to going from bed to car to cubicle to car to couch to bed again, the benefits from advances in technology seem more ambiguous.<p>I know this makes me sound like a Luddite, but I just think those of us who like technology and gadgets for their own sake should step back once and a while and consider whether more technology is always better or if there are also potential downsides.",1253415220

Type inference helps, but being able to use an Sexp-style representation a-la lisp is a huge, huge benefit in compilation.  You cannot do this in any of the ML family.<p>Pattern matching is a great feature, and it's available in all of the languages I mentioned.  It's a built-in in Boo, there are many libraries for it in Scheme, and I have my own Sexp pattern matching libraries for Python and Ruby.  It may have come from the ML world, but it's by no means exclusive to it.<p>As for proving correctness, depending on the language to provide this is simply not realistic in compilers.  You've got a much better shot at correctness by making your compiler easier to work on, IMO.",1253414037

832623,comment,832383,832596,0,0,ilkhd2,,,"1. No not any. Many cross-compilers do not if the binary formats and pecularities of arithmetic operations maps well between host system and target system - why waste time? Example = x86 and x64, two different platforms, with same binary representation. About performance - not sure if it is negligible - optimisation takes a lot of time in moder compilers.\n3. You have not seen ml code I am sure. ML has type inference, you are not bothered about types too much. And it has pattern matching, very good when traversing trees.\nNeither scheme nor pyruby has this. \nML also a language with completely formalized semantics, in combination with strong type it allows you to prove that you compiler is correct by means of formal provers.",1253413625

They're also similar to the naive approaches for tree like persistent data structures.<p>Generally these fall into two approaches: fat nodes and path copying. With fat nodes, each node maintains it's own independent history of update operations.

With path copying however updates are more expensive and we tend to have more duplicate data (depending on the fan out of nodes).<p>Interestingly, we can do better than both of these approaches.
