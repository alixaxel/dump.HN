Part of that cost is that for smart people it can be more lucrative to trade something than to make something.",1253450720

833020,comment,832933,833010,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As I recall it, the 128k model of Spectrum didn't launch until the 8-bit era was coming to a close and 16 bit boxes had been out for a few years.  The first-gen Spectrum was horrid (1k, worse than chiclet keyboard), though the second gen was acceptable (but not comparable to either of the 64 k machines in question).  One could buy a C128D or an Apple IIc by the time the 128k Speccy existed, and those machines were at least comparable, and the Amige and Apple IIgs (or Macintosh) would blow the Speccy away.<p>Not saying Spectrums weren't awesome (I don't really know; the only one I ever owned was that 1k first-gen model with a 16k expansion; it was miserable), just that you kinda have to compare Apples to...umm...not Apples.<p>And, of course, the C64 is the bestselling personal computer of all time.<p>(I should admit that you're arguing with an 11 year old SwellJoe here...I <i>loved</i> my C64.  And, crazy as it sounds, I also bought some C64s on eBay over the past few months for use in composing chiptunes.  Thus, evidence indicates I might be mentally unstable with regard to the C64.  Backing away slowly might be the best option.)",1253450303

833018,comment,829502,829502,0,0,Mz,,,"RE All the talk of loaning/giving money to family/friends should one suddenly find themselves rich:<p>I have a long history of being a bleeding heart. I also come from an environment where ""throwing money at the problem"" is kind of the default mental model.  So I've spent lots of time fantasizing about how I would improve the world/help people around me should I suddenly have money.  Over the years, I have concluded that financial problems grow out of real problems, so in most cases just throwing money at the problem actually hurts a person's ability to solve the underlying real problem.   If someone is convinced that ""The Problem"" is how much money they owe and you pay off their debts, it lets them off the hook for wondering if there is something about their lives they should change. (And in many cases, those debts will quickly pile up again because the cause of the debts was not resolved. My recollection is that about 2/3s of people who win the lottery are bankrupt 5 years later.)<p>For intractable personal problems, the odds are very good that the person with this intractable problem is very resistant to change and/or the problem itself is inherently difficult to overcome.  In both cases, an easy way out of a portion of the consequences tends to undermine any hope they will buckle down and do the hard task of making the necessary changes.  Also, paying off someone's debts inherently contains a judgement about how the money should be used.  I have concluded that it would be better to just give someone money, no strings attached, no questions ask, no expectations, as a gift.  And then not roll one's eyes and such when it isn't used the way one thought it ought to be. I have also concluded that if I want to help people address some serious personal problem, throwing money at the problem is not the way to do it.  Some day, I might figure out how making money available could grease the wheels of progress towards a solution without causing all kinds of unintended negative side effects.  Should I ever work that out in my mind, I might well found a charity.  In the mean, I will share info and try to mind my own business.",1253450153

833012,comment,833002,833002,0,0,patio11,,,"This is perhaps less impressive than you would think.  Watch some mathematical slight of hand: suppose for the sake of argument that 1% of Facebook has Dark Secret X and you have a DSXdar program which is 99% accurate.<p>Your program will, out of a sample of 100,000 Facebookers, identify 1,980 people as being DSX.  Half of them (99% of 1,000 = 990) have DSX.  Half of them (1% of 99,000 = 990) are not actually DSX.<p>The math is much more favorable for oracle programs which look for traits which are evenly split in the population.  This is one reason why ""An AI which reads your work and guesses your gender"" works so amazingly well as a tech demo.  (That program exists, incidentally, and is better than 80% accurate.)  However, even supposing there were sufficient cues in a person's writing to tell whether they were e.g. left handed or not in the same fashion, a similar Oracle Of Lefties would be almost useless because you'd get too many misclassified righties in with your identified lefties.<p>On a related note, this is why a) you are not particularly recommended to get an HIV test if you're not at risk for AIDS and b) the first thing that will happen after an HIV+ result is scheduling another test.<p>On a totally different note, much of the worries of privacy experts with regards to Gaydar and similar programs <i>don't require the AI to be functional</i> to come to pass.  ""My sophisticated computer analysis says you're 83% likely to be a child molester.""  If you're already under suspicion, folks will not ordinarily say ""Wait a second, lets see the study showing that this, in fact, actually works.""  They'll simply take the ""expert""'s word at face value.<p>(See, for example, computer models of global warming.  The big black box will spit out any answer you want from it -- want the answer that global warming is no problem at all?  Turn off the ""Assume that water vapor evaporation causes a vicious warming cycle"" and, bam, you can crank your smokestack slider to the max and not have any problems.  Yet folks don't routinely consider that prior to saying that ""Global warming is a fact -- the UN reported that the scientists proved it."")",1253449689

Better games, better high res graphics modes, dramatically better sound, and more software (because it was cheap, it sold more units, bigger market share, more third party applications).<p>Bonus reason: The case was a third the size of the Apple IIe, making it much easier to haul over to friends houses.",1253449201
