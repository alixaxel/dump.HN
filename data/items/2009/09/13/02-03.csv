819758,comment,819016,819516,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"That's very true, but I believe sales would have been <i>much</i> better this year if last years games weren't still priced the same as the new games of this year.<p>I have a serious problem when buying games, because I worked as a reviewer so I'm used to recommending 'buy this one now, buy this one later, and just don't even think about it' and I happen to agree. There hasn't been a single game that I <i>had</i> to buy this year. EVE Online has been winning my interest with the new expansion, and I usually detest MMO's. The games always held my attention, but I've never been able to justify the monthly payments, yet the lack of decent games this year and the fact that their expansions add a lot to the game without costing you more (I'd never play WoW because they charge you multiple times, for buying the original game, the expansions and monthly, and it never felt fun to play).<p>I've heard no mention of MMO sales, but I've admittedly not paid attention to that sector. So I would be interested to see if there has been a boom or bust. Have people been cancelling subscriptions or have people switched from buying a new game every month at $70 to a low monthly fee? I may have to look it up",1252810358

When I explain programming to someone who doesn't know what it is, I liken it to instructing someone to do something they don't know how to do, e.g., make a sandwich. You have to tell them to walk to the fridge, gather the ingredients, place them down, work with them one at a time, etc. If programmers spend all day thinking like this, I wonder if that doesn't do something to their world view. I know that I personally find a lot of everyday activities very tedious, but maybe that's because they really are.",1252809370
