It's a roundtable discussion of issues facing company founders in whatever stage they find themselves.  I'm building a product on the side but the other two participants have established companies in two different areas - casual game development and developer tools.<p>This is the ""pilot"" episode and is presented without editing.  Think of it as the alpha release.

Thus you try to subdue it by voting it down and telling me not to submit stuff like that. You are really very generous.<p>""Ignoring my comment on the healthcare post (which I only did because you submitted a bunch of them in a reasonably short space of time and the HN gimmick was too good to pass up)""<p>Are you some kind of weird stalker or something voting everything down of mine or on a particular topic? Get a life then. Btw. I wouldn't need to resubmit stuff when people wouldn't block it from being seen. People who like to decide what others are allowed to see should work as censors for China but stop policing democratic communities.<p>""the vast majority of submissions and votes, is very tech startup oriented""<p>Yes, indeed it is, which sometimes gets a little boring. HN is not strictly a niche topical community it deals with everything hackers might interest so please let the hackers themselves decide, here 6 of them did. I don't see a problem with the occasional non-Ruby, TechCrunch or startup article.<p>""You are free to disagree""<p>Thank you again for this generosity but it's not something you allow me to do, I have the same right to voice my opinion here as you do.<p>P.S.: Ever since I'm on the Web (1997) people like you always shouted ""off topic"".

Instead you get a huge debt from your record company, which you spend years working your arse off to repay. When you manage to get a contract, all those pretty videos and posters advertising your album have to be paid for and as the artist, you have to pay for them. I've only just finished paying off all the money I owe my record company. I'm lucky that I've been successful and managed to pay it back, but not everyone's so lucky.""</i><p>Isn't that the whole problem? That the (rapidly disintegrating) status quo is more about financing, marketing and controlled distribution than it is about music? Technology has made most of this redundant. High quality recording equipment is within anyone's grasp. Marketing and distribution cost nothing but savvy and persistence. The piracy phenomenon hasn't arisen through tight-fisted teens not wanting to pay for goods. It has arisen because the middleman, despite realizing himself redundant, is refusing to let go of the goose.",1253795819

Essentially you fast after drinking a sugary drinks, and they test your blood at intervals to see what it does. A Reactive Hypoglycemic will spike, then crash, unlike a normal person who will have a smaller rise then pretty much stay there. See, she normally has to eat ridiculously healthy food every 2 hours to stay even, otherwise she crashes.<p>It starts with cold sweats, then degenerates into nausea, confusion and a rotten mood. It never gets that bad with her anymore, we have a good system going now.
