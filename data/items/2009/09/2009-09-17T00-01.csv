The stuff is like 1960's !<p>There are basically two main camps, Lisp-1 and Lisp-2 and consequently two divergent major families, Scheme and Common Lisp.  From my recollection, the ""Lisp Wars"" started with hardware implementations, Symbolics vs. Lisp Machines, et al., see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics</a>.<p>My take is that the hardware implementations came at a time when CPU speeds and memory capacities where not up to the demands of integrated Lisp environments.  By the time speed and memory were sufficient to host Lisp, the world of IT got preoccupied with x86 architecture and Windows.  Neither of these being suitable (in 1980's) as a production Lisp hosting environment.<p>In the hands of an expert Lisper, any version of Lisp quickly becomes extremely productive.  The issues of libraries (FFI) and compilation are addressed in different ways, it's like you have a choice!  It's like asking a guitarist why there are so many brands of guitars? Why don't they all use ____ (insert your pref. brand).<p>To research further, I suggest looking-up ""John McCarthy"", ""Guy Steele"", ""Richard Gabriel"", ""Symbolics"", ""Lisp Machine"" on Wikipedia and Google.",1253148895

Create a new directory, type 'git init', and you're good to go. This compared to Subversion's insistence to setup a repo directory elsewhere and then checking that out. I save about 3 minutes (including time to ssh to a remote server to create the repository), but those 3 minutes feel very painful so I didn't create repositories until I've written a fair amount of code. Now I create a repository almost from the start.<p>Branching and merging is very useful even for single developers. It's not the number of developers, it's the size of the project. For larger projects I'll want to branch often to experiment with things. I can delete the branch after I'm done with the experiment.<p>As for Windows support: I've heard that Msys-Git is in a very good shape today. I haven't used it myself though.",1253148430

You can't run things at parse time in Ruby (without exotic extensions); that's the whole point of macros.<p>I completely agree that there are a large number of uses for macros that ""SmallTalk style"" syntax completely replace. It turns out that a lot of things don't really require you to run code at parse time.
