The way I read the article the laser pulse has a short range, ionising the water in the vicinity of the buoy, which creates sound waves which emanate out to wherever the sub is.  The laser isn't bouncing back and forth from sub to buoy.<p>As the communication is via sound and not laser it also means that anyone else in the vicinity could intercept the message.  Strong encryption and authentication would still be required.",1252929268

We're going to be getting into some heavy document processing, and need a reasonably scalable and efficient way to go about it. In practice, this means scripting together different command-line programs (graphics-magick, pdftk, tesseract) across a large number of servers, and gluing it all together with Ruby. CloudCrowd is our first take on a pleasant parallel processing experience -- as an ""action"", you write a Ruby class that responds to '<i>process</i>', for the portion of the computation that can be parallelized, and optionally '<i>split</i>' and '<i>merge</i>'. The central server and job queue, the worker daemons, the web interface for monitoring, and the automatic retry of failed work units is all handled for you.<p>In the Wiki (linked above), there's a pretty comprehensive explanation of the architecture -- I'd love to hear suggestions, or ideas that can be pilfered from Hadoop or even Grand Central Dispatch to improve it.",1252928759

I'm not a designer, but I hope some points might help.<p>* Make the front page simpler in content, richer in design/graphics:<p>In the front page, I'd put WHAT exactly is tarsnap (few words, like ""Tarsnap is an online backup service for UNIX operating systems with emphasis on security"" and avoid the  ""probably will compile"" stuff, and WHY should someone use it instead of other products/solutions, in a few words. Drop the ""start now"" box and make a nice button instead that says ""Start now with $5"" or something simple like that.<p>Make a simple logo in GIMP, there are hundreds of tutorials for this.<p>Avoid listing the pricing in the front page, but make sure it is accessible from a nice viewable button. Use normal units, not ""picodollars"".<p>* Use a sans font. Serifs are nice, but seem ""oldish"" and are not the best fonts to describe a new product.<p>* I'd use blue and shades of grey as the dominant colors. Grey speaks ""solid"". I'd use other colors such as yellow,red etc. to achieve contrast to the buttons that might interest the visitor (pricing,documentation,legal etc)",1252927620

From the other posts on that blog I get that he's trying to be funny, but this one follows TechCrunch's ""trolling and creating drama for massive pageviews"" style guide so slavishly that any humor intended just falls flat imo.<p>It's ridiculous how every time new software is released we must turn its position vis-a-vis existing similar software  into some kind of soap opera.<p>Hey I know how we can make this even more dramatic.  Async aside, Tornado is also a web framework.  How about we get the developers of Django, CherryPy, TurboGears, etc to all castigate Friendfeed devs for not choosing their framework and adding easy async support?<p>Just because some software has overlap with others doesn't mean we all have to automatically pick sides.  I love Twisted. I look forward to building something with Tornado. I am eager to see dlsspy's efforts at interop between them come to fruition.<p>At the end of the day, there is new, well-documented free software available for Python.

821463,comment,821379,821379,0,0,axod,,,"The controversy surrounding this is just really funny.<p>I wrote my own comet webserver in Java to run Mibbit (Hopefully I'll open source it one day soon - maybe when facebook acquire me lol). It's pretty awesome IMHO, and happily handles thousands of concurrent users in a single thread, doing thousands of http requests a second, on a medium size VPS server.<p>Writing your own stuff makes perfect sense. Here's why I personally did it<p>* Comet is very important to a realtime app. I wanted to make sure I had the best server in the world for that.<p>* I wanted to learn the complete low level details so I could be sure that the protocol,systems,etc were best possible, and just so I know exactly what's going on under the hood. (Knowing the whole code base inside out means I can really heavily optimize)<p>* One of the worst situation you can ever be in IMHO, is trying to find a bug, which ends up being in some badly written 3rd party lib. If it's in your own code, it's far easier to find+fix.<p>* It's not that hard. It's just webserver networking etc code.<p>Yes there were other comet servers out there, but they all seemed pretty 'general purpose', overly complex, etc for what I wanted.<p>I think the take-away from the Tornado release isn't ""Wow! There's a new web framework here you should use it!"". It should be ""If it makes sense to reinvent the wheel, you should totally reinvent the wheel.""<p>The amount you learn in the process is invaluable in itself.",1252927367

821460,comment,819865,820200,0,0,alexandros,,,"transactions are unnecessary, unless you are looking for 100% consistency between cache and database at all times. Usually this is not the case and if it is, you will have extremely serious problems scaling. All i'm saying is: If you have an update that you know will invalidate some cached pages, why invalidate them and then rerender them from the database once the update is commited instead of updating them directly. and lazy queueing the update, taking the load of the database (less pressure to commit instantly, and less reads). In the facebook inbox example, you know that a new message to the user will increase their message count by one. Just update the cache directly with this new info. When/if it explodes, by all means, rerender everything.",1252927096

The docs are easy to follow, and they do a great job of walking through the things you need to be thinking about. I like learning a framework by following exercises and gradually memorising how to set up a basic app typing into an empty console with no notes. I'm there with tornado already. The abstractions are nice.<p>Twisted is already cool, and I look forward to the polished version of the Tornado-on-Twisted making it into the repository.

There was an something on the BBC News website a while back with two sides of a similar argument, only one side was written in a style that was supposed to be easier to read; it certainly wasn't for me as it was written with a more southern (southern English that is) accent and I had to re-read certain words several times to work out what they were supposed to be.<p>I know this part was only covered briefly, but English did used to have two different letters for the ""th"" sounds - ð (like the) and þ (like thin), I suppose they were dropped for simplicity of the written alphabet in the end.",1252926510

The hardest vocabulary to memorise are the small words.  The longer words are less common, and often share a root with the English (this is less true for Japanese, Thai, <i>etc</i>)  Small words turn up more frequently in prose, so when reading a novel you get drilled on them more often.<p>Studying a technical work in a foreign language is something I've not tried - it's an interesting idea - but I personally would have trouble dealing with both issues at once - the language and the material.<p>Will you blog to let us know your progress?",1252926464
