Pick a couple (2) of the most interesting-looking attempts and showcase them. Leave everything else out.<p>Obviously, subcontracting, consulting, temp, and meaningful volunteer and open-source work should get written up. If you worked for name-brand clients who you're allowed to mention, and you were there for more than a couple months, list them as if they were jobs, with a subhed like ""on behalf of XYZ Consulting, Inc."".<p>If you did most of your self-employed work under a single umbrella company name (and, everyone else, here's a good reason why you should), list that company for the largest possible time span. Freelance work counts! Having helped run a consultancy for 4 years now, I'd look <i>more</i> favorably on someone who managed to keep a freelance practice running for 7 years.",1254103124

I am not ""experienced"" in that I haven't yet achieved my millions, but experience has told me ""forcing""  myself to continue hacking away when I'm clearly experiencing physical fatigue only leads to more lost productivity down the road.<p>For example, forcing myself to continue working at my computer when I don't feel like it will lead to eye strain, back pain and anxiety. I will often wake up with a headache after such marathons. I refer to this as burnout. Burnout is very real.<p>In my early years of programming I could work non-stop because I was doing something new almost every day. And for someone that likes new experiences, it was exciting. But after years of experience, programming in-and-of itself feels more and more like labour.<p>Don't get me wrong. I still love programming, in general. I've just become more focused on the end-results of programming--of what it makes possible, what it does for people.

I have absolutely no problems with people who choose to devote their energies outside of their schoolwork.  My gripe is with kids who don't do that well in school but then <i>vocally</i> brag about how smart they are <i>in particular school topics</i>.  A contrived example would be some kid in your high school class who is a solid B student but is always bragging about how he knows the material inside-out.  I think that if you want to brag about how good you are in class, then you should probably have the grades to back it up, since by definition, grades are the metric by which people judge you in a particular class.  I'm in no way saying that kids who don't do well in class aren't smart ... I definitely know people who didn't get great grades but are amazing hackers.",1254100158
