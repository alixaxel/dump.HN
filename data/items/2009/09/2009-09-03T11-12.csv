I checked the HN guidelines again and didn't see any such rule. That mix-up was the reason for my ""and DON'T post it to HN"" line.

I assumed that they would pose the problem in a such a way that the naive approach would be too slow.<p>C) yeah that was the shortest - my first ""naive"" algorithm was not fast enough, though. I have now thought of a better one and can't wait to try it out, but it is too late for the competition. Still, that alone was worth participating to me - it is a kind of ""revelation feeling"". I love it when by improving an algorithm a problem becomes solvable.<p>B) Was actually the easiest for me - the naive algorithm worked well enough. Took me a while to get the program bug free, though...",1251978902

Fines are a punishment, damages are to correct damage done to the ""victim"".

Freedom's price is not the opportunity cost associated with it. He mentions it in passing but brushes it off as something to make light of.

It's not a bad idea to keep some of your home directory under VC, especially config / preference files and any writing. (This is more useful on Unix, which typically uses text files for nearly everything.) They're also useful for backup.<p>2. Git and Mercurial (AKA ""hg"") are both really good, and <i>probably</i> simpler to use than svn. (I suspect the people who say svn are simpler probably learned it first, and then had to learn all the ways that git/hg's designs differ - but those differences make them simpler to set up.) They havea few different features, but have probably 90%+ in common, and you're not going to really know which one would be a better fit for you until you pick one and learn the basics.

802208,comment,801659,801999,0,0,stephenfleming,,,"I remain amused by the casual bigotry exhibited by so many Silicon Valley denizens that OF COURSE all the smart, motivated, ambitious entrepreneurs will move to the Valley.  Most of them would be incensed if a colleague displayed a comparable level of bigotry about race, or sex, or national background, or the rest of the litany.  But it's socially acceptable -- at least west of I-5 -- to dismiss 99% of the country as full of failures.  ""Sure, maybe they did great in AAA ball, but they couldn't make it in the Big Show.""<p>Which has led to the Valley being a hothouse of artificially-compressed geniuses building products for each other instead of for the real world.<p>But not everyone is a brilliant 23-year-old willing to share a flophouse with three other geniuses while coding 20 hours a day.  In the real world, people have spouses... kids... mortgages... elderly parents... heck, maybe they just like sweet tea!  There are all sorts of reasons that they won't move to the Valley, even if they have plenty of talent to compete at that level.<p>I submit that looking for the best of the best among that 99% of the country is a heck of a good way to make money.  It's harder, because you can't sit on Sand Hill Road and watch the universe rotate around you.  But with some hustle and some brains, there's plenty of opportunity for non-Valley entrepreneurs, and non-Valley investors, to do very very well.<p>I'm not going to try to embed a picture here on HN, but check out the link and let me know if you want a button!
