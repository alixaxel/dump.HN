You can just reread the post you just replied to.  I did not say that.  I have not edited that post.<p>The closest I came was that it was reasonable to believe that global temperature fell after 1998, and suggested that since I know of no source of data which isn't disputed by one side or the other, it's pointless for me to track down data to support a claim I haven't made.<p><i>If you are going to stand by the statement ""global temperature is falling"" I would again ask for a citation.</i><p>I have no plans to stand by someone else's statement.  Thanks, anyway.<p>I <i>did</i> support my actual claim that it was reasonable for a third party to believe that global temperature is falling, by pointing out that google's first page of results provides many examples of vociferous arguing <i>both ways</i>.  I really have no idea what global temperature is doing, apart from the obvious fact that it's not increasing or decreasing so quickly as to be unmistakable, since lots of mistaking is going on, one way or the other.<p><i>""JFGI"" is not a citation.</i><p>On the assumption that you're unable or unwilling to copy/paste or type ""global temperature since 1998"" into Google yourself to see this first page of results, here's a handy link <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=global+temperature+since+1998"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=global+temperature+since+1998</a> .

I cringe every time I come across Perl code because I've never actually come across any real Perl that's written that way.

Though that's a semantic argument and not really important because my main point in the above comments was that this is not a now or never issue. Inaction today isn't a commitment of any kind, because the same options will be available tomorrow.<p><i>Do you mean that we should (oof, I hate to bring ""should"" into this) sometimes maintain the status quo even if doing so doesn't have the highest expected outcome for us?</i><p>No, certainly not. I mean that we should maintain the status quo until we can reasonably estimate those expected outcomes and their costs/benefits (ask questions first, shoot later). This article is arguing that we don't yet have those reasonable estimates.<p>I think the ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach <i>is</i> and expected value approach. Public loss of faith in the system is a huge cost (probably much bigger than letting the average criminal go free). So I think there's an implicit cost/benefit analysis there.<p>There are also costs associated with (at least some of) the proposed global warming solutions. I'm thinking specifically of cap and trade, a system with far reaching economic consequences we can't fully understand until it's actually implemented. So before we implement it, we'd better know with some degree of certainty that the current situation is bad enough to warrant a potentially dangerous economic experiment. On the other hand, I think investment in alternative energy is a relatively low cost decision (sort of a ""what the hell, it can't hurt"").",1253925599

So either you've gotten extremely unlucky or there's something nonobvious causing your problem.<p>Do you lose CFLs at the same rate in other sockets? I'm not an expert, but my first guess would be that you have dirty power messing with the electronic ballast; that wouldn't affect an incandecsent bulb appreciably, I expect.",1253923476

People _don't_ buy iPhones to play particular games.<p>This is the opposite case for consoles, where it's not uncommon for someone to buy a console to play a particular series — say, buying an xbox to play gears of war.<p>At the end of the day, the iPhone lacks the lengthy and complicated games that a lot of people crave. This isn't to say more casual games stop them from competing, but they can't hope to use them to replace the current games market with cheap, casual games alone.<p>Personally, I think it'd be nuts for any game developer to spend the same amount of time on an iPhone game as they would on a DS game. For two reasons; Apple's mercurial approval process and an app store full of companies chasing each other to the bottom — too many cheap-arse games basically.",1253923369
