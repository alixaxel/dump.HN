I've heard the term ""Global Weirding"" thrown around before. The term is a better descriptor because what we humans actually experience isn't hotter weather, but highly unusual climate occurrences: storms, record temperature fluctuations, etc.",1253930121

If we all can conceive tests that remove all defects from past, now and future, then we all live perfect lives. But that is impossible, though we can try to minimize the impact. The problem is probably is undecidable in computational complexity sense.<p>And to some point, we need people, maybe our beloved one, maybe ourselves to be sacrificed in order for scientists and engineers in the next generation to figure out and put them into their test cases to avoid repetition of tragedies.<p>I think you misunderstand gifted engineers. Gifted engineers understand what they shipped are imperfect, but they have guts to ship them and see how they work. The failure will be lessons for next generation to learn. I feel more scared of people who think their tests have removed all known defects while they forget about unknown defects.

My experience mirrored theirs. Essentially, we wanted to offer annual billing, but when we went to our processor with that, they weren't willing to assume the risk associated with that. My understanding might be off, but I believe the rationale is that they're essentially guaranteeing that we'd be able to offer refunds to customers who didn't get what they paid for. So if someone pays $30 for a year's coverage of our software, and we go out of business three months into that, they're going to want their money (or, at least, part of it) back. But if we've gone bankrupt, the credit card processor is partly on the hook for that money.<p>The CC processor we use (www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com) {and I'm very happy with them} allowed us to apply for annual billing after we had many months (7? 8?) of billing under our belts, and they could see that we weren't super risky.<p>So, yeah.
