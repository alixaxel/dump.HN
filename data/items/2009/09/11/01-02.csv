I am much closer to your world than you suspect and yes, $3000 is a horrendous amount of money for an individual at the bottom of the film food chain to lose to an avoidable expense. I absolutely appreciate the financial pain involved for a niche product which will struggle to break even. Believe me, if I was earning enough to just shrug about such a sum I would write you a check to help.<p>When I compare that dollar amount to a line-item expense for digibeta tapes, the particular example I was thinking was for a sub-$50k DVD-bargain-bin film, which basically didn't (and won't) make a penny for most of the people involved...but the release of which by [Well Known Company] has been enough to get the maker into a project with a proper budget: in other words, it looks as if someone else will pick up the tab for the next one, and he'll earn a respectable paycheck at least, which is a step forward in my book.<p>What I'm trying to say comes down to two issues: first, would you rather bank half the proceeds from selling 5000 copies or bank 10% of the proceeds from selling 50,000? and second, will your approach help you sell more or fewer copies - that is, are you fighting a useful battle?<p>Let's say that between the licensing and other factors it would cost $4000 to be able to sell GET LAMP on Blu-ray. OK, that's the suck. But at $45, which is what you sell the BBS film for, that would start to be profitable after 100 extra copies. So when the question is 'Could you sell more than 100 extra copies by putting it onto a single BR disc'? If the answer is yes, which I think it might be, then there would be benefits in doing so.<p>As I said, I am completely with you about the (lack of) ethics of this licensing scheme and the resulting financial headache it creates as you try to please both your potential customers and your bank manger. But I feel that merely shaking your fist at it may not be the best strategy.<p>If this were a game, and in a maze of twisty passages, all alike you met a gnome who was offering you a magic key but demanding an excessive amount of your gold, possibly even more than you have... would you assume it was a red herring and just forget about it, or at least entertain the possibility that paying off the gnome would turn out to be worth it later?<p>I'd very much like to continue this conversation by email and/or telephone.

If people always operate under this assumption they will be fine (yes I realize in certain cases information may not be cached before it is removed.)<p>You shouldn't enter any information on a social networking site that you don't want everyone to see, no matter what the privacy settings tell you.  Personally I am wary of sending sensitive information of any kind to a remote machine (of course I do it anyway <i>ahem</i> Gmail, <i>ahem</i> Amazon, <i>ahem</i> etc.)  But to expect that you will be able to enter information on a social network and only have a subset of that site's users have access to it is much too high an expectation.  No offense to Facebook but it is a difficult enough task to implement an efficient technical solution to this problem.  But that is before you take into account the difficulty of explaining complex (or even simple) privacy controls to your users.<p>This is a really great demonstration of the privacy illusion but the illusion should not even exist. We should all lower our expectation of privacy on Facebook.  Again, no offense to Facebook, but they can't meet the unreasonable standard set by some.<p>[Addendum]<p>* Facebook is not a private site.  The term ""privacy controls"" is really misleading and should really be called something else that helps people understand how short they can fall of giving you true privacy.<p>* It is called a social network but our virtual societies have different rules than the real world.  One notable issue is the Whiteboard Problem (yes I gave it a stupid name): The Facebook stream is like a whiteboard that you have given your friends access to but you can write comments on your whiteboard and they can write on yours.  So whoever can see their whiteboard, whether they know you, can see what you wrote and learn of your existence.<p>* Another issue, the rules of information are completely different.  Referencing the hypothetical swingers in other comments on this submission if I am a) invited to my ""swinger conference"", b) I accept the invitation, and c) we take lots of pictures only the diffusion of that information has strict constraints in the physical world.  Once it is on Facebook a) non-swingers will likely have access to my swinger invite, b) non-swingers can see my response, maybe even in their stream and c) they may find my photos (last time I checked private Facebook photos are relatively easy to access.)<p>Once again, treat Facebook like a public whiteboard that represents you.  For the most part only people you know wil see it but keep it blemish free just in case.  So no ""swinger conferences"" on FB.",1252631065

She's private about it, her facebook profile is hidden from searches, public, etc. She posts as attending a swinging event.<p>Friend A is connected to Friend B, another swinger (but semi public about it), someone she's met, trusts, etc.<p>Friend B sees Friend A's swinger party in his events-feed, and signs up to go to it too. Friend A 'likes' this. But that's OK, because Friend A trusts Friend B to know this information.<p>Here's where it breaks down:<p>Friend B is connected to Friend C, an ad-hoc internet friendship without the same level of trust between A and B (to hammer home the point).<p>What the poster of the article is saying, is that now Friend C can inspect Friend B's feeds and see what activity is going on by B's friends. So it's possible to determine that Friend A is interested in this lifestyle and what her name is.<p>Friend A expected her activities would be private and, through the website, it appears they are. But the API is permitting inspection that is not obvious and exposes information that would seemingly be private.<p>Yes, don't post stuff you don't want public (it's a good rule of thumb) but this is going a bit further than that and breaking the barrier of expected/perceived privacy and reality.
