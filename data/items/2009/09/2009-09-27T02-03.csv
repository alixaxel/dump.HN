We are intelligent people who notice the difference between two comments with very similar upvotes and one that far outpaces the other and find these proportions to be of interest. The new portrayal of comment rankings keeps interesting information from users and will end up stunting the community's progress. If you're just trying to ward off users, maybe remove the nav and make the site even slower.<p>There are far more interesting ways to differentiate. I'd like to see this site be as light and fast as possible (would appeal to our hacker ethic) and allow users to customize the hell out of it given knowledge of Arc or similar (good chance to promote your language as well).",1254019786

Apple learned pretty quickly what a terrible idea that was, and switched to a design where there's a hard ABS ring inset in the aluminum exterior case. Unfortunately every other manufacturer continued with the shitty design.<p>On top of that, the power supply is 12v/1A, and is carried on one of the outside pins! If you shove it in backwards, power gets connected to data and fries the board. They should have used the central pins for power and ground.<p>I've personally seen at least a dozen cases of fried Firewire ports, including several epidemics where someone would fry ports on several computers using one bad device.",1254019642

846436,comment,846365,846416,0,0,aboodman,,,"There is indeed a preference for window (really the global) object. Try these:<p><script>
alert(this == window);
function foo() {
  alert(this == window);
}
foo();
</script><p>|this| is basically a magical variable that by default is set to the global object, but can also be set by the caller of a function one of two ways:<p>a) by setting a reference to the function on an object, and calling it with object or bracket notation:
  var someObj = {};
  someObj.f = theFunction;
  someObj.f();  // now |this| inside theFunction will
                // point to someObj
  someObj[""f""]();  // same thing<p>b) by using apply:
  theFunction.apply(someObj);<p>You are right that in the case of event handlers, it is common in the DOM for event handlers to get their |this| set to the DOM node that fired the event. Since the default value of |this| is the global object, it isn't possible in the case of setTimeout for us to tell whether the caller (the host) explicitly set it, or if the function is being called without any value set for |this|.<p>Basically, |this| is an extra parameter to any function. It is controlled by the caller, and as such, should either be documented as part of the signature of the function, or else should not be relied on by the implementation of the function.<p>The common misunderstanding with people new to JS is that they expect |this| to be controlled by the callee, like it is in lots of other popular languages, and are surprised when calling convention can change its value.",1254019315

846416,comment,846365,846365,0,0,Bluem00,,,"This article does a good job of explaining a concept I had trouble with when first using javascript. Now, I usually use the approach recommended in the article of setting a private variable (e.g. self, or my) to the current value of 'this' in a javascript class.<p>However, I think the article is slightly incorrect on one minor point. It states, ""this wants to be window whenever possible, which is not always what you want."" I believe the correct description is: the 'this' variable in a function called in response to an event on dom object is set to that dom object. For the example given in the article, this is set to the window object because setTimeout causes an event on window to fire, not because there's any inherent preference for the window object.",1254017842

There are a ton of things going on if you look for them at Waterloo, and it's not a commuter school so there are a lot of people on campus.<p>The one thing I cannot stress enough is the value of the co-op program at Waterloo. I didn't realize until my fifth co-op job that this was going to be the only time in my life where I could switch jobs every four months without looking like a quack who couldn't hold a job. I got to see a bunch of different industries (Telecommunications, Power Generation, Green Building and term in Ghana, West Africa with Engineers Without Borders Canada) without making long term commitments to any of them.
