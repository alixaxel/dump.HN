If the user is searching for sites about tea, the ads that work will generally be for sites about tea. When a user is on facebook, they are doing facebooky things. The ads that work can be expected to be ones that get her to do facebooky things.

For example, purchases for me are consummated off-site and there is no guarantee that the customer will return to my Thank You page to get tagged by GA's conversion code.  However, since the off-site system does ping a script on my server, I can use Mixpanel's API to complete the last step in that customer's funnel.  (Finally, my number of conversions reported actually bears strong resemblance to the number of sales I made in the same period.)<p>3)  Google Analytics really, really is suboptimal for funnel segmentation along any axis which isn't available to the browser.  For example, a logged in user to my site might be a guest, a trial user, or a paying customer.  I want to know completion rates for a particular interaction broken down by that role.  This is, literally, one line of code added to my internal Mixpanel API.  If I were using Google Analytics, I'd have to start tagging many pages with arcane Javascript to cookie up the visitor with utm_some_garbage_here_argh, then configure custom segments in Google Analytics, then finally be able to sort by that.",1251860003

The point of the apple is to be eaten; colour is more or less irrelevant.
