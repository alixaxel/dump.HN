(2) taking advantage of previous solutions, not reinventing the wheel but (3) not using any wheels which are limited or limiting and (4) spending maximum time and energy on the specific product.<p>but i think the most important thing is to regularly analyze whether or not one is on the optimal path to one's goal (first-round funding, e.g.) and also whether one can make the process of the development so bloody fun that one wants to spend as much time on the project as literally possible.<p>the most undervalued link in the whole network of the problem space is between the founders and their problem space. i.e., figuring out how to spend as much time as possible in your REPL, with your design diagrams, or otherwise amongst your code.<p>and now, i am just going to press 'add comment'. but yeah, nice article.",1252197391

Sure, it's useful to get a <i>feel</i> for it and have some experience with it, but I'm assuming ""learn"" in this case means a higher level of competency than just a broad understanding of it.<p>C is about as low as you need to know nowadays. x86 was critical to know in the 90s due to performance issues, but since the majority of software nowadays is running on some sort of VM or pulling heavily on frameworks (CLR, JVM, OS X's frameworks), it's <i>mostly</i> pointless to use x86 in all but the most unusual of projects.<p>The only reason I'd still advise a basic familiarity with assembler is to rid the notion that C is as low as it gets - you can get totally different results from different C compilers (and even incompatible results in some nasty cases) and it's worth at least knowing there's something underneath there that you can take a basic look at.",1252197154

Most of my colleagues in the UW engineering department I was in learned just enough Matlab to get the homework done. I learned enough to program a solution to the homework.

You can get pretty far in web development with a good head, some Railscasts and tutorials, and a bit of practice. Maybe the question is ""When should a web developer learn machine code?"" I think the answer to that question, if he/she is a working web developer, is, ""When he/she has to, when it comes up.""<p>For myself, I look at these--let's be frank--esoteric things like machine code, higher-order whatever, compiler-design, and so on and think, ""That may be interesting, but I've got work to do and fun to have. I'll wait until I have to know it before I learn it."" I've already had to learn about lambdas.
