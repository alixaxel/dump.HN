Consider that the legal system (which is designed to make the fairest decisions possible) takes forever and is not necessarily accurate. For starters, you need to admit the possibility that a fair resolution != convenient resolution.<p>A ""con artist coder"" registry isn't fair. It's error-prone at best and exploitable at worst. Sure, those ""registries"" might make you <i>feel</i> safer, but they don't really accomplish anything useful.

It's self-referential: only you can define whether you are addicted or not.<p>By this measure, if the youths are <i>self-reporting</i> that they feel addicted to the internet, that's very, very interesting. It says that the youths themselves feel they should be doing something else, not some old, stodgy institution.<p>I know it's fun to play the old folks against the young, but you just can't keep waving your hands around and yelling various buzzwords. At some point there are real, independent metrics that come into play. Kids can't spell. The ability to put together (or appreciate) a cogent argument spanning more than ten words is being lost on a generation. No amount of technology is going to give critical thinking skills back to people who spent their formative years on FaceBook and WoW instead of somewhere else -- anywhere else.<p>It's not like being instantly connected to the world's body of knowledge and each other is going to make up for cognitive potential lost through inattention.<p>We've got some really cool stuff going on now -- stuff that has the potential to change the nature of what it means to be human.

To some degree, it offers a way around these limitations. (See Greenspun's Tenth Rule.)<p>Object-oriented programming is popular in big companies, because it suits the way they write software. At big companies, software tends to be written by large (and frequently changing) teams of mediocre programmers. Object-oriented programming imposes a discipline on these programmers that prevents any one of them from doing too much damage. The price is that the resulting code is bloated with protocols and full of duplication. This is not too high a price for big companies, because their software is probably going to be bloated and full of duplication anyway.<p>Object-oriented programming generates a lot of what looks like work. Back in the days of fanfold, there was a type of programmer who would only put five or ten lines of code on a page, preceded by twenty lines of elaborately formatted comments. Object-oriented programming is like crack for these people: it lets you incorporate all this scaffolding right into your source code. Something that a Lisp hacker might handle by pushing a symbol onto a list becomes a whole file of classes and methods. So it is a good tool if you want to convince yourself, or someone else, that you are doing a lot of work.""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html</a>",1253055040

The only examples I can think of where laws or ethics have been created is the case of texting and driving, which is killing people as fast as drunk driving (or faster).<p>You'd think if the next generation were being made 40% stupider (a number I just made up) we'd care at least as much about that as people plowing their cars into each other.",1253052740
