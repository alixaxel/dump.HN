There is no policy which cannot be gamed, but we have to look at the bigger picture. How many VCs do you think will put their reputation at risk to earn $50k pa? I am not saying the solution the author mentioned is perfect, but its a start. A system can be put in place similar to O1 or EB1 visa but with startups in mind. Every startup will have to go through certain conditions to be eligible to apply. The founders can have 1-2 year temporary visa and if things work out great, they should be granted Green card, or they should be allowed to go through the cycle again.",1252987074

823253,comment,822932,822932,0,0,Radix,,,"I'll just address this bit since it seems fundamental: <i>So how do we decide what good things are? Doesn’t everyone have their own idea of what’s good? Instead of trying to promote one particular person’s notion of what’s good, it seems like we should balance everyone’s good. In most cases, it’s impossible for us to know what’s actually good for a person, so this usually means taking their word for it and trying to give them what they want.</i><p>How can one balance everyone's good?  In order to do so you would need to be able to take the world in its entirety as those in the thought experiment do.  We can't do this, so the suggestion is that we trust what people want.  The problem is not only do people not have the foresight to know what they want their wants change relative to their haves.  'Need' would have been a better choice with a given definition.  Because we can not balance everyone's good I suggest everyone must be chiefly responsible for themselves and their charges.  They should be expected to be honest about their desires and, to be fair to others, they should be as little burden as possible.  Such that the greatest good is caring for ones own needs first while avoiding hindering others from acquiring their own base needs.  The only thing needed now is a definition of 'need', but I would probably just choose a level on Maslow's hierarchy.<p>I probably communicated as poorly as the author, so my point is: communication is an interesting problem, and these are week assumptions and poorly communicated as it is too easy for an alternate, though in my case similar, theory of ethics to be built.<p><i>I have friends who, to save money, break into buildings on the MIT campus to steal food and drink and naps and showers. They use the money they save to promote the public good. It seems like these criminals, not the average workaday law-abiding citizen, should be our moral exemplars</i><p>What if every student, faculty member, staff member, alumnus, and donor <i>want</i> food, drink, and grounds to be used in an ordered way.  How are their collective wants less important than some few ""poor"" people?  I don't see how that jump was made.",1252986903

We already have processors\n  2. We have a metric to measure processor speed\n</code></pre>\nThen the path we're hiking is one <i>mostly</i> of incremental improvments, with occasional boulder of innovation.<p>Whereas the 'intelligent' agents we currently have do not seem particularly similar in <i>quality</i> to intelligence we already know; the path from contemporary AI to strong AI is hardly a trail at all --- it's all boulders; innovation all the way up.<p>[The claim I make about 'quality' is vague; in part necessarily so. If I could pinpoint my discomfort with current methods, I could propose a new course of action based on a new metric. Nevertheless I feel that the high-mathematical bent of current machine learning techniques (proto-value RL, statistical relational methods, etc) will lead to excellent answers, but does not point towards the flexibility of general intelligence.

If you get into a decent program, your Ph.D. will be fully funded: a full ride plus a stipend for living costs.

That's my, fault, though; the bit about software being pure design wasn't my main point there, so I kept it very short. Plus, people use the word design to mean a zillion things. I'm using the word in its broadest sense.<p>Even if I'm making something with no user interface at all, creating source code is still purely a design activity. The source code doesn't actually do anything; it's a blueprint. When you create the UI, that's designing the UI. When you create the API, that's (as you say) designing the API. Even when you implement the guts, you're still designing them as you go.<p>I agree with everything else you say, though, especially about the warning bells!",1252984028

The nano release was a backstep for them in that it doesn't unify their product category. If they'd released a camera with the iPod touch, as I think they will, then suddenly they've got a chance for a powerhouse, but the nano is a music product, not a multimedia product, and this camera is as close to lackluster as Apple gets. It will sell nanos, but this isn't a competitive product like the touch-with-camera would have been.",1252984010

Then I found out that the jobs that fit that description, such as ""university professor"", are typically scarce, highly sought after, and guarded by layers upon layers of BS to protect the interests of people who already have them.  (""First, we're going to have you go through seven years of indentured servitude for a <i>shot</i> at getting one of these jobs.  Then, we're going to subject you to a toxic hothouse of petty politics about trivial things."")<p>So I started a business to write my own job description:  think big thoughts, sometimes write about them, avoid BS to maximum extent possible.  It turns out this actually works.",1252983690

There's surprising as in what is this software doing!? and there surprising as in the wow, this is so much better.<p>The pinch zoom is a perfect example of a surprising UI that most people love. When someone sees a two fingered pinch zoom for the first time they go wow, that's awesome. Surprising isn't always bad.",1252983633
