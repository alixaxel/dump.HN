830492,comment,829638,829638,0,0,jyellin,,,"Passion is the prospect that something incredible is about to take place. Notice the term prospect because a prospect is not a guarantee, but rather a chance that the world will be different based on whatever you desire to achieve. My personal opinion is that you can have all the intellect and money in the world, but if you do not have passion and enthusiasm, you have nothing! The irony of this concept is that passion and enthusiasm are the most powerful forces in the world, which means that as good as they can do, they can also be destructive in such a way that people will forever be changed due to their wrath. Let’s think about Madoff, Hitler, or Bin Laden because all three of these infamous figures had passion and enthusiasm which is how they were able to manipulate the lives of thousands, and potentially even millions of people. All three of these men obviously had intellect, but if they were lacking in the passion department, there would have never been a $50billion ponzi scheme, a Holocaust, or 9/11. Now let’s bring this to perspective for all of us entrepreneurs because these three men exuded passion in such a way that they were literally able to create a cult-like following and etch a place in history. I am sure that all of you will agree that their passion was overshadowed by their sickness and lack of self worth. But Steven Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Biz Stone are currently doing what these three infamous men have done in the past; but the difference is that they not only have the secret sauce of passion, but also an insatiable desire to impact the world in a positive way! Get excited about what you are doing and start to live with passion…",1253289561

Watch the cable news sometime--it's 100% ""analysis"" because only three facts have come out in the last hour, and they have a dozen people on call to give ""analysis"" of this ""breaking news"". Analysis is cheap. With more and more people offering this analysis for free, you'd think it'd be easier in the long run to just filter all of this freely available analysis and you'd end up with something just as good as if you paid the Financial Times.<p>Facts, however, are in short supply. Discovering a surprising fact or two is good journalism. ""The CIA has secret prisons in Eastern Europe to imprison suspected terrorists"". ""The Watergate Hotel break-in was orchestrated by members of Nixon's re-election campaign"". But facts like that are hard to get. The only people who'd pay for those facts are the political opponents of whoever they embarrass, which means if both parties are implicated you can cover things up. Also, political opponents will pay just as much for a convincing lie as they will for the truth.<p>""More data beats a better algorithm"" is just as true for journalism. Yes, I'm sure the Financial Times does a good job analyzing the same shallow set of data we can all get for free. I'm sure they do a better job than most other places do. But analysis is what most of the media does. They scrape press releases and the like as hard as they can, never looking for more facts.<p>At some point, journalism is a public good. But, uniquely among public goods, it cannot be provided by the government because journalism often operates in opposition to the government.",1253289444

830472,comment,830075,830075,0,0,sunir,,,"An interesting part of the history of bank account feeds is that Intuit was a big part of the original OFX standardization effort. Initially OFX was looking to become a wonderful and well supported standard in North America. However, Intuit tried to turn the screws on the banks by charging hefty licensing fee for supporting OFX, and that eventually that killed the effort to free your bank account information.<p>I hope the lesson is clear for everyone: if you depend on someone for data, you don't get to charge them--they get to charge you. That goes double for banks who are generally extremely unhappy when they aren't the ones making money in a deal.<p>That's why Yodlee has a near monopoly. They are the only ones doing a decent job screenscraping from your bank, which is hardly secure or stable especially since some banks actively try to prevent this. This is very expensive and ultimately futile.<p>On the other hand, there's an opportunity for someone to get the OFX working again by reversing the flow of charges back towards the bank.

The point I am trying to make is that Coding is an <i>enabling technology</i>, i.e., it serves to enable reliable communication, but it's a means towards an end, not an end in itself. A lot of people think communication is about two antennas and something floating around in the air is transmitted between them, and somehow the receiver is able to guess the message that the transmitter sent. Well, the transmitter can do that because of coding schemes, but that's too technical for most people.<p>Another field which suffers from the same problem is Controls. It's also an <i>enabling technology</i> in the sense that it allows man-made mechanisms and devices to work as desired. Most people think airplanes fly because they have wings, when in fact they fly because they have controls.",1253288695

NeXT, on the other hand, created bleeding edge hardware and an amazing new operating system that was worthy of being the core for the next decade or two of development.<p>Apple didn't ""buy"" NeXT.

830459,comment,830459,830326,0,0,osipov,,,"As a personal project, I've built a simple search driven website using Scala + Lucene. The article doesn't make a fair comparison of Scala vs. Java complexity. The examples in the article are focused on Scala strengths, e.g. for-comprehensions, closures, Range classes, etc. It is true that these features are superior to Java equivalents. However, Scala is still too awkward in implementation of annotations, generics and type inference in general. For example, Scala 2.7.5 annotation problems make integration with Java Persistence API (JPA) an adhoc hack. Scala 2.8 still has serious bugs open on annotations. Generic type are fundamentally complex and while Java attempts to abstract some of the complexity related to co/contra-variant types, Scala requires a deep understanding of nuances in practical application of generics. ML type inferencer in Scala is great when it works (in simple situations) but it is a headache to figure out _why_ it causes problems in the cases when type inference doesn't work as intended. Unfortunately when the type inference doesn't work as expected one is forced to hard code type casting which defeats the whole purpose of a type inferencer.",1253288513
