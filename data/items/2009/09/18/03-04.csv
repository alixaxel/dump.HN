Your mind seems pretty made up about Mint without knowing all the details surrounding the acquisition.<p>What's kind of funny is the vast majority of the 37signals philosophy I agree with. Hell, we turned down VC funding in part because we really liked what you guys were able to do without it, and the fact that investor interests and founder interests often conflict. But to lambast someone for taking the payday of a lifetime without knowing all the circumstances surrounding not only their company, but their life, doesn't seem right.",1253246100

Developers were clamoring to develop for the iPhone because they saw how big it was going to be in the market. If all the iPhone developers today decided to go to android, it wouldn't move the android needle one bit, it would just open up a huge hole to be filled with other aspiring iPhone developers.

Tesla and Facebook had to, and both seem to be well on their way to changing the way we behave environmentally and socially.<p>Also, I really really really do not understand all the crap you guys give ad based websites/business models. Advert business has well and long been an established industry, dripping with cash. There are tons of websites out there generating millions of dollars for their owners. From POF to sleazy SEO blogs, these people generate enough money to live comfortably, and they're happy with that.

But something bothers me about the current critique.<p>The most common argument (by far!) that I've heard against VC funding is that VCs only care about home runs, so their interests aren't aligned with the founders', they don't care if 9/10 of their portfolio companies die, and so on. But here the criticism is just the opposite: the ""VC-induced cancer that’s infecting our industry and killing off the next generation"" is that VCs <i>don't</i> want home runs, they want early exits. Both criticisms can't be right. So, are there two distinct and incompatible schools of thought about why VCs suck? Or are there just a lot of people who are against VCs no matter what, for whatever reason is handy? My spidey sense is that there's a little of the latter at work. (FWIW, I don't have an opinion for or against VC funding in general.)",1253244982
