Here is what they do well:<p>1)  Have an opinion, state it clearly and incorporate it into every piece.  Articles can be a lot shorter and more informative if you don't have to ""show each perspective"" (which I think is impossible to do well.)<p>2)  Create content that is so good, people will pay for it.  Part of this is hiring insightful writers, part is sending them all over the world where a story is always happening and part is journalistic integrity.  An untrustworthy news source is not valuable.<p>3) Avoid the butter battle.  They don't play the tit for tat game with other columnists.  The paper would read nearly the same whether they had a million competitors or none.
