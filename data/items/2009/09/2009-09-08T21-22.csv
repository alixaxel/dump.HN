While a correct implementation of HMAC-SHA1 should resist forgery as well as RSA-SHA1, there are numerous drawbacks to shared-secret schemes in general that you noticed.<p>Another weakness in OAuth with RSA-SHA1 in the section you cite is that you have to implement your own PKI or other scheme for validating the source of RSA public keys. Like so many other specs, it punts on this hard issue.",1252447181

He started with no business plan,and at first the site has very slim pickings of things to auction.  In 1998 they hired Whitman because they he realized he need an ""A List"" business person on their team in order to define the company, direct it, and get it to be taken seriously.  Whitman led Ebay to its IPO.<p>I am not a greedy person at all, and though I enjoy being a founder myself as I currently am one, I have both an MBA and am a founder.  So I represent both sides and the best of both worlds.  Whitman my not be the founder, but her efforts and that Harvard MBA has led her to the tune of of starting salary of $175k per year with an annual bonus of $100k.  in 2008 this had grown a salary of $11 million per year,and today she still owns 3.9 million shares of Ebay stock.  Not too shabby I'd say.<p>Meg Whitman's Ebay Employment Letter

Solr, for example, has been a big win for us -- I've written a Rails plugin that ties to an embedded Solr server, and because there's no network overhead, search requests on indexed data finish up in under 30ms before the cache has warmed up, and 1ms once the index has been cached.<p>On top of that, the JVM (with JRuby, Rails, a database, and Solr) uses less than 200M of RAM even when being pounded by our benchmark suite, and produces impressive performance results... even when running on my laptop.  On a full-fleged server machine, the numbers are even more impressive.<p>And all of this, without having to write a single line of Java.  It's a good time to be hacking on Ruby.",1252444640

I'm arguing for a more complex model, rather than an idealistic one.<p>""Less total weight carried, across the system as a whole, would result in less fuel consumption.""<p>While this is correct from very simple standpoint, what are you really saying?<p>""The system carries n amount of weight.""  Okay, I can accept that.<p>""The system carries less weight if one person does not fly.""  True, but that one person's weight is offset on the specific flight in question by cargo.<p>For a very large value of n, n-200 = n.  An airplane takes a massive amount of fuel to accelerate to rotation speed (it's not just pushing you and cargo, it's also shoving vast quantities of aluminum, steel, plastic and fuel.)  The empty weight of a 747-400 (the industry standard) is 400,000 lbs., of which 200 is no factor.<p>If that empty plane takes off, it will use 100 times the body weight of a human being in fuel <i>during takeoff operations alone and continue to burn as much during each hour of cruise flight</i>.  Adding humans decreases range.  Adding cargo decreases range.  Fuel will be burned.<p>Your statement assumes a very simple model of ""if I don't get on that plane, I'm saving the environment.""  The actual model is ""if at least 200 people don't get on that plane, a seasonally-appropriate ~15 minute delay will happen until cargo can be loaded.""<p>I feel, therefore, that I have contradicted your statement quite soundly.  I assure you that I have no interest in representing myself as an environment-hating industry apologist.",1252444504

But these are my impressions:<p>Unlike the desktop market, all the large-scale server VARs have a 'sliding scale' where the larger you are, the more you pay.  And even if you pay 'small business' rates to dell for your servers (which are much lower than 'enterprise' rates, from what I see)  you still end up paying 3x-4x what I pay buying the parts and building the server itself.<p>Even if I charge you $500 for building the server (which is gouging, but if you wanted support, that's probably what I'd ask.)   I could sell you a 32GiB ram, 8 core 2.2Ghz shanghai for $2000 before disk.  For another grand I could build you the same server with 64GiB ram.  Compare that to anything from dell.<p>edit:  I don't actually sell anything that isn't a 'service' so I don't have a retail license.  when I build people servers, I have them buy the parts, then I charge them a fee for labor and support.",1252443989
