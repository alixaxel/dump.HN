824666,comment,823723,823723,0,0,rcfox,,,"Disclaimer: I'm by no means an operating systems expert. I am simply a computer engineering student who has recently written my own OS, from scratch.<p>First things first, limit your scope! All of those links seem to want to tell you how to write an OS to run on a standard PC. That is going to be a huge nightmare. Presumably, you'll want to be able to access some (or all) of the peripherals on your PC, so you'll have to write drivers for them, which is incredibly time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, write for a smaller platform with simple peripherals. Something like a Gumstix, or ARM development board. You should be able to easily get documentation for each hardware component.<p>Second, don't try to mimic Linux. It may seem appealing because Linux is great, but its underlying architecture isn't. Linux has a monolithic kernel, meaning that there is a lot of functionality in there. If your display code gets into a bad state, it can bring the entire system down. It's also not very fun to manage the interface when you have 250+ system calls.<p>Instead of a monolithic kernel, use a microkernel structure. In a microkernel, you essentially have basic scheduling, inter-process communication, and memory management. Everything else lives outside of the kernel in separate processes, which communicate via message passing. This makes it much more stable, since there's a smaller chance of the entire system being taken down. It's also a lot easier to have your OS certified (essential if you want to use it in industrial or safety-critical scenarios) when it's broken down into small pieces.<p>Third, you'll have to read up on scheduling algorithms, context switching (this will require knowledge of assembly for your chosen platform), memory management and concurrency. Those are just the bare minimum for a working OS!<p>Fourth, get some partners for your project. Writing an OS is a lot of work, and your friends will help to encourage you. They'll also help to prevent you from making silly design decisions.<p>Good luck!",1253046342

824656,story,,,8,14,jv2222,"What Can You Do If a Coder Cons You?",,"I met a coder (via Twitter) when I was looking for someone to help me with some stuff. He had a great resume with buckets of experience listed on it. He was approx 35 so I believed the resume and he ""talked the talk"" as well as any coder I've ever met. As it turned out, he never did any work with me... but... an old friend of mine was looking for someone to help with his new site.<p>The site was a simple points/wallet system that you can earn points by filling out surveys and then download games using those points.<p>So, without thinking too much of it, I put the new coder buddy I had met via Twitter in touch with my old friend. My friend interviewed him and agreed that he looked like a great guy with lots of experience.<p>Anyway, he quoted 7 days work at a cost of $2k to do the job.<p>Everything was fine, and he delivered about 80% of the site. Then my friend made the mistake of paying him the final 50% because he was happy with the work to date.<p>After this, the developer stopped work.<p>After which point, each time he was sent an email asking when the next 20% would arrive, he would send back an email saying that he only had a couple of hours left and he would complete the site within the next day or so.<p>This went on for 6 weeks. Which of course drove my friend nuts, who finally contacted me to get involved.<p>My gut reaction was that my friend was over dramatizing and that I would be able to resolve the issue. So I spoke to the developer and he assured me that there was only few hours work left and he would get it done in a few days.<p>So, I set up a bug tracker and I checked in the exiting code to svn to make it a bit more track-able and easy to sign off the final 20% - after all there was only 5 small issues.<p>So, now what happened was, every few days I would send this guy an email saying hows it going, and he said I've finished everything. I'm going to commit it tonight.<p>This went on for two weeks.<p>At which point I realised that he was never actually going to do the work. So I had to apologize to my friend and find another trusted resource to finish it.<p>Then, after cutting this developer off by changing all the passwords etc, I decided to have a closer inspection of the code he'd written.<p>Well, let me just say that he had used a code generator to build many active record style classes that loaded rows from the db with insert/update etc... Not a problem right? But the code was so bad!<p>For example, there was zero use of a database abstraction layer, and each of these code generated classes had the full mysql declarations inside the objects.<p>He then tied up these classes with some verrrry questionable procedural logic.<p>NONE of the db queries anywhere were escaped. Even for form input. So not only could you easily perform SQL injections, but any one who typed a ' into an HTML form would break the system.<p>What amazes me is, how could you write a code generation tool that generated such bad code. Surely during the course of his career he woudl have noticed that the most basic of bugs was present in all the SQL. Wouldn't you think, after years of using the same code generation tool to re-factor it?<p>I can tell he's been using the same tool for a while because it's using PHP4 style constructors rather than __construct.<p>Anyyyyway.<p>The question I have for you is... What can be done about con artist coders like this? Is there anything? Should there be some kind of ""con artist coder"" registry?<p>It doesn't seem right that this guy will be working for other clients, when he is clearly not going to have their best interests at heart.<p>All thoughts, much appreciated.",1253046072

It takes into account the history of the worker (were they accurate workers in the past? etc.) and also handles automatically rejecting workers who fail too many gold questions.<p>Speaking of, that's one of the cool bits about CrowdFlower, too, is that you can define ""gold"" questions. These are questions to which you know the answer. Workers will see these as if they were any other task. We then give them feedback about how well they're doing. If they keep missing the gold questions, then we mark all of their work for your job as ""tainted"" and their answers don't go into the aggregate calculations, which tell you what the users agreed on the most.<p>So, for instance, in a job where we pull in tweets about, say, #kanyewest, and ask workers to judge the sentiment of the tweet (positive, negative, etc.), we could take some obvious ones, like ""Kanye West is a big jerk!"" and mark it as gold with an answer of ""Negative"". Anyone who says ""Positive"" is probably yanking your chain. So we trust them less.<p>Of course, gold questions don't work too well for subjective questions, like writing short paragraphs.<p>I hope this gives you an idea of what CrowdFlower does in terms of Quality Control. I'm only the front-end guy, so I'm not too knowledgeable about all the math behind the scenes. All I know is that there's lots of it. :)<p>(I'm a front-end developer for CrowdFlower.
