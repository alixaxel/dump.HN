824208,comment,824178,824178,0,0,sophacles,,,"Take the degree that provides you with material you wouldn't otherwise learn.  In your case, this would be electronics, because I strongly suspect you will pick up on the CS stuff on your own. My experience is similar to yours. I was enrolled in the CS program at a pretty big engineering school. I became somewhat disenchanted by it, as there were all sorts of interesting classes out there, but I only had free slots in my degree for 2.  In most of the CS courses I enjoyed the stuff, but frequently had already learned it on my own. So I switched majors to Geography. (Such a degree is nice, because it allows many random courses, so I could learn stuff I would have otherwise not learned).  I minored in CS and continued it as a hobby.  This has had no noticeable impact on my career, and I now work as a researcher at a university, writing and evaluating software.<p>HTH",1253033977

At the age of 14 I started with programming in C and quickly graduated to socket programming and experimenting with other languages like Ruby. But before I joined college I attended a seminar on basic electronics and liked it a lot. I changed my plans of majoring in CS and went for a electronics degree instead.<p>After some time I suddenly started to wonder if I made a wrong choice. First of all is that in my college in an electronics degree they focus mainly(and rightly) on circuit designing and micro controller design and management. To be honest I miss courses like algorithms and theory of computation. But on the other hand I feel much much re leaved that I dont have to study in the more proprietary software they use, like for GUI programming they just emphasis on microsoft windows and for object oriented programming they limit themselves to whatever is included in java only. Also there are no ""interesting (as i want)"" stuff like a course on functional programming.<p>Fortunately in my electronics course they have interesting things like AI and image processing (and electives for bio informatics).<p>So would it be too hard to survive in a world without algorithms and data structures for a CS guy?",1253033271

I have lived in China and found possibly more specialization there as parents usually set the course for their children which most children feel obligated to follow.  Whereas in the ""West"" parents generally leave things open to their children to decide.<p>When I first read the article, I found this part the most interesting:<p>""I remember reading about how good The Rolling Stones were in self-promotion. Someone in the article said that nobody becomes that successful by sheer luck. I tend to agree.... When we raise children with this bias towards specialization, they become defenseless when they enter the real world. They naively and faithfully keep improving their skills in their own specialized areas thinking that the success will automatically follow.""<p>Jeff Atwood had an article where he mentioned that if he could train every developer on some skill it wouldn't be technical as most decent developers are already good with technical things.  He would train them how to market and promote themselves since most developers just focus on programming and ignore the other skills needed to become successful.",1253032343

Other personality types suffered.  Those with enough seniority and clout took to working from home.<p>The lesson:  If you match the description on this list, don't expect such treatment from the general population.  Work to put yourself in a position where they have no choice.  That can be a very difficult lesson for an introvert:  Valuing yourself in a disparaging world, and putting yourself first before that world drains you.<p>Many introverts have a strong need for social connection.  Often we subsume ourselves in an attempt to create and maintain it.  This eventually makes everyone very unhappy.  Turning the list into a list of things that you do for yourself -- that you insist upon -- is a better approach.  Then follow up with the people who respect this.<p>This doesn't rule out extroverts.  Some get it.  Others learn.  Especially when they find out their normal approach gets them nowhere.",1253031861

The property named ""prototype"" on the constructor is not necessarily the same as the actual prototype object of an instance created with the constructor. There is no standard way to retrieve the prototype object of an instance, but in Mozilla you can get through the non-standard '__proto__' property.<p>The 'prototype' property on the constructor indicates what will be assigned as the prototype of instances created <i>in the future</i> with that constructor. The property can be changed, but that does not affect existing instances created with the constuctor. It would probably be less confusing if the 'prototype' property was called 'assignPrototype' or something like that.<p>The prototype (ie. __proto__ property) of an instance <i>cannot</i> be changed according to the standards (although some non-standard implementations allow that). That is, it cannot be changed to point to a different object, but the prototype object itself is mutable, and when you change it it will affect all instances sharing the prototype.<p>It is not uncommon to think of constructors as equivalent to classes, however technically prototypes and constructors are independent.
