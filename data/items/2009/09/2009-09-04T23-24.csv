It is often forgotten that the idea of mind or brain as computational is merely an assumption, not a truth. When I point this out to ""believers"" in the computational theory of mind, some of their arguments are almost religious. They say, ""What else could there be? Do you think mind is supernatural?"" But accepting mind as a physical entity does not tell us what kind of physical entity it is. It could be a physical system that cannot be recreated by a computer.<p>This sounds like the same kind of argument as ""intelligent design"" people use.  """"What else could there be?"" is not a religious argument, it's a perfectly reasonably question, and to suggest that there are physical systems that cannot be recreated by computers shows a lack of fundamental theoretical understanding of computation.",1252107620

Provide artist, design, QA, project management, tech writers, beta/alpha testers and developers way to seek each other out.  Then make it seamless to submit ""ideas"".  Ideas are just that, someone went ""dude, it'd be awesome if"" and allow feedback.  A project can then implement the idea, but it's just a soft link, the project isn't required to follow it at all.  And any other project is free to implement it as well.

Some of these tips I don't quite understand, like creating a custom authentication backend (I've only had to do this once), and creating global template context processor and middleware files. I prefer to keep those bundled individually with the app that uses it. Also, not all of my apps use forms, so why would I make a forms.py for each app?<p>My package is on github here: <a href=""http://github.com/dziegler/django-create-project/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/dziegler/django-create-project/tree/master</a><p>There's not much documentation because I wasn't really expecting anyone but myself to use it, but basically once it's installed, it'll install a binary file in your path.

you would do<p><pre><code>  create_project project_name

It'll auto-create your wsgi handler, an apps, templates, static/css, static/js, static/images directories, create a localsettings file, and update your settings. It also automatically installs some common django apps I like to use, like django-command-extensions, django-debug-toolbar, django-css, and clevercss.

The main msg is that treating cancer is really, really hard; as another commenter noted biology is incredibly complicated.<p>multi-pronged approaches do seem to work best; some variation of that already happens.  Large tumors are surgically removed, anti-angiogenesis drugs work by blocking new blood vessels from growing, I mentioned some others.  The problem is that even the most aggressive combinations of treatments haven't proved to actually work in practice, and death rates for most cancers have barely budged in the last 30 yrs.  A reflection of this is that people will pay $50k+ for a drug that will increase life expectancy by a few weeks (or their insurance will, that's another topic).<p>People like me do train their entire lives to improve this, and we are working on many new possibilities, for example tracking circulating tumor cells and figuring out what DNA mutations they have to see if you can make a drug that is targeted towards deactivating whatever fraction of them actually lead to metastatic disease.  Look up the National Cancer Institute's nanotechnology in cancer program to see more of this kind of stuff.<p>I don't know what the ""unlocalized"" side effects are and why things are done that way - I will say any kind of advance in treaments is incredibly difficult to achieve because you have to convince MDs and patients to go with something new when there is a tried and tested method, and it is their lives in the balance.",1252106893

If you get cancer, are given a treatment, and you live, you assume that without the treatment you would have died (death being the ""counter-factual"" observation that corresponds to the factual observation of your not dying), and thus that the treatment effect was big and important.  But if you take a preventative treatment and don't get cancer, you don't have an obvious counter-factual to which you can compare your present state of well-being.  You don't have the opportunity to realize that without the preventative treatment you would have gotten cancer and died: that counter-factual history never had a chance to play out.",1252106533
