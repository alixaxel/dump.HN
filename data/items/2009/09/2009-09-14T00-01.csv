If it did pattern matching, it'd probably take a table of potential patterns, or a table array of pattern->functions, or somesuch.<p>After wondering before, I just checked the source. In message.lua, receive just takes an optional timeout. It'd be easy to have it take an optional function argument that tests each message in turn (since it's just a list of messages, modified in place), and returns a true if that message should currently be used. I'll test and submit a patch for it later. Not as flexible as pattern matching, but PM would be better off in the base language.

Most housing developments don't have lots with enough space for this sort of thing, but it's silly that in Massachusetts they would be opposed to a windfarm.

Just take a look at the agricultural efficiency charts over the last century, global population, and rates of starvation.  Seriously, the data is on wikipedia.  Check it out.  As a planet, we need GMO food.  Its not up for debate, if the data means anything whatsoever.<p>As to your last comment: Why would labeling GMO foods as such create a food class system, and why is this wrong? (not something you claimed btw, just part of my rant :)  Because only people rich like you will be able to choose the non-GMO variety, because you are undermining the development of safe GMO foods with that label, and because without GMO foods large numbers of poor people will starve.  To me, thats a pretty clear connection.  As to why class matters?  Because North America has more food wealth than the rest of the world, maybe combined?

There are now more obese people than starving people in the world. The diseases that are killing those overweight people are largely nutritional in origin (heart disease, diabetes, at least some cancers).<p>2. The EU (and I assume the US/Canada as well) are destroying agricultural products en masse, due to subsidized overproduction.<p>3. Population growth is rapidly decelerating - the largest countries in the world have or are rapidly approaching ""first world"" birth rates. Western Europe is shrinking.<p>Borlaug did phenomenal work for his historical period, however, looking at it in a historical timeframe, we should remain aware that the parameters of our world are constantly changing, and thus it's not that simple.<p>Personally, I think it requires a careful look at the political and economic production and distribution systems around the agriculture and food industries.
