Look for the engineering details that a non-rocket-engineer animator would get wrong or not know about. I guess, though that you don't know about these.<p>Instead, you could look at the density of information and secondary effects in the shot. Typical CGI shots, as engineered intentional artifacts, lack the level of detail and chaos / serendipity of reality.<p>E.g. the spalling of the concrete, the smoke/steam dissipation, the fully volumetric flame with mach-diamonds.<p>CGI smoke is rarely done right. If you've seen enough particle systems, you'll start to recognize their signature. CGI flame (your comments aside) doesn't usually correctly capture the features of a rocket exhaust plume. Note the colour changes and mach diamonds, as well as the subtle thrust gimballing.<p>Also, look for non-rendering details. E.g. the rock in one video that's just canted on its side, being supported by the back-blast of the plume. If this were CGI, then someone would have had to decide to do that. But, who would think of that?<p>Every CGI shot has a budget, and usually only enough work is done to ""sell"" the shot, within budget. If you look frame-by-frame at most CGI animations, you'll see that it's just a veneer of reality. Usually when you compare to photo or video reference, you notice all kinds of missing effects.<p>What may be confusing you re: the metal is that the oxidizer is LOX, which is super-cold, and causes frost to form, altering the metal's reflectivity.",1252906216

For example, if you have the subprocess you have two fundamental designs. The first being where the master process still manages the client socket (so data is transfered from the worker back to the master). The second being where you pass the client socket (over a UNIX message with send_msg) and allow the worker to flush the buffers and close the socket. The problem with the first is that you increase the amount of wake-ups your event loop needs to do by 2x (since it needs to handle data in and out for the worker) which could increase your handling latency. This is a no-go in some applications. The problem with the second model is you lose the ability to have connections live longer their request (otherwise they are restricted to that workers affinity which will not be evenly balanced).<p>ODBC is an option (or SQL Relay) but it adds an increased latency without providing the ability to yield on the resource being ready. For example, even with the models I described above to reduce over subscription of resources, your container may not be correct in its assumption that the connection has little contention. So you effectively add latency and reduce correctness in your ability to run efficiently.",1252905181

I hate the idea of specifying fonts in web pages... why can't web browsers just pick a reasonable default?  But you're right, it does look much better with sans-serif -- consider it changed.<p><i>... reducing the contrast just a bit...</i><p>Lowered contrast helps readability, but I hate the look of grey text (maybe this is just a personal thing -- but I'd like to be able to look at my website without wincing), so I've done this using an off-white background instead.<p><i>On the About page, you should probably make ""portsnap"" and ""FreeBSD Update"" into links.</i><p>I considered that, but there's nothing sensible to make them link to -- I have pages about portsnap and FreeBSD Update on my personal site, but they are several years out of date.<p><i>I wonder whether your legal page needs to say explicitly that the ""Why?""s aren't part of the legal agreement.</i><p>My law student friends tell me that this isn't a problem; and it doesn't matter anyway since I really don't care if the explanations are somehow interpreted as part of the terms.<p><i>Too many parentheses on the ""Utility"" page.</i><p>Good point, I didn't realize how many parenthetical remarks I was making when I wrote that text.<p><i>On the why-picodollars page, you probably mean 2^-40, not 2^(-30).</i><p>Oops!<p><i>On the why-10^9 page, you claim that nothing other than RAM is addressed in hardware. This is, of course, not true. You might consider replacing ""RAM"" with ""memory"", or something.</i><p>Is it not true?

I'm not necessarily going to follow all of your suggestions, but even those I'm not following have provided very useful food for thought.",1252904961
821123,comment,820378,820846,0,0,evgen,,,"It is mostly a matter of scale when it comes to the actual farm operations.  Larger operations have the available capital to invest in pricy equipment that decreases their operational expenses (favorable tax advantages make this a win for most businesses, bug operations just have the cash/credit to actually act upon the available options.)  For a farm a lot of that expense is fuel, fertilizer, and herbicide/pesticide; larger, more efficient equipment is usually the quickest route to being fuel efficient on the farm and there are a variety of options ranging from GMO crops to smarter tilling and cover crops to try to reduce the usage of fertilizer and other chemicals.  A lot of these techniques were pioneered or ""re-discovered"" by modern organic farming but the make sense for any farm.<p>As for the efficiencies in transportation, a recent book to take on that subject was ""Just Food: Where Locovores Got It Wrong"".  The basic idea, which makes a lot of sense when you think about it, is that modern logistics systems have spent a lot of time and research on getting very good at what they do.  Companies in this business track every penny involved in getting goods from point A to a lot of different point Bs.  One big truck going from the farm to a regional distribution center and then twenty smaller trucks going shorter distances from that center to customers ends up being a lot more efficient than a small army of trucks going from the farms to those twenty customer sites.<p>There are some externalities that do not show up on the bottom line, but I can't see it being more than a drop in the bucket compared to the total cost of the entire effort.",1252904928

I've bridge jumped before (not fifty feet I believe but high) and I wasn't the only one around, I didn't think it was that dangerous at the time but I understand how a bad landing could cause such an injury.
