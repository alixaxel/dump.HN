In the past year, I've gained social skills, so I have a lot of friends - however, I have no problem maintaining contacts or gaining new friends. I feel that while my current friends are very important to me, I could make new friends easily (while keeping in touch with high school friends as well).<p>I think that my parents do not need the extra year to save for college.<p>I'm interested more in your point about being over 18. I'd be 17 for the first year of college - but where would that limit me? Where are binding contracts necessary? What complications are there?<p>Thanks.",1252299534

I collected college credit until I was 18, went to a university, and finished in 4 terms. I'm much further along now than I would have been otherwise, and haven't regretted the decision once.<p>You could always attend community college for a year before going to college. You'll save money, have a lot of course work behind you before transferring, and get to meet new people at the college. If you're in California, you'll have a much better shot at getting in to a UC as well.",1252299430
808606,comment,807766,807991,0,0,gruseom,,,"I don't think you're contradicting the post. He's talking about the meaning of the concepts and you're talking about how to get efficient implementations. Both are important, but if you didn't have to worry about efficiency, it's pretty obvious that the data/metadata distinction is a logical false turn. (To use your terminology, why wouldn't we want everything to be fast, dynamic, and unified?)<p>The post does hint at this by suggesting that the concept of metadata itself arose from tradeoffs imposed by hardware. Where I think you differ from Terry is that while he implies that it's time we moved beyond all that, you're saying that the tradeoffs (e.g. between scale and dynamism) remain fundamental. That's a legimitate concern. It's not obvious that we can have our cake and eat it too. It will be interesting to see how FluidDB performs at scale over time.<p>We've been thinking a lot about these issues on our startup too, because we need both speed and dynamicness. The solution we're arriving at is to exploit the static (structured) cases to get as much speed out of them as we can, be fast-ish on the most common dynamic cases (which thankfully are relatively simple), and be correct-but-slow on the complex dynamic cases. What we won't do, however, unless absolutely forced to, is introduce architectural distinctions between these. We want a consistent, regular system (no two types of data, no two types of anything) that happens to run very fast when handed common usage patterns but still allows for arbitrary flexibility. What we're betting is that the usage patterns will be something like 90% static, 9% dynamic-but-simple, and 1% dynamic-and-complex; we want that to map to 90% super-fast, 9% fast-enough, and 1% slow.",1252299388

I thought about attempting to graduate early, but it could come with some big drawbacks.<p>The first question is when do you turn 18, and do you plan on living at home while going to school?<p>Trying to move out before you are 18, even to a school dorm, creates complications that simply vanish when you are 18.  (For instance, you generally can't enter into any legal contracts at all until you are 18).<p>So if your plan is to live at home (at least initially) then graduating early might make sense, but if you want or need to move out to go to college, then I would wait.<p>Next is how is your savings.  Do you and or your parents need that extra year to save before you start college?  I did and then I worked thoughout all of my college to keep my debt low.<p>And then, to echo so many other posters, how is your social situation?

I've also written real production software in about half a dozen languages, so yes I do. I just happen to have a codebase of 100,000+ loc in PHP that I support, so I'm kinda heavily invested in it more than the others.<p>It sucked trying to rework so much PHP4 code for PHP5 while keeping b/c, since that felt like the slowest community migration to a new version I've ever seen... But it seems like each additional release from PHP changes and breaks something else. My codebase is older than many, so it's possible that's made it a bit more brittle over time, but things like completely changing the allowed characters in .ini file keys from 5.2 to 5.3 I find baffling. Yes, speed things up or improve things, but consider that existing liberties you've allowed may come to be relied on by your users. If you let them do something in 5.2, make sure they can still do it in 5.3. I'm always careful myself to make sure existing code will continue to work, and new features are offered as optional or via new APIs. Code from 3.x of my software continues to run fine on 5.x as a result, which lowers my support burdens.<p>So again, no I'm not just fanboying for other languages or falling for the ""grass is always greener"" line of thinking. PHP just has certain inelegant things that I find add to my overall frustration over time. I value terseness, so things like -> versus . for objects adds up, just like $ versus nothing for variables wears at the wrists too. I value consistency, so not remembering which parameter goes first for in_array() versus strpos(), or why the differences in naming add up too. Those are minor things that have been present from the start, but then when I start getting emails from people saying my software is messing up and I find out it's just that the latest version of PHP totally broke something I'd been relying on, that frustration is amplified tenfold.",1252296800

Relationship-wise, in retrospect, high school was depth, while university was breadth.<p>Not rushing high school also allowed me to do well enough to attend university for free, without ever having to worry about my workload during high school.<p>Overall, I guess it didn't hurt me to graduate HS on time.<p>Now for the advice part: if you want to save one year so you can graduate from university faster, don't bother.  Life is short, but youth is the best part anyway... a rush towards some nebulous idea of adulthood is pointless, it'll come sooner than you want anyway.  If you want to use the extra year to explore more courses in university, or to use it towards a graduate degree, or even to travel for a year - that might be worth it.",1252296461

808555,comment,808468,808468,0,0,JimmyL,,,"As many have said, he socialization of high school is worth it. I'd even go as far to say that what you would gain by moving everything forwards a year would be less that what you'd gain by having a more ""normal"" college experience by coming in at the right age, but I have no numbers for that.<p>If you're bored, start contributing to Open Source stuff (maybe turn it into an Independent Study course), do a start-up (look at Mark Bao to see that it's possible), and study a bit so that you can destroy your SATs. You may as well take a few more APs too - figure out which ones will transfer well to you college (as I left HS with six APs, but only got college credit for two of them since they most were in random things like European History) and do them; things like Computer Science AB, Physics C, Calculus BC, and Chemistry should let you bypass almost all of your standard freshman science courses, and will be much easier than their corresponding ""real"" college versions.<p>If you really feel like you need some knowledge, follow along with an MIT OCW course (and if you're really ambitious, find a teacher who will let you do an Independent Study on it) or an evening one at your local community college.<p>I'd also suggest finding an interesting teacher to hang out with and establish as a mentor. In my junior year I took Comp Sci A, as taught by the school's director of IT. He knew I would get a five in a heartbeat (and I did), so he suggested some other projects which were pretty cool. The following year I couldn't take BC based on the schedule, but I would drop into his office every other week or so to hang out, talk about what stuff I'd been working on independently. More often than not we'd start digging into some code and two hours would have passed before I'd leave, at which point I'd go back to whatever class I was supposed to be in (armed with a good excuse note). As a rsult of this I polished my skills, got access to a whole lot of the school, and got some really good advice about how to succeed in the business. I still talk to that teacher, ten years later.<p>Most important, thought, is enjoy yourself. Hang out with your friends, pick up some hobbies, hook up in the park, steal your parents' booze, make fixable mistakes. You will never be a kid again, and the marginal value of one more year of ""real life"" isn't much.",1252296411
808554,comment,808468,808468,0,0,petite,,,"If I could offer my own experience, I had a similar situation my junior year of highschool. I chose to stay for my senior year. At that point, there was no academic reason for me to stay in school, so I had actually loaded myself up with courses from a particular teacher simply so I could spend more time with him in classes (he was our schools CS teacher, so although I was in classes ranging from AP Comp Sci to Math for Seniors II [low level math], I spent my time being mentored in comp sci). I also spent alot of time in the art room. Otherwise, I had only been in that school district for about 2 years, so I did not have many relationships with any of the other students.<p>Basically, I think what was positive about my experience was that I was able to spend time with an experienced programmer (he unfortunately left the following year, but he had years of experience building businesses and had a doctorate in CS, so it was pretty awesome). But honestly, if that teacher was not there, it would have been a total waste of my time. Highschool sucked for my social experience, and it was mainly in college that I felt I found my place amongst my peers. Freshman year in college was pretty much that same as highschool regarding the people (and I went to a tiny private tech school), but as I got into the later years, it was definitely easier to find people that I wanted to surround myself with (motivated, smart people). The courses were hit or miss, some were really great, others were a waste of time, but unlike highschool, these courses were usually only for an hour a week. And of course, there's tons of organizations and clubs to join, whether it's with the school or the town the college is in.<p>So really, if there's something you think you wouldn't want to miss out in a last year in highschool, whether it is building a relationship with someone/some group of people, or taking some particular classes, I'd stay. But if there's nothing there for you, move on. You'll spend the year bored and annoyed that you are wasting 6 hours of the day essentially locked up in a building, when in college, you'll be able to go on to more interesting things in a less restricted setting. Or if you take the year off, you'll have free time to do whatever projects you want to, or go to random places.<p>Good luck with whatever you decide ;D",1252296321

I don't have peers, and it pisses me off sometimes. But that may not be the case for you.\nIf I had a group of like-minded, intelligent, and ambitious people to hang out with, I would probably be looking forward to this year.<p>And surely there's something to be said for learning how to do things before you're expected to do them right... I think, in my case, that's especially true of relationships. I need this year for social development, even if my intellectual development will suffer a little.<p>You, however, would appear to be more motivated than I am. If you can seek out a college course load in high school, in whatever area you're interested in (that is, without too many fluff courses), then gaining the extra year of social development would likely be beneficial in the long run --  no downside.<p>Putting myself in your situation, I would want to skip the year. What I should do, however, is NOT skip the year.\n(I had a similar debate about skipping 2nd grade, except that I didn't really know how to weigh the possibilities back then. (I didn't go for it.))<p>As tsally suggested, I would definitely try and find a college professor to work with. Do research in your field of choice. It's more interesting than lit homework, neh?<p>So I'm not really sure why I would be qualified to give you advice. Feel free to ignore. =)",1252296049

You can put some color, some thumbnails on a list, but in the end, it's still a list.<p>What I find much more attractive and intuitive, when it comes to news, is a real front page, that echoes the old print newspaper front page, but pulls in extra real-time information boxes from other parts of the paper.  There is a clear idea of a headline story, the size of each summary is varied, and it's full use of 2D space, instead of just going linear straight from top to bottom.<p>What I'm thinking of in particular is the New York Times <a href=""http://nytimes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nytimes.com</a> ; since its last major redesign it has become very attractive and I have found myself spending more time clicking around within the site whenever I read it.<p>For comparsion, check out this old twin-list front page version of NYT: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20031203020804/http://www.nytimes.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20031203020804/http://www.nytimes...</a><p>This does also have to do with their strategy for fighting the aggregators (so it's not just a design question): 1) writing their own blogs and 2) syndicating blogs where they are short.
