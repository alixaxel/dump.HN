The price of a room slightly bigger than a double-size mattress is $150/mo, for a pretty central location.  YMCA membership for $40/mo for your running water, and bam, an apartment for < $200/mo in Manhattan.  Sure, it won't be cozy, but I wonder whether it'd be feasible to have crazy-cheap housing like this.",1252292316

Either way you save a year, but in college you'll be older and able to make better decisions. You need to give yourself time to grow. :-)<p>If your school doesn't have any more AP classes, study for the tests yourself.  You seem like you're smart enough.  I knocked off a year and a half of college through APs.  Two of my friends did the same. One is graduating a year early and taking a full time job in California, one is getting a masters in four years, and I'm getting a second degree in four years.  Having an extra year in college means a lot more than having an extra year in HS.<p>In addition to doing the AP tests next year, see if you can work with a professor at a local college once or twice a week.  They'll write you a pretty powerful recommendation for college and you'll get some nice experience to boot.",1252291246

808463,comment,808199,808420,0,0,edmccaffrey,,,"> For example, I've never used the events feature that you find so important, and before I saw the NYT design I had no idea that you could create an account. If I didn't know it, maybe there are millions of other people who don't know about it either -- a good reason why the feature might be under-utilized.<p>And that proves my point.  The NY Times redesign dedicates lots of space to a new feature that relies on a feature that no one uses.  Craigslist is designed specifically to be anonymous to the point where you don't require an account.  Putting something that personalizes an account goes against one of the things that made them popular in the first place.<p>This reply shows that you are posting on the redesign without doing any research.  I don't use the events feature, but if you bothered to do any research before commenting then you would see that it is quite popular.<p>The most cursory research on what the posts are will tell you that most people use the site to get/get rid of something (e.g., jobs, items, sex), or for the community features.<p>A design that requires marginalizes one of these things to the least visible location is a disaster.",1252289859
