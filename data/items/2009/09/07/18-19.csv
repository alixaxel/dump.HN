809540,comment,809498,809498,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"A nice theory, but has it been tested? It assumes rational behavior on the part of the salesperson, not to mention assumes that the writer understands the motivations of the salesperson.<p>I once found a car salesman who was asking way too much for a used car on his lot. He refused to budge on price. I couldn't believe both that it was priced so high above market rates or that he wouldn't come down on the price at all. I kept asking, don't you need to go talk to your manager?<p>I decided that eventually he would come around and called him every day for two weeks with a low ball offer. Eventually the car sold to someone else for $100 above my offer. If rational behavior is to maximize the sale price, then this was not rational behavior. A simple counter offer would have closed the deal with me and netted an additional $500 for the dealer.<p>After that experience I've often wondered if there are other incentives for car salespeople beyond money. Maybe there's an opportunity cost of selling to a good negotiator when a bad (i.e. normal) negotiator might walk into the dealership. Maybe car salespeople just don't like being on the wrong side of a deal. Maybe they get harassed by coworkers when they strike a bad deal.<p>If the method works, I'd still be suspicious of the reasons. Maybe calling for 20 prices is a good idea just because one of them, independent of the others, really wants to get rid of the car.",1252348731
