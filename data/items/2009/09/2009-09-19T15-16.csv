The key thing to remember is that ""nuclear waste"" is just another way of saying ""slightly used nuclear fuel"", and by stockpiling it in dry cask storage, we're building up a huge fuel reserve for future generations.",1253375994

I think the CEO said they needed ~$30M to build it, ~$30M to market it.<p>> it was going to take at least $100 million, half to build the back end across thousands of servers and half to get distribution (maybe more with Microsoft spending $100 million on Bing advertising alone). What we didn’t plan on was the terrible downturn in the economy which made it impossible to raise another $50 million to get distribution (mainly through toolbar deals). In this economy nobody wants to invest that kind of money in a company that is pre-revenue, even if the net result is potentially a multi-billion dollar company.<p><a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/searchme-may-go-offline-tomorrow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/24/searchme-may-go-offline...</a>",1253375931

832059,comment,831421,831761,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"What about after the electricity market in California was ""deregulated"" a few years ago? Didn't my employer lose millions of dollars by having to shut down its factories during the ensuing rolling blackouts, which in turn were caused by successful efforts to create artificial scarcity and extort billions of dollars from the public?<p>But you shouldn't read too much into that example either. The lesson here is that buzzwords aren't always useful for understanding the world. The word <i>deregulation</i> means different things in different situations. Airlines are still a heavily regulated industry: Health and safety regulations, security regulations, labor regulations, international treaties, state and local regulations. (You think you're going to be allowed to launch a jet helicopter from your suburban backyard? Your neighbors think otherwise.) But there was a moment when a few of those regulations were removed or changed in a useful way that permitted the market to work better, and that event was <i>named</i> ""airline deregulation"".<p>Which does not imply that every action called ""deregulation"" is going to be equally successful, or even that such actions are especially similar to each other. The devil is in the details. What matters is what the regulations are, and what the situation is.",1253375785

832048,comment,831817,832007,0,0,gizmo,,,"Aside from those three? C and C++. Those libraries are not ""batteries included"", but they are plentiful and very mature. I like the ""batteries included"" part of Python though.<p>- I don't know if Python on the JVM is stable. Last time I checked Ruby on the JVM and .NET was in its infancy.<p>- They're not big breaks, and they are, as you say, discussed on mailing lists. The difference is that with a JAR file you can upgrade Java and you _know_ that the JAR will continue to run. With Python the only guarantee you have is that one of your libraries is going to throw an exception at some point after you upgrade. Essentially, you have to keep track of every library you use, and you have to check if it's compatible with the new point release.<p>- Not forward. Merely backward. Backward compatibility is offered by JAR files. You compile it, and even if the language changes the JAR will stay in place. Because the Java VM is stable you don't have to worry as much about precompiled libraries. I don't think Java is the solution to the world's problems, but at least old JAR files still run on modern JVMs (afaik). You can also design a language grammar in such a way that you leave room for future extensions. That is, to only make previously illegal statements legal. To change the semantics of legal statements (except for the rarest of corner cases) is, I think, a bad (but tempting) idea. You can have forward compatibility if you guarantee that code that uses new features won't compile or even attempt to run on an older interpreter. Essentially, if it runs it works. That is a hard guarantee, and the kind of thing you can build on.<p>> Define stable? That the language grammar doesn't change. Or more generally, that every version of the interpreter can flawlessly execute code written for version n - 1. Take Python: print used to be a keyword, now it becomes a function. I think it's too late for that kind of change, and it's only a minor blemish in the language anyway. You can't upgrade to Python 3 until every single library on your server has been updated. The number of man-hours this will take is staggering.<p>When you're actively developing in a language, these changes are only a minor nuisance, and upgrades come with a bunch of goodies. 10 years down the road you just want things to run, and with Python the only way to guarantee that is by deleting aptitude.",1253375069

There are a couple of 'real' reasons for denying corporations free speech: the government may want to more tightly regulate truthfulness in corporate speech, since the immunity we give corporate officers prevents us from suing a spokesperson if they lie outright about their product. Another instance where it's important is the subjet of the case at hand: election law. Corporations want to double dip, allowing their officers to give to the legal individual limit and then give again anonymously under the corporate banner. And of course, the immunity doctrine helps shield the officers in the event of campaign finance chicanery.",1253375015

The big transition to Python 3.0 is still ahead of us. I'm using python since 2.3 and the path to 2.6 has been much less troublesome here than CPAN or the jar interdependency hell have ever been.<p>I especially find your claim that Perl is ""stable and reliable as hell"" amusing.

832034,comment,830660,831068,0,0,vannevar,,,"""And how would a corporation publish a prospectus without the right to speak?""<p>Bear in mind that the corporation is free to do anything that isn't prohibited. What we're talking about here is whether a corporation can avoid a legitimately-enacted regulation by claiming immunity based on a fundamental human right. Corporations can go right on publishing prospecti. And corporate officers are immune from liability (except in certain extreme cases of wrongdoing).<p>This will be the case as long as government (ie, we the people) decide it's in our best interests. If for some reason government (again, us) decide it's no longer in our best interest, then we can prohibit publishing a propectus without fear of violating some imaginary entity's rights. We can already prohibit the formation of corporations entirely (ie, withdraw the privilege of immunity that corporate officers enjoy), so it is simply silly to say that we can't regulate them on some bizarre human rights claim.<p>The reason this comes up in the election context is that corporations want to double dip: all of their personnel can give to the individual limit, then give again in the name of the imaginary entity. It's a shell game, and it's good to see Sotomayor is smart enough to see it.",1253373702
