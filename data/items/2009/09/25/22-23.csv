Specifically, if those VC's get early and in-depth looks at these companies and choose NOT to invest, it would be a negative signal to other investors.  By spreading this across a large number of VC's, this potential is diluted.<p>The investors in Seedcamp are well known and respected investors... they're not ""small time"" with ""very little experience"".

844625,comment,843512,844450,0,0,Goladus,,,"I never said that code wasn't readable at all.  But it's more complicated than the lua code and not as easy to read.  I've never used Lua in my life but barely have to think about reading it.  The questions I do have are keywords that are easy to search for in documentation.  With the perl, I have to double-check and make sure there's nothing funny going on, and that is a VERY simple piece of code.  If you look at another function in the same program (which I didn't use because the lua version is recursive which you could do in perl if you wanted), you'll see some non-obfuscated perl code that is a much better example of the pain of reading perl if you are not familiar with its idiosyncrasies.  Not only do you have to trace through every step of each loop, you have to figure out what the double-asterisk syntax means and the bracket syntax.<p><pre><code>    sub bottom_up_tree {\n        my($depth) = @_;\n    \n        my @pool;\n        push @pool, [undef, undef, -$_] foreach 0..2**$depth-1;\n    \n        foreach my $exponent (reverse(0..($depth-1))) {\n            push @pool, [reverse(splice(@pool, 0, 2)), $_]\n                           foreach reverse(-(2**$exponent-1) .. 0);\n        }\n        return $pool[0];\n    }</code></pre>",1253919485

It should be trivial to back that statement up with evidence. You refuse to do so, and in doing so reframe your original point to the <i>substantially</i> weaker statement ""temps have been falling since 1998."" That latter assertion is indeed trivial to support: here[1] is a data set that supports that second assertion. You will note the central point that the narrowly-framed question can be true while the broad implication can be false.<p>If you are going to stand by the statement ""global temperature is falling"" I would again ask for a citation.<p>If you cannot or will not back up your assertion with evidence, please do not couch them in the terminology of fact.

That's a real sense in which a decision can be made. At each point in time we choose to do one thing from among the infinite possibilities available to us. And in making the decision to do that one thing, we are making the decision <i>not</i> to do any of the other things, even if not consciously.<p>I don't know where you're coming from with the ""inaction is always our default position"" thing. What do you mean when do you say ""default""? Do you mean that we should (oof, I hate to bring ""should"" into this) sometimes maintain the status quo even if doing so doesn't have the highest expected outcome for us? Do you mean that we should sometimes maintain the default even if the expected outcome of doing so is <i>dramatically</i> lower than doing something? (I'm gonna go ahead and assume that this isn't what you believe, but if it is, our argument has to end here, because the only response that I've got is, ""Well, that's really stupid."")<p>Because I would argue that that's the situation that we're in with global warming. I actually agree with you that the scientific establishment should be treated with substantial skepticism. But I also think that global warming is <i>probably</i> happening, and through applications of logic I've decided that reacting to a fictional global warming is SO SO much better than not reacting to a real global warming that we'd be insane to choose inaction as long as there's still some non-infinitesimal probability that global warming's happening.<p>You seem to think that you have an ace in the hole with your argument that our society supports an ""innocent until proven guilty"" approach. In fact, I am both a believer in the ""expected value"" approach to choosing a course of action <i>and</i> an ardent defender of innocent-until-proven-guilty. This is because the downside of convicting an innocent person is dramatically larger than the downside of letting a guilty man free -- not only because locking up an innocent guy for 40 years is much worse than letting some embezzler get away with it, but because every time our legal system sends an innocent person to jail the public loses some faith in it, and faith in the legal system is one of the most fundamental elements of a stable and happy society.<p>Okay, I think I'm done. I'm pretty damn sleep deprived at the moment, though, so if I missed anything please point it out and I'll address it later.<p>*Not a criticism.",1253919122

At worst, I am venting, though I am trying to make a point.<p>The reality is that I am annoyed at having to deal with perl (actually am using DBI.pm; written by the guy who created the original slideshow) and am annoyed to read him ""BUSTING!"" a Perl readability myth without even understanding why Perl is hard to read in the first place.<p><i>You could have written the Perl code very similar to the Lua.</i><p>No, in fact, you can't.  You can't use parameter lists in perl.  You can't use variables without context.<p>And even where you can, this particular example which I just pulled up completely randomly wasn't written like lua.  Which is what life is like when you are surrounded by perl code and are not a perl expert.  Here's real code I was annoyed to have to read:<p><pre><code>    ABC::Myclass->find_or_create({thing => $thing->itm, otherthing => $x->itm});\n</code></pre>\nDouble-colon, hyphen-arrow, equals-arrow, variables with context specifiers, curly braces, and parentheses all for a simple library call.  Curly braces normally mean a block of code, but here it means we're defining a hash.  Double-colon and the dereferencing symbol mean different things, but I don't really have to care about that, it's just visually distracting.  With python syntax it might look like this:<p><pre><code>    ABC.Myclass.find_or_create(dict(thing=thing.itm, otherthing=x.itm))\n</code></pre>\nIf you don't remember what dict() does you can look it up.  Alternately:<p><pre><code>    ABC.Myclass.find_or_create({'thing' : thing.itm, 'otherthing': x.itm})\n</code></pre>\nNote that in Python, curly braces are the standard way of defining a dictionary literal and are not used for anything else, as one can determine by searching for '{' in Python's context-free grammar: <a href=""http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/ref/grammar.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/ref/grammar.txt</a>.<p>To determine that those curly braces in the perl example defined a hash, you have to root around in the docs looking for curly braces until you stumble on something that discusses hashes rather than code blocks.<p><i>All that is anyway dwarfed by the language specific libraries you use, as soon as you do something interesting.</i><p>I would agree that by the time you are neck-deep in a gigantic perl project then all that trivia will come second-nature.  I have never done a gigantic project in perl.  I have read lots of code various languages, though.  Perl and C are the only ones where the language itself gets in the way, and C is really not that bad.

844525,comment,844133,844133,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is silly for a few reasons. For one, click through rate and conversion rates are not only a factor of the displaying website, they're a factor of the ad and where the click through lands. For a publisher CPC is therefore often impractical because they have no idea what that will convert to in terms of sheer dollars, given that a poor ad will produce far fewer clicks with the same audience than a good one. (And the distinction between the two is not always easy to tell without a/b testing.) With CPM you know exactly what you're going to get paid.<p>As an advertiser, CPM is fine too because if you're at all competent and do some basic testing you can build an above-average engagement ad and effectively get a discount. If your ad produces 10% more clicks than everyone else, you can bid more to get the same ROI. This is often easier than you'd expect. I buy all of our Facebook ads via CPM because we've figured out some great ways to get higher click throughs, and roughly what CPMs you need to bid at what times for what demographics and keywords to max out your budget as efficiently as possible.<p>Also, all advertising is basically CPA-by-proxy so it's not really that relevant to the advertiser whether they're paying by CPM, CPC, or CPA. When I buy an ad somewhere (as I frequently do) I may pay CPM, CPC, or CPA, but I'm simply converting them all into CPA in a spreadsheet because that's the way to get ROI which is the only thing I care about. If I have to spend 50 cents to make a buck, I'm ecstatic, but if I have to spend $1.50 I look elsewhere.<p>If the publisher uses some shady page-view enhancing technique that doubles page views but doesn't impact clicks at all, that's fine. I just will end up paying half the CPM (or moving elsewhere) because that converts to the same CPA in the end. The market values ad slots in terms of pseudo-CPA, so the publisher can't really boost their revenue in the long run without boosting the advertisers'.<p>All shifting from CPM to CPC or CPA really does is switch the party taking the risk from the advertiser to the publisher. It's pretty easy to see why publishers don't want to do that. Advertisers really don't want it anyway because it's harder to budget when you don't know how much you're going to be paying today.",1253916164
