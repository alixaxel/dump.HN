I just would want to avoid making them believe that school is the only thing that matters.<p>I acknowledge that it is necessary to learn putting up with unloved tasks - I am just not convinced that learning that has to take 13 years (length of school in my country). Maybe a couple of years of boredom could be shaved off without a great loss.<p>I would certainly be <i>very</i> interested in making my kids become autonomous learners and achievers. Just, as I say, the school metric does not mean very much to me. In the best case scenario I hope to teach them how to cope with school without expending too much energy. I think I would also encourage them to do all sorts of voluntary school projects they can possibly do (like writing for the school magazine, making movies, drama, science projects, whatever).

834475,comment,834088,834327,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Soft iron is affected by magnetic fields, but does not create a magnetic field of its own.</i><p>Well... yes and no.<p>Iron is <i>ferromagnetic</i>. If you look carefully at this word, and know a little Latin and/or a little chemistry, you will see that it was basically invented to describe iron. (Although nickel, cobalt, and other elements and compounds are also ferromagnetic.)<p>Individual iron atoms have a magnetic moment, which is to say: they are tiny magnets. They both create a magnetic field and respond to other magnetic fields. And when iron crystallizes the atoms which are next to each other tend to align their magnetic fields.<p>However, the typical iron-containing crystal has a large number of individual magnetic <i>domains</i>. Within a domain all the tiny magnetic iron atoms are aligned with each other, but each domain is randomly oriented with respect to the others. Thus, the tiny magnets tend to cancel out, and outside the iron we don't see it creating a net magnetic field. However, if you <i>apply</i> a (nonuniform) magnetic field to the iron it gets attracted, because the individual atoms do respond to magnetic fields even if they aren't all in line. [1]<p>If you apply a magnetic field to the iron -- preferably a strong one -- possibly together with a bit of heat or some banging with a hammer, you can encourage its magnetic domains to realign themselves and produce a piece of iron that has a net magnetic moment. Now you have a magnet.<p>This is what the bacteria are doing. Like most biological things, they are capable of taking iron apart to its component atoms and then putting those atoms together again, so this isn't especially astonishing behavior.<p>The point of the oxidation, to create magnetite, is that a magnetite crystal bonds the iron particularly tightly, improving the odds that the individual atoms will retain their orientation. As you know, a rod of pure iron isn't very stable: It tends to turn into iron oxide all by itself, then flake apart. We call that <i>rusting</i>.<p>--<p>[1] Of course, in the real world pieces of iron do tend to have a net magnetic moment... because they crystallize on the Earth, and the whole Earth has a magnetic field. But the Earth's field isn't very strong, so the orientation effect isn't very strong either.",1253537682

834465,comment,834267,834399,0,0,yardie,,,"I hope you don't have kids. Whether you do or don't like school is immaterial. The fact is, schools take up a majority of your kids' time until they graduate and get a life of their own. By default, you should be interested in what your kid is learning. No one is asking you to sit in class 8 hours a day, but at least get to know what it is they are learning. If my kid takes an interest in music, I'm there, wrestling? me too, football/soccer/hockey? I'm game. God forbid I have to get up from the keyboard because junior wants to go to the park.<p>As for rote learning. Every other nation has stuck to rote learning or some form of it. It's only the US that has taken a method of education that has worked for hundreds of years in many nations and manage to completely fuck it up. And every few years some academic will invent some new form of learning, convince the school board to buy into, and then after 10 years of ""experimenting"" on kids they might have gained/lost 0.5% on the academic test compared to rote learning.<p>I'm not sure where the skill of learning will be replaced by another, except maybe unlearning. Rote is just a baseline, if you can't work your way through a basic problem set then you certainly aren't qualified to handle something that might require a bit of brainpower.<p>I hope your still young because you'll realize, after many years, that in high school no one truly fit in. That is why John Hughes films (RIP) and shows like Freeks and Geeks were so popular. Everyone was awkward and that was the point. High school is a microcosm not a career, there was no skill to learn there.",1253537262
834464,comment,834400,834400,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I tend to agree with the comments about intentionally controversial headlines, but the article itself was excellent. If you haven't actually read it, please take the time to do so.<p>I think in the end, the author really nailed it. The important question is, ""Is Java dead for me?"" I would not use Java for a new personal project (and probably not for a work project either unless the libraries were needed). I do not have a clear replacement in mind... Python stands out the most.<p>My biggest problems with Java are the compilation step (admittedly not that big a deal with an IDE, but I don't always like to use an IDE), the insistence on objects, and most importantly, the lack of first class functions.<p>A new issue that has come up for me in comparison to Python is constructor overloading. In Python, constructor overloading is beautiful because of args and kwargs. In any C-family language (including Java here), it's horrible. With small objects where inheritance works well, the constructors in other languages can get unwieldy fast. In Python, they're always concise. I also love keyword arguments in general. It can make code much more readable, especially when using something like wxPython, where the parameter lists are long and otherwise would be quite vague.",1253537198

There are European White Jews (They are the Jews with elevated IQ, Ashkenazi), African Jews, Oriental Jews, and so on.  You can't say that Jews are not white or Jews are not black.  You'd be surprised by the number of blond hair, blue eyed Jews in Israel.  There are Jews with a Jewish characteristic, but just as many without.  There are also non-Jews with Jewish characteristics.  In my Jewish circle, they all claim to be white, and that's what you'd call them, you'd never know any difference unless you found out that they go to synagogue.",1253537154

Even more so in a browser where the Ui is mostly selectable text and graphics anyway.I'm quite happy to have to specify that an element is dragable, and that elements can't be dragged otherwise.<p>It also makes sense that when you drag it over a potential target, that target gets to decide if you can drop that particular item or not.

834460,comment,833425,834167,0,0,spencerfry,,,"That's what you might think at first. And that's exactly what I perceived to be the case. But as someone who frequents 2-3 networking (tech/startup related) events a week in NYC for the past three years, that's actually not true at all. We want to talk about things outside of our daily grind first i.e. our hobbies, where we like to eat, what we do in our off time, etc., and where/what we work on will work its way in with time. Why the rush? You're (hopefully) trying to make a friend not pitch a random stranger that will forget you the next day if all they hear about is your company.<p>You don't have to believe me, but I went from knowing nobody in the NYC tech community three years ago to knowing everyone. My initial approach was going up to people and asking ""Hey, I'm Spencer, what do you do?"" and playing the whole back-and-forth like a recorded conversation. That gets you a routine glazed over eyed response. I then started getting to know people and them getting to know me and everything flipped and I've now made dozens of friends for life where we now get together outside of work, go to each other's birthdays, know each other's girlfriends/boyfriends, go on vacations together, etc. And this all changed when the conversation shifted to being more about the people than only what we did for a living.",1253536965

While there is this attribute in Mozilla (and a CSS style in Safari), right now, the formalized way to enable dragging is to disable the default operation (which is starting the text selection process).<p>I don't think this is such a problem.<p>Maybe I'll come back later and comment on other parts of this rant.",1253535199

Most of what I've found has been written for journals or books (the Appel compilers book above, _Purely Functional Data Structures_ by Okasaki, etc.), not blogs.
