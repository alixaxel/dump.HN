I couldn't (or rather, didn't) find it because I thought the indented bits under the Tarsnap label were telling me which things were included on the page I was on.  I know, for example, that I saw News there.. and also News included just above the fold of the page I was on.<p>In fact, I suppose realized later that they were sub-menu items.  When I went to the Design page and clicked on the Security link, I recognized that the menu on the left changed.  I'm pretty sure it would not have occurred to me to click on them directly, however.<p>I spent maybe 90 seconds trying to find info about your work and the company, unsuccessfully.

I'm in a business right now where I buy a LOT of locally grown fruits and vegetables --- often 1000 lbs a week. I'm in the Bay Area, and I buy at the farmers' markets direct from the growers.<p>Probably 2/3 of what we buy is certified organic, 1/3 'conventional'.  Everything is local, and I'm pretty sure that everything we buy is better than anything flown in to the organic section at Whole Foods.  And I'm definitely sure that the certified organic produce is not uniformly better than the non-certified.  The differences farm-to-farm, variety-to-variety, and season-to-season are certainly stronger effects.<p>Perhaps you point instead is that there is a difference between a mass produced tomato flown in from afar and ripened in a chamber and a home-grown tomato picked at the peak of ripeness?  And that the tomatoes on the vine at $3.99/lb are often a better facsimile of the latter than the pinkish tennis ball at 99 cents/lb? In which case I'd agree with you.

While they do have some good points (it's harder to extract the second half of oil from a well, doing the math on the energy it takes to extract a barrel of oil, etc..) they are missing some very important points.<p>1.  Oil is not the only energy source.  Sure, it is by far the best and most convenient source for transportation, but outside of transportation, almost all our power needs could be met by electricity.   One can obtain electricity from many sources;  Nuclear fission being the source I am most excited/hopeful about.  Countries like France and Japan already meet almost all of their power needs with fission.<p>Also, many of the processes for extracting oil that are impractical if you use oil as the energy source to do the extraction, such as oil sands, become practical if you can use energy created by fission or coal or some other cheaper, more plentiful source.<p>2.  oil demand is not inelastic.  The automotive market of the last few years should make that clear.  Sure, we'd all like giant luxury vehicles, but this is constrained by economics.  Not only can we move from 12MPG SUVs to 50MPG compact hybrids, we can drive a lot less.  Sure, I am going to drive to work every day; until it starts costing me more than I'm making, at which point I will obviously stop doing so.  Oil demand is extremely elastic.  I bet that when gas hits the equivalent of $10/gallon (meaning, in today's dollars) you will see the bottom 40-50% of the us population no longer driving.<p>Sure, I'm not going to be turning my servers off anytime soon, but that's mostly fission and coal, with some natural gas thrown in because California is weird and rich.",1252883424

Not in the sense of an environmentalist lashing themselves to a tree, but in the sense of two neighbors attempting to win a battle about who loves and cares for their families safety more by buying expensive items. It might still be true that one of them loves their family more, but it is irrelevant to the battle; the real battle is who can buy more of the expensive shit to prove it to the person they are fighting against. This is a class conflict, above everything else that is going on.<p>And hence the problem with organic food; it provides a more expensive option that is, ostensibly: better for you, better for the environment, better for the farmers, better for the rest of the population, better for wildlife, and likely any of a number of other groups of people or things.<p>Do we know if any of this is true? No.
Do we know if any of it is false? <i>No.</i><p>Does any of this really matter? I'd like to believe it does; it does for me. But I'm not convinced it does for most people.<p>We can argue that we <i>know</i> the above is true, but the data we have is relatively limited. Even when we have data, it isn't entirely clear what it is measuring, because people have such confused definitions of what ""organic"" actually means. It has nothing to do with local farmers; it has nothing to do with the complete elimination of pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers. It just limits the types of substances used, based on <i>origin,</i> not known health effects; organic farmers are required to use ""natural"" farming aids. What we have to go on is gut feelings that ""natural,"" whatever we define that to mean, is ""better."" We also have the gut feeling that ""artifical"" things, whatever we define that to be, are ""bad."" This falls apart the instant someone points to something artifical that is better than the natural version -- as an example, please see Canola oil. But it can so fuel the senses that food we consider to be artificial will taste noticably worse. Does it? Who knows; we need more double-blind studies on this.<p>The problem is that the debate is working from an assumption <i>a priori,</i> that organic food <i>is</i> the better option, at least by the organic proponents. I am not pro-conventional food; I don't believe that most of the people who still buy conventional produce <i>are</i> that religious about it. They'd like to see data on both sides of the debate, and would like to sit down and have a reasonable pro-con discussion. But that can't happen when one side of the debate is screaming ""YOU'RE KILLING YOURSELF AND THE PLANET!"" It's like the guy who buys the more expensive car seat while screaming at his neighbor ""YOU'RE KILLING YOUR CHILD!"" The poor neighbor now has a choice: submit to the religious fervor of expensive car seats, or deal with the continued condescention of his neighbor.<p>We need to start having a rational discussion about this; I'm surprised, given the level-headedness by which we approach other topics, that we are so unabashedly biased on this one. Maybe it's just a vocal minority?",1252883335

Perhaps the difference is that in the public eye, the term doctor is synonymous with the qualification, whilst ""engineer"" has yet to reach that status?",1252883193

I've heard the 'economic frontier' argument before too.<p>But I don't think anyone thinks there's infinite amount of oil in the ground, so a peak of some sort, at some time is predicted by everyone serious, including the US Department of Energy.<p>Now, the Hulbert curve only has it's shape because decaying deposits are replaced by less expensive deposits elsewhere. So if there actually is a decline in total deposits, it's logical to expect the decline to no longer be exponential but more gradual. Indeed, a lot of the increased US production is coming from the increased price but it's still limited by the total amount in the ground at any price.<p>By the way, Moore's law has broken down for <i>processor speeds</i>. It hasn't broken for the other components but without increased speed, more transistors aren't necessarily instantly usable. This, again, won't lead to instant Armageddon but it's problem, Intel can see it's a problem and is working on improved parallel processing - but we know there are serious limits to this. Ironically, huge but not necessarily faster processor are what's needed to do massive simulations of the human brain. But these won't necessarily sell another round of Windows upgrades (at least not tell the simulations work convincingly...)<p>Anyway, let's not make hysterical doom-sayers lead us to act like there will be no problems in the future.",1252883186

Your first sentence is specious at best and not really that as even a priori it strikes me as poor logic.<p>Did you mean <i>no more likely [...] than heterosexual men</i>?<p>The best stats I can get are from ""The Demographics of Same-Sex 'Marriages' in Norway and Sweden"" however they don't relate particularly to the Midlands of England in the 1950s. They show that indeed about 34% of homosexual male registered relationships in their study have a 10+year age gap (vs. 9% for heterosexual marriage) but account for this by the greater age of those entering registered homosexual relationships.<p>So yes ""older men with younger"" is apparently a more common homosexual pattern [in modern Sweden amongst officially recognised partnerships] but that's not really relevant as we're not considering a population but a specific case - stats don't show anything certain about individual members of a population. So this apparent Ephebophilia may have been a more specific fixation (which was my speculation) - Turing's crush died tragically at 18, the lad he was arrested for having a tryst with was 19.<p>Like I said, it's speculation. There doesn't appear to be anything ruling it out.<p>Two side points:<p>""Normalcy"", yes statistics indicate ""normalcy"", the age gap is unusual. Deviations from normalcy often have interesting phenomena behind them - I had a BBQ this evening, that's unusual, the reason why we chose to sit outside and eat, cooking over charcoal, indicates something about my character.<p>I don't understand your reference to ""torturing young men"" what are you getting at there?",1252883018
