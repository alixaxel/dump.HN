I think less of a person when the perfectly legitimate use of 'literally' is a pet peeve of theirs.<p>If you read the article you would understand how there's nothing improper about the usage. If you knew anything about human language you'd know that there's no such thing as an improper usage. Sheidlower is a highly respected lexicographer and his entire article subtly acknowledges this fact. The speech community uses the word in a certain way, and all who hear it understand what is being said, without even consciously realizing it. There is nothing improper or wrong about how it is being used. The amazing richness of language is due in part exactly to the kind of mechanisms that cause drift such as seen with 'literally', and it's a testament to the endless versatility of the language mechanism. On the surface at which the average person contemplates it, sitting around in their armchair, language is not a rigid, logical artifice that makes the sort of naive sense they want it to.<p>Read Pinker's 'The Language Instinct' for a good discussion of the topic of language mavens. My pet peeve is people like you, who have pet peeves that are grounded in your own ignorance.",1233284252

If you feel that an English major college degree would be an enriching experience, then treat it as such, not as an investment.<p>From this vantage point it's comparable to taking a year off to travel (except 4X longer) or taking a couple of years off to volunteer. The question then becomes, can I afford it?<p>An interesting excercise is thinking about creative alternatives with similar costs. Say a parent was willing to give their 17-18 yr old child 100k in capital (maybe also help getting financed) + a 4 year stipend to start a business. Every cent must be reinvested. I'm not saying go start Microsoft. Maybe buy an ice cream franchise, mobile dog wash or double up & spring for an existing small business.

Pointing to any developed of this kind and saying 'this isn't uni' as if it means something really substantial is short sighted.

In my first job at a small hardware manufacturer, all we had was phone support (this was late 80's - early 90's, email wasn't widespread). The people who needed the most support often became very good customers because they knew they could rely on us to help them when they needed it. Almost <i>all</i> customers needed pre-sales support and a fairly high percentage needed tech support after purchase depending on what they bought.
