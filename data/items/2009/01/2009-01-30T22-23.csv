When a <i>system</i> consists of multiple components you need to take into account the security and the failure modes of each individual component as well interactions between those failures.<p>The operator does not need to be tortured, he simply needs to be told to cough up the salt or get tried on terrorism charges in a secret court. How many people will you find willing to trade their freedom for your corporate profits? More importantly, you don't know whether they will or will not fold, regardless of what they tell you at the job interview.<p>Next, if the operator is the only one to know the secret, what is to stop him from blackmailing your businesses? Or dying under the bus and taking the secret with him? You will have to introduce a backup person who also knows the secret and is also fallible in the same way, increasing your risk. The questions of loyalty and conflicting interests are collectively known as ""the agency problem"" - where agents act not consistent with the interests of their employers.<p>Given agency problems soon enough you will come to a point where someone with big stake in the company (like a founder or CEO) has to know the secret to avoid possible conflict of interest. Of course such person will also have a lot to lose and will be even more likely to fold under simple pressure such as arrest of their assets.<p>The idea with storing the salt out of jurisdiction also has weak spots in it: first, you can't use public CA because NSA likely has their own certs signed by all major CAs. You would need to roll your own SSL cert and deliver it physically. Next, there wouldn't be any machine-gun-toting people streaming into the datacenter - there will be a subpoena to the CEO and if he does not comply he will go to jail and lose his mansion. Is it possible to set data such that CEO can not fetch the data? Technically yes, but realistically CEO that does not control his secrets will likely feel uneasy about losing those secrets to an accident or an agency problem and so he will most likely try to assert control over said secret. At which point he becomes a point of attack.<p>Now, how does remote site know not to dispense secrets to a anyone who asks? It would have to ask requester for an ID and that ID will be stored on the (now confiscated) machine.<p>Then, who will administer the remote site? What are his legal and moral obligations? Can <i>their</i> government compel them to cough up the secrets on request of <i>your</i> government?<p>Further, RAM can and does get examined. There are consumer-level tricks with canned air that allow to reboot the machine while keeping RAM content intact for the next booted OS to chew on. This was at the heart of the recent TPM security breach (for some implementations of TPM). Also when machines are being confiscated they are not unplugged, there are products that allow to transport machine without losing power.<p>The system is complex and there will likely be bugs at the points where some components talk to some other components.",1233355207

458835,story,,,1,1,Spyckie,"Ask HN: CMU's Information Systems or Computer Science?",,"This question does not pertain to Information Systems in general, but rather the specific IS major at CMU. I would like some perspective so I can advise people about what they should take in college.<p>A little background; I'm a senior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Information Systems. In IS, you start off learning simple web development and project management (documentation and client expectation management) in your first 2 years, and in the beginning of the third year, you complete a full scale web application in Ruby on Rails. During the second half of your third year you do project courses where you get into groups of 4-5, come up with an idea for a website and build it. In senior year, you get a non-profit client who has an idea and you build it for them.<p>IS cannot compare in terms of curriculum to CMU's computer science program. In CS, you start off with an introduction to programming, and quickly get into both the low level (C/bit operations, memory management, etc) and the high level (data structures, advanced algorithms, etc). In your third and 4th year, you get into functional programming and machine level code, and either build a complete Operating System from the ground up or a complete webserver, protocols and all. CS also comes with a deep mathematical background and training.<p>However, CS is also very difficult, even to relatively smart people. All the classes are very time consuming and leave little room for other activities. The required CS classes go very deep into theory, much deeper than you would need to if you were just web programming.<p>When I first joined IS, there were hardly any hackers in the program - most people wanted to become project managers or technology consultants. However, I TA some of the 2nd year classes and a handful of the students there have a programming background and take IS because it is easier, gives you a lot of free time, and lets you do a lot of electives. They just use these electives to take the CS classes that they want, but have enough time to do side projects like creating their own websites. A group of them have already gotten together and build websites for fun on the weekends.<p>Granted, the majority of IS majors are not hackers at all, and the project management side of IS is quite a large aspect of the program (to accommodate these types of people). Also, the program doesn't push you very hard technologically or mentally.<p>Now that was a long intro - My question for you is what major would you suggest and why?",1233354803

  (+) (I x) (I y) = I (x + y) -- integer addition
  (+) (S x) (S y) = S (x ++ y) -- string concat

So I can now use the + operator on variables of type Dyn. If a value has the wrong tag, then a pattern matching exception is thrown. Once I get enough primitive operations defined, I will never really have to manually unbox a value of Dyn type again.<p>The one difficulty is emulating objects, because we would not have good syntax for arbitrary method calls. We could take a Smalltalk-like or Erlang-like approach, where the object takes message... the message being of type Dyn.<p>We should really look at dynamically typed languages as subsets of statically typed languages.

  tarsnap -c -f backup01302009 mysql_dir/<p>And you can just adjust the date each day.  It gives you the luxury of a full dump (anytime you want to restore, just reference backup01302009), but it only actually stores the deltas (making sure not to duplicate data that might be in backup01292009 or backup01282009 and so on). Tarsnap stores the data to S3 so that it's replicated in multiple data centers.<p>It costs a little more than S3 at 30 cents per GB, but it's metered out so that if you only use 1MB of storage, you'll only be charged 0.03 <i></i>cents<i></i> for that storage.  You <i>could</i> try creating your own way of doing incrementals, but I doubt you'd get it as efficient as Colin (the math genius behind Tarsnap) and so I doubt you'd get it cheaper.  Plus, this way you don't have to deal with it.<p>And remember, it's hard to fill up a database.*  As the Django Book notes: ""LJWorld.com's database - including over half a million newspaper articles dating back to 1989 - is under 2GB.""  So, if they were using Tarsnap, they might be storing 5 or 10GB tops at a whopping $1.50-$3 per month plus whatever the transfer of their deltas was for the month. Oh, and tarsnap compresses the data too.  So, maybe they'd be paying $1 or something lower.<p>* Clearly, if you hit it big time, you might not want to continue paying for tarsnap.
