448634,comment,448293,448611,0,0,jrockway,,,"It depends on how important you find purity and strict typing.  They are both useful, but the mistakes that experienced programmers make are not usually related to types.  Having recently started writing ""real"" software with Haskell, I've noticed that the type system doesn't save me a lot of time.  I still have to debug stupid errors, like calling a function with the right type signature but with the wrong effect.  By the time I've debugged and written tests, I haven't gained a <i>whole lot</i> over Lisp or Perl.  The advantage of Haskell is that it's as expressive as either of those, but executes <i>a lot</i> faster.  (One concurrent app we ported was very quick to use 100% CPU on Perl with just a few outstanding operations.  In Haskell, it gets to 10% CPU and runs out of file descriptors.  Wow!)<p>As for monadic computation in Haskell, it is very comfortable.   You can create an environment where you only have exactly what you need, which makes your program easier to read and reason about.  (No ""IO a"" signature?  This function doesn't do IO.)  It is not something I can't live without in other languages, but it does solve the intended problem very cleanly.  (Similar abstractions like monoids and functors are also nice ways of looking at their respective problems.)<p>The author of this article is right, though -- in a language with mutable state and without type inference (for return), monads are just not worth the bother.  They won't give you anything you don't already have.",1232850116

448625,comment,448293,448607,0,0,jrockway,,,"> the standard functions and macros illustrate that<p>You do know that nearly all of the standard list functions destroy at least one of their arguments, right?<p>People like to call Lisp a functional language, and you can use it that way, but it is really just a very nice imperative language.<p>Statements like:<p><pre><code>   (loop for x in some-list sum (* 2 x))
</code></pre>
are just more efficient in CL than the ""functional"" approach:<p><pre><code>   (reduce #'+ (mapcar (lambda (x) (* 2 x)) some-list)
</code></pre>
In this case, the LOOP is about 10x faster than the reduce, probably because it conses about 5000 times less memory.  CL is not set up the same way Haskell is, and hence you want to reuse data structures (or never create them) where possible.  This is very imperative and very non-functional.  (But I am not saying it's bad, LOOP (or ITERATE, which is what I use ""in real life"") is very easy to read and write.)",1232849438
