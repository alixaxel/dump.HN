417905,comment,416827,417833,0,0,wizlb,,,"Thanks for the history lesson, but it doesn't backup your statement that everybody uses Windows because ""everybody uses Windows"". Obviously there's not an objective bone in your body, but I'll continue the charade anyway just for fun.<p>Do you remember the lines of customers waiting to buy Windows 95 the week that it was released? Do you really think that was because ""everybody was already using Windows""? No. It was because of all the improvements. Nobody even used Windows 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0. It wasn't until Windows 3.11 that anyone seriously used Windows. And it wasn't because IBM handed it to them on a silver platter.<p>""Microsoft has always been a ""Me-too"" player...""<p>FYI, That's complete and utter bullshit. If they were only a ""me-too"" player they wouldn't have a huge R&D department. They wouldn't have been the ones to make the mouse wheel popular. They wouldn't have come out with the XBox. They wouldn't have invented LINQ. Do you have any idea what you're talking about or are you just a hater with a tin-foil cap on?<p>""Microsoft is alive because they have the best system for people in power to control those that they employ.""<p>Wrong. Microsoft offers the best platform for developers and users to control _the computer_. Where did you get all of this stuff about people controlling other people? You are starting to sound like a crack pot conspiracy theorist.<p>The reason that I use Windows, quite simply, is that it generally lets me do what I want, the way that I want to do it. And that's the same answer you'll likely get from anyone who enjoys using Windows. I can't say the same for Linux or for Apple although I have used both extensively. All that Apple offers is ultimate lock-in and Linux is way too fragmented and unorganized to be useful on anything but a server which is where I put it to use for my company.<p>I also love Vista _because_ of all the improvements. It runs on 3 of the HTPC's in my house because Vista Media Center pretty much kicks the ass of XP Media Center, Apple's Front Row, Linux MythTV or XBMC. So, there are definite improvements over past versions. Of course trolls like yourself won't have anything to say about that, will you?<p>""When Microsoft runs an ad campaign instead of fixing Vista bugs""<p>Gee, steal lines from Apple much? Exactly what bugs are you talking about? Can you even think of one? Like I said...I use Vista everyday and I don't have a problem with it, so no I don't think of it as a failure and I feel just fine defending it.<p>The horse and buggy metaphor stands up just fine because there were many failed attempts at making an automobile before someone actually did it. There's nothing wrong with failure. I love failure. I love failing. If nobody ever failed, we wouldn't know anything.",1230940190

The files are larger, but who cares? Most people are time limited, not transfer limited.<p>It's not inconceivable that a high bandwidth broker that trans-codes large static files into streaming media (especially if coupled with a quality down converter) would be beneficial for some uses.<p>However, the bandwidth and computational power required, plus the difficulty of explaining what it did and how to use it, plus the availability of services like Megastic, Hulu and iPlayer, would probably make such a service a good candidate for the dead pool.",1230939894

What you need is a theory of probability for price movements. Financial theory uses the normal distribution, which underestimates the likelihood of big crashes.<p>Mandelbrot says fractals give a better picture of market behaviour. They can be used to generate scenarios of price movements which give you different values for your portfolio. This is the  probability distribution of your portfolio. It tells you how much debt you can take if you want to be able to pay it back 99.99% of the time.<p>He makes an interesting analogy with the likelihood of a storm. Ships are built to survive waves of a certain height, and the highest probable wave is also calculated with a probability theory. The theory of waves had to be revised because a lot more ships were sinking than was thought to be likely. Someone came up with a better theory, and now safer ships can be built. In the same way, fractals could help build better portfolios.",1230937544
