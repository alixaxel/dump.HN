I meant, some of the implementation decisions seem arbitrary, and seem like they were made ""for the sake of being different"".<p>For example, Lua's use of two dashes for line comments, and  --[[ and --]] for block quotes.  That lets you remove the first --[[ in a block quote without causing the program to break, because the ""closing"" block quote is commented out at that point (because --]] is a comment at that point).  But really, that's so different from other languages that it seems like a liability rather than an asset.  That's what I meant by ""not <i>necessarily</i> beautiful"".

458698,comment,458034,458346,0,0,palish,,,"<i>... allocation/deallocation is really expensive ...</i><p>The cost of allocating memory in .NET (and probably other GC environments) is basically equivalent to the cost of incrementing a pointer, which is to say, basically free.  The reason is because the .NET garbage collector periodically ""packs together"" objects in memory, so the memory allocation algorithm essentially becomes:<p><pre><code>  result = _freeMemoryPtr;\n  _freeMemoryPtr += numBytesToAllocate;\n  return result;\n</code></pre>\n... in other words, since objects in memory are periodically ""packed together"" by the GC, there isn't a lot of memory fragmentation, so the allocator can simply allocate from the end of the heap.  It doesn't need to try to find a ""large enough free block"" within fragmented memory, because memory isn't fragmented.<p>At least, that is my understanding.  I could be wrong because I haven't investigated this thoroughly yet.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Generational_GC_.28aka_Ephemeral_GC.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_sc...</a>",1233349979

For my production sites, I usually have the following setup:<p>* Replicated Database with one slave in a separate data center just as disaster recovery (not a performance thing with the separate data center). Heartbeat for the slave(s) in the same datacenter so that it stays up.<p>* Nightly backups offsite. Used to be rsync, but recently thinking of using tarsnap for the ease of it (and S3 puts it in several data centers).<p>* Files stored either in a MogileFS setup or S3 in multiple data centers.<p>It doesn't have instant failover to another data center, but the offsite DB slave should mean no data loss beyond a second or two.  Ma.gnolia is a decent sized site.  Maybe they did have a decent infrastructure and it will only be a little while before they've gotten everything back.  Of course, after the fiasco with the blog site that used RAID as their backup system, I've started to think that many people don't take data as seriously as it needs to be taken.",1233349808

Read the wikipedia article, especially the last paragraph of ""Reliability"".  (Part of what's happening is that diesels have a smaller overall range, so even if the ""90% peak"" ratio is bigger, the width of the range is smaller.)<p>Also, diesel engines' fuel consumption doesn't vary as much with load as do gasoline engines'.
