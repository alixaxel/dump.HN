435703,comment,435382,435650,0,0,geuis,,,"I read so much stuff I got my sites mixed up. It wasn't here on HN. There were 2 stories I read in the last week that kind of tied together. The first one(can't remember where) was describing a hypothetical way to use the Casimir effect to propel something through space. There was a more detailed story in New Scientist that talks about using metamaterials and the Casimir effect to induce levitation at extremely small scales. The link I made in my mind was between those two stories and a third, which was about artificial gecko feet. The gecko has an extremely powerful grip because its feet have tiny hairs that extend down to the level where they are able to interact with the van der waals force of molecules on something they are touching. 
I think the stray thought I had was a) we can build metamaterials(think invisibility), b) we can build artifical materials that mimic and work like gecko's feet, c) if you can actually induce the casimir effect and generate propulsion-ish forces then:
Make millions of the little microscopic propulsion thingies, attached to structures like the gecko's, scale that up so you have trillions of little propulsors, and you might have some new fangled kind of engine.

My point is that JSON is capable of being terse, and XML is not.  XML attributes are unordered, so you have to use child nodes, which have to be named.  The best you could do is:<p><func><sig name=""byId""><arg name=""id""/></sig><body><return><call object=""document"" method=""getElementById""><args><variable name=""id""></args></call></return></body></func><p>Which is significantly longer than a positional JSON serialization.  XML is also harder to implement a parser for, and existing libraries tend to be difficult to use (python etree and ruby's implementations are a much better direction).  Now, someone else's raw XML is often easy to understand, whereas my array based JSON format would clearly require domain knowledge.  Because of this, I prefer JSON for small network requests that are consumed by scripting languages.<p>For larger, disk files, the overhead of XML is marginalized, and the extra formatting might help in hand editing and error correction.<p>As for Greenspunning, I think its a perspective issue.  The example was one of code serialization, so the lisp syntax is particularly well suited to the problem.  Programmers also have the domain knowledge, so the less verbose format is still easy to understand.",1232052375

Well if they spend one hour of staff time a year helping you then the profit margin is essentially shot.  That's why most cheapo shared hosts just offer crap service.  It's not worth it to even try.<p>That's why the momentum is definitely the direction of hosted services for most things people need rather than direct web hosting.

The first is the idea of quantum propulsion that was described in a previous link here on HN, and now this. I wonder, if this pans out as a verifiable way to detect the quantum ""foam"" of imaginary particles if it could also be used to to detect evidence of the extra microscopic dimensions predicted in string theory.",1232050397

In order for data to be code, some programming language implementation has to understand the data and be able to execute it, in which case the data was already code (or transformable into code) to begin with.<p>Another thing: what the article uses to distinguish Haskell from Lisp -- using functions in a way that looks like a data-structure -- is something I do in Lisp all the time. So this just isn't a distinction.<p>I'm not trying to pick on either Haskell (which I'd love to learn someday and which is obviously not Lisp) or the article (which makes some interesting points). It's just that most of what people say about Lisp in blog posts is kind of uninformed, and drawing this kind of distinction is harder than it seems.",1232050327
