They're cheaper for the employer, are issued more than one time of the year, and there isn't a lottery. There is more paperwork required, and you need to be doing something that the person can't learn in their native land. If you're doing something like game design, that'd be an easy one. There's other requirements, but check in with an immigration lawyer if you're an innovative company and hiring. I went through 80% of this process with an international hire.",1230850658
