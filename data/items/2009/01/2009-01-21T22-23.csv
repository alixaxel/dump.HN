RHEL4 is still supported, and will be for several more years, and never breaks compatibility.  RHEL has a seven year security update cycle (and a five year full support life cycle).  It's not Solaris style backwards compatibility, but it's more than long enough for any server I've ever managed.  The average server life in the web services business is right at three years.  That leaves four years of wiggle room.<p>Sun has occasional done major breaks in the past.  Not as frequently as Red Hat, but I have dealt with issues in the past.<p><i>Do you know they won't support you if you upgrade RHEL4 to 5 in-place?</i><p>I actually didn't know that.  I've done such upgrades numerous times (hundreds, at least) in the past and never had any problems.  On the other hand, I've attempted Solaris upgrades in-place, and been damn near beaten to death by the machine in the process.  I think I'd prefer to not have support and have it work, than to have support and need a helluva lot of it.<p><i>Solaris is not like it is because Sun doesn't know how to get new versions of their userland. Rather, they've chosen not to.</i><p>Yes, I know.  That's why it's so damned frustrating.  Sun has smart people working for them.  They <i>could</i> be building a leading edge operating system, but they aren't.  They're building an operating system that would have been embarrassing for a Linux distribution ten years ago.  Package management has been a solved problem for years...and yet, Sun still ships a retarded bunch of crusty old pkg tools and they recently added a clunky GUI to sit on top of it so they can pretend they've improved their package manager.  No matter how good a few pieces of the tech are, or how good backward compatibility is, if the user experience sucks, I'm not going to use it for the majority of my systems.  And, right now, the user experience on Solaris sucks.  Really, deeply, truly, and with enthusiasm, sucks.  I figured Ian Murdock being on board would <i>at least</i> get package management fixed (since Debian was the first Linux distro to have reasonably modern package management in apt-get), but that hasn't happened.<p>I guess we'll see if OpenSolaris can solve these problems...but, we're, what, two or three years into the OpenSolaris experiment, and you still can't just download an installable CD for the damned thing.  You have to run it in a VirtualBox, or jump through really complex hoops and be extremely selective about hardware.<p>Sorry, I actually jumped into the conversation to say <i>nice</i> things about Sun.

So it sounds like Cnet doesn't have an actual story until Red Hat goes up, or Sun goes down. They're just pushing a fairly cheesy, meaningless non-story to get in ahead of whoever is planning on writing the slightly less meaningless non-story about when Red Hat's market cap <i>does</i> surpass Sun's.",1232576145

443906,comment,399863,399863,0,0,bradma,,,"I think that there seem to be two schools of thought in the USA on what defines performance and competence.  If you follow the money you’ll see exactly the same thing happening in China happening here.<p>You've got wall street on the east coast and investment banks then you have the west coast with VC funding smaller businesses.  As the size of the businesses get bigger and they are no longer created to be sold in six years, the downside of failure becomes much much higher.  It's easy to assess performance in a small company and it's easy to kill projects that don't work in a small company.  When you're Ford and your Firestone tires kill some folks life is a bit different, funding projects is a bit different, cash flow necessary to stay in business when disaster strikes is different, the types of employees you need to stay in business are different. What does this have to do with education and credentials?  In these large companies it's much harder to measure performance and you get back to the old world view of who knows and trusts who. You're looking for a minimum level of reliability and competence since the downside of a screw up is much larger and the consequences are very different. I think these small companies are funded by people in large companies eventually buying them and those people agreeing to make the purchase I suspect went to Harvard and Stanford as did many of the VC partners who organized the funding.  At the beginning and end of the project, the money passed through the ibanking system.<p>Silicon valley creates tons of companies which are bought and produce nothing but cash for the VC and deliver no or very little incremental profit to the company which buys it. It can no doubt be produced faster with a small company driving the project, but if you step back and look at the quality of the investment, you have an entirely different way to measure performance.<p>That means that the VC founders got money from east coast investors and the executive authorizing the purchase came from the exact same social circle.  Performance metrics at the project level Paul Graham refers to are clearly met by any qualified professional from any school, but that employee amounts to an assembly line worker. If you measure performance in profit<p>I would suspect that the people who funded the startup attended top universities as those who bought it.  Access to this kind of sure thing bet is limited to a group of people who are trusted by the previous generation who were doing the exact same thing.<p>The USA is good at moving money around into investments that often have no value to the investor.  The founders and VC are out of the investment and the executives that authorized it are out of it long before anyone knows if it delivers real value.  To call this performance based rewards is a pretty narrow view of performance.  I think Paul Graham is brilliant, but he lives in a west coast piece of the puzzle which exits the process long before the end result of the pieces he’s created is known.",1232576084
