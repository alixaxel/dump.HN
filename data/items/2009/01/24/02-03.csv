Spectacular Gigantic Unbreakable Security Chains</i><p>It reminds me of when I used to work in Holland and would cycle to the train station to commute to the office.<p>The train stations in most large cities have HUGE bicycle-carparks, literally bikes as far as the eye could see, so people would generally get in the habit of parking in the same spots.<p>Anyway, I had a fairly decent bike compared to most others around i.e. I bought it new from a shop so it had yet to get beatup and was given a huge cycle lock like this.<p>My colleagues used to say there was little chance of the bike being stolen.<p>One day I came back from work and returned to my bike only to find someone had broken the padlock (and it was a tough padlock) and stole the security chain leaving the bike.<p>I told my colleagues the next day and they laughed saying this was not unusual, often the chains are desired more than the bikes.<p>I didn't know how to feel as I kinda thought it was bad my bike was not stolen, given it was a decent new bike (and worth more than the security chain). I was told there is a certain etiquette where it is ok to ""borrow"" old, beatup bikes (especially if it is a cold night and you need to get home and live far away) and many people do it, but taking a new bike would be ""stealing"", the thief however probably ""needed"" and nice big chain for his new bike.<p>I like to think there is a certain truth to that (atleast for the place and time I was there) and to this day it is one of my favourite memories of that country.<p>Anyway, remember having a big chain is useless without a very good lock!",1232765531

Rather than making the world a better place by making intellectual property free, you're putting it into the hands of the very people many in this crowd hate.<p>I'm not saying that intellectual monopolies/oligarchies such as those seen in the 20th century are sensible; I'm merely saying that the free culture is, quite literally, economically retarded.  Allowing creatives and intellectuals to pursue their art as a profession is one of the greatest accomplishments of modern society, I think; even better is the fact that you can pursue these things and make a significant amount of money which can be used to do lots of interesting things.  We really need to figure out a way to preserve this -- the balance of power created by wealthy creatives pushing initiatives that run counter to the aims of wealthy industrialists is extremely important (Bono not withstanding, of course -- kidding).",1232764475

Success for Twitter users is to get people to recognize their brand/personality and not so much piecemeal tweets. Just reading individual tweets of random strangers is boring. And if I wanted to read topical messages I would just use summize.<p>2) why is this engaging?<p>As Twitter increase towards more to conversational styles amongst its users, an out of context message is jarring. To the point where I have not much interest in perusing <i></i>your<i></i> site. In fact, if the person is interesting at all I would much rather just follow them. But a Twitter user recommendation engine this is not.<p>3) how do I know this is working?<p>The instructions to find the missing word makes it awkward. How do I know the missing word is because of the app in play or because the original Twitter user wasn't dyslexic? It's also too much of a chore to parse and reparse a 140 character sentence to see if it's broken. Brains don't work that way--we automatically self-correct sentence subconsciously.",1232763580
