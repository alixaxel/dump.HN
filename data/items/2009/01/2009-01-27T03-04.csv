When it comes to end-user software applications, I can't think of any problem that has been solved categorically (contact management, calendaring, browsers, word processing, spreadhseets).<p>That's why I would take the other comments in this thread with a grain of salt. True, nobody has solved content management -- BUT, the leading solutions have put in a ton of work to solve vast swaths of the problem space even if they haven't nailed the whole thing.<p>Wordpress, for example, while not the most architecturally elegant piece of software in the world, is an incredibly rich, powerful, and useable content management system. The plugin system enables a developer to extend the application in any number of directions, while the administrative toolset is sleek and sophisticated yet easy enough for hundreds of thousands of bloggers to use.<p>Okay, I didn't mean to turn this is into an ad for Wordpress (which I've used as a CMS on several projects, btw). My point is simply that your CMS would have to get very far advanced before it even reached the terrain where the problems that Wordpress has not solved lie.<p>I don't mean to discourage you in your project, but simply to point out the road might be more difficult than others make it appear. As a consolation here are a few areas that I haven't (in my own limited experience anyway) seen many CMSs nail effectively:<p>* Content versioning<p>* User commenting features (threaded commenting, ratings, user management/ownership of comments -- basically disqus's whole business is built on this lacking)<p>* Snippet management (tools to manage little copy snippets etc., not just pages/posts)<p>I'd be curious if anyone else had any specific features they felt were part of the ""unsolved"" problem set.",1233028699

I doubt the comment intends to convince us simply that this belief exists (we know it does, and that many people hold it).

  - periodic beeps while shooting video (use specific tones,
    people can then sell software to mask them in the

  - periodic beeps while video chatting, the guy on the other

    PIs and television news folks.

Many of them appear generic enough that any new codec would run a serious risk of infringing them. For example, one of H.264's major improvements over previous codecs is the use of arithmetic coding, and there's a patent in the pool concerning a ""method and apparatus for binarization and arithmetic coding of a data value"".<p>(Here's an interesting mini white paper about the codec patent situation: <a href=""http://www.vcodex.com/videocodingpatents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vcodex.com/videocodingpatents.html</a> )<p>Worse, there's the possibility of submarine patents that are not included in the H.264 pool. Qualcomm has already attempted to sue Broadcom for making H.264-compliant products that allegedly infringed Qualcomm patents (which Qualcomm had not disclosed when H.264 was being developed). They lost the case, but the US Court of Appeals specifically limited the scope of those patents' unenforceability only to products which are covered by a H.264 license.

451549,comment,451497,451540,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"To throw away Christianity is to throw away Western Civilization and much of our heritage. I enjoyed this bit from TFA:<p>""Arguably, the highest achievements of the human species have been motivated by that instinctive spirituality just mentioned. The great cathedrals, the precious heritage of religious art and music, are not only monuments to religious belief, but more persuasive testimonies to and arguments for faith than the disputations of theology. Have you ever read the story of the conversion of St. Vladimir, the founder of the Russian Orthodox Church? He was, as the account goes, a pagan prince of the line of Rurik; and an enthusiastic pagan, having built several temples. Yet he was not quite satisfied with his religion, and agreed to hear deputations of Muslims, Jews, and Christians each deliver their respective sales pitches. The presentations of the first two were rather arid, but the Christians (who had come from Byzantium) put on by far the best show, high mass with all the smells and bells, rich vestments, singing, the whole nine yards. Vladimir was convinced - any religion that was so beautiful had to be the right one (it also didn't hurt that it had the least restrictive dietary rules, and no ban on booze). Accordingly, Russia became Christian, and Vladimir a saint - all on the basis of his aesthetic judgment.<p>I suppose these anthropological and aesthetic reasons explain why many people remain culturally Christian despite an abundance of doubts and discontents. They aren't willing to dismiss the spiritual out of hand; they see more benefit than detriment accruing to society from religion in spite of their doubts (as did Jefferson and Franklin); and they find Christianity aesthetically appealing (as did St. Vladimir). They are therefore unwilling to discard it in favor of the barren and austere horizon offered by the crusading atheism of a Dawkins. For my part, I'll wait to see whether Dawkinsianity produces anything equivalent to Chartres, Handel's Messiah or Mozart's Requiem, the Pietà or the Sistine ceiling. When it does we may re-evaluate it to see if it offers anything worthwhile.""",1233026054

You can have profiles, blog, image gallery, status message, etc. Also get group discussion boards to collaborate and internal messaging.<p>I know you are not trying to be a social networking site, but in my opinion, my first thought is, ""hmm maybe I can just use a private ning account for managing a small team"".<p>I'm not saying this is right or wrong. What I am saying is that I think you really need to provide an optimal use case. It's one of the hardest things to do, but as an entrepreneur you need to explain your product and why it benefits the user in ONE SENTENCE. What problem do I have that this simply ..SOLVES. It is very hard, but this ensures that you can convey your product in the greatest light. Note that your customers are not hackers taking the time to give you constructive criticism, they will go to your home page, say ...""i don't get it"" and then click away.<p>All the best.",1233025713
