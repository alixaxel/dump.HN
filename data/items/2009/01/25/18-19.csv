Configuration, deployment, and all round administration skills are part of the tool kit that you need even if none of this is your primary responsibility.<p>I would also add JavaScript and Ajax to the necessary skill set.  If you are a freelancer or job hunting, JS, HTML, and CSS increase the number of gigs that you can tackle.  Even when the backend is your primary responsibility, you will often be called upon to do a quick fix in the other areas.<p>Farming out design is good advice, but often the HTML and CSS is not really usable, so you will need to know enough to make it work on your site.",1232909879

I guess the existing investors figured (in hindsight: correctly) that YC would boost the company sufficiently to make it worth what I can only assume must have been a lower valuation. 4% at $20k would put the whole company at $500k, and ~$350k had already been invested!

449354,comment,448780,449179,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"Hitokiri82 needs to take a more quantitative approach to accouning than simply saying ""a lot of money"". For example, there is something of a trade-off in consultancy that you can get more money for more esoteric skills, but you will get fewer billable hours per year. If a narrow speciallity pays twice as well, but you only get half the work, you will not be taking home any more money, and that extra spare time? You might need more than 100% of it to prepare for when the speciality narrows to nothing.<p>Hitokiri's key problem is to settle on his accounting treatment of his Plan B. At some point in the future the SAP gig will turn sour. Perhaps in five years, perhaps Hitokiri will need two years money in the bank to maintain his standard of living while he rebuilds his career. If that is the assessment, then Hitokiri has to save 40% less inventment returns. That makes it look a lot less lucrative.<p>The key point is that the extra pay has to cover both Plan B and compensate for any special unpleasantness in the work. You have to be very careful to avoid double counting the extra salary.",1232908602

All employers in Ontario require you to go through the process, but from what we've asked people the first year is completely and utterly useless (thank the ontario government!) and the second year is break-your-back hard because you basically have to learn everything in one year.<p>This whole thing is caused by the government allowing all forms of office administration (Medical, Legal, Realty, etc.) to group their first year together. This means everyone who takes any of these courses has to pay thousands of dollars and the colleges group multiple courses into one to save money.<p>The ironic thing is that legal offices are desperate for workers, my wife already has a job offer from one of our family friend's place.

449343,comment,449115,449115,0,0,markessien,,,"This is something that is going to happen very quickly:<p>You have a forest full of plants. These plants have insects living in their roots which are feeding on them. At some point in time, insects arrive and settle on the leaves of the plants. They start feeding, and the plants die on or two weeks later. So these insects move to other plants nearby - soon, all the plants in the field are dead, and then all the insects in the field are dead.<p>But let's say there is a single insect underground that feeds in such a way that the chemical composition of the plant is mildly changed from the standard plant. The above ground insects will avoid this plant, because it smells a bit different, and so this plant will be one of the last to die. As a result, it will be the dominant plan in the next generation of plants. In the next generation, the plant that emphasizes this trait will continue to win, and in a few generations, the evolution will occur.<p>This ties in with my theory that evolution can only occur under very high pressure, and it happens very suddenly. This slow evolution theory that is common now is wrong, in my opinion. I believe that mutation is common, but singificant changes happen only under immense pressure.<p>That's why humans are no longer evolving. That's why women still have to suffer at childbirth - midwives have removed the pressure.",1232907984
