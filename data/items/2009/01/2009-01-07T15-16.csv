(Actually, I think I can prove that.) The only thing that would change is that the ""lines"" on the equilibrium diagram would become ""curves"".<p>I think you can't. If you modeled real traffic congestion for this the paradox would not exist. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.<p>The ""real world"" examples listed on the page were not because of this type of paradox, but rather because in the real world it takes time to merge, so removing a merge point makes things faster.<p>But a road paradox structured like this one? I don't think you can. The whole paradox is because the T/x does nutty things as T changes (nutty as compared to the real world).<p>At the minimum I want to see f()+c.

And Phil Schiller's role in all this was to jump off a ladder into a stunt bag, holding the candy orange purse-looking thing, to show its sturdiness.<p>Do you think Steve Jobs would ever do such an undignified thing himself?<p>And this was what...  8, 9, 10 years ago?<p>Schiller is considered a joke. He always has been considered a joke. He looks and sounds more like he should be a cast member on Full House than a presentation guru.<p>Jobs claimed they were pulling out of MacWorld years ago, but went back on the idea for whatever reason. He doesn't have to ""sacrifice"" anyone. He's Steve Jobs, for crissakes.<p>Y'all don't have historical perspective on the man and the company. You can't make these kinds of assertions without it.<p>Note: Schiller has a tough row to hoe and he clearly works very hard to do a good job.

It's an idealized extrapolation of our less regimented society, true, but if you grow up as a poor black boy or girl in the ghetto, the forces that are going to keep you there far outweigh the forces that will allow you to leave. See Hurricane Katrina: most of the poor folk that didn't evacuate were too ridiculously poor to even afford to evacuate. The same goes with someone who grows up in a rural town; if they want to leave town and go to college or otherwise make something of themselves, all of the factors in their environment are working constantly against them. I'm tired of people born into privlege (me included) feeling that growing up in an environment where the only barrier to success is your own motivation somehow applies to everyone else.<p>I mentioned in another submission about how one of the greatest misconceptions of the past 50 years is that our environment is somehow completely unrelated to our well-being and the choices we feel we have. I'm not about to say people can start blaming their bad judgement on their environment, but the other extreme is no better a way of understanding our country.",1231342742

If he hadn't mentionned that he's an atheist, it could easily have come off as religious preaching.<p>Also: why did this get killed? I hope we don't lose the ability to discuss the effects of religion, independent of one's religious preferences.",1231340578

The DoD's money doesn't go on salaries for Infantrymen. It doesn't even go on rifles and boots and jeeps.<p>I'll give you a clue, how many planes do the Taliban have in their Airforce? How much does an F22 cost and how many of them is the USAF buying? What about the Al-Queda Navy, how many aircraft carriers they got? What does a Seawolf-class submarine cost? That's where your taxpayer dollars end up. Soldiers (and Marines) are cheap and if anything we need more of them.",1231340547

What's even better is that a Republican administration made the initial proposal for and has lead the largest bailout in US history.<p>I may lean to the right... but this letter (if real) just reads as a veiled threat to employees and not to mention it's really short on details... nor does it address the real problem: politicians on both sides of the aisle spend money like drunken sailors",1231340526
