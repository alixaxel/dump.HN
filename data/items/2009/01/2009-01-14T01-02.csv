Well, suppose you had asked me to pay a nickel to read this comment thread.  I value my own time at about a hundred dollars an hour.  I've already spent more than a nickel of time reading this thread, so clearly I should have been willing to pay a nickel to read it.  But the mental decision point on whether to cross the penny gap or not, plus the amount of friction it would take for me to authorize this transaction (fish out credit card, type in digits, sign in, click ""Are you sure you want to pay $.05 to this merchant?"", yadda yadda), is worth far more than a nickel of frustration to me.  That increases the cost of the content to me but it is revenue that <i>you don't capture</i>.<p>Rather than selling things for micropayments, do what essentially everybody does in this space: sell a microcurrency in macro-units ($10, $20, etc), and then make authorizations to spend the microcurrency as friction free as possible.  For getting over that penny gap on the first transaction, you probably want to give people a significant incentive to buy their first hit of microcurrency -- 100 dragon eggs for $5 instead of $10 like usual, whatever.<p>Clarifying edit: for non-Americans reading this comment, it might be useful to know that a nickel is .05 USD and a penny is .01 USD.

This one requirement now completely invalidates his rights to the invention he created; this means less incentive for people to invent.

cwe.mitre.org/top25/<p>MITRE maintains the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) web site, with the support of the US Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Security Division, presenting detailed descriptions of the top 25 programming errors along with authoritative guidance for mitigating and avoiding them. That site also contains data on more than 700 additional programming errors, design errors and architecture errors that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. cwe.mitre.org/<p>SANS maintains a series of assessments of secure coding skills in three languages along with certification exams that allow programmers to determine gaps in their knowledge of secure coding and allows buyers to ensure outsourced programmers have sufficient programming skills. Organizations with more than 500 programmers can assess the secure coding skills of up to 100 programmers at no cost.
