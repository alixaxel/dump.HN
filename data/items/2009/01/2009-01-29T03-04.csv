• Find a support group, even if it's just an informal group of friends;
• Seek employment counseling when available;
• Be professional in your job hunt;
• Network with other professionals;
• Take time to exercise during hard times;
• Spend valuable time with your family.<p>Ah, good! I was about to panic, become a hermit, be unprofessional in my job hunt, and avoid my family.<p>Okay, some of that advice is mildly valuable, but without additional detail, ""Don't panic"" is totally vacuous. Yeah, you're not going to be wrong, but it's not insightful either. It's why I typically avoid mainstream TV/newspapers - lots of unqualified ""Don't panic"" and ""remember to exercise"" type advice.",1233201545

Countless -- old, pre-internet -- psychology studies and case studies show this.<p>It doesn't have to be online.<p>Intentionally overcoming it is good for everyone. But. It's just the nature of the human beast.<p>And this Paul Carr dude is trolling - again - with this article, because he knows negativity sells.<p>And maybe he feels guilty about everyone thinking he's an asshole, but it's A) clearly his own fault and B) a habit he can't kick, because even this article has the same tone to it.",1233201447

I also found that when I was tired I would fall asleep instead of meditating since that's what my body needed.

Sleep and exercise are also good at reducing stress, but I have definitely found that meditation helps me to relax and reframe my perceptions.",1233201415

(Yes, some disks, especially the flash ones, support a lot more IOs/sec than others.)  If you're IOs bound, you either have spare disk space or can probably increase the amount of disk space at a sublinear price.  (1.5TB drives are <3x as expensive as 500GB.)<p>For some data transfers, AWS has a ""per operation"" charge in addition to a bandwidth charge.  The latter is proportional to file size but the former is not.<p>My application has a lot of processing costs.  Most of them are on metadata, not the images, so they don't grow with image size.  I also do a lot of stuff with ""thumbed"" images - producing them is a function of file size but storing them and moving them around isn't.<p>My model is different from yours in at least two ways.<p>(1) I'm estimating some things.<p>(2) I'm using AWS and GAE prices.  (I'm assuming the highest prices because if my app is getting enough use that I'm getting bulk discounts, I've got other problems.)<p>If I had a model that tracked my actual experience, I wouldn't listen to some bozo on a website....<p>FWIW, data in a db is significantly larger than the actual data.",1233200330

DANCE does.<p>- Tie everything you do to your personal, real-you identity? Too much, privacy concerns.<p>- Raise awareness about how being good to others is better? Since the dawn of mankind we've been trying.<p>- Mark it as an unsolvable problem? Nah, not here.<p>- Have somekind of ""boy scouts of the internet""? Give recognition with badges (achievements for you gaming folks)?<p>- Setup a website (this is an old idea I had) ""the-golden-rule.com"", where you post what YOU want others to do to you, and users can do these stuff to people they know, and brag on the website how they did it? And earn good-doer points?<p>- Slashdot moderation applied to random content? Imagine if you could select a DOM node (like Firebug's inspect) and label it ""flamebait"", ""funny"", which is sent to a central server, so your blog software can filter your comments not showing some? Or users can assign opacity to ""bad"" content? (I actually thought of this when I saw Snipd working)<p>Whatever it is, I think the solution goes around promoting good content, and downplaying bad. Just like in real life... bad people are cast aside, becoming pariahs. Yes, I am fully aware it'll be hard to determine what's good and what's bad. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?<p>But anyway, it would be cool to see some kind of tool along these lines.",1233198417

Tests for the class were multiple choice and given out on a computer.  Every student for some reason good two guesses for each question and there were five answers.  This meant that you needed to work with two other people and you could get all the answers right.  So during the tests you would hear. Fred - ""A"" nope. Stan - ""B"" nope, Jeff - ""C"" yes.  Then everyone would enter C for question one and then repeat.<p>It was quite hilarious actually.",1233198106

Interesting tidbit, no?<p>But my point isn't that people aren't flocking to ""streaming"" sites. It's that if you gave them the choice between a forced stream, like the way Netflix streams movies, or a file that downloaded as quickly as possible, persisted, and could be viewed as it came in if your connection is good enough, they'll take the second one every time. The only way ""streaming"" wins is when it has something that isn't available that second way.
