The answer is that sometimes I need my code to be very fast, and C++ has language features making abstraction easier than C or Fortran.

456391,comment,454218,456093,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>If its about just doing what you want to do, why are people who want to be like their friends mocked?</i><p>That's something every movement has done. Thinking musically, there've been ""fake rockers"" and ""fake punkers"" and ""fake rappers"". In high school society there are the poser cheerleaders and the poser emo kids and the poser writers and on and on.<p>Hipsters mock everything. For every hipster I know, there's a great deal of cutting conversations. When I first met the group of hipsters I eventually friended, in sophomore year, I got insulted constantly and told to shut the fuck up after essentially everything I said, because I wasn't ""saying the right things."" Hipsters tend to always have the most comfortable niche of friends. The group I'm referring to has remained the exact same since 8th grade, adding a few people and losing practically nobody. I became ""part of the group"" my senior year; now I'm sitting in class next to one of those kids, and I'll likely keep in touch for a long, long time. Hipsterism is founded on diversity of interest and wit, and once those people find each other it's hard to separate them. On the flip side of that, it means they're very unwilling to expand their group, because it takes a very particular sort of person. And because their method of conversation is constantly nitpicking and criticizing, it comes across as mockery pretty easily.<p>""Doing what you want to do"" has limitations, as does everything. It's okay to say that you cried when you read the diary of Anne Frank. It's <i>not</i> okay to be against homosexuality; that implies a closed mind. It's okay to be religious, <i>not</i> okay to be preachy about it. You can't be boring; you can't be tasteless. Taste is the tricky thing. You're allowed to be awkward, or act different from what's expected - you can cry, for instance - but you can't like bands that demonstrate tastelessness in music. (Pachebel and Nickleback are both bad.) You can't like bad movies (Plan 9 is allowed, because it's fun to watch, Mac & Me is great, but Epic Movie is a no). And while in a lot of groups taste is semi-required, in hipsterism it's all that matters.<p>That kinda rambled, so a summary: any hipster group is going to be closed to most outsiders, but the hipster scene is <i>allowed</i> to be nice and sensitive, which is a good thing.<p>The problem is that a lot of fakester hipsters exist, too, and it's kind of hard to tell which is which. A former friend of mine falls into the latter scene: he deliberately avoids popular music to seem edgy, insults people just to sound insulting, and wears odd clothing for no reason. The general rule of law is that if you call yourself hipster, you aren't. The people I'd call hipsters are all defined by how <i>un</i>hipster they are. They avoid the cliché of hipsterism. That's the point of the whole movement: you're supposed to just be yourself and do what you want, and the minute you start following trends just to be hip, you aren't. So there's where some of the mockery comes from. It's kind of like how the punks were all passionate, but their music all sounded very different. The ""punk"" sound really isn't. It's a washed-up, generic rip-off that ignores the rule of ""be yourself."" Hipsterism works the same way: the more generic it sounds, the less hip it is; the movement is about <i>avoiding</i> a generic center.",1233240891

Since the thread isn't credible this technically isn't assault.<p>On the other hand, if I shove a gun in your face and threaten to kill you then that very much is assault as my threat is very credible.<p>Some where in between is the line between assault and just being a dick, which isn't a crime.<p>This is often why many verbal assault cases aren't tried.<p>The other, unfortunate, reason is that court time is very finite.  Prosecutors can only take so many cases to court and prosecutors know that people will often make these types of threats for a short period of time and then just leave that person's life.<p>If that's the case then the situation often resolves itself and they don't have to take up their valuable court space with this case.<p>It sucks but that's the way things are:(.",1233239974

456341,comment,455891,455891,0,0,smoody,,,"I read it. Years ago. And at the time, it was one of the most influential books I had read. But it has its pluses and minuses like any book.<p>One plus that I remember: They apply Heidegger's notion of ""Readiness at Hand"" to software (Simple non-software example: A hammer does not exist when you're using it. At that moment, it's an extension of your body. A hammer only exists during a fail -- hammering your thumb, for example). That had a big influence on the way I design user experiences.<p>One minus: The book is sort-of building a case for a workflow system the authors were building that ultimately crashed and burned in a pretty big way. They odd thing to me was that, in reading their description of the workflow system, it seemed anything but ready-at-hand. It was very strict and regimental in the way it operated and required people to actively think about process flow (which isn't a bad thing, but I think it takes you off the court and puts your in the stands, so to speak). But, learning what doesn't work is, in and of itself, a form of learning, as we all know. And, sometimes things fail due to timing and it is likely the case that, back in 1987, it was way too early to approach businesses with such a radical approach to workflow.<p>I recommended it to people for many years and I still would.",1233238102

It can be a little bit dry, but it certainly tries to be comprehensive: It's like <i>Civilization</i> in that it starts with phalanx and then moves slowly forward through the history of strategy and tactics.<p>You might like the works of John Keegan, another famous military historian who takes a general approach. He's got a <i>History of Warfare</i> that's like a lighter-weight version of Jones -- I might recommend starting with that, actually. His one-volume histories of WWI and WWII are probably decent.<p>Keegan is British, so it wouldn't surprise me if his histories were heavy on the Western front. If you want the <i>actual</i> history of WWII you need a history that's more about the Eastern Front, which is pretty much where the war in Europe was actually decided. Unfortunately, the history on that subject lags decades behind, because the surviving Germans didn't exactly want to dwell on it and the Soviets weren't exactly forthcoming. (Many of the key Soviet figures either got disappeared by Stalin or lived under the constant fear of being disappeared by Stalin.) I'm not sure what the best current general history of the Eastern Front is, but I do know that the big Western expert on the subject is David Glantz, who has spent the last twenty years digging through formerly-sealed Soviet records of enormous battles that were covered up for years.  I'd probably start with:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Handbook-Eastern-David-Glantz/dp/097176509X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Handbook-Eastern-David-...</a><p>because I don't know any better and it comes up first on Amazon.<p>If you want something written by a gamer try the works of James Dunnigan, founder of SPI and author of a whole pile of famous simulation board games. I read most of his <i>Dirty Little Secrets of World War II</i> and it was interesting. A much breezier style than the heavy-duty military historians. And he's got books that cover contemporary military stuff as well as history.<p>Nobody should read about war at the 10,000 foot level without also reading about what it's actually like on the ground. Obviously, the great modern literary works on the subject are <i>Slaughterhouse Five</i> and, even more so, <i>Catch-22</i>. In the realm of nonfiction, Fussell's <i>Wartime</i> was interesting, but it led me to Eugene Sledge's <i>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</i>, which is even better: a very good book by a guy from the front lines in the Pacific who is not shy about telling you <i>exactly</i> what went on. Comes with an endorsement by PG! (from the last time I mentioned it on HN.)Don't read it over lunch if you're squeamish.<p>(I haven't actually read some of these, but my dad is a military boardgamer and military history buff. He's got several bookshelves <i>packed</i> with books like these.)",1233238092
