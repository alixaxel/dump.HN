Giving some better sense of scale is the only definite improvement I can think of. That and don't let pictures almost completely overlap, as some candle holders do on a leaf bowl the second time I loaded the page.<p>ETA: Clicking to buy a ""Deep River Rectangle Cocktail"" table went through the affiliate program link and to the retailer, but it dropped me on the front page.",1231538367

427161,comment,426818,426818,0,0,strlen,,,"No new tools will emerge that make capital creation possible by small players?<p>That's a very hubris-tic thinking. I can already think of at least one that emerged recently - unprecedented parallel computation power. ""Recently"" here meaning after google IPO: virtualization, out of the box distributed computing, out of the box data mining/data analysis tools, on-demand datacenter capacity, cheap multi-core CPUs.<p>This ""tool"" just needs a ""killer app"" that would make this attractive to consumers (all these technologies are already attractive to businesses and are being adopted at enormous rate): I can already think of big players providing desktop virtualization, one YC funded start-up providing a virtualization based ""Windows app store"".<p>Here's another ""tool"" related to this theme: kernels and networking stacks are able to handle increasingly higher and higher number of simultaneous connections (here's a thought: read up on the epoll Linux system call and try and see if Meebo would have been able to start without a significant up-front hardware investment if such a facility was not available).<p>The only reason I mentioned those ""tools"" is that it's my specific interest: distributed computing. I see no reason to think there aren't other such tools. For the 2005-2008 ""Web 2.0"" boom, for example these tools were AJAX, Flash and broadband connections -- allow web applications to not only feel and act like desktop applications, but also do what only desktop applications once could, e.g. edit and play video or edit/mark-up photos in full size and colour. Would youtube or Flickr (both of which brought money to their investors) have taken off if there wasn't wide-spread adoption of cable and DSL?<p>Also I fail to see how ""cleantech"" (as much as great deal of it is buzzwords) can't create any new such tools: what about low power, low cost CPUs powering smart-phones and netbooks? Now any one can build rich applications that have almost persistent power and Internet connection (an Internet-connected computer independent of the power or land-line phone/cable grid that's hundreds of times faster than the computers provided computing power to entire universities).",1231537969

You may want to fix that somehow.<p>Also, I found some issues with the way the room objects were displayed (after you have a style)... seemed a little mish-mashed.<p>Looks like a good thing to present to Architecture digest or House and Home or one of those magazines... timing might not be the best with the recession though.<p>Good luck to you!",1231535122

I am sure that's not the case.""<p>Even if it's not, the fact remains that apps written in HTML+CSS+javascript (what's more, HTML+CSS+JS tweaked to run on WebKit) will be trivial to port to the iPhone -- not just because the iPhone has a fantastic webkit browser, but because the apps <i>themselves</i> will be trivial.<p>The Pre, at best, will be a phone of widgets (I like your ""slightly clever phone"" moniker). I've made my share of widgets, and I know they can be both fun and useful. But after three months of game development on the iPhone, I would hang myself if I didn't have Cocoa. The Pre is going to see twenty versions of Lights Out, but you'll never see a Cro Mag or a Crayon Physics.<p>When people go on about the iPhone being a ""computer in your pocket"" they're talking about Cocoa its OS X underpinnings. Mojo and WebOS, at best, put safari in your pocket, and the iPhone already does that for cheaper.<p>Maybe you're right, and the Palm doesn't have the iPhone in its crosshairs. But I'm not sure how that helps them.",1231535081
