Looking back at my experience here's my two cents:<p>- Start by learning HTML to get the basics straight. This isn't hard once you grasp the basic concept.<p>- PHP is a good place to start, since you can almost always find help in the huge PHP community. I used www.w3schools.com for reference, and google would always point me to an answer when I had a stupid question.<p>- Do a real project, it's the best way to learn. I did a HN clone just to learn how stuff worked, how to deploy, etc. (www.deloghersk.dk)<p>The one thing I missed was a real person I could ask whenever there was something I conceptually didn't understand.

I’m not sure I ever realized Google’s referrals meant that much (referral logs aren’t necessarily accurate due to the differing ways you can click on a link)<p>It’s interesting because Google didn’t prevent people from going to the sites it blocked.

I like the USB drive idea (maybe on a keychain) in conjunction with keepass (I'll need to look more closely at keepass - I skimmed over it a while ago). Also I like the supergenpass suggestion below - less to carry, and as long as I have the bookmarklet on a browser, and my master password, easily accessible. More to think about! :)",1233425039

As such, I have a few that are based on phrases with numbers interspersed (the canonical example, I believe, is ""Don't have a cow, man"" which becomes something like ""d0n'tHac,m"" which has the added bonus of looking like ""don't hack 'em""). When the policy requires me to change, I can either swap in one of my other extra-strong passwords or, if it remembers previous passwords and I'm stuck, I can just add a number at the end.<p>My job uses a CryptoCard for most things, but I use a randomly-generated Kerberos password for mail. When it changes, I write it down and stick it in my wallet until I have it memorized, then destroy the paper.<p>TL;DR: Assign different services to ""tiers"" and use a different password for each tier, with increasing complexity of passwords corresponding to increasing importance of services.",1233424992

They didn't add much to the conversation but they weren't so offensive that he deserved that. He got the point.  Probably -1 would have accomplished it.  HN is the most civil site that I have seen.

The marking parallel with the top of my head is my height.<p>What we should be doing is trying to bring grading to a similar level of objectivity and standardization, not throwing it away completely.",1233424848
