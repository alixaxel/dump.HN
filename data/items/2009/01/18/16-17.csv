439438,comment,439262,439262,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This seems, to some extent, like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Part of the reason that VCs need a 10x return is that they block a 3x return. Clearly if every investment was a 3x return in a fund lasting 10 years, they'd be incredibly successful.<p>Mathematically speaking, a good VC should aim to get the most value out of every individual startup. To pass on a 3x return, if it consigned the startup to failure, because they need a 10x return is idiotic. Either the VC was a moron, or he thought the company could do better. He didn't block it because he needed 10x, he blocked it because he thought his expected value was higher than 3x by doing so.",1232297592

Security <i>is</i> a category where low price connotes low quality.<p>* The sales cycle on new security products is very long --- 2-4 months, with high engagement through the process.<p>I wouldn't do (3) unless I had a <i>really</i> good idea about how to do it in a new way; that idea should be better than ""good looking UI"", because as soon as customers express a preference for good UI, all your competitors will drop 20k on a designer to get the merit badge.",1232296686

Very few people (Issara, Lilly) actually referred to expectations at Google.

I know I get driven nuts!<p>#1 would be neat, but one problem would be that you'd have to price it cheaper than better hardware.  For example, if your product costs $500/year and I can just double my RAM from 1GB to 2GB for $20/mo, well, I'm just going to double the RAM and save $250.  Or likewise any other attribute of the system.  It just seems like it would be a lot harder to sell this since most people could probably put the money into hardware and get a better result.<p>#2 seems interesting, but with postage, is it still a good deal?  Personally, I don't see anything wrong with parallel importing - in fact, I'd argue it's a good thing since it stops manufacturers from exploiting market segregation.  You're talking about doing it on things like clothing which means problems will be lower.  Things like autos or electronics often have regulatory issues.  If you're going this route, you might want to consult an attorney.",1232295144
