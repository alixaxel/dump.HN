So they ask (trust me, I've tried this). Their question itself then gets downmodded -- meta discussions not tolerated. So the commenter, who is not psychic, is left with negative feedback from the moderation system without any idea at all what or what not to do in the future.<p>This idea of treating HN as just a large dataset with contributors simply being data suppliers to train the neural net has some really big limitations. Last I checked, the board was full of human beings, and posting in some fashion approximates the social activity of having a conversation. The further the system strays from the social/linguistic/psychological needs of conversation, the less effective it is as a community facilitator, in my opinion.<p>Meta-discussion might not be needed by the computer, but it's a natural part of human behavior and to the degree the system does not allow this, the system is broken.<p>My opinion only.",1233446392

It's about correcting a specific flaw in capitalist economies (the existence of multiple inefficient equilibrium positions). The idea is that once you correct that specific flaw, the economy will run itself better.<p>To look at it another way: Keynes argued that no one can manage the market, including the market itself. But that doesn't mean it can't be managed better than it is.",1233446292

460244,comment,459892,460153,0,0,brentb,,,"I agree with Joel here: Bob is being unfair.  Here's what I heard Jeff and Joel say when I listened to their podcast:<p>Quality matters, but there are other things that also matter, such as actually getting working code written. Some of us (and I've personally struggled with this for a long time) have a hard time letting go of our quest for perfection and settling for shipping code that's imperfect but works.  When Jeff says that ""quality just doesn't matter that much,"" what I took this to mean is: quality matters, but it matters less than we sometimes feel like it does.  And that doesn't mean he's condoning writing crappy code; he's simply saying that we tend to overvalue this abstract concept of quality and that can have a crippling effect on our productivity.<p>Joel focuses on dogmatic adherence to development methodologies/principles as an example, specifically testing.  I got the impression that he thinks testing is great and it has its place in the software development ecosystem.  It tends to increase software quality and there are certain types of software for which it is really, really important (Jeff mentions framework code as an example).  That said, taken to an extreme, testing can get in the way of getting things done... getting working code written and out the door / live on the server / whatever.  It can also get in the way of modifying working code, as intentional changes to the way that code works always breaks some percentage of your unit tests, just as a regression will.  And while catching unintentional regressions is great (and one of the best reasons you should unit test), constantly having to rewrite your tests every time you change the behavior of an internal class can be a real drag on your productivity.  And that can be bad.<p>The key is to avoid being overly dogmatic in your adherence to development principles.  Instead, be pragmatic and find a balance.  Test enough to ensure adequate quality (whatever that happens to be for your product), but no more.  Otherwise you're just doing yourself (or your employer) a disservice.",1233444853

My wife just bought a big ass F250 pickup with the 7.3L Powerstroke diesel and that immediately began to feed my interest in biodiesel.
My background is in designing controllers and writing software to control machinery. As I was researching the amateur ways of making diesel from waste vegetable oil, I  was struck by how it lends itself to automation: pour WVO in at one end, push a button and get diesel and glycerine out the other.

460229,comment,459961,460186,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"Why is that a bad thing?  Successful companies in the free market are successful because they have given people something they want for a voluntary exchange of capital.  These companies turn around and develop more products that people want.<p>Why do you seek a flaw in capitalism?  Capitalism simply means the voluntary exchange of goods and services.  The alternative is non-voluntary exchange i.e. you are forced.<p>If you don't know why privately controlled means of production are good you have a lot of reading to do.  Might I point you to the Cato Institute or Ludwig Von Mises Institute (google for free literature).  Or for a more popular example check out Friedman's bestsellers.<p>For the ugly and fast version:
Would you put up with wal-mart taking $40 from your paycheck every month and telling you that you can come get a gallon of milk every week for ""free""?<p>first you should be free to choose whether you want milk or not and whether to support it with your money.<p>second you have no way of knowing if you're overpaying because you have no idea what price milk would sell for if several companies were competing for your business.<p>thirdly you have no recourse if the quality of the milk goes down. you can try to sue wal mart..good luck with that. You might claim that people are still free to go buy other milk, but any other company selling milk is at a huge disadvantage. People have to pay that $40 a month regardless, so most figure they might as well get the milk out of it. competitors milk could cost half of what wal-mart charges, $20 a month. But from the perspective of the citizen that ""private milk"" costs $60 a month since they have to pay the $40 regardless.<p>In this scenario wal-mart has you as a captive customer.  Before it made money by convincing you to buy milk from it with high quality and a low price.  Freed of having to convince you to buy it wal-mart doesn't have to care much about customer service or product quality.<p>This is essentially the scenario of state owned goods and services.  you're assuming that the central planner can come up with a better solution than lots of entrepreneurs taking a crack at it.",1233443974

460225,comment,459924,459924,0,0,pj,,,"JavaScript is /way/ better than good enough.  It's terrific.  It's the only programming language many people need to produce really amazing websites and web application that make the world a richer and more promising place for a lot of people.<p>It's good enough to get you $40-50/hr easily.<p>It's good enough to build platforms and APIs and tons of libraries given freely to the community by companies including Yahoo, Google, and startups you've never heard of.<p>It's a beautiful language and /extremely/ powerful.  To judge it poorly because hash keys are strings is so short sighted that I doubt the credibility of the author.<p>If you are new to programming or want to try something out, go for JavaScript.  You can build a simple website in HTML and if you know JavaScript, you can plug into a wealth of information just by typing some code into a browser window and hitting save.<p>Look at what any of the major mapping websites let you do.  Entire platforms as a service. And now with the Pre out, you'll be able to build websites with javascript that function natively on the phone.  The iPhone makes you jump through hoops to do something like that.<p>JavaScript is big big big and it doesn't have anything to do with hash keys.  It has to do with a network of like-minded individuals pushing it forward. Not for money, not to make it easier, not to win control, but to create a platform on which we can all collaborate and build an Internet that helps us communicate.<p>Look at the power right here on Hacker News.  The arrows, when you click them, the page doesn't refresh, it just sends a quick little request back to the server and the arrow goes away and ur done, no waiting, no pauses.<p>Now, that is, technically a RIA, or an AJAX site. Now, if you want to get all technical about it, it's not even AJAX because the X isn't there. In that way, Hacker News is more of an AJ site.  Anyway, this isn't my point...<p>My point is, it's all HTML and just a few clever little lines of JavaScript and you have a very functional system that works in any browser that supports Javascript and if it doesn't support javascript, it still works and that's amazing. It's like JavaScript is so simple to add so much functionality and speed to a site and a life.<p>I don't even know why the author went all into Action Script, what does that have to do with JavaScript?  Because Action Script does hash keys the way he likes it is awesome and JavaScript is just good enough?<p>No way I say!  I love JavaScript.  It's an Internet Standard.  Don't discredit the value of that. Standards bodies like that don't just go around choosing all willy-nilly, they think about the decision long and hard and they make a good one and JavaScript is a good one and it'll do everything we need for a very very long time.<p>And everyone wants it to stay that way.  Everyone's also trying to fill in its gaps and make some hard things easier and that'll always be expected and that's great, but the author didn't compare it to Silverlight and didn't compare it to Java Fx and all the other RIA platforms, only ActionScript and ...<p>You know what, look at this other post: <a href=""http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=66</a> Where in 2007, the same author says, ""<i>People are finally realizing that HTML is incapable of supporting a sophisticated user interface. AJAX is a reeking pile of hacks and cluges that offers only a glimpse of what could be possible with a halfway-intelligent browser platform.</i>""<p>A lot of really cool stuff is done in Flash.  A lot of really nice things are done with JavaScript too and I think those kinds of statements are outlandish.  JavaScript/AJAX, whatever you want to call it have problems and frustrations and so does Flash. To mention one or a couple reasons where one excels over the other misses the big picture.<p>The big picture is that JavaScript is what the <i>community</i> has chosen.  The community of the expert people for everyone that is good and JavaScript is that and it probably will be for a long time.<p>I feel like, and when I say ""feel like"" I mean my gut, without numbers to back it up, tells me that JavaScript is super powerful and widely supported by a lot of people for a very good reason. Why don't the flash people stop with the action script and start using JavaScript?<p>Is it because someone is going to have to change?  All the people who like Action Script are going to have to learn JavaScript? Or are the Action Script people expecting all the JavaScript people to give up JavaScript and learn Action Script?<p>There's a very backed in a corner feel to all of the posts. Like some sort of weird undertone I can't quite put my finger on, but I don't think I agree much with what the author has to say.",1233443928
