Linux is a very fine operating system, and for many purposes (like desktops and small servers) it is vastly superior to Solaris.  Red Hat has some of the most productive and important Linux kernel developers (along with dozens of other developers working on Gnome, databases, and a lot more) on their payroll, so they're definitely involved in the making.<p>Solaris is so embarrassingly bad in a few areas that I get pretty angry every time I have to use it.  It makes it even worse when I use the stuff that Sun has done <i>really</i> well (ZFS, Zones, dtrace), that I then have to use their stupidly bad package management tools, their neanderthal old UNIX utilities (or install the GNU tools myself, and remember to use the g variants), and their general disdain for anything not invented by Sun.",1232571182

The acquisition of MySQL is merely the most obvious example, but Sun has open sourced <i>everything</i> in their software stable.  Literally all of Sun is Open Source now (hell, they even have an open CPU design or two).  This has beaten down their revenues a bit (OK, maybe a lot) in the short term...but I wonder if it's the beginning of a dramatic turnaround.  It feels kinda like they've put the nerds back in charge.  I don't know if that's always a good thing.  Would Apple have become what it is today if Woz had been at the helm?  It's almost comically obvious that it wouldn't be...but still, Sun was founded by nerds for nerds, and was explosively successful because of that.<p>In other words, I have no idea what's going to happen to Sun.

443765,story,,,1,0,EngagoTeam,"Lead generation - Customer nurturing using company website",http://www.LEADSExplorer.com,"Hi,\nEngago Technologies Ltd. presents LEADSExplorer.\nwww.LEADSExplorer.com www.engago.com<p>Best regards,\nTom\nEngago Technologies Ltd.<p>Company websites are failing to generate B2B leads\nAbout 2 years ago we from Engago Technologies had the plan to develop an online web service for businesses. During the writing of the business plan we were faced with the problem of lead generation as this would rely heavily upon the website.\nIndustry research reports that only 2 to 3% of all website visitors will ever register on an online form for a download, a podcast or contact a company directly for further information.  Thus about 97% of all potential customers are lost upfront.<p>On the other hand most (7 out of 10) business deals start with an Internet search for retrieving information and comparing products and solutions.\nThis means most potential customers will be looking around your website, but hardly any of them will contact you or will reveal their identity. This leaves you without any selling opportunity although the leads have visited your website.<p>During several discussions with friends and colleagues active in different business, they recognized having the same problem. This led to the conclusion of being a general problem for both brick-and-mortar enterprises and online businesses.\nAny company that has visitors on their website hardly generates any leads from their website as there is no identification of those visitors and the companies they represent.<p>After a market research on several existing solutions we saw room for improvement in features, functions and a higher level of company identification. Thus we decided to tackle the problem of lead generation and customer nurturing by developing a solution that starts by identifying the website visitors by company name and provides additional information like language, geographic location, number of visits and visitors by company, the search terms used or direct access. The thumbnails of the pages visited indicate visually the interest in your specific products or solutions.<p>Using the friends and colleagues as Beta users, allowed us to adjust and improve the solution to their needs by adding functions and features like a weekly or daily email report of the visiting companies.<p>Lead generation\nThe first purpose of the service is to contact (by cold calling or sending email) possible contacts within the visiting organization. These contacts are found using the Internet Data Mining on the company supplied by LEADSExplorer.<p>In order to keep track of you communications we have added a CRM that is seamless integrated with the website and email communication exchanges. Thus any visitor from any company in the CRM is plotted on the Activity chart of the company. The Activity charts bring together the communications history and the visit history. This allows you to see and analyze the interactions and the reactions upon your communications allowing adjusting the message.\nThe Activity charts also indicate the prospects that need more or less attention compared to their lead qualification valuation.<p>As email has become probably the most important communications channel in business, we have added the automatic collection and aggregation of the emails you have sent to and received from a company. Thus all of your emails are neatly organized for every customer in the CRM.<p>Customer retention\nGenerating leads and turning them into new customers is very exciting, but keeping your customers will normally bring more operating income, hence the importance of improving the efficiency of your customer retention.<p>1) As you can precisely follow–up on your communications and the reactions of your customers by the visits and their communications, it is likely you can improve your customer retention as you can measure the level of interest of your customers. \nYou will be able to analyze: \n- If a message generated interest or not.\n- If there is any sign of interest\n- If there is an increase or decrease of interest\n- How the customer reacts upon different messages and information.<p>2) If the company starts visiting again or even worse stops visiting, it is time for your account manager to call upon his contacts within the company. He is then armed with the information about the interests shown in your products or your solutions by the pages visited or re-visited.<p>LEADSExplorer http://www.LEADSExplorer.com\nThe LEADSExplorer web service is applicable to large and small companies having a website that receives traffic, no matter how much traffic.<p>Our view is that all online information:\n- The website\n- The email communications\n- The CRM\nhas to come together in one environment in order to increase your sales and your bottom line.<p>LEADSExplorer is available in 2 packages:\n- The basic version for discovery of the visiting companies allowing capturing information from the Internet and export the data to a CSV file (Comma Separated Values) for further use in a spreadsheet, data base or a CRM.\nPricing is based upon number of monthly visitors and number of users.<p>- The combined solution with discovery of the visiting companies and a CRM provides the seamless integration between your company website and your email conversations with your leads and customers.\nPricing is based upon the number of monthly leads and number of users.<p>Engago Technologies Ltd. http://www.engago.com\nEngago Technologies Ltd. is a bootstrapped company from the UK that develops markets and operates online services for businesses.\nThe aim is to provide for businesses On Demand web services, which they require to take full advantage of the new technologies of the digital age.",1232570531

Find good points in what they say, and then lead them step by step.  Be constructive, and respect that their opinions are their opinions.

Start me at the US and let me enter an address and show all places on the map.<p>2. The map is very small. At the minimum it should take up the available area. Keep the same height / width ratio if that looks better.<p>3. The color codes should be visible from the start so I know what I'm looking at. I'd suggest moving it above the map and out of the tabbed part.<p>4. Make the Top Rated part into a table with columns and alternate colored rows. It looks messy.<p>5. The tags section is messy too. Give me a list of tags and the number of restaurants in each tag and let me click. And definitely don't show me tags that don't have restaurants.<p>6. Actually, dump the tags and categorize the restaurants. There's too much potential for an overabundance of tags.<p>7. The text in locality filter overlaps.<p>8. I'm not a fan of popups in general because it covers too much of the map and makes it very difficult to click another restaurant. Consider moving all of the info on the popup to the area below the map.<p>In general, figure out why people are coming to your website and engineer the UI to fit that purpose. I would think people are looking for where to go out to lunch because of your domain name (which looks it may change). So let them zoom into their office and see all of the places within a few miles. Colored pins are good but your customers have to know what they're looking at.",1232568287
