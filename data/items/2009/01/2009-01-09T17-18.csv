426868,comment,426313,426313,0,0,gruseom,,,"Here's a trick I discovered for working with bad code that used to help me a lot: treat it as an archaeological dig. Complicated bad programs usually evolve out of simpler bad programs, often in a semi-consistent way - inconsistent enough to be a maintenance nightmare, but consistent enough for a human reader to grok the patterns. If you can read the code backwards in this way and find the remains of the original simpler system, you then have a model for understanding the whole system: it's the crappy simple original one plus the crappy ways it was extended.<p>For example, complex bad systems are often extended by means of duplication (C-c-C-v-driven development). It's often possible, when you have a number of duplicated sections, to figure out which was the master and which the copies - e.g. if there were any comments in the original code, people will just leave them in the duplicated code. (The sort of programmer who reads and updates comments probably doesn't program by C-c-C-v in the first place.)<p>This brings up another point about bad code. Naive bad code is a lot easier to understand than sophisticated bad code. It's bloated and buggy, but there's always a sort of internal order to it. Bad programmers are able to maintain it by remembering the 10 places that X is done and the 19 places that Y is done. Sophisticated bad code, on the other hand - the kind full of impenetrable pseudo-abstraction - is a different can of worms. I don't think the above techniques apply to it. However, naive bad code is more common.",1231523849

426855,comment,426569,426695,0,0,mdasen,,,"First, I should correct you that both the US and Europe use the International Labour Organization's definition for unemployment: ""those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay, currently available to work, and have actively searched for work.""  Europe implements this as people who are not working, have looked for work within the past 4 weeks, and are available to start work within the next 2 weeks.  The US methodology differs slightly, but not in a statistically significant way stating that workers must not be employed, they must have looked for work sometime in the previous 4-week period, and they must be available work work.  The last part differs, but since these are surveys, I don't think anyone being asked ""are you available for work?"" would interpret that to mean at the precise moment.  So, the US doesn't define ""in the next two weeks"" and so some people might interpret it to be a longer period and some might interpret it to be a shorter period, but I don't think you can say that American numbers don't count people that European numbers do count.<p>So, European and American unemployment rates can be compared with decent accuracy. The fact is that governments want accurate data.  Inaccurate data just makes it harder to create policy that helps those governed.<p>One of the nice things about the American unemployment numbers is that they're more than a gross rate.  The US also publishes numbers by certain groups. That allows me to say that the unemployment rate for men is 22% higher for men than for women or that teenagers have been the hardest hit group with unemployment at 20.8% for them. Likewise, there are interesting (if not meaningful) differences in the unemployment rate changes between groups.  The African American unemployment rate is up about 30% YoY while the Caucasian unemployment rate is up a whopping 64% YoY.<p>Full data: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf</a><p>So, why is American unemployment a bigger issue?  You already mentioned it: we've got less good stuff coming from the government when we don't have a job.  Healthcare especially is a problem.  Beyond that, the amount of time that unemployment benefits last, the amount of each check, etc. just aren't as good.  Unemployment is more of a hardship in America than in Europe.  Europe has seen very hard times and it created a system that would allow people to get through many years of tough times.  America has been able to limit tough times to be much shorter periods and, generally speaking, just has a ""get off your butt"" attitude.<p>Partly, this is because America has allowed for drastic economic changes in a way the Europe hasn't historically.  The United States is more ready to see old industries die and to start new ones in their place.  And so hard times do come (it's inevitable that you can't make something perfect), but they tend not to last as long.<p>Before I go further, I want to say that much of this is historical.  The Europe of today isn't the Europe of even 20 years ago.  That said, one way of thinking about this is code refactoring.  It takes time, it can be painful as things that worked stopped working as you fixed it.  However, arguing that something is working and just trying to (indefinitely) prevent any non-work in order to realign things for a better future is worse.<p>It's my personal belief that governments can help smooth over the ""refactoring"" by encouraging new industries to locate near industries that are closing down.  Note, this can't be a ""we'll just lower our taxes"" scheme.  There's no point in lowering taxes on a dying industry or throwing long-term government support behind it simply because failure of that industry means unemployment.  You need to be smart and find industries that are likely to be <i>growth</i> industries that will progressively demand <i>more</i> labor as time goes forward.  Keeping people employed is great, but encouraging industry that increases employment in the long-term is sooooooooo much better. And government can incentivisze new industries. It's hard and often people hate it because they see it as discriminatory against industries not getting the cool incentives, but some industries do benefit communities more than others and some industries are growth and some aren't.<p>In closing, I'll just say this: in the face of an economic crisis, it <i>might</i> be a good idea to repeal the employer part of the payroll taxes (note the might qualifier since I haven't studied this).  It would lower the cost to employ someone by, what, 9%?  As the cost of labor goes down, employers want more of it.  And when the economy gets good again, it could be reinstated or not and if not would really just be passed to workers as salary increases (just like the employer part of the payroll taxes makes them pay you less each year because they need to pay the government for your employment).",1231523330

Try researching your VC's by talking to the people who have been funded by them.<p>.<p><i>There is no NDA at this point.</i><p>You are thinking of asking a VC to sign an NDA?<p>.<p><a href=""http://robertplattbell.blogspot.com/2007/10/to-nda-or-not-to-nda.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robertplattbell.blogspot.com/2007/10/to-nda-or-not-to...</a><p><i>Simply put, when you sign an NDA, you are signing a CONTRACT, and any contract may obligate you to perform certain acts. More importantly, for each contract you sign, you are exposing yourself to potential litigation liability for breach of contract.<p>Thus, as a large company, if you sign hundreds or thousands of NDA contracts, you are incrementally exposing yourself to more and more liability. In a country where you can get sued for serving hot coffee, the odds of getting sued for signing all those NDA’s is pretty high.<p>So there is no point in a large corporation agreeing to sign an NDA with a solo inventor, unless the NDA is one of those bogus “disclosure agreements” referred to above.<p>If you think about it, it makes sense. And if you were to advise a company, you’d advise them NOT to sign an NDA. For example, suppose you represent a carmaker. Most of the ideas submitted will relate to cars. If your client signs all these NDA’s with potential inventors, chances are, one of them will submit an idea similar or identical to an idea already under development in your client’s lab. You’ll end up getting sued, as the inventor will claim you “stole” the idea. Better off to advise your client NOT to sign any NDA’s.<p>Venture Capitalists (VC’s) historically have refused to sign an NDA, and in fact, to ask them to do so is considered an insult and a sure way to put an end to your “elevator pitch”. Again, since VC’s listen to hundreds, if not thousands of invention pitches over the years, the chance that they will hear the same idea more than once (or a similar idea) is pretty great. If they sign NDA after NDA, they slowly paint themselves into a corner, to the point where they cannot back any new idea without the chance of some previous inventor claiming a breach of an NDA.<p>Frankly, the proposition of an NDA is a bit absurd. Someone comes to you and says they want to tell you a secret. BUT, before they will, they want you to sign a contract agreeing to draconian consequences if you tell the secret to anyone else. Suppose the secret is not all that great? Suppose everyone already knows about it, or more to the point, someone in your company does? It really is a risk not worth taking.<p>So, there are various good reasons why people will refuse to sign an NDA. If you think about it, chances are, you’d refuse to sign one, too!</i>",1231521638

First they took out the ""discouraged"", people who wanted a job, but had stopped looking. Under the Reagan Administration, the workforce was expanded by adding in members of the U.S. military, who were by definition ""employed"", thus shrinking the percentage of ""unemployed"". The Clinton Administration reduced the number of households sampled from 60,000 to 50,000 and ""a disproportionate number of the dropped households were in the inner cities.""
