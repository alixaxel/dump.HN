Up until now, virtualization--especially x86 server virtualization--has been pushed forward by the huge hardware and operational savings accrued from app server consolidation. Sadly, the consolidation of whole businesses will likely become one of the main drivers of virtualization in the year ahead. For IT managers at acquiring companies, virtualization will become a tool for onboarding IT assets without bringing along old servers, murky networks and a hodgepodge of management tools.",1231819060

Who ""won the war"" in selling clothing, Walmart or Armani?  Who ""won the war"" in entertainment, World of Warcraft or J.R.R.

431599,comment,431285,431575,0,0,gruseom,,,"Yeah, I know you meant that. The point is people don't do it because they don't have to. In XML, by contrast, your example has been written countless times. For a few years it was almost <i>de rigeur</i>.<p>JS's notation for data and code may not be identical, but they're close enough to get things done (that's JS's Lisp heritage showing). Since XML was explicitly designed to prevent people from doing a bunch of things they needed, it's not surprising that what resulted were montrosities.<p>I suspect that XML is a manifestation of the kind of people who like to lock things down and specify them up front, until they're so tied up in knots of their own making that they form a committee to design the same thing all over again. As you may guess, I'm of the opposite camp. Happily, I can work in my medium and leave them to theirs.",1231818380

The old C hackers hated it (too inefficient.)<p>The nice thing I see in XML is that it abstracts out grammars (using XML Schema / DTD). For JSON, a grammar isn't used - it's a nested tuple transmission format - sort of a dynamic type systems, but without, er, types - just tuples that can contain anything. It's agile, and all you need in many cases. And JSON is a natural for web-client stuff.<p>BTW: who said SOA is dead?
