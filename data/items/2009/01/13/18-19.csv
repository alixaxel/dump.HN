That is why great frameworks like Spring, Guice or Stripes exist.<p>Sun loves you when you use J2EE/JSF/EJB/JMS/JWHATEVER. But there are serious alternatives that are more lightweight, easier and less intrusive.<p>Of course you will not add value (read: buy into) to the Sun Enterprise Ecosystem :-)<p>Staying away from (most) 'Enterprise' Java standards has worked very well for me.

I've seen many projects where people think they don't need Spring but where it made 100% sense. And made the project simpler and easier to manage and test.<p>Even in small projects it makes a lot of sense to have a good seperation in layers or services and to use a <i>mostly</i> invisible helper to glue things together.<p>Modern Spring can configure your app with a very minimal amount of XML. If you don't like XML then use annotation based configuration.<p>I totally disagree with your statement that Spring only exists to manage the 'massive configurability of Java design patterns'. The only patterns that the foundation of Spring introduces are IoC and 'configuration by convention'. Those have been proven to be extremely powerful patterns that simply allow you to burn half of the 'J2EE Design Patterns' books.",1231872871

He recognized that most interesting materials are stronger under tension than compression -- steel, for example.  This is part of the power of the geodesic (tension spreads throughout the structure, yielding global tension and localized compression).  The houses were designed with a load-bearing center shaft, and the structure pulled from it.  At least in the designs I've seen -- and in the aluminum building shown in the article (look at the ""foundation"").<p>But similar to a tepee, the top would also open (and rotate) for ventilation purposes -- domes and round structures have useful air circulation patterns.",1231872537

There are plenty of other development methodologies that work for people, of course, but XP and anything close to it really requires a constant level of communication betweeen developers, product managers (and customers), and testers that's just impossible to achieve if you're not physically sitting right next to everyone.

432384,comment,432080,432300,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Your numbers suggest very little, one way or the other. People who make bad marriage choices are more likely to get divorced. Bayes rule implies that divorcees are therefore more likely to be the type of people who make bad marriage choices, and second/third marriages are more likely to fail.<p>I'll give a simple numerical example. I assume some people marry badly, and have an intrinsically higher probability of divorce. I assume the probability of divorce does not change after the first marriage.<p>Let MB = Marries Badly, and D = Divorce. Assume P(MB)=0.5, P(D|MB)=0.9 and P(D|!MB)=0.1. Then:<p>P(MB | D) = P(D | MB) P(MB) / P(D) = 0.9 x 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.9.<p>So 90% of divorcees marry badly. Therefore, a person who has gotten one divorce has a probability of getting divorced on their second marriage of:<p>P(D | MB) x 0.9 + P(D | !MB) x 0.1 = 0.82<p>Therefore, in this model, 50% of first marriages and 82% of second marriages will end in divorce.",1231870455

It's not the same thing as mandating a standard-for-how-all-interfaces-shall-be-defined-and-all-grammars-declared.

A bunch of oil companies took years to define it. Do you know what happened? First, the overwhelming majority of projects still use the old ASCII format which is much easier to work with. Second, those of us who tried out the new format soon found that the different vendors' implementation of this ""standard"" were incompatible with each other, and we had to write just as much vendor-specific code as before, only now the format was bloated and rigid and made it harder.<p>The whole approach just hasn't worked in practice, and if it were going to, it would have by now.",1231869700
