432690,comment,431786,432015,0,0,dasil003,,,"Nothing really wrong with that per se.  The problem is if at one point you decide that's just the way to do things and you never learn new approaches.  If you want to be a good programmer you have to try different things and learn the pros and cons for yourself.  Best practices are a decent jumping off point, but developers often overestimate their own best practices that they've learned while working on certain types of projects.  It's especially insidious among very smart developers who work in a narrow field, because their reputation causes their wisdom to be mis-applied by junior developers and cargo-culters.",1231880352

432688,comment,431702,431702,0,0,olavk,,,"The problem with monads in Haskell is a chicken-and-egg problem. When an ordinary programmer (as oppossed to a mathmatician) starts toying with a new language, they usually start with some simple IO code (starting from ""hello world"") and play and explore their way deeper into the language. In Haskell, however, you don't get much further than ""hello world"" before you bang your head against the IO monad. Hence the monad totorials aimed at newbies. The problem is that to understand monads you have to understand a lot of other advanced Haskell features like type constructors, type classes, type inference, partial functions and so on.<p>I think the solution is to realize that you dont need to understand monads to write IO code, you just need to understand the rules of do-notation. Sure, do-notation is implemented using monads under the hood, but you dont need to understand monads to use it, just as you dont need to understand vtables to use objects.<p>I should propably write a do-notation tutorial to show how far you can get without understanding monads.",1231880307

I agree that more students are considered gifted than ought to be, but I also think that the whole three-tier gifted/normal/special ed thing is broken.  It's a spectrum, so treat it that way.<p>That said, I've never gotten a gold star that I can remember, and I've definitely received my fair share of red X's.<p>I did get stamps/stickers on papers which were A's or, in the lower grades, check-pluses or E's.  But I don't think that these in any way gave me a false sense of accomplishment; they only gave them out for top marks.  (For the uninitiated, sometimes for minor assignments we were graded on a scale that went v+, v, v-, X or Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Poor.)<p>Maybe this is a big issue in other places, or perhaps private schools (that seems likely to me, based on the accounts of some people I know who attended private school), but it's definitely not happening everywhere.",1231880136

432683,comment,431786,432287,0,0,dasil003,,,"I'm starting to see why a lot of people say all software development analogies suck.  What does it mean to say its tools would break under duress, or they're made of balsa wood?  You can interpret those analogies any way you want.<p>The bottom line is the Ruby runtime has some serious flaws, but they are not so pervasive as to make everything in Ruby total crap.  There's a good chance you could write an application in half the time it would take in Java and experience no problems ever.  It's also possible you'll hit a memory leak and have to face an ugly workaround, partial rewrite or even scrap the whole Ruby project.  Finally, you may have a memory leak and find an easy workaround, and then one day the problem is magically solved by Rubinius.<p>Those are concrete scenarios to consider.  I don't see how a physical materials analogy has any value in analyzing your options.  The pros and cons of languages don't align AT ALL with physical properties.  Thoughts like, ""Java is more like cast iron, and Python is more like hardwood"" is just one-dimensional mental masturbation.  In the end the reason to choose a language like Java because you are willing to tolerate more overhead for less risk.",1231879973

Cornell started a few years ago releasing ""Median Grade Reports"" so that students would see what classes were easy and hard in terms of grading.  The idea was that students would enroll in classes with low median grades so that they could challenge themselves.  Instead, people took the reports and took as many classes as they could with high median grades, so they would have an easier time and a higher GPA.<p>Sure, people come here because it's known to be hard.
