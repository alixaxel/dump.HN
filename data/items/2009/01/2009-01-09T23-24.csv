427331,comment,427079,427079,0,0,fallacy,,,"Great start!<p>I've got a few comments:<p>First, as someone pointed out, you should not switch your quiz interface between the first question and the latter questions. I don't see that you gain anything by switching and it is a little confusing. I would stick with the first question layout, because it is simple.<p>Second, I'm not sure that you need the ""Most recent results"" feature. The investment your seeking from potential users is so small, I don't think I that you need to prove that you have traffic, and I don't really see this as morphing into a social app (if it does, I think you are straying too far away from what will make you money). Further, I think it detracts from the point, which I assume is to get people to take the quiz and click through to buy products. Removing it will make the interface cleaner.<p>Third, as someone has stated, I would make it clear how many images have been rated and remain. A simple ""1 of 10"" would do the trick.<p>Fourth, if you go with the second layout for the quiz interface, I would do away with or hide the ""How to take the style quiz"" text, like you do the ""like or hate something.""<p>Fifth, after the quiz, I would take people right to the ""room"" of stuff that they can click and buy. As it is, you are going to have a lot of people navigate away at the end of the quiz and they will never even see your money page.<p>Lastly, I noticed that you are using some magazine images. Although you will likely fly under the radar, that is copyright infringement. I see that you source it at least, and that may be enough to get them off your back.<p>All in all, good start for sure.",1231545284

427324,comment,427206,427282,0,0,mdasen,,,"Basically, what it comes down to is Python's explicit over implicit policy.  First, unlike PHP, not everything in the Python language is automatically included in every file.  You explicitly import things.  datetime is a module in the standard Python library.  It includes several things: datetime, time, date, timedelta. . .  So, often what you want is a datetime object from the datetime module, but you could do datetime.date.today().<p>One of the nice things about Python is that you should be able to see where something comes from anytime you're using it.  If you're referencing something, it will either be defined in that file or be defined by something imported at the top.  So, if you see ""Site.objects.get_current()"" you can easily search the file for where Site comes from.  Maybe it's a Site class defined in the file itself.  Maybe it's imported from django.contrib.sites.models.  Maybe it's from somewhere else.  The nice thing is that you can easily see where it comes from so that you can look up that code.<p>This is very unlike many languages.  PHP's include()/require() could execute anything when you call them and define any number of things and you might not know where they come from so easily.  I get push back on this from some of my friends who argue that good IDEs should track that for you, but I like that there isn't the ambiguity in Python.",1231544898

The docs on apple site say to apply for a 'TIN' but, as I learnt after some days, a TIN is almost impossible to get outside the US (it seems that you have to send your passport to the IRS by mail).
After a while (and a very useful post on the Internet from an UK guy that managed to get it I discovered that the key is to apply for an EIN. You can apply by phone, they release it to you immediately by phone and, after a while, you will receive a letter from the IRS with the number for your record...
