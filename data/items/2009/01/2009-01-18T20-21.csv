439643,comment,439515,439603,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I acknowledge the validity of the concerns you're bringing up here.<p>I've just started thinking about this a few months ago and I haven't spent any time trying to actually implement my ideas yet, so there are indeed quite a few issues I haven't explored very deep or indeed not at all.<p>I had thought a bit about the potential rigidity tradeoffs of correctness VS usability. I hadn't really thought about going so far as enforcing function signatures, though it's the logical next step after enforcing s-expression validity.<p>There are lots of different types of ""structure errors"" and I think some should be strictly enforced while others shouldn't. In the s-expression case, one example of something that should be enforced strictly is the nesting of parentheses that delimit s-expressions. Fortunately that one is pretty easy. Wereas in a traditional editor you'd do:<p><pre><code>  (|
  ()|
  (|)
</code></pre>
as 3 different steps, in a structure editor you'll simply have one operation that will do all this atomically so you go from one correct state to the next. In the function arity case, I think a much more lax enforcement is de rigueur. There will always be some editing tasks that will require less rigid rules but I think we should value correctness by default and <i>then</i> introduce laxity in controlled ways where it makes sense. It's a tradeoff similar to how limiting side-effects by default is a restriction that can make a program more powerful, yet sometimes you really want to have some mutable state.<p>edit: I'd add that my end goal for a structure editor is that it may better assist the user in his editing tasks by having a better understanding of the context. The validity enforcement is only a means to facilitate this and should be relaxed wherever it impedes the user rather than helping.",1232311481

But in general I'm a big fan of using long-and-meaningful-identifiers.<p>If you're saying that it's not worth it to make a structure editor just to have more CPU efficiency, I wholeheartedly agree. It's true that a structure editor would probably be more efficient on that level, but it's only a very minor bonus compared to the real advantages of the computer always being fully aware of the editing context you're in (thus helping in ways it normally couldn't), and without the need to write such a complex piece of software as a reliable incremental parser.<p>If you're saying that the keystroke savings are not worth it, I'll have to admit the very simple example I used doesn't make it seem very worthwhile, but the benefits of a structure editor would become much more obvious the more you looked at complex examples of the kind of thing it could do.<p>I didn't even talk about the modification of structure yet. I can't tell you how many times I had to edit<p><pre><code>  (something (stuff)

The more the language has stupid boilerplate like html's close-tags, the more keystrokes you look to save.<p>- But: the trickier thing to get right is how to handle <i>editing</i> existing code.<p>If you're just writing html-in-lisp in an ordinary text editor, you don't have much to worry about here.<p>If you're writing html-in-lisp in a structure editor that makes it hard to get into an invalid (meaning: contrary-to-language-grammar) state, even something as simple as re-ordering lines can become a royal pain; this gets even worse the more you do cutesy things like write macros to auto-generate some types of output, or try to be smart about how you parse the program being written.<p>Here's an example: I define a format-product-row function that takes an item sku, price, thumbnail url, and product name argument and generates some html output (python notation below):<p>def FormatProductRow(sku, price, thumbnailURL, productName): BLAH<p>Your super-helpful structure editor sees this definition and memorizes the function name and required arguments.<p>I then proceed to write a bunch of code that makes use of FormatProductRow, and each time I use that function in my code your helpful structure editor reminds me of the arguments it takes and doesn't let me make mistakes by having the wrong # of arguments (too many or too few).<p>Now, later, I am like ""oh snap I needed to include the marketingOneLiner argument in that function"", and I need to go back through all my source and do the following:<p>(1) change the definition of FormatProductListing to take that argument (and handle it)<p>(2) go to every place the function is used, and change the # of arguments that are fed in, while making sure to actually pass in an appropriate value in each spot this guy gets used<p>(3) where necessary, change a lot of the functions that are calling FormatProductListing (so that are actually in possession of an appropriate value to feed into that argument slot), possibly altering their arguments, etc., until everything is done<p>When I get done with (1) (2) and (3), the program should be expressible in 100% correct syntax (and whatever semantics you're enforcing like type-checking).<p>Before I get done, the program's in a ""broken"" syntactic state:<p>- if I change the occurrences before the definition, then I've got what'll look like a lot of ""misuses"" to your syntax-checking logic (b/c the remembered definition != the way i'm using it in the new, fixed usages)<p>- if I change the definition before the occurrences, then I've got what'll look like a lot of mis-uses, b/c the old usages are incorrect according to the new, updated definition<p>Regardless of the ordering, you have more problems:<p>- if you ""taint"" any part of the parse tree that has errors inside it (eg: FormatProductTables is now ""bad"" b/c it calls ""FormatProductRow"", which is ""bad"" while I'm fixing stuff up), then potentially large parts of the program are broken during these edits. Depending on how rigid your structure editor is wrt allowing ""bad"" states to exist, this could make your program totally useless.<p>- if you don't do that kind of ""tainting"", your program's going to be pretty weak in a lot of ways.<p>The situation above is just one particular example of a general problem you'll encounter if you go this route: how do you tell ""good"" errors -- ie, the kind of temporarily broken syntax or semantics you'll get while editing code -- from ""bad"" errors, in your syntax-and-semantics-enforcing logic?<p>Unfortunately for you, I'm afraid, a simple mode-toggle doesn't work too great, either, and here's why in a nutshell:<p>- when you're first writing the program and the editor is forcing you to be ""correct"", everything that you wind up writing is going to turn out correct (just b/c if it was incorrect it'd not have made it through).<p>- if you hit the ""CHECKING OFF"" switch, and then do some mucking about, and turn the ""CHECKING ON"" switch, two things could happen: your code could be correct, or it could have errors. If it's correct, yay! Parse it again and be done with it. If it's not correct, though, you (the editor writer) have the very fun task of trying to smartly parse enough of it to be helpful (and/or to try and reconcile differences between the current and previous versions, re-using as much as you could from the previous version).<p>The root of the problem(s) above are this:<p>- many ""semantic"" edits (like any refactoring) change many different parts of the program; this is mostly independent of whether or not you're looking @ an abstract syntax tree or the raw text, and mostly independent of how structured or not your code style is. If you write a function, any place it gets used is a long-distance-dependency in the a.s.t.<p>- your structure editor needs to be smart wrt to such multiple-step editing transactions, while retaining enough power to provide actual benefits over a plaintext editor.<p>- And: not all languages have structures that are well-defined enough to make building a structure editor a tractable undertaking. C++ is far and away the worst offender here: you can approximate the grammar pretty easily, but a ""correct"" parsing is pretty nontrivial (see here for some details: <a href=""http://www.nobugs.org/developer/parsingcpp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobugs.org/developer/parsingcpp/</a> ).<p>A good design for a structure editor would somehow make sure that that ""approximateness"" of the grammar didn't handicap you, in the case that what you were trying to do was running into one of the ""approximations"".<p>Lastly: I'm not trying to discourage you, just trying to warn you of the challenges people who go down this route tend to encounter. I'd spend some time thinking about the stuff above, but a lot more time thinking about a sensible user interface for working with your editor; any workable solution you come up with is going to benefit immensely more from an intuitive-and-efficient user interface than from getting the parsing-and-enforcement-model 100% correct on day one.<p>It's football time got to go.",1232309299

Your financial situation is likely not better than it was, but I sold almost $15,000 alone, as did 2 other people in the TV department. As a store, we made 275% to our budget today.

That flow would've been nice, and might have been able to save our company...<p>...I don't know what's worse: the vultures at the liquidation companies that mark prices up before marking them down and will fire a CC employee for taking off 11% instead of 10% if their math was wrong, or the vulturesque customers that complain that they're getting ripped off on the sale that they were never forced to make...  Picking at a dead and rotting company's carcass when it could have been saved is why I call you [the liquidation companies and customers] vultures.""",1232309201

The most heartbreaking experience of the whole ordeal, were the customers that showed up on that day. These were not the same people that usually came to our store. Something had changed.

Not one person said they were sorry to hear myself and thousands of others would be losing our jobs. No one, not a single one gave a damn.<p>The only thing on their minds was how much money they were saving. They asked how much a certain product was marked down, and regardless of my answer would then demand that I take off more. When I tried to explain I was not allowed to lower the price further, many would become angry, some would actually start screaming!
