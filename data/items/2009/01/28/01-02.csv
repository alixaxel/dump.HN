You can use them for a lexing step, but you're probably better off using something like yacc or LPEG for the parsing.<p>Forth, Factor, and other stack-based languages also have this same property of ""syntax agnostic representation"". While on the surface they're kind of a backwards Lisp (due to postfix notation, with intermediate results pushed on a stack), both are dealing with nested lists of symbols, and very adept at dealing with things expressed the same way.",1233107877
