The engineering program was so-so, and they valued ABET over actual learning.<p>Senior Design was known as the ""gauntlet,"" not necessarily due to the actual building of something, but for the 100-page research paper that they required. They assumed that if each member of the team writes about 25 pages, then they <i>must</i> understand the underlying concepts.<p>This didn't affect me as much as it did my team. As you can tell, my long-windedness knows no bounds when behind a keyboard. My team however had the collective grammatical know-how of [insert punchline here].<p>It was my job to proofread the paper. It was straight copy and paste. Utter bullshit.<p>And I understand that it was my ethical obligation to correct this, if not report it. But it was clearly stated at the beginning of the class: ""if one fails, you all fail."" I was not prepared to deal with that. So I compromised my standards and just finished the assignment.<p>I knew that there wouldn't be repercussions; all they do is count the number of pages, make sure there isn't too much whitespace, and that there's no more than 50% of space devoted to pictures.<p>What can be done? With this particular example there was a large discrepancy with the overall goals that <i>should have</i> been, the goals that were, and the metrics that they measured it.",1233197955

One of the chapters tells the story of Steven Brill a man who, after hearing New York Cab Drivers were all dishonest, decided to look into it.  He decided to get in a bunch of cabs, pretend to be an out-of-towner and asks to be driven somewhere really close to see if the cab driver would rip him off.  This was the result (from the book)...<p>“One driver out of thirty-seven cheated him.  The rest took him directly to his destination and charged him correctly.  Several refused to take him when his destination was only a block or two away, even getting out of their cabs to show him how close he already was.

455639,comment,455335,455335,0,0,unalone,,,"I said other. Here's my specification.<p>I make web sites to make things that don't already exist. I make web sites I wished already existed. My main user is always myself.<p>Startups fascinate me because so little has been done. Each movement innovates very slightly. One person will add one neat feature to a site and then everybody else steals that and creates a lot of repetitive iterations on that theme.<p>When I work on startups, I kind of reflect that belief. I've had a few ideas - none of them launched until this current one - and with each one I tried to start from nothing and create stuff specifically to meet the content type. I'd call it ""working with art"" but that sounds really snotty. What it means is that I try to make every page I design something special. I want people to click a link and fall in love with the next page that loads. Splash page, deletion page, everything. I like having a site where each page is specially crafted.<p>So that's that. I view money as a similar artistic goal of sorts. I think that creating profit should be as unique as a web site. I guess it's a part of my goal, too - I <i>do</i> want to be filthy rich - but more than that, it's part of the process. I'll know I've made something meaningful when it makes me rich.<p>Glamor? From designing web sites?<p>I like learning new things as I design. Absolutely. But I get experience for everything. I learned graphic design to make a book cover, and in making a book I learned some things that I used for designing a blog theme, and I learned from that to make the first draft of my site's design.<p>Freedom's found everywhere. Maybe I'm young or an asshole, but I've never been in a situation where I feel caged. I would go work at the movie theater with ten sheets of paper and write. When I'm in class I take notes on one page and draft layouts on another. And I've always felt free to refuse to do things. One day in my senior year, I walked out of class, quit my job, and rode my bike to the library, because I felt too restricted doing what I'd been doing for a while. I always feel that freedom that comes from my knowing I'm doing what I want to do.<p>Wow. Long post for a short question, but I guess summarized it's that I make startups because they're there to be made.",1233195881
