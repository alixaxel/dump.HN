If you need to think hard to find even a sector to found a startup in, you're probably doing it wrong.  Not that you can't be successful, and I wish the best of luck to anyone, but it seems like the giants we all know come from founders who started coding to solve some problem, and let the company grow from there on its own, instead of the other way around.",1232247512

Both those articles started off assuming that PHP 'won' something, and then tried to explain why by pointing out good things about PHP and its community. Neither of them started by laying down the contest rules, examining all the contenders, and picking a winner... They started with a winner and worked backwards somehow into the aether.<p>On the other hand, if you just realize headlines are <i>by definition</i> linkbait, you can make the mental substitution of the phrase ""became more popular than any other toy language"" for the word ""won"". Suddenly those articles make more sense, even if they become less controversial (or insightful) in the process.",1232247208

The biggest barrier I have found to starting a company ( or perhaps its another form of procrastination) is finding a field or industry that is sufficiently interesting to me, comparative to alternatives. I am curious as to how you (as an employee or entrepreneur etc) sat down and decided that from today on I am a online retailer, a web consultant, a MD of a Logistics company etc. Did you just choose the field with the most interest to you, did you solve a problem that is personal to yourself, did you follow a methodology of finding a problem like Steve blank suggests?? cheers, cameron",1232247168

I'd also be curious as to how the wind was in relation to the river. Ideally the plane would be pointing directly upwind as it hit the water.<p>However the details worked out (and we pilots love the details) the crew had only seconds to configure and land the plane. Kudos to them for being able to change context and execute a fairly rare maneuver without flaw.

a) Fastest to type in for a user with IDK a 2 year experience in it.
b) Easiest to learn, from scratch.
c) Easiest to retrain for a person that already dominates the other keyboard.
d) Healthiest over a period of 10 years (RSI anyone).<p>Instead of doing an experiment or honestly revising the studies mentioned.  This article spends most of its time, attacking the Dvorak history or ""hoax"" as the author calls it in the end.<p>So this study is neither truly scientific nor truly logical.
Is simply the author trying to support his preconceived notions: ""Dvorak is a hoax"". And using ""ad hominem"" attacks or self selecting studies to support his conclusions.<p>as I mentioned before for real science on keyboards check:

However, one must consider that many NFL players never even graduated from the colleges for which they played and have limited non-sports earning opportunities.  One ex-Browns player in Cleveland is now a Realtor (sadly, a proper noun?) -- he's able to use his celebrity status to woo clients. Most aren't so lucky.  Is it that being a Rhodes scholar results in high lifetime earnings, or is it that the skills/aptitude/drive required to earn this scholarship are the cause?",1232246323

I was actually looking for that to illustrate the fate of most aircraft that attempt to ditch in water.<p>And yes, I should have been more clear, ""gear"" would include landing gear (duh), engines, flaps, elevators, or anything else that might ""snag"" on contact with the water and cause this sort of outcome. The larger the aircraft, the harder it is to prevent this. There is a water landing emergency checklist that usually includes retracting the wheels, pulling in the flaps, etc but the angle and levelness of contact here was all art. Very cool to watch.
