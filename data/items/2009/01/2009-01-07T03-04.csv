This framework can be represented in many different languages (primarily N3 and XML), and is quite well-understood amongst semantic web people. The trouble is how to associate RDF 3-tuples with (X)HTML elements.<p>To take the date example from the original article, <span id=""date1"">May Day next year</span> could be represented in a machine readable format be the following 3-tuple.

Perhaps a new element could even be introduced (just one) that allows the direct embedding of RDF content in a manner similar to the embedding of CSS content via the <style> element.<p>This solution would have the benefits of being extensible, flexible, robust and well-understood.

Q Are there any know solutions to preventing this behaviour?""</i><p>I think the real problem with trying to achieve something is a combination of not <i>""knowing how""</i> and thus having ""no way to estimate"" what it takes and just give up.  For example,  if I said to you, <i>""go and walk 1000Km over hilly terrain""</i> most people would probably give up because it seems impossible to do?<p>But if I said, <i>""could you walk 10Km a day for 100 days?""</i>. This is doable. The second bit is the estimate. Could you <i>""walk the distance in 100 days straight? Or 5 to 6 days out of every 7?""</i> Breaking the big unachievable goal into smaller more achievable goals, you do regularly, means you have an understanding of:<p>- where you are now<p>- how far you have to go<p>- how much effort is required, right now<p>I imagine some peole still might flat out choose not to do 10Km/day five or six times a week, but I imagine quite a few could see that the effort is doable and achievable and not give up. Breaking down the tasks means you are not overwhelmed by the perceptions of impossibility. This could be the reasons kids give up for instance if you tell them to do a task and simply give up. Break it into smaller achievable tasks and you can hack their automatic flake response.<p>Btw I'm at my 330/1000Km.",1231298075

Unless you do some academic research and publish a paper or two before you apply (senior thesis at least), there is little chance you will get into MIT or Stanford.  A friend of mine prolonged his undergrad for a year or two in order to work on some undergrad research for a while and got into MIT that way.  Of course, if you are willing to settle for something other than a #1 school then you could get by without any publications as long as you have an interesting class project or two that you can talk about and you do well on your GREs (remember to study your vocabulary).  Programming experience will not help you get in.  If you can find some kind of research position, that would help, but it could be hard to find a position like that at IBM or HP with your experience.  A better bet would be to look for a prof somewhere that does something you are interested in and go work for him for a while (paid or not).

I think these latter sorts of jobs hurt your chances of getting into a highly respected academic program, though they may make you a better entrepreneur.  I think status in the software community (e.g. at HN or in the open source world) matters little unless someone on your admission committee knows what that status means.  My experience has been that many university professors at Stanford and MIT have no clue about this sort of stuff (though of course some are very well-informed).<p>You should probably ask your current professors for letters of recommendation now and have them sent to your registrar so they can be forwarded on later when you decide to apply.  Unless you have a natural way to continue your connection with your professors it will likely be very difficult to go back to them even a year later and ask for the letter and have them remember you (unless you were a super-star of course).  Just get your letters done now.  You can always have them update the letter in x years if you feel there's something relevant they can add.  More likely than not you'll just be thankful that you already have the letters since you never really maintained contact.  On the other hand, remember that the longer you wait, the more unusual it's going to be for the admission committee to see a letter from so many years back.<p>If you're really serious about wanting to get into one of those programs you could actually move to Stanford/MIT and try to get a research position working with some of the people in those departments.  Or perhaps going to them and asking if there's any companies they would recommend working at prior to a graduate program.",1231297653

But then, it probably doesn't make you buy laundry detergent. But having concepts out there in this form does have an effect.<p>A big one is normalising atheism. Making sure it's not something foreign or taboo. Making people comfortable having it around them. Making sure it's not an extreme position. The immediate things to counter is the idea that atheism is an extreme position, an arrogant position  or a dangerous one.",1231297421

You would need to stay at one place long enough to contribute directly to refereed papers, this will really help your application.  There are a lot of research positions at places that are not big companies, too, and those tend to submit more papers.  Often they are looking for staff programmers and you can ""get in on"" some papers over time as you work hard and make good observations etc.  Or you could be the assistant who is writing the performance harness, etc.<p>The hard part would be getting in the door probably, in my experience anything CS related will usually accept CS graduate students into internships etc. but finding a full time job there with a BS and no previous CS research experience will be tougher.<p>---<p>Academic departments typically only care that you can code well enough to pass their classes.  You need to be able to program, for sure.<p>The better you are, the easier it will be to get through school -- you will need all the time you can get in order to concentrate on algorithms, linear algebra, etc.  But it probably won't you help you too much at application time (unless maybe you have won programming competitions).<p>""<i>Does status in the software community affect acceptance into a CS program?</i>""<p>Probably not too much, unless the program is linked to a software product (like where I work, the University of Chicago CS department and the Globus grid computing community are intimately tied).",1231297203
