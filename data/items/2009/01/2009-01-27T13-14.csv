If 'non-techies' start to have their bosses poking around asking questions about ""so why do I keep hearing that you refuse to use the wiki?"", that'll help.<p>I mean, really. A wiki is about as technical as a whiteboard... they're just being lazy. No one's asking them to make beautifully formatted pages, just get the stuff in there because _that's how we track it_... it's part of their job. They need to realize it.",1233064781

I've basically built my freelance career out of building and selling a set of CMS software and I'm sure others here could say the same.<p>For a simple term like Content Management System, it seems like everyone has a different interpretation of what that means. I think that alone answers you question about whether or not this is a solved problem. There's always going to be some target market with a need that can't be solved with current CMS software.",1233064733

To get bang-for-license-buck you're forced to run on only dedicated hardware.<p>Really annoying because it destroys economies of scale - you have all this bity infrastructure.

Are you arguing that patents shouldn't be available at all, or they should only be granted to those that are a suitable fit for society?<p>This sounds dangerous as I can't really think of anyone suitable to make such a judgement. Even in the later case, you still need an enconomic basis for the patent - or more correctly, the R&D required to gain the patent.<p><i>Even if you're capable to invent a new kind of car, do you have the money to advertise it properly?</i><p>I don't need to invent a new kind of car - if I came up with a valve arrangement that increased efficiency by x% that would be patentable, and I would profit from it.<p>If this invention, say, could be retrofitted to existing vehicles and reduce emissions - then governments might mandate it's use - and I'd profit from that.<p>I don't think a body such as the government should be guiding research. It's a slippery slope to bureaucracy. What you can do is put in place the right framework - e.g. all cars must comply with an emission standard by X - then you create the economic basis for the right inventions to follow.",1233062663
