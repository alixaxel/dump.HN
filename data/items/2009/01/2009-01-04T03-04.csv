Also, under the Danish system, the home owner must have a minimum 20% downpayment which they would lose in case of a default.<p>I think if we just had the simple 20% downpayment rule in the US, we would have avoided a lot of these subprime issues.",1231040954

418951,comment,418339,418339,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Seth's point is good, but there's an answer to, ""Why not have an unlimited budget for positive-ROI advertising?"" In fact, there's three answers:<p>1. Cashflow
2. Budgeting
3. Things change<p>First, you don't get your lifetime value of a customer right away. If you have a huge pile of money, then yes, go for it. But if you bid $100 to get a $20 sale, knowing that you'll get an average of $20/month for two years, that's a really solid buy. Awesome. But if you've got $1000 in the bank right now, you can't go unlimited on that very good buy.<p>Second, budgeting. In a small business, there's probably lots of things that you really can, would, should, and would like to have. A new hire. New tools. More money into advertising is great, but you've got to put money into some stuff that'll never show a positive ROI to fend off barbarians. A bit into legal, a bit into accounting, more than a bit into customer service, upgrading fulfillment/turnaround/uptime, etc. Those are things you can put off forever in name of profit, but it's not such a good idea.<p>Third, one day the world's going to change, and if you have an unlimited advertising budget the month that your super positive ROI stuff produces zero return for whatever reason (might not be the advertising's fault!) then... you go out of business.<p>So you have budgets. Smart businesses immediately pour most of the cashflow from good resources back into them towards the limit, but slowing down and building the foundation so you don't get crippled later is a good play. It's not sexy, but cleaning up and locking down means you don't die when things get ugly.",1231040263

If Jeff said ""one of the children is a girl"", but added ""<i>but we don't know wich one of the two is</i>"", this post would have never existed and we wouldn't have argued so much over nothing.<p>In the world of mathematical conventions you learn in school, the question is understood and you're right.

Obviously in the first case, we don't know if it's X or Y that's the girl, so the set of possible worlds is [(X-G & Y-G), (X-G & Y-B), (X-B & Y-G)], so we get the 2/3 answer.

I think I'd try to survive and move over land until I got to a coastal trading city, and then convince the nearest Lord that I was shipwrecked from a distant, mystical land and try to enter into military or guard service. Then catch up on the local language and customs, do what I can to get land or a title, then try to figure out what modern process improvements I could invent to build a lot of wealth. If I was in a rigid caste system type place, I'd definitely recruit potential great men from non-aristocratic classes and get them working for me.
