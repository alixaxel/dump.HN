431128,comment,430432,430572,0,0,ja2ke,,,"I think that if you drop the semantics and take the article for what it's talking about -- new front-end features you specifically want your user to be using, or at least to investigate and become aware -- then he is wholly right, you should give the UI a bump, tiny or big, if you want someone to notice.<p>Too often a programmer will drop a new button into a list of buttons and then, two weeks later, incredulously ask everyone why they haven't found it yet.<p>(Of course, A UI bump doesn't always just mean cover it with new gloss. Simply moving elements around, creating spacing, changing up the colors or weighting/priority of items in a list can be all the change you need. Obviously not any one of those things arbitrarily... Any piece of UI, regardless of how pretty or ""artistic"" it is, should always have an intent, and the intent in this case is to do something that causes people to investigate your new functionality.)<p>I think the author's Windows calculator example is a great case for this. Over time more functions have been added to that thing, but when its literally another button added to the grid, few people are going to notice it and investigate it. Some will surely come across it because they'll need to perform some mathematical function for the first time, but nobody will actively <i>investigate</i> the calculator for the new stuff because nothing and nobody has told them to.<p>Conversely, if you crack open calculator for the first time on a new PC or new OS install and see that its appearance has been cleaned up across the board, or that a row of buttons has been newly split out and given its own breathing space in the window layout, you might actually look at them and discover what they do.<p>I don't think that this article applies to code improvements under the hood, or even really to improvements to existing functions that will streamline the user experience. This is especially true if those user paths are well traveled. If they're already there, you don't need to bump anything to tell them to go there -- they'll figure it out.<p>It's when new things are added, or when existing-but-underutilized things are beefed up, that adding some new gloss or shifting your design's visual priorities a little bit can go a long way.",1231793860

Even before he entered public life, he began honing not only his political skills, but also his mental and emotional ones. He developed a self-discipline so complete, friends and aides say, that he has established dominion over not only what he does but also how he feels. He does not easily exult, despair or anger: to do so would be an indulgence, a distraction from his goals.

431101,comment,430432,431046,0,0,ja2ke,,,"Exposing the steps and having them each have their own progress bar or ""reset"" the progress bar is always preferable to me as a user, both because I like feeling like I know what my software is doing (even -- or, in some cases, especially -- if it is behind the veneer of plain speech and a nice UI), and also the more fine granularity feeds my boredom and often does ""make it seem quicker."" If you have something to look at and track, you don't feel like it could take forever. Letting people see the light at the end of the tunnel /always/ makes it more bearable. Giving them ""sub-tunnels"" helps that further, I think.<p>Another example of this is online checkout paths. Obviously the fewer pages and fewer form fields a user has to fill out, the better, but even if its just a single page and a confirmation page, I /always/ prefer checkout paths which list the number of steps and number of pages at the top, and indicate how far along in the process I am. It's always so exasperating when online shopping when you think you're about to make a purchase, only to be taken to an unexpected ""confirm everything you just did"" page, followed by two order confirmation pages. Its not the same as an installer or other crunching process, but granulated progress bars get you a surprising amount of mileage in many linear processes you can put your users through.",1231793277

When you first set up account and start a workspace, the first thing it asks you to do is choose the people you want to share it with. This seems ""wrong"" to me. I would expect to be able to set up a workplace, add documents and wotnot and only <i>then</i> be bothered about who I wanted to invite in.<p>2. I then tried to work out how to add an item to a workspace... there were buttons on mouse over for Manage, Share and Delete  - so I sat there trying to find 'Add document'. It wasn't until I eventually clicked on the workspace that I 'entered' it. I wasn't really expecting that 'enter to do something' metaphor. How about a mouse-over 'click to enter message'.<p>3. Add video resource - how about some clue as to the formats you accept. None that I tried. that's for sure. It's a bit distracting to see the Web page URL input go scrolling by on the way to the file chooser.<p>4. Thumbnails of the documents would be good.<p>5. The Black pallette really isn't to my taste.<p>6. The big one... without the ability to actually edit Word or Excel files (as opposed to annotate), it isn't really a collaborative tool in my opinion, I'll probably keep using Google Docs or Drop Box and I suspect others will too. Sorry, it's a lovely idea apart from that. I'm not sure I can even see myself using it with the free account.",1231791458

431046,comment,430432,430565,0,0,potatolicious,,,"But how often is a progress bar actually related to ""progress"" in the simplistic sense, like sorting through a bunch of identical items?<p>More often we use progress bars to represent progress through a multi-step process, each one of indeterminate duration. This IMHO is a mis-use of the progress bar.<p>A far better way to do it is to <i>show</i> the user the steps you are moving through, and have an individual progress bar for each (if performance is expected to be linear), or simply an activity indicator. Check/grey items out as they become completed.<p>[edit] Another note: A lot of times progress bars are not backed up by correct code. For example, if you are, say, compressing a bunch of files - the progress bar should not represent how many files you have finished, but rather the <i>size</i> of those files. Too often progress bars are used to signify a quantity that is not closely correlated with TIME.",1231791166

You <i>can</i> sometimes bring things back.*<p>Often it's not really sensory at all; it seems to work at a higher, conceptual level. For example, I once looked in a mirror and saw myself, but recognized different people, with different personalities, my mother, my siblings, my different personalities.<p>I looked out into a room, and I saw all the elements, but my experience of it was flat, as if someone took a picture and laid it out on paper. Then the shading in the picture implied lighting, which quickly implied depth. Objects rotated into consciousness. I saw a tree, and then suddenly the existence of leaves and branches screamed out to me, as if to say ""we are entities too! we are not simply parts of the tree! we are objects of our own."" A friend of mine was standing near, but still. At a conceptual level, my perceptual experience of her was of an extremely accurate <i>statue</i> of her. As in ""my, what a life-like Sarah<i></i>."" And then she moved, and she was animate again, a real person.<p>A friend of mine studies perception. He tells me there's a lot of evidence for these kinds of 'perceptual layers,' and that a lot of the subconscious visual classifications that I was experiencing. Self, not self. Person, not person. Animate, not animate. Object, not object. Flat, not flat. One expects it's the sort of thing that we do naturally, for many other sorts of things. Male, female, old, young, intelligent, dim, aware, tired, happy, sad, etc. And it's the sort of thing that neural networks can do, too.<p>So I definitely think that there are things that you can bring back. I think if you try hard, you can hold on to the experience, and see how much of it makes sense in the real world. But I'm not sure this is the experience of most people. I hear lots about people seeing pretty colors.<p>* Note, all this happened on half a hash brownie, alone. This experience suggest that I stay away from anything harder.<p><i></i>Name changed to protect the innocent.",1231791120
