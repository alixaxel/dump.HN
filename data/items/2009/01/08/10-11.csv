424736,comment,424667,424667,0,0,cgranade,,,"OK, I'll admit that color barcodes are cool, but there's several problems with this:<p>* There's no compelling usecase that cannot be accomplished with existing technologies like QR-code.<p>* Routing all Tag traffic though MS systems is just asking for abuse. For instance, with this setup, MS could retroactively yank a Tag that they didn't like.<p>* As others have pointed out, there's still a lot of black-and-white only printers out there, so without support for a fallback scheme, you'd need both a Tag and a QR-code app on your phone.<p>* Is the color barcode technology patented (forgive me if I missed that in the article)? If so, then that shuts out alternate implementations. What if MS decides to pull an MSIE for Mac kind of stunt and pull non-WinMo versions of Tag once it gets popular?<p>I don't mean to be an ass; MS Research came up with yet another great idea. No, my problems are with the productization of the color barcodes.",1231411744

Defining what a ""right"" is and what it is not would lead to endless discussion.<p>In any case, I would say that instead of discussing in rather vague terms whether more government is better / worse than less government, it would be sensible to think of what kind of government.<p>By principle, I believe that goverment bureaucracy and interference should be kept to a minimum. However, I would rather live under a Scandinavian-like government (even though it's <i>big government</i>) than in a Somalia-like anarchy.

Another downside is that the government can easily be inflated with lobbyists to carry out a corporation's dirty work.<p>Libertarianism by itself is flawed because many corporations will establish monopolies or duopolies, stop innovating, raise prices, and call it a day.",1231411208

For a retailer investor, that might mean a margin call causing you to liquidate what you held with your brokerage.  There are safety requirements (imposed by the government and your brokerage) to make sure you cover the liability.<p>But when you're talking about billion dollar bets, you probably didn't fully secure it.  Nope, you put your reputation up for collateral instead -- ""You can trust us to say this billion dollar chunk of stock will be returned on time to the very minute because we have NEVER FAILED TO DO SO, EVER"".<p>You really need that capital bit to be true because, if not, you'll never be permitted to do this again by your counterparties.  If that happens, say goodbye to your hedge fund -- actually securing the size of bets you are making is murderously expensive.<p>Do you understand why this means you're willing to pay literally any price to satisfy the short according to schedule?  If you don't, your firm is finished as a going concern.<p>This is the same reason why no fund family will allow their money market funds to break the buck.  They'll invariably kick in their own money to keep it solvent because the alternative means ruin.  (The Reserve, which broke the buck earlier in the financial crisis and was not able to kick in funds from other sources, is probably finished, even though the FDIC is now insuring money market funds.)",1231410784
424718,comment,424090,424460,0,0,cgranade,,,"I mostly agree, but I must take slight issue with the point about imposing a significant cost being morally unquestionable. Microsoft, to follow the example, has gained an unfair monopoly, and has exploited such to prevent possibly superior products from reaching acceptance. Moreover, Microsoft has abused the patent system to shut out still more potential competitors, and enforce vendor lock-in (see, for example, patent disputes with OOXML). Thus, I submit that Microsoft imposes a disproportionally large cost to society for what benefits it gives, and therefore can be said to be acting in an immoral fashion. That is, Microsoft makes their profits directly at the cost of society's happiness, which is immoral by a utilitarian view.<p>Now, far be it for me to pick at MS in exclusivity-- they were simply a convenient example. Rather, I only mean to illustrate that the moral questions of a monopoly in technology (be it hardware or software) are not completely dissolved in an affluent society, but only reduced.",1231410641

The other point about this blog post: a 16 year old business studies student would point out, why didn't you do any market research?
