This easily turns into political hell with you in the middle.<p>- The more specific you are in your businessplan the more it will come back to haunt you. If you wrote it and it turns out not to be the way you said it's your falut.<p>- Nobody actually reads updates to business plans, thus rendering them unusable.<p>Some of these can of course be remedied, but it's a lot of hard work.

425491,comment,424665,424851,0,0,pelle,,,"I agree as well. Too many people in the US use the term ""liberal"" or ""socialist"" without really understanding what that means. The same seems to be very much true at the moment about libertarians. Zed who I have a world of respect for doesn't seem to have the faintest idea what a libertarian is. What he describes is a centrist Republican.<p>I grew up a Socialist in a Socialist house hold. I spent much of my teenage years in all kinds of ""important"" positions in a socialist party in Denmark.<p>Then I became an entrepreneur and my whole world view changed. I didn't read Ayn Rand or any libertarian literature until 15 years later, but my world view changed completely during a year and I became what I later realized was a Libertarian. Most of my opinions are based on observation.<p>This also frustrates me sometimes with other libertarians (and in particular Republican's) is that they don't understand where socialists come from, so they often have difficulties communicating with them.<p>I understand all the arguments socialists make because I used to make them. But I also understand that their reasoning is based on absolutely flawed understandings of economics and human behavior.<p>I would recommend anyone reads Marx's Communist Manifesto <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Manifesto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Manifesto</a> as it expresses the basic ideas behind not just Communism, but socialism as a whole and to a somewhat smaller extent the more left wing parts of the Democratic party in the US.<p>It would also be useful if Republicans, ""liberals"" and socialist had a quick read of Adam Smith's truly profound Wealth of Nations as this is kind of the libertarian equivalent of Marx's writings. So they would actually have a clue what we believe.

425456,comment,424835,424891,0,0,twopoint718,,,"I learned Dvorak over a summer break late in high school/early college (about 10 years). I was never a very good typist, so maybe this colors my 'switch' story. I think that I just generally have a hard time with feats of manual dexterity (no musical instruments, etc.), so I consider myself about the worst case scenario for QWERTY Dvorak switch time; I hope this gives someone who's on the edge the push to give Dvorak a try. It took me about 2 weeks to be able to use it such that it wasn't aggravating, 3 and I was using backspace way less, 4 I could use IM, 5 I was faster than I ever was with any QWERTY method and in 6 weeks it was very natural. So if you think it'll be a painful ordeal, just think that you'll almost certainly do better than me.<p>I'm also a post-Dvorak Emacs user. The way that Emacs works is just wired into my fingers now, I don't have to think about what the keys are, I just think ""Find file"" or ""Suspend Emacs"" etc. Some chords are probably a little tougher to do, but they are the exception rather than the rule. If there is a weird fringe benefit of Dvorak use it is that it makes me <i>way</i> more reluctant to reach for the mouse in any circumstance. I've never moved the keycaps on my keyboard (so there is no ""cheating"" while looking down) and so I have to depend on my fingers always being on the home row. I have to agree with Steve Yegge (""Effective Emacs"") and consider using the mouse to be a pretty grave cache miss.<p>I'm a relative newbie to vim but I have no trouble moving around, I just developed a ""feel"" for where the HJKL keys go. It is hard to describe but you can kind of ""unroll"" their directionality in your brain. In some ways vim is nice (although it won't ever move me from solid Emacsity) in that the commands are simple letters which Dvorak makes really easy and comfortable to hit.",1231442562

It's only that in their install.rdf file, they specified 3.0.*.  I changed it to 3.1b2pre and re-built the extension and it seems to work great under Minefield.

I made the switch concurrently with changing to a TypeMatrix keyboard (<a href=""http://typematrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typematrix.com/</a>).  TypeMatrix keyboards aren't radically different (cf. DataHand), but they are radically better.  They don't stagger the keys, and they place #\Newline and #\Backspace in the center of the keyboard so you aren't contorting your pinky finger for these common keys (the source of an unbelievable amount of typing pain).<p>Once you type for a few minutes on a TypeMatrix (Qwerty or Dvorak), you come to understand the gross insanity of continuing to stagger the keys on a modern keyboard.<p>The TypeMatrix keyboards are switchable (via hardware) between Qwerty and Dvorak with a function key.  I use X/loadkeys mapping most of the time anyway, but this is quite useful for boot prompts, BIOSes, and new installations.<p>As for learning Dvorak if you're already a fast typist, I like to say that it feels similar to how people describe quitting cigarette smoking (I've never had to do that personally).  That is, for the first few weeks typing is a conscious process, and painfully slow (I got up to 20 wpm after just a couple days, but getting back up to 100+ wpm takes awhile).  So what happens is that things come up, you have to send an email out quickly, or you need to debug some pressing problem, and you'll feel a powerful, <i>visceral</i> urge to switch back, just temporarily, so you can bang out the email or solve the problem.
