Why does a heavy aircraft float for even a minute?</i><p>What an odd question to ask.<p>1) They can be seen floating in air, why not water which is 800 times denser?<p>2) The weight seems to have an issue in the asker's thought process. Battleships float, and they weigh about 600 times as much as an airbus 320.<p>3) Maybe there is something about the ""sink eventually"" time constant that causes confusion. Perhaps battleships get an exemption because they remain floating for long periods. If you can live the lie long enough, people will believe you.<p>Now let's review some answers we get at fluther by ""tapping the collective"":<p><i>There is air inside it, making it somewhat buoyant. Think about how a submarine works.</i><p>Using a sinking object to explain floating is not going to win points for clarity.<p><i>like the titanic. when the ship was cracked into half, the other half stayed like 1 minute before sinking into the deep sea. i would say its due to the buoyant force by the water acting on the ship is temporarily higher than the weight of ship because the ship breaking into two releases the water contained in the in the ship. Or probably the sinking of the other half of the ship displaces the water to generate force to support the remainning half.</i><p>A whiff of truth passes through this answer, but it is fleeting. ""the ship breaking into two releases the water contained in the in the ship""?? I can't even begin to fathom what leads to that statement.<p><i>They are designed to do so.\nThe bottom half is a sealed compartment (full of air), they do eventually sink, but by NTSB saftey guidelines they are required to remain aflote for a certain period of time.</i><p>Ignoring the ""by definition"" aspect, this answer has truth in it, but I like the part where they stay afloat for a ""certain period of time"" because of NTSB requirements. I imagine a plane buoyed solely by the power of government mandate.<p>(And just to clear some of the misinformation in the article's comments: A rear door of the airbus was opened and did let water in, and the pilots allegedly neglected to throw the ""ditch switch"" which closes various openings to prevent water entry. The engineering team for the airbus deserves a big round of applause.)",1232480355

442130,comment,437824,441974,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"You're misunderstanding me. The link between benefits and utilization is that in order to gain future benefits you spend a certain amount on capital goods, based on your expectation of utilization. You must have an idea of utilization because that's what determines cost and hence profit. That's the link I was talking about and it doesn't contradict your parked airplanes example at all.<p>The original question we were discussing was whether buying excess resources was economically sustainable. I think we can agree that economic sustainability depends on profits. Higher costs reduce profits and therefore threaten economic sustainability.<p>Now, you say the connection between utilization and costs is not always strong. No, it's not always strong, but it is strong enough for entire industries to focus on exactly that issue.<p>People are fired right now because they cannot be ""utilized"". Planes are rented away so they do not rot in AZ hangars. It's because machines lose value over time. Owning them without being able to make money out of them means you lose money every month. So spare capacity becomes a huge problem if growth doesn't meet expectations.<p>Paying only for the resources you actually use increases flexibility and reduces costs. If your expectations are wrong, you haven't spent the money buying the hardware either. Many dot coms would've been very happy to accept that logic in 2000.<p>But of course you pay a premium for that flexibility and if it turns out your growth expectations were right, you may have been better off not paying that flexibility premium. It's an insurance contract against the risk of wrong expectations.",1232480104

The unanswered question is: would it be worth that much to Microsoft to acquire a mobile phone company that has completely lost its relevance and marketshare outside North America, and has little to do with Microsoft's business-oriented Windows Mobile strategy?<p>Palm under Microsoft would become the ""Zune phone"" -- a vertical integration experiment detached from the goals of the rest of the company. But didn't Microsoft already buy Danger (maker of Sidekick/HipTop/whatever) not long ago? It's possible Danger is already working on something along those lines, but with more Windows integration than Palm's web-oriented Linux+WebKit device provides. Where would Palm fit in?",1232478080

My partner's girlfriend at the time was a model so I asked her to get us a meeting with her bookers. Her [strong] opinion was that for a variety of seemingly good reasons (too long to list here) web video would never work in the modeling industry and we were pretty much wasting our time.<p>Five minutes later, on a completely unrelated topic, she mentioned that her best friend, also a model, was going on a video shoot that week. Turned out her agency (Wilhelmina) thought this new online video thing was, ya know, promising.<p>I am still scratching my head over that one.
