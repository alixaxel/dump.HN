They're the generation that decided that, while their parents paid for their education, kids should really pay for theirs (paying for zero educations in their lifetime while each other generation will pay for 1).  They're the generation that has decided anything that costs money can be shuttled onto future generations through debt.  They're the generation that paid too little in Social Security and Medicare taxes who are gearing up to fight for expanded benefits paid for by their children.<p>We'll see if Gen Y decides to be as entitled.  Yeah, Baby Boomers get annoyed with Gen Y kids who think they know everything when they don't.  Most people in my generation think they're a ton smarter than they actually are and think that minimal work should result in great reward. Maybe we're no better than the baby boomers, but I resent this implication that we think the world revolves around us.  The baby boomer generation seems to like to forget that part of their success was that they were able to shift burdens onto others (often their children).<p>I guess I should apologize for how I started off this comment.  It was too harsh.  I got a little too aggravated by the article and being lectured down to by a generation whose greatest accomplishment was being born in the only industrialized nation not bombed out by WWII and, therefore, had the opportunity to create with barely any competition.  OK, I'm still aggravated.  I'm sorry.<p>Most people are hardworking folks and this author is trying to appeal to the few that are probably less hardworking and want to blame society on someone else.  It happens all the time - it's those immigrants that are making your life suck and the like.<p>I think we'd all be better off if we remembered who we are really - not the idealized vision we have of ourselves.  Baby Boomers went through a period of pot smoking and being lazy.  Before them, dating was the hot button being seen as a waste of time and a disregard for morality.

It's just that adequate compensation <i>is</i> important, meaningful recognition matters, etc.<p>Being enthusiastic about your job matters, but the big tech companies that recruit the cream of the crop (Google, Amazon, etc.) pay well above market rates, and don't seem to be suffering a lack of quality.",1232039074

435320,comment,435192,435192,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Being born in 1981, which according to wikipedia is the last year of Gen X, the following year, 1982, being the beginning of Gen Y, I consider myself more of a Gen X'er than a Gen Y'er. That said, just from the point of view of software, it is not fair I don't think to call Gen Y ""entitled"" because there is a lot more to know about technology than there was even 10 years ago. To keep up, people always need to be learning new things. So Gen Y has a burden unlike any previous generation of just the vast array of knowledge of different programming languages, etc. they need to be able to compete - a vast breadth of knowledge, if not depth. So it is really uncalled for to call Gen Y ""entitled"" as a whole group. Sure there are ""spoiled brats"" in every generation, but we cannot make these kinds of generalizations, especially in the technology sector. And even the whole notion of this article displays archaic thinking, regarding the job market, at least in technology. The whole ""get a job"" thing has been more replaced with ""get a gig"", i.e., people are more into independent contracting/consulting etc. than before, so Gen Y is not necessarily the same as Gen X in terms of trying to find a long-term employment, at least in technology. It is more a generation of independent consultants that is coming up. This article is wrong from top to bottom, wrong in calling Gen Y ""entitled"" and wrong to think that the ills of the job market are going to finally be all that damaging to them, since they are more independently minded than their predecessors. A response to this could be: What happens when deprecated purveyors of old technology get hit with web 2.0 and 3.0? The answer is they get replaced. By the same Gen Y they so despise.",1232038858
