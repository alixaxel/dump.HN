For many, $72/mo plus bandwidth might be a bit much for what they're doing if it can work on a 512MB Xen instance for under $40 with a few hundred gigs of transfer included.<p>Beyond that, drive snapshots aren't the easiest things to do.  I know that Right Scale tells their customers to freeze the drive so that no changes can occur until the backup is complete.  With S3 performance around 20MBytes/sec, to backup 1GB would take around a minute.  That's not bad and only doing deltas it's unlikely you're going to have a huge amount to backup at any given time, but it isn't exactly good either.  With file-level backup, you can do a mysqldump and then just back up that file.  Eh, maybe I'm just preferring the devil I know in this situation.<p>It's a little more complex to set up (doing file-level backups), but if you're going the volume route, you need to make sure you don't leave the drive in an inconsistent state.<p>All that said, EBS is awesome.

The only two real reasons why I use Gmail and not Outlook are:<p>- I can access it online from anywhere without configuring much.<p>- Because of the good spam filter, saves me from installing Mail Washer or other anti spam tools.<p>Couple of things I don't like about Gmail:<p>- Still doesn't have folders (labels are OK but they don't have any kind of hierarchy).<p>- I miss the drag&drop functionality from Outlook (e.g. mark a couple of emails and drop them into some folder or the trashcan, much faster than having to select the label from that pulldown).<p>- It's missing desktop alerts. Sometimes they are annoying, but with some configuring they are pretty useful at work. I have that Firefox extension to check incoming emails @ Gmail, but I can't configure it to show only certain emails.<p>Of course Outlook isn't perfect either, but I don't think it has been ""destroyed"" yet.",1233361063

The difficulty of netbooks penetrating the corporate environment isn't just performance, it's also a combination of the desktop form and the support that corporations want.<p>Soon, netbook performance will become comparable with laptops, but that alone won't make Microsoft's empire fall.
