(university was the last time I looked at any QM though, so I'm a bit rusty on the specifics) Maybe they mean doing so <i>during</i> the entanglement process, in which case the benefit is that you now have two particles holding the wave function of the result (or rather a related one holding the same information), and being atoms, they could represent the quantum equivalent of mass storage.

445659,comment,445378,445560,0,0,azanar,,,"> Even with my noise-canceling headphones, I can never escape the feeling of movement and noise around me.<p>If you are anything like me, the root cause may not be the noise and movement. It may instead be the anticipation that the noise and movement is someone who is about to pull you out of your flow. Even if it doesn't happen that often, the psychological jolt that occurs every time it does is enough to make my mind resist concentrating when potential distractions are around. Noise-canceling headphones do nothing against a tap on the shoulder.",1232669606
445658,comment,445641,445641,0,0,brandonkm,,,"It really depends on the part of the country you're in (or interested in moving to).  I grew up in North Carolina where lots of families move to raise kids.  Growing up, I saw growth of epic proportions.  Families would migrate in droves to the triangle area from places like Ohio, Massachusetts, and New Jersey (this is still going on and the whole region is having some pretty serious growth problems).  From what I gathered back then, and looking back on it now, I would say that good schools, good climate, nice people, safe area, reasonable cost of living, good colleges in state, and a nice outdoor environment are all paramount.  These are mostly the reasons that people move to areas like where I grew up ( Cary, North Carolina).",1232669578

Recently I discovered that this also works if I rise early, _very_ early. This month, I've been waking up at 3am and accomplishing a LOT, until about 10am, when the outside world comes alive. It's nice because my mind is sharp -- I get to wake up and do something I love. I'm not racing against the urge to fall asleep, like when I code at the end of my day.<p>The downside is that I go to bed at 6pm every night...
