It's about hardware infrastructure that can scale automatically, or at least programmatically, without having to add physical devices to the network.<p>If you are going to use a /new/ term to describe something, use it to describe something that actually /is/ new, not something that has been around for 15 years!  That's why people get sick of marketing ""gurus"" and journalists who keep redefining stuff to mean the same old thing that they thought they understood, but really they have no clue...<p>Cloud computing actually is something new and it's powerful and it is going to change the world.  Just like the Internet did.  But please remember that Cloud computing is a subset of the Internet, not the /entire/ internet!<p>If you marketing/journalist/(know nothing but want to capitalize on it) types want to redefine cloud computing to mean anything accessed over the Internet, then that too is changing the world.  We said it would change the world and it DID change the world.<p>Look around. According to another link on HN right now, only 25% of America /isn't/ on the web.  That's amazing considering almost no one was on the web just 15 years ago.<p>The problem here is that people think, ""OMG, The Internet is going to change everything!"" like people are going to be driving to work over the Internet!<p>Oh wait, people don't even /need/ to drive to work anymore because of the Internet.  people don't need cars because of the internet.  They work from home because of the internet. They order pizza and groceries and pay their phone bills over the internet.<p>Okay fine, you want to redefine cloud computing to mean ""anything accessed over the internet"" and then you want to argue that it's hype and it won't change the world?<p>Well it already has.<p>Look around.",1232726094

(it probably should redirect back to the page you were looking at, from a usability POV...) The async version uses the onclick event attribute to call the vote() JS function, which returns false to cancel the anchor click navigation after dynamically generating a new image with the vote URL as src attribute. If anything in vote() throws an exception, vote won't return false to cancel the navigation, so you get taken to the (blank) non-JS vote page.<p>I can't see anything at first glance that would throw an exception, however.",1232725907

After some number of years, other people from those companies may have moved on as well.  Keep in touch with all of them (e.g. linkedin).  This is how I got my first consulting contract.

446466,comment,446165,446402,0,0,cchooper,,,"An increase in the value of the dollar is not an increase in total wealth (and similarly, a fall is not a loss of total wealth). A change in the value of assets is always a transfer of potential wealth from one person to another. This change may stimulate wealth-creating opportunities in the economy (e.g. increasing bond values will encourage the creation of more bonds, which means more investment in productive business) or it may thwart them (e.g. the loss of value of sub-prime securities has frightened people away from lending) but the price change itself doesn't create or destroy real wealth (goods and services).<p>If dollars were to rise in value, it would constitute a transfer of wealth away from people with debts and towards people with cash savings. The first effect is that people will no longer be able to service the increasing real value of the interest on their debts, leading to default.<p>But the more serious secondary effect is that a rising dollar encourages people to hoard money rather than spending it, as dollars tomorrow will be worth more than dollars today. The result is a liquidity crisis, where everyone refuses to consume or invest. The liquidity squeeze makes dollars even more valuable, and so the effect is self-perpetuating, until eventually the economy grinds to a halt.<p>The worst historical example of deflation is the Great Depression, where local communities were having to invent their own currencies to make up for the extreme dollar shortage. The Great Depression is the reason central banks have positive inflation targets. Although inflation is bad, a small amount of inflation is a fair price if it reduces the risk of self-perpetuating deflation.",1232724827

I don't think it necessarily does any harm, but I think the article kind of misses the mark if you are someone that is really faced with this issue.<p>I would argue that picking the language also depends very much on the domain/platform/target you are writing software for.  Is it a web application?  Is it a desktop GUI app? Is it an RIA -- for web or desktop? Is it a scientific application that needs great math libraries?  What are the performance characteristics?  Does it need cross-platform support?  Is it a distributed business enterprise system?  Is it an embedded system?  Is it a library?  Do you want the library to be able to be used by many different platforms and languages?  Does it have to integrate with other systems and what languages are those written in?  What about 5 years down the road -- how do you think it will evolve?<p>Most likely -- answering the question on what the domain/platform/target will be will trim you to a very short-list of options.  For example, if you are programming for an embedded system, you may have to use C because that's the only language you'll find compiler support for.  Maybe there will be a C++ compiler -- but whether or not you choose it can depend on a lot of factors such as whether your team is comfortable with C++/OO...whether you even want to utilize OO...whether you can afford the additional memory/complexity associated with the features of C++...etc.",1232724507

So, every Windows Mobile user who has downloaded Opera Mini to <i>try</i> it is considered an active Opera Mini user?  Hogwash!

We'd love to have you as an employee, but a person building their own business and riding on the salary we (a small business ourselves) pay while they do it is not welcome.<p>Every employer I had before heading off and starting my own company had an air-tight IP policy which basically owned my software-developing ass.  That makes sense:  You're either an employee or an owner, you don't mix the two.",1232723142
