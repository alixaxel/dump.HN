451209,comment,450997,451169,0,0,Jd,,,"You hit at the fundamental difference between my approach and others, which may make mine better or worse (certainly worse if nothing ever comes of it, and 'revolutionary' if it does and it is a fundamentally new way of looking at things with some utility).<p>Here is an example of why I would start with modeling the human side (essentially sociological) instead of simply 
modeling the data. Suppose what we want to model and improve is an academic journal. What will our data be? Submissions to the journal? Articles published by the journal? Should corrected articles re-submitted also be included?<p>What we have is essentially data coming to a node (a human editor) and then sorted by viability, then sent back to the originators when a certain criteron is reached (an article that needs corrections in order to be published), the item is returned in better form, and then various items are collated and released as a journal.<p>The essential work here is the human side, and I know of no possible way to capture the necessary <i>qualitative</i> aspect merely by analyzing the data stream. For instance, is there anything we can say simply from analyzing Twitter feeds without attaching labels assigning some worth?  We can talk only about quantity, but not quality. And if we talk about quality (e.g. we create a point system and posts that Pg or Chad Fowler reads are worth twice as many points in our system) then we are introducing a human element, that may in some sense be arbitrary, or even if it is not arbitrary it does not follow necessarily from the our purely mathematical modeling structure.<p>Admittedly in my case study, the academic journal, we also haven't discussed anything about the type of journal and whether or not there is quality of content. That is because I desire to provide a platform to allow different groups of people to assign their own value to things they find important, even if I might not find it especially so myself (i.e. post-modern literary criticism).",1233009670
451208,comment,450926,450926,0,0,physcab,,,"In my experience (and I'll preface this by saying that I'm not quite an expert yet) ASP.NET is fairly easy to bring people with no web experience up to speed.  Our development company switched from LAMP to ASP.NET, C#, and MS SQL Server.  While I wasn't involved in the decision-making process, I did ask them why they switched as I came from a LAMP background.  They said that their company gets all of their employees from their internship program, and it was easier to train interns with all of the standardized tools that Microsoft puts out.  Plus there is a pretty good community of .Net developers that makes the training process easy.  It took me far longer to learn PHP than it did to learn C#, but maybe that's because my coding experience is better now than it was then. :)",1233009273
451207,comment,450460,451004,0,0,unalone,,,"Yeah, I like watching the debate swirl around stuff like this. It's fascinating stuff.<p>Trolls aren't the only people who're disruptive. It depends on intent. Trolls do it just to cause pain. But if you get that shirt primarily to shock people into a new way of thinking, then it's not trolling. For instance, I'm considering getting the ""slaves get shit done"" shirt I mentioned. I don't typically wear shocking shirts, but I thought that one was genuinely funny. The point of <i>wearing</i> a shirt like that wouldn't be offending people. It would be to slowly make these more controversial topics (slavery humor, foul language) acceptable in the mainstream. It raises the question of what's acceptable to wear on clothing. My view is everything goes, and I figure that getting a shirt like that might help spread the message.<p>Cheap? I dunno. Some of the jokes are, some are legitimately clever. Yeah, they're all shocking, but some are shocking in the way that ""Rednecks"", the Randy Newman song, are. (That song is sung from the point of view of some rednecks ""keepin' the niggers down""; some people miss that the point of the song is that stereotyping against rednecks is just as bad as stereotyping black people.)<p>But I guess it's a matter of taste.

451198,comment,449457,449457,0,0,crpatino,,,"This is of course oversimplified. The argument seems to me like:
1) If you love what you do, you will care. You will go the extra mile to do it right.
2) After a couple of years of doing what you love, and caring, and improving every day, you will be very good at what you do. You will be able to beat most competitors (who don't really care and are in for a quick buck anyway).
3) Assuming your clients can tell the difference, you will never lack work. 
4) Assuming your market is big enough to support you and your more important competitors, you will be able to pick clients, and rise your fees, and have lots of work anyway.
5) Then money follows the good work.<p>Now, there are 2 big assumptions here. One is that the world will be able to figure out how great you are and how lame are most of the others. If they cannot, or doesn't care, you are in a lemon market. The scam artists grow rich and the good practicioners get exploited. Not a nice place to be, unless what you love is take advantage of other people.<p>The other big assumption is that there is enough demand for what you love to do. By example, if you love classic music and want to be a piano concertist, good luck with that. There is not enough demand for that skill to support but a handfull of performers. Unless your talent is that of a genius or have all the right connections, you will not survive long enough to actually learn to play well. Again, not a nice place to be.<p>What you want to do if not to do what you like the most. You want to ask yourself what are those things that you like. Get a list of a dozen items. Cut half of those that seem like lemon markets, the cut again by half those whose market is to small.<p>You will end up with a couple of solid options of what you can realistically pursue.",1233008930

For example, the government could require that (a) the employer sponsoring a new immigrant has to pay six months of the immigrant's unemployment insurance in advance (perhaps put into an escrow account), and (b) if the immigrant is neither employed nor collecting unemployment insurance for more than, say, two months, then the visa is terminated.<p>Another possibility I've seen floated is that the government make only a fixed number of work visas available, but auction them off.

Add-ins have been easy to install, too. (I'm looking at you, Eclipse!)  The .NET Framework has great breadth and depth.  It integrates well with MS SQL Server.  There are plenty of quality 3rd party tools/libraries that work with the stack.  API documentation is easy to get to.  Building install packages is a snap.  Visual designers can make building/understanding components or the database schema easier.  Code generation from the designers can fill in boiler-plate stuff yet still leave it visible if you need to dig around in there by hand.<p>As for ASP.NET WebForms (which is the sample you've given), it was meant to make it easier for Windows Forms developers to do web page design.  WebForms imitates the WinForms structure and calling conventions, so you can make a working web page act more like a desktop app in terms of the programming model.  Obviously, you run into limitations rather quickly because the WebForms abstraction is very leaky.<p>ASP.NET MVC would be a good pick for new projects if you are already an experienced web developer.  You get all the benefits of the .NET stack without the limitations of WebForms.  You get control over the markup that gets generated and it does a good job with separation of concerns.
