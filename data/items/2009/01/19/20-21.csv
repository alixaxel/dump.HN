Maybe buy a tablet PC and use that to prototype, etc.<p>Don't even remotely consider building your own hardware until you have something that <i>demands</i> you do that. Custom hardware is messy, gross, expensive, intolerant of mistakes, long lead time, etc. Figure out if the rest of your business ""works"" before you commit to your own custom hardware.

440874,comment,440348,440720,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"There's a lot of monolithic server side JavaScript packages like Helma, but I want something more modular. Also, Helma is written in mostly Java I believe, rather than JavaScript, which is ok if you don't want to hack on Helma itself (or if you know and like Java), but I'd rather have an all (or at least mostly) JavaScript solution.<p>Anyway, I started working on part of a solution for this: Jack (<a href=""http://github.com/tlrobinson/jack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/tlrobinson/jack</a>), which is like Rack (<a href=""http://rack.rubyforge.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rack.rubyforge.org</a>) but for JavaScript.<p>If you don't know, Rack/Jack are like bridges between webservers and Ruby/JavaScript web apps/frameworks, so framework/app devs don't need to worry about what server they're using, they just write to the Rack API. It also includes ""middleware"" which lets you pre and post process requests, which allows for neat things like intercepting some requests and serving static files, or gzipping responses, etc (in a server agnostic way)<p>Right now it only works with Rhino+Jetty but ideally it will work with a number of JavaScript interpreters and webservers.<p>It also includes a Sinatra-like routing framework (called Roundabout), which lets you define routes like<p><pre><code>    GET(""/user/{username}"", function() {\n        var user = this.wildcards[""username""];\n        // do stuff!\n        return resulting_html;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nJack and Roundabout, combined with your other frameworks of choice, like ActiveRecord.js (<a href=""http://activerecordjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://activerecordjs.org/</a>) make a pretty good solution, I think.",1232397918

For example, the RIAA said that 183 albums were transferred through Dove's server 17,281 times, then multiplied that by the wholesale price of a digital album in 2005 ($7.22) to conclude that its member companies were owed almost $124,769 in restitution, or $47,000 if Dove agreed to be part of an RIAA ""public service announcement"" about piracy. Similarly, Lionsgate said that it owned copyrights to 28 of the 700 or so movies that Dove served up—Lionsgate argued that Dove caused the movie industry to lose some $22 million, and since Lionsgate owned copyrights to about 4 percent of the available movies, it was owed $880,000.</i>",1232397475
