In the Philippines the BEST programmers never earn more than $20 a day working for local companies, and most of them are lucky to earn $7-10 a day. This is not a joke either, I've employed and managed hundreds of them since I moved here 8 years ago and I know exactly what I'm talking about.<p>These freelancer-type sites attract programmers from third-world countries <i>specifically</i> because the opportunities allow them to earn an order of magnitude more money on outsourcing jobs to folks in developed countries than if they took a job working as a programmer for a local company.<p>Unfortunately most of these programmers also think they have to bullshit the folks they are trying to get jobs from, since that's the only way they have to try to distinguish themselves from the other thousand programmers who will apply for the same jobs. So ...<p>To put a strongly worded and very demanding job opportunity like this one online seems to me to be the ideal way to go about finding 'the best of the best' while hoping that everyone else will be scared off.<p>Naturally the advertiser knows that he's fighting an uphill battle to try to find someone who actually knows how to design software rather than just write code, especially when he's looking in low wage foreign countries.  But if all he needs is that one ideal candidate, maybe his ad will discourage most of the riff-raff from wasting his time.<p>His approach of requiring 5 separate unpaid projects is also a great way to weed out the losers.  In third-world countries you can EASILY find lots of guys who will agree to  do little 2-hour projects for no pay if it might mean a very high paying long term job with a foreign company -- and that's exactly what this guy is offering.<p>My guess is that he is giving the exact same tests to every applicant.  That's what I would do in his position, and I've been in his position dozens of times this past decade.<p>In other words, it's an exceptionally well written ad that may produce the precise results the advertiser is hoping for ... and that's a difficult thing to accomplish in a third-world country.",1232329854
