POF users rarely fill out profiles in my exp. What I'm trying to say is that if users are paying for the service they are very motivated to go ahead and actually use the service.",1231037902

I've learned a lot reading your entries.<p>In your 2009 outlook, you wrote some goals, one being: ""I will have to go from 'mr. Do-it-all' to be Balsamiq’s CEO, which will mean having employees, delegating..."" - one thing from personal experience. When you make your first hire, you're going be tempted to get a friend you know is good. My advice: Don't. Your first hires will always see you in the light they had before you were their boss, and since you're growing so rapidly in business and life, it's 95% likely to end poorly.<p>It won't be the end of the world, but I disregarded this advice myself a couple times. Staff will learn and grow with you to some extent, friends to a much less extent. And since you seem like a really nice guy with a soft spot for people, then being in the super difficult position of it not making sense to keep working with someone - but you're their livelihood - will suck more for you than it will for a more heartless person.<p>Your call of course, just have a think over it, and best wishes and much prosperity in 2009.",1231037312

For the second question, the results skew to 1/3 and 2/3 because we're discarding the cases where the answer is 'no'.<p>The light went on for me when Paul pointed out in his update that getting a random answer for ""What is the sex of one of your children?"" eliminates (an unknown) one of BG and GB.",1231036378

418897,comment,418440,418440,0,0,amix,,,"While I really love Python as the language I really hate its primitive implementation. 20% is nothing compared to what would be gained if Python ran on a virtual machine that was JIT'ed.<p>Java for example got a 10 to 20 times performance gain from moving to HotSpot (their JIT'ed VM). And similar gain's have been seen in Chrome's V8 JavaScript VM or Strongtalk.<p>Anyway, it's kind of sad that such a great language has such a braindead implementation :-(<p>And unfortunately, the same thing can be said about Ruby as well.",1231036250

The ultimate rule is that everything written off must have business purpose.<p>Now, you'll only get in trouble if you get audited, but writing off things that shouldn't be written off will stand out.<p>The best way to shelter yourself from taxes is to invest the money and then pay taxes on a long term capital gain (which have historically been lower than ordinary tax rates).",1231036236

418894,comment,418672,418852,0,0,peakok,,,"Ok this thread is confusing. Actually, your second algorithm wasn't the point of my argument. You're right that according to your second formulation, the probability is 1/2, of course.<p>My point is that there is nothing wrong with Jeff's question, and I believed that you made a distinction with the Monty Hall version. But your second algorithm isn't the same as Jeff's question, my mistake.<p>It is very clear that my argument specifically adresses the question the way Jeff has formulated it, so you can even forget the part about ""your second formulation"", what I meant was the question of Jeff and why there is nothing wrong with it.<p>In statistics, it is commonly accepted that we don't know what we don't state (for an obvious practical purpose). Therefore, when we say : ""One of them is a girl"", it is implied that we don't know wich one because we didn't specify it.<p>Therefore there is nothing wrong with Jeff's question (and the probability is 2/3), at least for anyone familiar with basic statistics and probabilities conventions (and I suspect you are), anything else is just quibble. I assumed your argument wasn't about nitpicking this kind of convention, but it turns out I was wrong. I guess nobody wins this one :)",1231035801

There can be miscommunications about what needs to be done, the other person might not understand what the requester likes/dislikes, they might have to ask for extra details etc. and often it may be just faster to do it yourself.",1231035488

I'm sure it is some advertisers who care that Facebook strictly enforce their appropriate use policies.<p>Facebook is simply protecting their revenue stream. If the recent story about Ning shutting down adult networks was any indication, this is a common thread among ad-powered sites.<p>It is unfortunate that this is the way the world (or mainly America) works, but the line has to be drawn somewhere. If you don't draw that line, you wind up with crime dens like Ning dealt with. Facebook, very reasonably, drew the line where the TV networks draw it.

Hashes far below that level are often also less memory efficient since the hash-table is pre-allocated.",1231034464
