One is a schizophrenic who used obscene amounts of ecstasy, shrooms, salvia and DMT throughout his 20s and early 30s. When he was 24, he was popular, a great basketball player, and able to interact normally with other people. At 35, he's incapable of holding a job and has been in trouble with the law countless times. His psychological collapse might have happened anyway had he not been using psychedelic drugs, but I suspect it wouldn't have happened in the same way, and it might have been more manageable.<p>I don't know anyone, though, who has burned out on a small amount of psychedelic drug use. I believe it can probably happen, but I've never seen it.

Hosts may have taken lower margins back when their RAM costs were higher that they are now trying to recoup.  At the very least, they aren't in a hurry to cut prices right now because their costs could go back up again if the economy picks up and RAM prices head upward.<p>2. Hosting is basically a subscription business model.  Subscriber acquisition costs are balanced against total lifetime value of the average subscriber.

What about the, few, independent journalists working out there. They are certainly citizens, yet they don't work for any mainstream news org.<p>And if your definition of CJ is rubbish, then we need search engines and aggregators set in place to help us filter through the crap. Still, this isn't part of the mainstream sources.<p>And I'm having a hard time seeing how you are rationalizing that news orgs like CNN or NBC are <i>not</i> comprised of iffy product placement and factual errors. They report what they want you to hear, not what <i>you</i> want to hear. Fox News, for how much of a news organization than a tabloid they are, reports factual errors on a constant basis. Product placement, have you ever watched the filler crap that CNN or any of them show during the slow news days? Sanjay Gupta, who works for CNN, has continuiously promoted big pharma companies that he has financial interests in.<p>Every news organization, no matter what its name, is biased in one way or another. They have to sell ad revenue or else they'll go off the air, so they show you what they want you to hear. Not what <i>you</i> want to hear. This is where citizen/independent journalism shines and is also a reason why newspapers are failing.

I agree that XML is better for its problem domain than s-expressions, but in that case the whole article is an apples to oranges comparison.<p>He claims that syntax is important, otherwise we'd still be using binary formats. If that's true then the only reason syntax is important is for humans, because machines can read binary formats just as well as anything else. So why compare it to s-expressions instead of to a human-friendly ideal? Is XML the best human-friendly markup language possible? Yes his paragraph is similarly readable in both forms, but would it be if wrapped in XML namespace clauses and an XML Schema? Would the s-expression version be if wrapped in a macro to parse text outside quotes as significant text?<p>The purpose of XML shouldn't be to make everything more XML-y, but to make everything easier. Maybe it does, in big enterprisey systems and between large data silos. Look at the recent ODF v. Office XML file formats. Have any of you been tempted to process Microsoft Office documents directly because now they're XML they must be easier than the old binary formats?<p>It's still not human friendly - you can't use the Jabber protocol by hand over telnet like you can use POP3, SMTP, IRC.",1231810628
