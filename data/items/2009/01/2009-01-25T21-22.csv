This is undeniable but after we are able to accomplish this task whats next? From that point on money is not and should not be the primary driving force.<p>I say primary because there are things in life that people enjoy doing that needs some amount of money. So I would say,<p>a) Find what you love (x)
b) If the process of completing x needs money, then seek the money needed for it.<p>Our ability to do this process well depends on how focused we are. since, it is easy to get distracted in a world filled with things we ""want"".",1232920795

449587,comment,449457,449457,0,0,gcheong,,,"Some problems I have with this saying:<p>1.It implies the money part flows effortlessly from the ""do what you love"" part.<p>From what I've seen, people do something they love and then try and find a way to make money with it. Sometimes they are successful, and sometimes not, but in any case it involves effort to go from doing what you love to doing what you love for money.<p>2.It implies people have one passion or one reason to be on this earth. 
That is crap. You can have several passions or you may have none. I have many interests but I can't say for sure that I have a passion about any one thing - yet I've been able to make money following my interests and make money not following my interests.<p>3.It's often taken as meaning that making money doing something other than when you are doing what you love is somehow a lesser choice.
Maybe so, maybe not. Should I fault the programmer whose real passion is ski-boarding because they'd rather make more money or make money doing something they know they can make money at and then use it to enjoy their passion in their spare time rather than making less money as a ski-bum or taking a risk in what may be a dead end venture? I don't think I can.<p>4.It implies people can't or shouldn't love the pursuit of money. This might be true insofar as money itself is just a store of value or a means to an end. The problem I have is that anyone with a desire for just starting businesses regardless of the product seems to be included, which I think is a wrong categorization. Businesses create wealth, money is just the representation of the wealth created by business. I see nothing wrong with pursuing business for business sake because to be successful in business, for most people, means you are creating value.<p>So my conclusion is that this saying is more useful for selling books than as real advice.",1232919801

449585,comment,448767,449490,0,0,Riley,,,"Off the top of my head:  It's the 6th largest city in the US, and it's the birthplace of the country (lots of culture and history).  Most of the buildings are well over 100 years old (great architecture and craftsmanship is commonplace).  Real estate prices are super reasonable, and property taxes are basically nothing (most houses are less than $1000/year).  Public transportation is everywhere.  Parking and traffic are much better than the NYC and Boston metro areas.  Crime is almost entirely isolated to bad areas of town.  There's a huge amount of independently owned local businesses.  And there's hardly any chain restaurants.  The locally owned restaurants and bars are awesome.  There's about a half dozen world-class micro-breweries in the area.  I can walk to two of them.  There's grocery stores, dozens of shops and good restaurants within walking distance of most areas.  But if you want to drive somewhere - NYC is two hours away, the Pocono Mountains are two hours (lots of state parks and skiing), Atlantic City is close by, and there's some good beaches (for the east coast) within two hours.  The city provides free wifi in lots of places around town.  There's all the nightlife and live music you could want here.  And most everything is really reasonably priced.  The people here do seem to litter a bit too much, and they can come across as rude at first.  But I've found most people to be genuinely straightforward and refreshingly honest compared to other areas.  I've lived all over the US, and I think Philly is one of the most well-rounded and underrated cities.  It's very much like NYC in the late 80's/early 90's.",1232919759

449580,comment,449204,449204,0,0,pg,,,"His mistake is not to distinguish between the average and the median case.  Being an actor is an inefficient way to make money in both the average and median case.  Starting a startup also doesn't pay in the median case, but it does a lot of better in the average case.  In the average case it is probably the optimal way to make a lot of money.  And if you are young enough to stand the risk, you can afford to care about the average case.<p>Startups and acting both have great variability, but acting also has demand working against it.  Being an actor effectively pays you in other ways than money, because it's considered a cool thing to do.  So demand pushes up the price in foregone income.",1232919699

You can't rent an apartment in the hopes of selling it later for a higher price.

Learn as many numerical methods as possible etc. etc.<p>In my mind, neural networks should only be used when you're trying to model actual biological systems. Otherwise, one should always use a proper model - since it actually gives insight into what's going on with the system, instead of just being a magic black box. Of course, notice that all commonly used ANN topologies have nothing to do with biology - feed forward, hopfield nets, kohonen maps etc. They have barely any resemblance to how actual neurons behave. Basically, they are just heuristics with a cool sounding name.",1232918574

The programming (backend & javascript) is like the muscles that move stuff around and the css & visual design is the skin, makeup and clothes that define the style. It's a bit simplistic and ignores more advanced interaction design that can help define the skeleton in the first place, but it's a good shorthand for how designers and programmers make stuff, especially in early stages.<p>So that's a hell yes to learning html/css. Learning web design means more than learning simply the toolkit to create those designs, it's also about developing an eye for what makes an attractive or usable interface, so learning whatever you can there should probably be a hobby that teaches you to appreciate good work.

Most of ""Indian"" stuff is exclusively in English with local language media websites and blogs coming in at a very distant second. There is a distinct snobbery about not using their native tongues  by english educated, city bred citizens when on the Net.<p>However, mobile is another ball-game.

You get the equivalent by doing<p><pre><code>    (:foo { :foo 1  :bar 2 }) ;; => 1

For default values:<p><pre><code>    (:baz { :foo 1  :bar 2 } 3) ;; => 3
