Since people are talking a lot about Myers-Briggs, I'll throw in something I figured out a while ago.<p>When I take MB tests I come out evenly split on T vs F. (I'm also evenly split on I vs E, but am extreme N and extreme P... but we're talking about T and F, so never mind that.) What I figured out is that being evenly split, I tend to morph in response to the people I'm around. If I'm in an environment with lots of T people (like at work), I tend to behave like an F. If I'm around F people (like at home), I tend to behave like a T. So I get told both ""don't be so emotional"" and ""you're a heartless automaton"" on a regular basis :)",1231963194

I figured no one would pick up that name because it's stupid.  It's been parked by the next person for 5 or 6 years now as a jump page for lots of cat ads.  This sort of thing irritates me. I would rather have some kid get it and put a picture of his cat on it with some blinking text like ""This is my cat!  You are defeated!""<p>I suppose what I really want is for a group of people that are interested in creating useful web content to have a chance at before it expires.  My ideal target audience would be the readership here or a similar group.  Just having a list of unused domain names registered by people on this site would be a valuable resource to me.

People who've never used one call it ugly. They call it a waste. It's become a joke of the industry, and I <i>have no clue why.</i> It's selling well, isn't it? It's just selling to a niche audience of people who actually read things. So I guess the joke has to do with the implied functionality, like your wonderful joke implies.<p>I am an astute reader. I own a Kindle to go with my miniature library. I enjoy cuddling up with my Kindle just as much as I would with any other book. The screen is gorgeous. The <i>device</i> is gorgeous. I've never understood the mockery. No, it doesn't feel ""high tech"" and gleaming, it feels very down-to-earth. It feels like a book ought to feel.<p>Now, I'm the sort of person who likes Shakespeare. And it's much easier to have The Complete Shakespeare on a Kindle than it is to have it in a backpack. I also have The Complete Asimov, and I'm considering The Complete Sherlock Holmes.<p>The Kindle got me into reading P. G. Wodehouse for the first time, because his stuff was free on Gutenberg. I managed to find a complete archive of Diana Wynne Jones stories: they're for teens rather than adults, but they're still very well-written and they're childhood favorites and I like that I can find them and read them when I couldn't purchase half of them physically on Amazon.<p>When I got to a meet-up an hour early, I had my Kindle, and I could go and search for half a dozen novels and read excerpts from each one. It's like window shopping but you can do it anywhere.<p>Not to mention the free wireless Internet I get everywhere, the NowNow asking feature (which I've used several times to get quick feedback on projects), and the music player, which I've loaded with Bach, and which isn't a <i>brilliant</i> player but which makes for pleasant background music while I read. I value my Kindle more than I value my iPod.<p>So, you who would mock the Kindle, try planning out a 7-hour train ride when you read books often at the rate of one every 90 minutes. Try figuring out a better way to store 200 books in a dorm room without cluttering everything to hell. Try making a physical device that does as much, as unintrusively and as beautifully as the Kindle does. <i>Then</i> mock it.

Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities. (It is fair to say that ""clarity"" is, regrettably, becoming less and less a distinguishing feature of ""analytic"" philosophy.) The foundational figures of this tradition are philosophers like Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, the young Ludwig Wittgenstein and G.E. Moore; other canonical figures include Carnap, Quine, Davidson, Kripke, Rawls, Dummett, and Strawson.[1]<p>""Continental"" philosophy, by contrast, demarcates a group of French and German philosophers of the 19th and 20th centuries. The geographical label is misleading: Carnap, Frege, and Wittgenstein were all products of the European Continent, but are not ""Continental"" philosophers. The foundational figure of this tradition is Hegel; other canonical figures include the other post-Kantian German Idealists (e.g., Fichte, Schelling), Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, Gadamer, Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, Habermas, and Foucault. Continental philosophy is sometimes distinguished by its style (more literary, less analytical, less reliance on formal logic), its concerns (more interested in actual political and cultural issues and, loosely speaking, the human situation and its ""meaning""), and some of its substantive commitments (more self-conscious about the relation of philosophy to its historical situation).</i>",1231961343

That phrase seriously annoys me, especially when it follows a good critique of non-logical ""philosophy.""  How is it consistent to maintain ""we know nothing"" as a philosophical precept, unless it is a knowledge claim and therefore self contradictory?<p>Additionally, while philosophy is based on logic, logic is only half the picture.  Logic is syntax processing, and as such does not provide the semantics of the statements being analyzed.  So, there are really two aspects to philosohpy, syntax and semantics.  Analytic philosophers focus on syntax and continental philosophers focus on semantics.  This split is fairly recent relative to the history of philosophy, seems to have started around the time of nominalism, i.e. Ockham.  Before then, you'd find both elements in philosophical texts.

Once you get used to this idea that you'll be punished for doing the right thing, either you start deciding that the right thing isn't really right (which I find despicable, but which happens pretty often), or you decide that the system itself is flawed in some way, which is what happened to me.<p>It's tough to keep yourself an idealist when your parents tell you it's not worth it to get in trouble for things - I suppose they might have had a point, especially since if they <i>did</i> I'd still be too stubborn to cave in to somebody that was wrong - and when you get scolded across the board for what you do. I spent 3 years mainly under the radar at the school, then in my senior year was threatened with suspension three times: once for making a rude gesture at a teacher who over-the-top ranted at me for not standing during the pledge of allegiance, once for telling the teacher in charge of the literary magazine that I was the editor of that the magazine was bad and that he was refusing to fix things, and the last time for posting on Facebook about my dislike of the yearbook magazine (on a private note, of course).<p>I left still trying to do the right thing, but the result is a profound dislike for that school, despite the excellent handful of teachers that actually shaped me as a person. That's really sad, when you think about it.<p>Anyway, the point is that unlike most systems - unlike, say, the world of entrepreneurdom, where all that matters is idea and execution and getting ahead - some systems are designed intentionally to cripple the people within it. The school system is the worst, because a, focusing on the best students <i>would</i> hurt most other students and that would be unfair in a manner of speaking, and b, it's much easier for the teachers when they can create a bland routine, force everybody into it, and have everybody come out unharmed if not much wiser. The teachers who <i>didn't</i> do that at my school were incredible, but there were always unspoken hints at how difficult the administration was making things.<p>I entered school wanting to be a teacher.
