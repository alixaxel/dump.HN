460034,comment,459710,459710,0,0,yason,,,"I have a single password and a mailinator address for anything that requires login or registration. Fake name, fake password?<p>Then I have different, good passwords for my login and Gmail. These are easy to type and generated from a passphrase so they look nothing like dictionary words and yet there is a good way to remember them when they're new and my fingers haven't learned them yet. These are about 10+ characters long but those that are easier to type are favoured.<p>Old passwords from the previous category are often reused for middle-level services such as HN, Reddit, Slashdot, FaceBook and others where I have a long (or expected long) residence and high correlation with my privacy or personality. This is mostly for convenience since my fingers have the kinetic memory for about 6-7 such passwords: something I've typed for months or a year as my login password is something I'll also remember the following montsh or a year as my reddit password. If I forget, I try all recent password patterns that my fingers can remember. Has worked so far.<p>Online banking login + passwords are nowhere but my head. In fact, I don't know them if someone wanted me to write them down. Instead, my fingers remember them. The login + password are set by the bank. I also have to look up a code from a pad of one-time PINs sent to me by my bank in order to successfully log in to the online services.<p>Anything else that is either important or rarely used (Amazon, online stock brokerage service etc.) are stored in a file encrypted for my private GPG key. I open it with Emacs, type in the GPG passphrase, let Emacs decrypt the contents and edit the file as usual. Saving will automatically encrypt the data before writing to disk. Looking up a password is a matter of decrypting the file to stdout from the command line and piping it to less. The private GPG key is protected with a passphrase that is about 50 characters long. It is not written anywhere. The passwords in this file are generated by a Perl script I wrote in the 90's. The output of the script is 16 bytes of random characters and numbers.<p>It seems that I rely a lot on my memory. Most of them are memorised in my fingers rather than the lexical part of my brain. I have maybe ten passwords that I need every week or month, and those are in my head, probably because I can keep them there. In addition, I have several PIN codes I must remember, and I do. (Cell phone PIN, two bank cards, SecurID user PIN, door lock code...)<p>So, go figure how to hack me.",1233435361

Even if that meant having a very  standardized building, it seems like it would be so cost efficient that the aesthetic compromise would be alright.<p>I know there is pre-fab housing.. it's cheaper, but the savings are negligible.

460026,comment,459574,459909,0,0,endtime,,,"I agree that grading has nothing to do with teaching people how to think, but that doesn't mean it's not useful.  As a student, I would hate not to get feedback on my performance.  Also, I've definitely gone over and above on assignments when extra credit was possible, and that has often forced me to learn more than I would have if things were, say, pass/fail.  Sure, I could have had the discipline to go above and beyond anyway, but honestly, having an artificial motivator is nice sometimes.<p>And if I were an employer, it would make it much harder to determine who to interview.  If you remove ""dehumanizing"" numbers like grades and test scores from resumes, how does Google (for example) know whether to interview you, who had a 3.8 CS GPA and a 1550 SAT, over the guy who slept through class, turned in code that didn't compile, and can't explain the difference between = and == (yes, I knew people like this as an undergrad)?<p>That said, this is all from the perspective of an engineering student.  I suppose it's much harder to quantify performance for the liberal arts (which is probably part of what initially pushed me towards engineering, now that I think about it).",1233434908

It's also, to judge by the rest of the post, a snap judgment with more than a little bitterness in it. (""It is good enough that you can deploy hordes of programmers to produce crappy software that sort of works. And that is good enough for making money."")<p>My project does things with JS that I would never have thought possible. It has not let us down. The regularity and dynamicness of its core are reminiscent of Smalltalk and Lisp. There are annoyances, of course. But the one the OP places the greatest emphasis on - that all hash keys are strings - only caused us trouble once, and in that case we found a simple workaround. I'm curious: have other people here experienced that limitation of JS as a fundamental obstacle?<p>Given that the OP holds out Java, ActionScript, and that let's-turn-JS-into-Java thing as examples of how it ought to be done, I'm reminded again of how grateful I am that we have something as flexible as JS for making programs that run in a web browser. It's not what I would have chosen, but it's a hell of a lot closer than anyone could have expected, given the rest of computing history. We got lucky.<p>Edit: Oh, and <i>they</i> - the arbiters of programming correctness and staticness - can't do a thing about it. It's already taken over the world.",1233434809

I haven't listened to the entire podcast, so I may have gotten this wrong, but it seems like Joel and Jeff made only nuanced statements. No unqualified remarks like ""testing is bad"" were made, I think.<p>Joel and Jeff mention that code quality doesn't matter much from a _business_ perspective. In Jeff's case - does the code quality of StackOverflow's internals matter? Probably not. There's no critical information there - so security is not an issue. It makes sense to me that time spent on features is going to be appreciated more by the users than time spent on code quality.<p>As for the unit tests - I don't think they mean to say that unit testing is a waste of time in general. From what I understand they're saying that unit testing isn't ""real actual work"". You write unit tests to save yourself debugging and regression testing effort later. If you consider unit tests intrinsically valuable you may end up writing tests for every getter and setter, and that's just 
a waste of time. They also mention that unit-tests themselves have to be maintained and updated, and if architectural changes break a significant percentage of unit tests then you have to put a lot of effort in fixing your tests.<p>The .NET framework was even mentioned as an example where high code quality is incredibly important and where all interfaces should be extensively unit- and regression-tested by Microsoft.<p>> I’m starting to wonder if anyone should be using any of their products.<p>So happy users of Fogbugz and StackOverflow should leave because Joel and Jeff are too pragmatic?",1233434164

1. FDR didn't really try Keynesianism until he was forced to during WWII (the 30s didn't count). Too little Keynes.
2. The whiz kids of the 60s took Keynes too seriously.
3. The ~$650 billion Obama wants to spend follows directly from Keynes's formula.

Filter out the important bits into a useful system and delete the email, I say.<p>Or, in another way of saying it, buried deep in an email archive is not the best place for any given piece of information. Especially not any information that anybody else might ever need to look at - which, in a company, is quite a lot.<p>The sheer effort of remembering what might be in there, the ensuing obligation to search your massive archive any time you need any information just in case (because you can't be sure if it's there or not), the minimal hassle of not finding most 'important' information and the large amount of 'information' that you will, in practice, never look at again makes it a dubious thing to do, IMO.
