I went to college to expand my mind, meet interesting people, and learn things I would never have learned by myself. I am very happy that I did so, even though I barely use any of the actual Physics that I learned, in my daily job.<p>I will add that I learned far more than just Physics at university. I learned that there were a lot of extremely smart people out there. I learned about my limitations (cramming only gets you so far). I learned about my abilities (few things seem that incredibly hard after a physics degree). I learned how to learn new things (there are many ways to learn). I learned how to behave in a wider variety of environments than I had been exposed to previously. I learned that even amongst very smart people, there were things I could do that no one else could. I learned that if you make the right connections, you can benefit immensely. I learned many more things, far too many to list here.<p>What went in was a naive, uncouth, slightly ill-mannered boy, what came out was confident, friendly, approachable go-getter.<p>Perhaps your university didn't expand your mind.

http://forums.x-plane.org/<p>Choice quotes:
<i>""Question: Austin, it's been about a year since the launch of version 9. What are your overall feelings about 2008? Are the sales where you expected them to be, is the product at the technical level you wanted it to be?<p>Austin: 2008, for me, kicked butt. Lots and lots of Butt.
Why?
Simple reason: IPHONE.<p>Iphone sales of X-Plane have been strong (I hit #3 in the world.. and #19 in the world with X-Plane Airliner).
As well, ever since I came out with the iphone version of X-Plane, sales at X-Plane.com of the desktop version have been up by 400%.<p>So, people buy X-Plane for the iphone, and then a lot of them buy the full version... enough to quadruple my sales.<p>Now we are really starting to get some noticeable amount of market share.""</i><p><i>""Q: Are you going to release more iPhone apps?<p>Austin: Huh-Huh... if there is a huge pile of gold under your lawn, are you gonna dig for it? ;-P<p>I look at the cheesy games for iPhone now, and I look at the power of X-Plane on it.. the power I have to bring sophisticated Apps to millions of people is just STUNNING... Yah, I have a huge opportunity here and am grabbing it!""</i><p><i>""Q: Austin said you were also working on the iPhone version of X-Plane. What do you do on that project?<p>Ben: The iphone version of X-Plane actually runs the same scenery engine as the desktop version - with much smaller, simpler scenery files. So my main work on the iphone was to port X-plane's scenery engine from the desktop to the iphone, and build scenery files for the iphone.""</i><p><i>""Q: What are the major differences in working for X-Plane 9 desktop and X-plane for iPhone?<p>Ben: Memory! :-) The iphone has a lot less of it -- it's a constant battle to put x-plane on a ""memory diet"".<p>Actually, the biggest difference is that on the iphone, we control everything that goes into it - everything is pre-packaged. Every airplane, every scenery file, it all comes from us.<p>By comparison, the desktop sim is very open to add-ons. People add their own planes, scenery and plugins...there's a ton of great add-ons on sites like X-Plane.org. We have to program the desktop version of X-Plane to handle a huge range of airplanes created by other people.<p>So the primary concerns on the phone and desktop can be different. On the iphone, we need to save memory at all costs; on the desktop, we need to handle a huge range of airplanes and scenery created by other people.""</i><p><i>""Q: How would you describe 2008 for X-Plane?<p>Randy: In late 2008 we also created our first X-Plane port to the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch. These are amazing devices, acting not only as the computer and monitor but also as the flight controls; all rolled into one. Even we are a bit surprised at the explosive sales these products are delivering, with Apple selling well nearly 200,000 copies in the first three months.""</i>",1231954886

433902,comment,433703,433703,0,0,mdasen,,,"From my vantage point, Google has been nicer.  I can switch search providers with no hassle if someone offers a technologically superior product.  Microsoft, through everyone developing for the Windows API, made it very difficult for people to change OS - less so now that the internet has arguably become the largest platform.  Still, I can see how Google exerts a bit of a hold because of AdWords.  I know at my work, we never think about non-AdWords networks.  If you're going to monetize search, you need advertisers.  In order to get advertisers, you need users.  You can go the whole, loose money now and then make it up later technique, but that's hard unless you've got some nice VCs.<p>Maybe the issue is who their customers are.  With Microsoft, it's definitely the people using Windows and such.  With Google, one could argue that their customers aren't people using Google, but the advertisers who pay for it - and Google does have a little lock over them as they have the search traffic.  Still, I think Google has been more open and tried harder to succeed on its merits than Microsoft has.",1231954663
433901,comment,433551,433551,0,0,ideamonk,,,"Well... as far as my college is concerned, yeah it does eat up a big chunk (8am to 4:30 pm, on 3 days a week) of my 24 hrs, plus till 3 years of 4 year course I need to study chemistry and physics along with core subjects, and surprisingly environmental science too is pushed into CS here, 4 credits (highest) for env. science... and chemistry shares same 3 credits with other topics like OS and Algorithms. I wonder why my education system fails to see the importance of less load on students and giving us free time to experiment, self-learn and spend more time in understanding what is important for us.<p>Plus a semester in my college has 5 tests, so every month we are really busy... its really hard managing time like this !<p>Imagine a student whose parents can't provide funds due to some reasons, how can he ever self finance or add some independence/comfort to his life!<p>While my friends in foreign universities do find great part time opportunities and free time to work some side-projects, this kind of scenario is majorly lacking in India :( most of my classmates just concentrate on getting 9+ gpa,don't even care to look at whats going on in the world outside... since grading is competitive, this creates a pressure on one and all to be at a nice position compared to those who give 24x7 to mugging based syllabus and never ever dream to achieve any self earned practical experience which I believe to be the best form of learning.<p>The case is not the same in premier institutes in India such as IITs, NITs and BITS. Getting to those colleges is achievable only after beating a huge crowd of super high IQ people. This can't be possible for everyone, anyways my point is the private institutes are really messing up with our lives as in case of my college due to outdated ideas and thoughts of people who run it. Major issues for my college are discipline which translates to -<p>1. no use of laptops in the hostel for first 2 years of college....<p>2. Uniforms on 2 days a week.<p>3. ban on jeans and tshirt<p>4. no cellphones<p>5. no girls and guys hanging out<p>6. not getting treated like adults even when we are 20 years old...<p>7. many more like hostlers standing till 3am as punishment for making some noise on the last day of 2008<p>Now that really makes me think, my college is stopping me from getting rich and advancing in my own views!
I could've learnt so much more if I was in a college that is run by people who are more broadminded and understand how education and knowledge are different and respect what Einstein said in ""On Education"" and aim for a better advanced society for future rather than creating huge crowd of people with zero creativity, experience and almost ditto common skills.<p>The best some screwd up colleges can do for people like me is relax the timings and test, syllabus load and let me have some college/life/fun ratio.<p>BUT COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NO WASTE OF TIME EVEN IF THESE STUPID ADD-ONS ARE ATTACHED TO THE ONE WHICH I GET :)",1231954577
