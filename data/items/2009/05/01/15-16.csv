It's very hacky to expect consumers to mess with their user agent's Accepts header to get the response format they want. Specifying the desired format such as ?format=xml is simple, clear, specific, and reliable. I prefer default format be XML and other formats available by passing a format parameter.<p>The REST of article has some good suggestions. I made a pun there. Did you catch it? ""REST of the article"". Because it's about REST? That's comedy gold.",1241190342

588580,comment,588491,588551,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think it might be dependent on what language you use.  In Perl, alignment is very important, as you have a lot of code that looks like:<p><pre><code>   my $foo = Foo->new(\n      named_initargs => 'go here',\n      and_also       => 'here',\n   );\n</code></pre>\n(There are various technical reasons to avoid this style, but I think it looks too nice to avoid.)<p>As a result, a non-monospaced font would be a nightmare.<p>However, perhaps if you are using a language where everything is positional (Java, C), then maybe it doesn't matter:<p><pre><code>    Foo foo = new Foo(args, go, here,\n        and, if, you, run, out, of, room,\n        perhaps, they, can, be, written,\n        like, this);\n</code></pre>\nNote that the only alignment is the initial indentation; one space is always as wide as another space, so a variable-width font won't mess anything up.<p>Obviously if you are using Haskell or Python, you will care even more about alignment, and hence will want a monospaced font.  You will also want a monospaced font in your terminal emulator, as most console apps depend on all glyphs being equally wide.",1241190213
