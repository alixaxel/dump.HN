More than that, and one would either move on or treat the medium different: for example, instead of interacting with the webpage, one would set it to load and go do something else, and come back later. Or give up. There was an alternative, though: going down to the internet cafe to get fast access.<p>The existence of the alternative affected one's perception of the ""slowness"", just as being stuck in traffic in LA made me wish for a proper subway system.<p>No quantification, just anecdotal observations.",1241816282

One of our biggest hurdles was avoiding people who would, in a sense, reverse engineer our coupon dispersion so that they could purchase large quantities of various products.<p>In the end we ended up having an employee become a member of the sites and forums where these people hung out and to attempt to cutoff these types of scams before they got out of hand. But it was normal for someone to have store managers orders cases of non-perishable items that were bought on a buy-one-get-one deal. People would also purchase items on coupons and then return them at a later time for full value or store credit. It was amazing to see. Many of these people would resell these items at garage/yard sales or on ebay.",1241816079

That's different, my bad.<p>But not so different though, because telling a user your game/app  can't run anymore because <insert pleasant looking reason here> doesn't help and the user can hardly do anything to help give the app a higher chance to run. Of course they can start Safari, close all the tabs etc, but it is (1) tedious and (2) many users wouldn't know how to do it (3) again destroys the experience.<p>Also, try to catch the error may not work in practice. It will work sometimes, but there's really no guarantee how much time you have to save the current state, and show a nice error because the app is shutdown.<p>The irony is that the environment uses reference counting to allow better control of memory yet there is this limitation. Or maybe it had to use reference counting because of this limitation.<p>Still it's a pretty nice platform to code for, it's just us developers asking for more :)",1241814908

Equity is a form of payment (although, admittedly, it is a gamble). However, the way that you advertised it here really makes it sound like you are looking for free work, and a naieve student to take advantage of. And working without any sort of compensation is indeed being taken advantage of.<p>Also, as a side note, I suspect (and Google seems to support) that American students have far higher costs for going to university -- I believe that in Europe, the tuition fees are significantly cheaper thanks to government subsidies.

However one key difference is instead of unstructured natural language, I use Python or Scheme - this is beneficial for me, because it forces me to concretely express what I am trying to do, instead of hand waving, and for a future reader, who will probably have an easier time unambiguously parsing a real language instead of random half-sentences. And it is often succinct - it is amazing and amusing how often (the gist of) hundreds of lines of optimized C/C++ can be expressed in a line or three of Python.",1241812943

The work I'll be doing is also a great deal more interesting, I suspect, than any web startup could ever offer.<p>While I would't expect to make as much money if I was working for a startup, this offer is simply a rip off. As reference, personally I would expect to be offered a bare minimum of $12/hour for technical work. That's the level at which I wouldn't laugh in your face and walk off.<p>If your company is too cheap to pay students working for them, that also raises questions about the sort of work that they would be doing, and now interesting it might be. It also implies strongly that the students would be on a lower rung and would be a ""lower class"" at the company, with poorer working conditions and a lack of respect.<p>Overall, unpaid positions without massive perks [edit: or other forms of payment] scream ""AVOID!"".",1241812865
