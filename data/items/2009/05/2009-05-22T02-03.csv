I'm sure when the Model T ford was the best seller people would have been arguing along similar lines.<p>> The tech industry if full of people building products for themselves, as opposed to the people they are trying to sell to. This obsession with CPU and RAM specifications, open access, etc, is just a symptom of this.<p>Time and time again people have predicted that ordinary people will have no use for certain technical features. Right from personal computers through to the internet and mobile phones they have been consistently been proven wrong. Remember Bill Gates 'Nobody will ever need more than 640k RAM!'?<p>Of course most users just want 'better stuff' but thinking that this is going to result from reversion to a unipolar 'Model T' type marketplace is, in my view, mistaken.",1242960971
