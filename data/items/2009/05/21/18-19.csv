That feeling caused me to think again about why I get annoyed.  Do I really <i>deserve</i> their attention?<p>The counter to the narcissism argument is that I feel like I ought to be preferred because I was there first.  Sort of like how you feel when you've been waiting in line at a checkout only to have the cashier turn and answer the phone when you reach the counter.  Also, I feel like physical proximity seems like it should count higher in the 'urgency' scheme.",1242932355

It's about empathizing with people who are different than you are, learning to see through their eyes, giving them what they need, and not getting any payoff in terms of interesting technical problems to solve. It's probably the exact opposite of what draws most people, myself certainly among them, to programming in the first place.<p>That said, I also agree that pretty much anyone can learn to be a good UI designer, just as anyone can learn to draw well. As in any field, talent helps and the very best people will always be the ones with talent, but it is much more important to want it enough to put in the necessary work.

When I first got my french press, it tasted like any coffee I had ever had from Starbucks. Recently, things have started to take a turn for the better - I can make a damn delish cup. This is what has changed:<p>A lot of it comes down to grinding your beans, right before brewing. How much do you put in the grinder? Usually I use +1 to however many cups I am making. The average mug can hold around 2 cups - so that means 3 tablespoons of beans.<p>Pour slowly some boiled water (usually you want to wait a moment after it begins to boil) over the beans. Stir briefly and let it sit.<p>What you should see is basically a foamy rich bit (kinda like crema on espresso) going on at the top of the brew. I've heard a friend call this 'the bloom', though I don't know if that is a technical term for it but I like it.<p>You wanna keep this bloom going, which means stirring intermittently for the next 4 minutes. Usually I stir a single brew once at the start, twice during the steeping, and once right before pressing it.<p>Place the cover and press on top and press down slowly. Try to press down with uniform pressure and keep it straight. I know my press is kinda jiggly when you press down. If you favour one side too much, you might let some grinds slip through the other side.<p>Pour and serve.<p>If you still find this dull, try other types of coffee. Try drinking it black (I know, this is daring for people who prefer 'sludge water' aka 3 milk 3 sugar). Personally I am a big fan of Ethiopian and Kenyan beans. I find they have such strong undertones. It is like drinking expensive wine!",1242929436
