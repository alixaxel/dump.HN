If you take that concept away - why would you want to live in the U.S. anymore:<p>- none of U.S. cities rank in the top\n100 most livable places (Mercer Cities Ranking)<p>- high schools and many public schools rank low in comparison to other western nations<p>- education is much more expensive<p>- there is no organized trade school education, like in\nGermany, Britain etc.<p>- salaries for the lower third are less<p>- health care (don't get me started)<p>- hardly any social safety net<p>- crime, largest per capita prison population in the world<p>- infrastructure - roads, bridges, buildings etc. (don't get\nme started; it's almost third world country level)<p>- average lasting quality of housing (drywall, cheap wood framing, bad carpentry on windows and doors etc.)<p>- manufacturing quality and capability: look at American made cars or power tools (I always prefer foreign made)<p>- half of the government budget goes towards the military<p>- lack of public transportation (Standard Oil bought up the urban train networks in the 1940's and had them decommissioned: street cars, urban transit etc.)<p>- no functioning Euro-style city cores, urban sprawl, stuffed highways with commuters<p>- and the most important fact of all: the byzantine law system of the U.S. and the huge costs of lawyers and law suits (this affects many areas); lawyers can cost over $ 500/ hour and if you can't afford one you are out of luck; further, judges are not high-end lawyers trained as judges (like in Germany etc.) but can be any random divorce lawyer that got appointed regionally, as I understand<p>Final verdict: the U.S. has been badly managed in the last 30 years, and the poor carry the burden.<p>The final evidence is given in the study of Cliometrics and measuring average body height of nations (an indicator for health/ prosperity): it used to be (up until the 1950s) that U.S. Citizens were taller than Europeans; this trend has been reversed in the last 30 years - now the Euros are taller (especially the Dutch)",1242873457

There is a metric crapton of cash getting plowed into this very specific initiative (AMI meters, most of which can link to ""home area networks"" via ZigBee, all managing an ANSI standard table definition).<p>For reasons that I hope are somewhat obvious, Matasano has had some limited involvement with actual on-the-ground projects here. The products are there, the PO's are getting cut, meters are getting retrofitted or replaced by the tens of thousands.<p>I think it's hard to say whether this is good news or bad news for the current crop of ""smart grid"" startups. You worry maybe that this is going to be a walled garden for the utility companies, but then a lot of these meters speak open standards, and there are jurisdictions (like, all of Texas) that mandate that customers own their power data. I also heard more than one utility talking about products that were going to bypass the utility/vendor AMI networks and just do a lot of this stuff over the Internet.<p>One of the more interesting (or at least complex) ideas that I saw getting tossed around was Demand Response / Load Shedding startups; the idea that a startup could contract with a utility to sign customers up for a program that would trigger different power profiles (like, ""turn off your air conditioner"") when the utility needed it, and in return get a break on their bill.",1242873132

While many houses sold are still listed that way, there is no reason other than inertia for it to remain that way.<p>When we sold our house, we explicitly stated in the craigslist ad, ""We will not be responsible for buyers agent fees.  If you have a real estate agent, that's your problem, not ours.""  Our buyer was working with a friend who was an agent, and was able to work out a deal they were both happy with which I wasn't privy to the details of (and given that the buyer found the house himself with no help from the agent, who had showed him lots of houses that weren't right for him, I'd say the agent got more than they deserved, whatever the amount was).  But, the buyer <i>did</i> get a better deal on the house, because we didn't give any percentage to a realtor.  So, we could sell the house cheaper than a realtor listed house <i>and</i> walk away with more money than the seller.<p>Anyway, as you may note, my own personal experience with realtors has been so bad that pretty much nothing will convince me to use a realtor again.  This could be a case of two bad apples.  But, the one that took me for a ride was a 30 year veteran, and had won awards and such.  The industry rewards those most effective at screwing people.<p>So, now that it's an industry that serves no real purpose other than injecting themselves in between buyers and sellers in large transactions (marketing real estate for sale and finding real estate to buy can now be done on the Internet; legal stuff has always been handled by the title companies and the lenders, anyway, and realtors just stake a claim to providing guidance in navigating the process...but if you call a title company, they will happily provide all the guidance you need), I simply have no use for the industry.  Realtors are selling wagon wheels, and I don't have or want a wagon.<p>I think you, as a technically savvy individual, probably well above the average intelligence of realtors, would be well-served to think long and hard about whether the industry will change or die...and get yourself at the head of that curve, whatever it is.",1242871706
