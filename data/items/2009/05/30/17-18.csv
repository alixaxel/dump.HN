633922,comment,633873,633873,0,0,telegraph,,,"""I already have plenty of things to read/do when my mind does need a wonder in the evening/weekend"" -- for many people, especially those in their 20s who came of age using Facebook, Myspace, AIM, etc, one of those things we do to occupy our time is use the Internet to keep up with friends who we, for whatever reason, can't just call on the phone or hang out with in person. Recent college grads especially suddenly find that their once close friends are scattered across the globe; Twitter lets them maintain a sense of nearness.<p>To me, that's the appeal. You don't have to be unemployed to have 10 minutes a day in which to keep up, particularly when you weigh that 10 minutes spent reading Twitter against the amount of time it would take to maintain individual correspondences.",1243706308

In the preceding discussion we are talking about cases where cheating would be considered ethical by some, because the trade-off is acceptable. For instance, someone may be on their way to becoming a very good physicist and doesn't care for compulsory german. Who cares if a current physics professor ever cheated at german?",1243706274

Which means John started programming about the time the IBM XT came out. So I doubt his MASM 4.1 and C skills would have lasted him the 29 years he worked at BIG JOB. In fact, given the pace of change, its pretty much a go he didn't last 29 years at any single BIG JOB.<p>Worse yet, when John started he likely worked on a Mainframe or Micro using VMS or a commercial *nix variant and had COBOL skills. Since the WWW was still a text based protocol running on a military network John wasn't likely to have any Internet skills at this point.<p>John likely ran a Wildcat BBS, or E systems communication system using dialup. John did this until about 1992 when the Net finally took. Along the way John continued with COBOL and his Mainframe buddies shifted over to the net. After Y2K fewer and fewer of his buddies stayed in COBOL and the market for his skills went through the roof.<p>Today John still hacks out COBOL for legacy systems and makes about triple what he did in 1989 when he started because the idiot children of this age think the only way you can carve out a living is with your RUBY slippers, drinking a cup of JAVA, while you fight it out with INDIA for your job.<p>But John doesn't have that problem, because believe it or not he knows what an AS400 is, and YOU DO NOT.<p>John is socking away enough bank by being available for legacy gigs because the market passed him by. Thank god for that...<p>And yes I know John. More than a couple of us old farts do...<p>Now lets stroll down that hill and have a poke with all them cows....<p>2 centavos..",1243706136
