Neither will any other kind of social solution - I doubt anything will do sort of a search engine that looks at semantics.<p>The real problem with SearchWiki (or other upvoting/downvoting) is that you keep going back to the search page while your search is <i>failing</i>. As soon as you click through and find the page that you want, you stop - you do what you wanted and get on with your life. Whereas if that is the page you need and bookmark it (granted your point that we don't bookmark everything), that is a true and accurate indicator of success.<p>Since HN was explicitly mentioned upthread, it would be interesting to know how many people upvote/downvote stories (which you have to get back to the main page to do) versus comments (which are in your face in their totality when you are asked to vote). I can only speak for myself, but I vote on comments massively more often than I vote on stories, exactly for the reason I described.

Further, more micro studies confirm that animal protein is the cause of cancer actually developing after exposure to a carcinogen.<p>Then walk into a vegetarian restaurant and look around.  People are pale, chunky, weak-looking, and generally the opposite of health.  You'll find the same at most health food co-ops.<p>Then look at a ""health food"" cook book and see the huge amounts of oils, nuts, etc. that are used in the recipes.  You'll notice that most of the food has around 50% of calories from fat.  Compare this to the stats from a McDonalds menu.<p>Now go into a vegetarian Indian restaurant -- most of the people who work there and eat there will be chunky.<p>For more information on some of the downside of the typical ""healthy"" diet in modern America, check out the book ""The 80 10 10 diet"" which really hits hard on the fat content of so-called health food.  Doug Graham advocates eating mostly fresh fruits and vegetables.

So lots of foods are labeled that way.  The whole ""healthy oils"" movement is a farce (explained in both books I cite).  No, slathering your food in olive oil does not make it more nutritious!<p>Consider the undisputed fact that big agriculture is heavily corn-driven.  Corn sweetens your cola and cereal, feeds your beef and chicken, etc.  But did you know that corn and soy are a standard crop rotation?  Of course we are told that soy protein is good for you (in fact, the compound soy protein isolate found in many health foods promotes cancer cell growth the same way that meat does).<p>I am shocked that my comment above got modded down.

You pay in $50 or so, then each click costs you $0.90 or $0.10 or whatever it is, it doesn't process a transaction for each one, it just draws from your reserve.<p>This is good because it encourages people to continue using the service until their balance is gone.  This causes the cost of moving to another service to increase.<p>The idea of this isn't new, it's just stupid.",1243541109

The song's genes are rated according to how strongly they are expressed on a 1-5 scale.  They break down your song ratings into ratings of certain genes and groups of genes (focus traits) and pick a new song that rates highly in the genes you ""like"".<p>They also account for lemons on a band-level and song-level basis.  If you negatively rate a song, they won't play it again on that station.  If you negatively rate a band twice, they won't play that band again on that station.",1243541071

It's a welcome change from the boring white pages.<p>I do agree that the results interface looks cluttered.  Granted, they are trying to present a lot of information, but they should find a way to simplify it.  I suspect they'll change it up in time and after a real world launch.",1243540857
