If there's any glory in remembering what the constructor arguments are for a certain class, it's lost on me.<p>Plus, in the real world, many of us use what we call ""third party code"" which could be as simple as something as a database driver or some kind of utility class.  If you think you're going to remember perfectly everything all the time, then you are dreaming.<p>And on refactoring: if you don't think it's essential, please do yourself a favor and find someone who can give you a tutorial.  Refactoring is <i>the</i> key feature of all of these IDEs.<p>Say you have 100K lines of code in a project.  You want to move a class to a new package.  In your world, you spend a week doing it and probably typing javac over and over on the command line.  In my world, I can do it in less than 5 seconds and know the IDE is 100% correct.  When you have power like that in an easily accessible frontend, you tend to use it.  That benefits your code by making the big ugly maintenance tasks into afterthoughts.",1241665028

My intro CS courses were taught using Eclipse, and I am constantly using it (for lack of a better, free, option) at work. I am getting more and more fed up with the bloat in Eclipse. Running in a Linux environment results in hard-to-diagnose crashes fairly often, and the memory overhead is, quite frankly, unacceptable.<p>I would gladly move to something lightweight like the OP asked for. Most of the features in Eclipse aren't useful to people working on relatively small projects, and the features that <i>are</i> useful (code completion, refactoring, nice library integrations) could probably be deployed with much less overhead.",1241664964

And records are only part of what a musician does. Live shows are so important as well, and you're not (really) going to have the producer to help you out there.<p>There's always been talent out there, and now finally with costs of producing and selling music coming down, we're starting to see lots more people making music.

597318,comment,597213,597213,0,0,_debug_,,,"ablashov, I have to chime in with the others here and let you know that Eclipse does so many things for you, that in direct contradiction to what you assume, it is actually difficult to set up Emacs or Vi to do the same for you. One example is whole-workspace refactoring : Let's say you decide that a function (method) needs to take an extra parameter, a boolean, but actually, that is just to cover some corner cases, i.e., the argument will be false in most cases, but true for 5% of cases. But that method is used in 326 places. Guess what : changing method signature and refactoring ALL the code that uses that method is just a few actions in Eclipse. Eclipse --> Refactor --> Change method signature --> Add new parameter, boolean isCorner, default = false. You're done. It changes all 326 references to your method and rebuilds the project.<p>Truth be told, Eclipse is a key reason for Java's popularity. It makes working a pleasure and helps you focus on the actual work, not on the mechanics of how-to-get-it-done.",1241664550

Also Eclipse has a great set of keyboard shortcuts to do everything, I normally do my whole workflow without the mouse being on my desk.<p>For Java work an IDE is essential. For C/C++ I still use Emacs but having Javadocs integrated right there and a nice debugger and refactoring is key.<p>You might also be interested in this: <a href=""http://community.buglabs.net/kgilmer/posts/114-Getting-the-files-into-Eclipse-steb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.buglabs.net/kgilmer/posts/114-Getting-the-f...</a>",1241664508

When the group was done taking one part, the tests were exchanged, and the psychologist administering the test, following his programmed script, gave the exact same instructions that he had already given, ending with ""Are there any questions?"" He was about to command ""Then you may begin."" when one of the Masters shouted out: ""Should we use the same personality as we did on the first half?""

People can just keep borrowing money, investing it in something like gold, and the price will continue to appreciate in terms of dollars.  As everyone start to do that their is a full fledged currency run.  The price of everything in dollars heads towards infinity as the dollar becomes worthless. (perhaps worthless is an overstatement as the government might still create some demand by taxing in dollars.  But effectively worthless compared to its value now).<p>This article illustrates more clearly how the scenario can play out: <a href=""http://www.safehaven.com/article-5205.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.safehaven.com/article-5205.htm</a>  (note that the author's prediction did not happen, because monetary inflation came to an abrupt stop in 2008.  Not coincidentally, the stock market proceeded to crash).<p><i>Rising prices could be just as easily explained by real increases in real total wealth while the quantities of some good remained fixed, or at least grew slower than the overall economies rate of growth.</i><p>The price of good X is simply the ratio at which market actors are willing to exchange X for dollars.  For the price to rise, one of four things must happen:<p>- The supply of X can be decreasing<p>- The supply of dollars can be increasing<p>- Demand for X can be increasing<p>- Demand for dollars can be decreasing<p>Changes in the supply and demand for dollars we call ""monetary inflation"".<p>So if you say the rising prices are some other cause, it can either be the supply of X is decreasing or the demand for X is increasing.  Now we know that the supply of gold or real estate is not decreasing.  So that leaves us with the possibility that demand is increasing.  But the price increase is happening in every category of good - gold, oil, farm land, downtown skyscrapers, copper, stocks, etc.  When demand for every good denominated is increasing, that's basically synonymous with saying that demand for dollars is falling.<p>For further evidence, note that MZM and total credit creation were also rising at ~10% a year.  These are both a more direct measure of monetary inflation.",1241662657
