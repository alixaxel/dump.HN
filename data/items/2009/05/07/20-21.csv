It would be like your boss standing over you as you write a letter and saying, ""no, we can't send that, shred that now.""  and then shredding the letter.  That's not tampering with mail, as it never became mail, it's just a piece of paper on some guy's desk.<p>In this case, Facebook is refusing to let you submit a form, just like when you omit a required field.  If you want to talk ""wiretapping"" or ""intercepting"", what about corporate spam filters and false positives?  That is literally sitting between you and a legitimate sender and is throwing away data some algorithm doesn't want you to see.  Sounds like this guy's definition of ""wiretapping"" to me, but we all know that email would be dead without spam filters.<p>Anyway, this is an issue for facebook and its users.

598641,comment,596471,597858,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"My main problem is with taking an issue which is very complicated and offering a simple solution: just remove the copyright.<p>Most decisions in economy are taken in a very rational. A pharmaceutical company will decide how much to invest in researching and getting approved a certain drug based on the chance of success and the potential profits. The profits depend directly on the time it has exclusive rights on that product. If it's only until a competitor reverse engineers the product, then it could only be a few months. If it's 20 years, the profits are completely different. It will invest in both cases, just very different amounts. The length of the copyright should be computed to maximize overall benefits to society. A large enough investment, but not too long.<p>Another case is software patents. There is a very big difference between patenting ideas (usually considered a very bad idea) and patenting software (usually considered necessary). An interesting example: most people decide to use (and pay for) Windows, even when there are free alternatives. Why? Because it simply is better. All those money invested in developing it (based on the expectation of future profits) just make a difference.<p>Or collections of otherwise non-copyrighted data, like maps. Making a map is extremely expensive. Copying one on the other hand is extremely cheap. What incentive would a map maker have to do all this work?<p>All these are very different cases, and they <i>have</i> to be treated as such. Simply saying all IP laws are not necessary because RIAA is evil is not a solution.<p>My personal preference tends to be towards eliminating copyright for non-commercial purposes, with a broad definition of what is commercial. Listening to music at home would not be commercial, but in a restaurant (or any other public place) it would be. But I only consider this my _opinion_. I admit it's limited and with flaws, and I am aware that ""the devil is in the details"". And most of all, I firmly believe this is a complex problem, which does not have a simple solution.<p>I will take I look at the book you mentioned. I am curious how it treats some particular cases, like some of the above.",1241729121

598636,comment,598523,598523,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I would have called it an educational example of what's wrong with textbooks :-) Good link though, this is a serious issue. As a european I'm horrified by most of what I see about the American school system; conservatives and liberals both seem intent on wrecking it in different ways. Examples like this make me wonder if the purpose of k-12 isn't so much to educate as to act as an obstacle course for the less fortunate. I also wonder about the price of textbooks here. I'm more familiar with college than k-12 books, but the prices here are a major scam. In Europe I can walk into a bookshop and pay about $30 for an (American) book that sells for >$100 here. Over there the academic books are almost always cheaper than the 'introduction to learning X in 24 hours for complete dummies'. In fact, I ended up owning a bunch of textbooks on subjects that interested because they were the affordable option. The first time I went looking for a CS book here in the US I nearly had a heart attack.<p>The problem is going to persist as long as education is a state matter but economics leads most states to play 'me-too' and go with whatever is selected in Texas. Kickbacks by academic publishers to selectors (which I hear sometimes takes place) should be prosecuted criminally. Textbooks should be certified by a panel of relevant academic associations, eg the AAAS or other well-established groups - not the 'Brand New Hisotrical Revisionism Society'. Those are just my superficial reactions, and not very good ones.<p>I was uncomfortably reminded of programming books by this article. There's a lot of junk out there...makes me think of how many programming books are built around things like administering a payroll system, which coincidentally involves nothing more complex than arithmetic and the most primitive kind of database.
