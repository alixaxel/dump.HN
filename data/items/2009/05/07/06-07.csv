And it pains me every day to go into the hospital everyday and see the consequences of smoking.<p>Lung cancer is frankly trivial compared to the bad outcomes associated with lost physiologic reserve due to connective tissue damage and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An overwhelming number of patients who smoke have bad surgical and medical outcomes attributable to smoking.<p>Poor tensile strength of connective tissue is associated with skin tears, diverticulitis,  impaired wound healing, emphysema. I'm sure you can all spot an 50 year old smoker from a mile away: they're the ones who look like they're 70. That is simply the outward sign of something terribly wrong inside. These folks consistently have bad outcomes in the event of trauma, including surgery of any kind. Surgeries that are usually overnight stays become weeks in the ICU with infections and being stuck on the vent becasue we can't get their oxygen saturation back up after the OR. The loss of physiologic reserve leads to trauma patients who can't be weaned off ventilators, more tracheostomies, more inpatient infections, more of pretty much everything bad.<p>COPD similiarly decreases the physiologic reserve and leads to poor vent weaning in smokers who go in for surgery of any kind. We had a woman in the ICU last week for a brain surgery; now she's going to get a hole cut in her throat because it's her lungs that can't heal, so she's getting a ""prophylactic tracheostomy"" because it, believe it or not, causes less damage than leaving an orotracheal tube in indefinitely.<p>Children of smokers have a higher incidence of asthma.<p>I couldn't help but read the thread and think ""what kind of doctor am I to not tell these folks the same thing I would tell any other smoker?""<p>To those I offended, I sincerely apologize, that was not my intent. I just don't want to see you or someone like you in the hospital, with complications of poor wound healing or other really ugly outcomes.",1241679326

I don't.  I find that games work much better on my console attached to my 50"" plasma TV and I generally keep my iPhone in the charger while I'm at work.  So as long as the battery lasts 24-48 hours, I'm good.<p>On the other hand multitasking and notifications are two things that I really find annoying on the iPhone and would go pretty far to make it work.

The number of different implementations grew as the number of available computers and users grew.  The number of smart people using each distro nowadays is probably still more than the total number of users of some of the original Unix implementations - the same implementations he says spawned the most good ideas.<p>2.  Many different distros allows for many different ideas and paradigms to be tried out.  Over time, the best ideas will escape their parent communities and become adopted by all the major versions.  Ideas that may never have gained traction in one massive community might find purchase in some of these splinter groups.<p>The fracturing of the distros was a natural and necessary step in the evolution of the nix system.  Yes, Microsoft managed to assert its dominance because it presented a single unified solution, but its heyday is nearing an end.  Slowly, the myriad good ideas coming from the countless nix's are again unifying into a very strong front.  Mac OS X (FreeBSD Unix) and Ubuntu (Debian Linux) are two great examples of how many different ideas have coalesced into a pleasing and usable system.<p>Rob Pike ends his message with an injunction to the Unix users of the world to unite, to work together as opposed to walling themselves off in their own segmented communities.  While I think the segmentation was beneficial and necessary, I do agree that a strong effort towards unifying the current crop of ideas into a uniform package is beneficial, if only to provide a seed for a whole new set of distros splintering off in new and unique directions.",1241677939

The end result however is a huge number of dependencies and options that make installation and setup harder than it should be. Turbogears 2, which is based on Pylons, has an even greater number of dependencies - such that I needed to install virtualenv to get going with it.<p>For example, in order to support a large number of template engines, Pylons uses Buffet, another library which provides a common interface for these engines. Typically, however, you will only use a single template engine in your project and it only needs a few lines of code to set an engine up.<p>Although I do most of my web development in Django, when I do need more control or something a bit simpler I go with a Werkzeug + SQLAlchemy + Jinja stack (plus WTForms, similar to Django forms but in a standalone package). The code needed to get up and running isn't that much more than Pylons (and paster generates a whole lot of code anyway) and I can count the dependencies on one hand. That makes deployment a lot faster and easier, and it's just as easy to swap out these dependencies as with Pylons.",1241677224
