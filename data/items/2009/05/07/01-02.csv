Creating a text editor from scratch in Python wasn't the way to go; starting with something like Gecko and contentEditable would have gotten them somewhere -- anywhere -- faster.<p>Jef Raskin passed away shortly before my college research project, very sad, but the project was to extrapolate from the proposals in The Humane Interface and examine if they still applied today.  The big issue is that Raskin, THE and the Cat only explored text editing in any level of detail.  You can imagine how the ideas could apply to any sort of process on the PC, from system management (Time Machine) to video editing (non-linear) to web browsing (Ubiquity), but none of his published work discusses it (except for maybe his QuickDraw thesis, which I read so long as as to have forgotten it in its entirety), so you're entirely on your own to envision what it might have looked and worked like.<p>He was also a big fan of zooming UIs which I am, to this day, not sold on (but Oberon looked neat, I'll have to check it out).<p>Speaking of Ubiquity, Raskin's work lives on through his son, Aza, who formerly ran Humanized (I still run Enso on my Windows PC), and now runs Mozilla Labs.<p>Emulating a Canon Cat would be neat.  Putting a real Canon Cat online would be hard without the special keys.  It wouldn't be inconceivable to put an Apple IIe online, and plug in a SwyftCard: essentially a basic Canon Cat expansion card for the Apple IIe.  There have been some efforts to get a copy of SwyftWare, the software version of this (I've even emailed Aza asking if he had a copy) and try to get it running in an emulator, but no-one's had any luck in the few years I've been watching people try (I own an Apple IIe with a SwyftCard).",1241660741

The best explanation for smoking the <i>first</i> time is social pressure. Maybe the first few times. After that, the best explanation for smoking is nicotine addiction. When you are used to the effect of nicotine, smoking a cigarette makes you feel good.<p>Also, not that I advise smoking cigarettes, but you can avoid burning your throat and lungs with good technique. Don't just suck on it like you are sucking juice through a straw; you will inhale too much smoke too quickly. Instead, only loosely touch your lips to the end of the cigarette, and inhale slowly. That will both let air mix with the cigarette smoke and give it some time to cool. If you do it right you should not burn your throat or lungs at all and the experience should be purely pleasurable.<p>(Damn... I'm going to talk myself back into smoking if I'm not careful.)",1241660226

It doesn't take an enormous amount of time to learn how to use Eclipse.  It probably takes 15 minutes of someone showing you the ropes.  You need to stop thinking of the problem as ""I need a text editor"" because that's almost certainly not what you need.<p>Eclipse in particular does nothing like what you claim (""unnecessary metadata and internal abstractions"") except one or two files in the root of your project's directory tree.  Upgrading your machines to support Eclipse means at worst spending $20 to buy 2Gb more memory, which doesn't seem like a lot to me.<p>All of the requirements you mention (plus a lot more) are available today in Eclipse.

You just have to trick your mind into instinctively realizing smoking is fundamentally stupid, the same instinct that kicks in when you see a code segment that goes ""if (x = y) { ..."".<p>Instead of trying to control the craving or stop thinking about cigarettes, you have your brain evaluate the ""should I smoke right now?"" question with the answer _no_. Once I did that, I found quitting smoking surprisingly easy. I still think about it quite a bit, but so far I haven't strayed from the correct answer even a little bit.<p>Regular exercise right at the beginning will help you ride out the initial physical cravings.

597213,story,,,27,51,abalashov,"Ask HN: Reasonable Java editor for heavily CLI-oriented UNIX types who hate bloat?",,"Hi everyone --<p>Let me give some background to properly contextualise this question:<p>I am the type of programmer that has been doing UNIX (generally Linux, also some commercial varieties) since 5th grade or so, and consequently am very command-line oriented in my habits.  Did mostly C growing up, and a fair bit of Perl later.<p>So, obviously, when I was faced with the real-world need to do some Java, I approached it with my usual arsenal of half a dozen, uh, terminals and vi (VIM) sessions.  Eventually I broke down and started using 'ant' for building instead of Makefiles, but apart from that, this approach has served me well.<p>I wouldn't mind a more Java-aware editor, though;  something that can save me a little time on the tedious task of having to switch in and out of editor windows without having a holistic view of my source tree, as well as provide cross-referencing of symbols and API-specific autocomplete and perhaps online javadoc summaries built right into the editor.  I spend a lot of time juggling all these editors and 15 tabs in my browser.<p>I've looked at Eclipse and NetBeans, but, they're just <i>way</i> too bloated and complicated.  It would take me an enormous amount of time to figure out how to use them correctly and do things the Eclipse Way or NetBeans Way, and I don't think it'd be worth the flexibility I'd be giving up.  Plus, they do far, far more internally than I really need, and I'd have to upgrade half my desktop machines just to stand a hope of realistically running them.  They introduce gigantic piles of unnecessary metadata and internal abstractions I don't really want to deal with for my relatively simple, terse code (as much as Java can be).<p>On top of that, much of my development is server-side and, although I can mount the code tree with SSHFS or NFS or whatnot, local building and testing is essentially useless.<p>So, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a decent editor for someone in this predicament.  I'm imagining something like an ""IDE lite,"" or perhaps a really glorified take on UltraEdit (but not for Windows).  I don't really know.  Something that can get me the aspects of Eclipse that make editing Java code easier without all of the metadata, complicated build processes, user interface bulk, or sheer scope.
