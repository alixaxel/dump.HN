But, for the code you do have to write, and for deciding exactly how to code less, the underlying talent has to do with <i>managing risk by decomposing your problem into small chunks</i>.<p>Once you have your ""problem"" pared down to the minimum needed, if you can decompose your system into lots of small parts that you can analyze easily and make darn sure are correct, then you can code without having to backtrack and do costly debugging.

590573,comment,589608,589733,0,0,Shooter,,,"I definitely believe it could be true.  I don't think the music story would be out of character for Einstein.<p>One of my academic advisors was Professor Robert Borkenstein (he invented the breathalyzer, among other things.)  Before he got into academia, he had worked as a police captain and forensics advisor to various organizations, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police.  I was visiting Borkenstein's office once, long after he became a Professor Emeritus, and I commented on some artwork he had on the wall.  I was really just making small-talk out of nervousness, and I hadn't really even looked at the drawings beyond a quick glance.  Borkenstein perked up and asked me to really examine the drawings, and tell him what I thought about them.  They were just sketches and doodles, mostly...nothing elaborate. I was going to just say they were 'nice"" out of courtesy, when I realized a few of them were signed...by Albert Einstein.<p>It turned out that Borkenstein had worked as a guard for Einstein and some of the other scientists involved in the US nuclear efforts when he was younger.  He wasn't supposed to interact with any of them, he was just there to help insure their protection.  One day, Bob was so curious about the mechanics of something they were discussing that he forgot his place and asked a question.  Einstein apparently spent quite a bit of time explaining the confusing concept, and became fond of Bob and his curiosity.  He recognized that Bob had a very inventive mind and apparently wanted to encourage it, so whenever Bob worked a shift, Einstein would chat with him. Einstein had drawn most of the sketches on the wall to explain various concepts, although some of them were just absent-minded sketches.  He let Bob keep them when the protection detail ended.<p>The sketches meant a great deal to Bob, and I think he had kept them somewhere in his office for his entire career.  I also think the sketches (and personal attention from Einstein) helped provide some of the impetus for Bob's inventing career. Unfortunately, I don't recall all of the details Bob gave when telling his story about the Einstein discussions, but I remember that he was very reverential, awed that Einstein had taken the time to discuss important things with a guard.  I think Einstein was genuinely fascinated with how other people view the world...and they say a new perspective is worth XXX IQ points, right?",1241328110

To disprove ""All gender role is social"", it technically suffices to show only one example of a gender role that could not possibly be social. I actually cite many (as I consider each child I know a separate data point). It should also be pointed out that it's non-trivial, which is why I shared it in the first place; even very knowledgeable non-parents (such as I was) can be surprised by the reality.<p>I thought I might be overstretching with that bit about not buying into the ""line"", but maybe not. Logic 101, universals can be disproven with a single counterexample. Logic 301 or so, very-nearly-universals can be rendered implausibly unlikely with just a few counterexamples with little regard to distribution. That only works on very-nearly-universals, but it's perfectly sound. (I'm not out to show that gender is 100% biological, only that 100% social is an absurdity.)

I was glad to find an article that posits some alternative hypotheses and simply acknowledges that the answers are not so simple as they might seem, and that discusses the issue from a neutral, non-activist viewpoint. I read Pinker's article in The New Republic, but this one talks about the issue more than about the discussion itself.<p>One thing I kept expecting the talk to mention as I was reading was the importance of outliers. While I agree that comparisons of fundamental ability between the sexes, as opposed to factors such as motivation, is probably flawed, I think it might make the argument more immune to activist criticism to point out that there are always outliers in either group. Just because men may be, on average, more inclined to build large businesses, for example, does not mean that each man is more inclined to build large businesses than every woman — the curves overlap. Of course, the different shape of the distributions are important, as Baumeister pointed out (the male curves tend to be bimodal in certain cases whereas the female ones might be more normal). But there are always outliers, and so there will probably always be certain woman who are better at any given thing than most men; even though there may be more men than woman who are 'really good'. The entire talk discusses generalities and statistical tendencies, I know, but might easily be confused by less sophisticated readers as talking about individuals, which seems to be the common criticism of such talk.",1241327739

Alas, he had no idea how to do that (or rather, he obviously had a very good idea how to do it, but was unable to put it into words), but the quote resonates a lot with my experience.  I've wasted so much time on projects that in retrospect weren't really all that important - I coded them quickly, and learned quite a bit that came in handy later, but the problems themselves were basically non-problems.",1241327164

Existing tax preparation software takes past returns into account and just asks the user to enter new information. How would Mint's system be better (aside from having access to your banking history)? The third-party intervention (and profit) doesn't go away.",1241327150

Where is the medium here, and how is such a thing even remotely close to a reason why Windows 7 is not the answer? You answer this dialog once after you first install, and you never see it again if you use recommended settings. So what's so confusing about that?",1241326905
