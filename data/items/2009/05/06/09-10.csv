They managed not only to do so, but they saved up quite a pile of cash as well.  All of that took a lot of hard work and due diligence.  They reap what they sow.<p>That having been said, inflation is still a reality for them.  Right <i>now</i> their growth rate is around 6%, but their inflation is probably around 4%.  That means they're only getting 2% growth, which is paltry.  How much will inflation go up with the government stimulus being applied?<p>Still, it is better than how we're doing, but the point is that the truth is --as usual-- a little more complicated than the news would suggest.  It also seems doubtful that they can have meaningful growth when so much of their economy is dependent on exports, unless the current bout of reforms manages to build up the middle class so that they have self-sustaining growth.  This is at least as difficult as the feat they just accomplished in reining in inflation.",1241603366
