But Alpha has the possibility possibility of being useful to people who wouldn't even visit the site.<p>At the very minimum, it has a lot of potential for search aggregation. Let's say that someone wanted to create a site that aggregated travel information. It sounds like a developer could basically create mini-travel guides on demand for specific regions or towns. So you would quickly get info on  crime, cost, food, weather, and tourist attractions. Or you could actually just rank travel places based on certain criteria. So if I wanted to find a cheap place that currently had warm weather, beaches, and low crime, I might be able to get a lot of useful information. I wouldn't need to use Alpha myself, somebody would have just had to develop a site to aggregate the results.<p>I have no idea what it's killer use will be, but this has the potential to be very useful to developers.

Any ex-employee could take a copy of the verify function and a dump of the database and hack it home. Similarly a cracker who gets a DB dump of the passwords will probably get your code too.<p>Running sha1() in PHP on each of the 98569 words in /usr/share/dict/words takes 1 second on my laptop. Appending all of the numbers 1-100 to each of those, not surprisingly ups the time to about 1m40s. You'll probably get quite a lot of users with passwords like that.",1241398981
