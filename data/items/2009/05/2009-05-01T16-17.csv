It's not so much treating pollution the way we approach transportation/infrastructure as it is changing the way we approach transportation/infrastructure.  While the technology would have made it impractical to implement, why wouldn't we but electronic tolling on all roads on a pay per use basis?  We could even privatize most of them.  The whole reason we have urban sprawl is because highways have been underpriced.  One great example is Hong Kong's MTR system that charges you based on where you started in the system and where you got off.  Incredibly convenient and efficient.  Heck, even China tolls practically all its highways.<p>That said I'm not sure this type of stuff will help us get out of a recession but at least it makes people pay for the services that they use.  We may even get better roads and highways out of it if the owners of the roads (be they governments or otherwise) are incentivized by the revenues from them because they'd be better tracked.",1241196545

Each additional episode would lessen her demand for another episode. But that's only after seeing a large number of episodes. After one episode, the demand may actually be higher than having seen no episodes at all.<p>And if denied demand has negative utility -- the more you want something you can't have, the more it annoys you -- then that person who has seen one episode is actually worse off than the second viewer who has seen no episodes.<p>That stops being true at the point where each additional episode begins having declining returns, which could occur at a point after five episodes.",1241195720

Also, running.<p><i>If they aren't computing, then what are they doing?

Coming from a CS-heavy Philosophy-light background, it took me a long time to wrap my mind around what Searle was saying there, but it's a pretty solid point nonetheless. The best way I've found to explain it in CS terms is that while theoretically, intelligence could be modeled using Turing machines, in practice, we will never have a machine fast enough to do so.<p><i>When I make a decision I consult my values and my goals and attempt to make the decision that gets me closest to my goals without compromising my values</i><p>We have no idea how you or I make decisions, and the notion that we can intuit how decisions are made is a huge road block in even beginning to think about decision-making. Lakoff, among others, does a great job explaining why ""values"", ""goals"", and ""morals"" are simply justifications we create after we've made a decision.<p>> And what makes you think we couldn't build a biological computer<p>We can, and we should - but let's agree that it won't be a Turing machine.",1241194198
