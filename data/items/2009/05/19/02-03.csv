After having hosted with them, I don't recommend clients use them any more.  They are more marketing than technical substance.  One of the critiques that he makes is that their database infrastructure is on a shared architecture - which unfortunately is true.  They separate all of their front end slices out, but all of their database are on a shared architecture.  Unfortunately with most apps that have scaling issues, those issues are related to database access - which makes that the exact worse part of the system to be shared.  Without going into too much more EY bashing, they sell you on the idea that you have a full time admin working on your site, but the reality is vastly different.  Personally, I've had much better luck using SliceHost than EngineYard, but YMMV.",1242701858

616141,comment,615640,616100,0,0,mbreese,,,"The advantage that RNA expression arrays has over mass-spec is that the techniques used are just a highly scaled up version of the northern and/or southern (depending on the method) hybridization blots that have been in use forever.  The corresponding protein technique (western blots) requires individual anti-bodies, and as such is just not scalable to the same degree.<p>So, instead we are left with mass-spec solutions that miss a ton of data.  Not all peptides can be read on a mass-spec, and if you do get a peptide, it's up to the software to figure out what it was.<p>Also, the data analysis in proteomics has been a known issue for many years.  There are little to no standards since it takes so long to run samples.  At the same point in the microarray field, the statistical and data analysis techniques were largely worked out.  But again, this is due to the 'simplicity' of the measurements.  It is just plain easier to measure known RNA or DNA sequences.<p>That's not to say mass-spec isn't useful, because it is.  But I highly doubt it will be able to ever give us a complete picture of the proteome.<p>It's kinda funny, because we are seeing a shift in the transcriptome world that is now moving toward rapid sequencing approaches that mirror mass-spec a great deal.",1242701662

Dobelle's company was supposed to provide life-long support for Jens and Robertson but that has ended. The company ran out of funding within the last 2 years.

616130,comment,613356,613711,0,0,ClausV,,,"I must concur with miles.  All too often we (end users/system administrators) can get enamored with a utility that has some great features and neglect to understand how it functions and any consequences it may bring (known/unknown).  ""Trust but verify"" I think someone once said.  I certainly am not a programming expert so I can't disassemble such a tool. But I imagine I could (like miles) think of some testing that might validate if a system is being compromised by such a tool or if the effect is memory-resident only.   In the past this is the kind of tool that our technicans and other system administrators would have rejoiced over.  Imagine being able to access and service end users (non-Active Directory shop) Windows user accounts when they were out and we show up after a two-hour drive and could not log on to their profile?  Awesome time-saver.  Sure we could change their password from our admin service account, but then we would have to leave a note for a callback.  This is a transparent ""solution"" that leaves the passwords intact...just completely ignored.  However, if in our enthusiasm to have an easy solution (and not validating what is really happening) we run the risk of spreading some kind of malicious rootkit or sleeper issue behind.  That is why (as miles suggests) Piotr's release of the source code could be valuable.  It likely won't detract from the hard work he has done, but would allow skilled coders to understand and ""proof"" his work.  I can only imagine he has his reasons.  As has been noted in these comments, Nitin Kumar and Vipin Kumar have released their Vbootkit 2.0 code openly...and others have already started to review it ( [Dailydave] Nitin Kumar & Vipin Kumar: ""please remember to give necessary credit to the authors"" PKB. - <a href=""http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2007-April/004288.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2007-April/...</a> ) and compare it to the eEye BootRoot project <a href=""http://research.eeye.com/html/tools/RT20060801-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.eeye.com/html/tools/RT20060801-7.html</a> . Based on what I have read and the research that miles and others have done on this and other bootkit tools that are ""open"" in the code, it likely (warning: logical conjecture here) hijacks the memory during the BIOS to bootloader process.  From there it hooks INT 0x13 to control content of memory sectors loaded by NTLDR and begins patching areas of the kernel specifically dealing with the security profiles and user SAM files dealing with user logon authentication and the GINA processes. With these patched, the operator can access these profiles without any password input needed.  What makes this tool (and Vbootkit) interesting is that they take the normal stay-resident MBR bootkit design <a href=""http://www2.gmer.net/mbr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.gmer.net/mbr/</a> and do it all on the fly (apparently) leaving no trace on the system behind.  That's pretty sophisticated stuff.  Particularly when it has been coded to work on both Windows as well as Linux kernels.  This similarity with MBR bootkits likely leaves some (as seen in the comments) that it must be leaving a MBR bootkit behind.  However the MBR on a test system can be hashed/checked (as well as inspected at the sector level with a hex-editor) by a number of tools such as mbr.exe - <a href=""http://www2.gmer.net/mbr/mbr.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.gmer.net/mbr/mbr.exe</a> or GMER - <a href=""http://www.gmer.net/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gmer.net/index.php</a> and also including an off-line boot of the system using a LiveCD boot disk (to ensure the OS booting the system to check isn't compromised by any potential rootkits left on the system).  As miles stated, the MBR is not changed by Kon-Boot.  Mitigation?  Pretty severe stuff:  disable CD/DVD, USB, PXE booting of the system in BIOS. Then password the BIOS.  Then (as thras has pointed out) you need to apply a pre-boot authentication solution and/or whole disk encryption; TrueCrypt, PGP, CE-Infosys for example seem to work great against Kon-Boot.  Only then will you likely stand a chance against a Kon-Boot attack...at least on Windows systems.  Please Piotr, release your l33t coding!  We are dying to know your method!",1242700707

It looks more impressive to write O(n).<p>And to try being helpful: do aggregation in the db where possible, be sure indexes are good, play around with the number of rows you process at a time, use joins if appropriate to minimize queries, if your queries are expensive at all use EXPLAIN, depending on the database, look into using a cursor (maybe?).",1242698619

RNA expression arrays were in much the same state several years ago.  The key is to make sure that the variation comes from the biological samples, and perhaps the instrumentation, with the methods not being a source for those differences.  Two things that the field needs to do is (a) make raw data available so that experiments can be reproduced and (b) uses consistent data formats.  Standards can/will follow.<p>One experiment I would like to see is the same lab doing the same experiment multiple times on the same sample on different instruments (of the same make and model).  Results should be interesting.",1242698538
