624578,comment,624405,624563,0,0,TriinT,,,"But isn't oil carbon neutral? ;-)<p>It's widely accepted that oil has a biological origin (some people dispute that). The carbon absorbed by plants millions of years ago had to come from somewhere, and that is the CO2 in the atmosphere. If oil is derived from those plants, then burning oil simply releases the CO2 that was sequestered underground for millions of years. If there was life before, I think there will be life despite AGW. The number of humans may drop dramatically, of course.",1243191433

It was not easy for the medical establishment to accept a theory that relied on the existence of a completly unknown and invisible substance.<p>Also, the post-napoleonic Austria-Hungary was an extremely conservative society. Revolutionary ideas and paradigm-changes were definitiely not the positive buzzwords they are today.<p>Here is a wonderful quote by the emperor: (<a href=""http://www.archive.org/stream/austriahungary00legeiala/austriahungary00legeiala_djvu.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/stream/austriahungary00legeiala/austr...</a>):\n<i>Hold to that which is old, for that is good; if our ancestors were pleased with it to be so, why not we? \nNew ideas are to-day being advanced of which I do not nor ever shall approve.
