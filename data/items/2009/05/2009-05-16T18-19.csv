612419,story,,,9,3,jdavid,"HowTo: Vista: Use NETSH to Run IIS7 & Apache on port 80",,"Vista: Use NETSH to Run IIS7 & Apache<p>Setting up IIS7 & Apache to use virtual hosting on port 80<p>Introduction<p>Like many of you I was skeptical about Vista for a number of reasons, it had a cloudy feature set, rumors of palladium code, and well, people told me it was slow.  And don’t forget that since it requires new drivers, most of the drivers are just coming out of beta and were quite buggy for some time.<p>However, I am here to tell you that there are some really KICK ASS features in Vista that you have never heard about, and the new NETSH or Network Shell command line tool is one of them.  Linux users have had tools like the new NETSH for a while now, but now Windows has it two.<p>To make use of this little trick we are going to use NETSH HTTP (Network Shell) an upgraded command line utility that comes only with newer versions of Windows like Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.  This particular command allows you to manage what ports you listen to for HTTP traffic.<p>By default most webservers listen to your computer’s loopback address 127.0.0.1 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopback) or LOCALHOST for traffic.  The problem is that they also bind to port 80 on LOCALHOST, which blocks other applications or services on your computer from binding to that same port, which is exactly what we are trying to get around. Some default settings for server apps like apache and iis7 bind to all network interfaces (IP addresses) on port 80 making it worse.  To get around this I use a little known fact of network architecture, which is that the loopback address of 127.0.0.1is not the only loopback address that is reserved for your computer.  In fact the entire 127.x.x.x address space is reserved just for your internal machine.<p>I have to admit that I was inspired by this article on the web to overload the network interface with two IP addresses, but where they use the 192.x.x.x IP address space reserved for local internal networks (10.x.x.x is also reserved for the same purpose), so I decided to use the network reserved for your computer’s internal loopback, which results in fewer network effects on your local network where other computers in your office might need to communicate with you.  So in my setup, you will have one external IP to send requests to, and multiple web servers responding to them.<p>The second part of this hack, requires you to use HTTP 1.1 protocols or virtual hosting. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#HTTP_1.1_Upgrade_header)  HTTP added a very widely used but forgotten feature that specifies the HOST’s domain name in the http request.  Many servers like IIS and Apache then use the domain name to determine which site to server.  This allowed one machine to host many sites, and subdomains of a network.  So in our network we want http://apache.foo.com and http://iis7.foo.com to host from the same server, so not only can we branch via a single server now, but we can branch between multiple servers by overloading the loopback.<p>{internet} => {ext IP 192.0.0.x} => {loopback 127.0.0.1} => {127.0.0.2:80 = apache, 127.0.0.3:80 => iis7}<p>Walkthrough (Vista)<p>Using NETSH HTTP to listen to 127.0.0.2 & 127.0.0.3<p>For additional reference on NETSH HTTP

By Fischer's definition, yes, but I've written very non-functional (ha) code in OCaml. It's a multi-paradigm language, which happens to have very good support for functional programming, but it isn't limited to it. (I've also written very functional code in idiomatic Lua.

I gave the exdample a week or two back of searching on 'Orson Welles' - you can ask 'who directed [OW movie]' and it'll tell you, but 'what movies did OW direct' (and yes I tried many variants) always gets you an error.<p>In this respect it feels like the sort of thing that has always annoyed me about expert systems: it's useful to the extent that you are already familiar with what data is curated therein, and want a handy way to look it up, but rather frustrating for surfing and exploration. I do like it...but I can't help sharing some people's view that it's sort of an ad for Mathematica.<p>It will find a use as citation source - you can embed statistics or factual info in your web page and reference Alpha, in relative comfort that the data there is factually correct. On the other hand, the lack of specificity in the citation info means it won't be quite adequate for academic use, at least not just yet. Might be that its best market will be among high school students who will a) buy Mathematica later and b) grow up with Alpha as past generations did with their slide rules or TI calculators, and stick with it as it evolves.<p>I didn't take time to play with the API yet - superficially it looks flexible, but I'm only a hobby coder.

Some general thoughts:<p>A) Double-check your employment agreement for clauses that might give ownership of the code to your employer, even though you thought you were developing the code on your own time. (In some U.S. jurisdictions, overly-aggressive clauses along that line may be unenforceable.)<p>B) If you developed the code in question before going to work for your employer, keep an eye out for ways to demonstrate that fact. (In court, truth is always the goal, but what actually matters is admissible evidence.)<p>C) ""Playing nice"" is usually the best approach.<p>D) It's almost as important to be able to document that you played nice -- without being too self-serving in your writing -- as it is actually to play nice. That's because in court, judges and juries can sometimes be skeptical of the testimony of witnesses who have interests to protect; contemporaneous written documentation is often regarded as more reliable.<p>E) Assuming your employment contract doesn't contain any special language giving your employer the ownership of your code, a simple exchange of emails -- which you'll want to keep in your personal files -- may well do the trick. At a minimum, it would make a lawyer for your employer think hard before recommending taking any action against you.<p>F) If you're a university student, vice employee, the ownership issue might be a bit more complicated, but OTOH the university may be less likely to care about ownership than a company would.<p>(Usual disclaimer:  Don't rely on this as a substitute for legal advice, consult a lawyer, etc.)",1242497865
