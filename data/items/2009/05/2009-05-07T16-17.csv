I think they're both definitely worth learning, but I would not call them a ""more robust, equally versatile scientific field"".  A bachelor's in physics is fairly specific to giving you the foundations you need to do well in grad school.  You can do a lot with it because workplaces use it as a signalling device for ""I can think quantitatively"", and so are more likely to hire a physics major than a random liberal arts major.  But other than a general respect for data (which you'll get in any scientific degree), I haven't used <i>any</i> skill I learned in my physics courses.

And also assuming that you want to load entries from a database, as opposed to having the information in a flat file (As I believe HN does)<p>The obvious and easy way would be to write a small recursive function that loads posts from the database where the parent is the current post. There are two disadvantages to this approach as I see it:<p>1) It doesn't deal well with posts that have children being deleted.<p>2) You would need to make a DB call every time you call the recursive function, resulting in a large number of DB calls to show a thread.<p>The first problem could be solved by not actually deleting the DB entry when an entry is deleted, but merely deleting the text. When you display the post you can check whether the textfield is empty and display [deleted] or something similar.<p>The second problem is a bit more hairy, I think. You could load all the entries of a thread into an array in one DB call and have your recursive function look through the array every time it runs. The problem is that this would be using a Shlemiel the painter's algorithm[1]. So maybe the solution is to delete entries from the array as the recursive function uses them.<p>How would you do it?<p>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlemiel_the_painter%27s_Algorithm and http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/fog0000000319.html",1241714897

It might feel so to you, but it is not an absolute truth. Some people (like me) like to explore the vast wonders of nature rather than create an imperfect object that tries to mimic the perfection of nature (most inventions fall under this category).<p>It's not a question of right or wrong or superiority or inferiority. To each, his/her own.<p>And it's not about 'creativity' as another commenter explains either. Science, the art(!) of coming up with generalisations and laws expalining a vast array of phenomena calls for a lot of creativity. The top notch people in every field are there because they are creative. Creative in coming up with new mind-boggling explanations (can you get any more creative than coming up with Quantum mechanics? :) ), thinking of new ways to measure things, thinking of ways to put a new theory under 'stress test'.<p>I don't understand what you mean by 
""Many computer scientists devote their time to studying other people's inventions (e.g., social networking, blogging, tagging, etc.)""

So, if they happen to be computer scientists interesting in social networking, etc., they might find it interesting to analyze and understand the dynamics of it; they like to tear things apart and look at the basics.<p>If you ask for the 'social' utility of it, I could say such analyses form the basis of ""inventing new things"", but that's actually not the point; the scientists do it for their own curiosity. Just like you would feel rewarding to create an AI, they feel it rewarding to analyze it and understanding completely.<p>>Why is that rewarding?<p>This question, IMHO, is inappropriate - things are rewarding because they are.
