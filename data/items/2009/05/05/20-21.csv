On her new MacBook, I've SMB sharing setup on her images folder (as well as AFP), but I'm not able to connect to her ""share"" from my windows laptop.  There's certainly a way to do this (or at least I think there should be), but it for sure doesn't ""just work"".<p>also, I just have to say that Finder (IMHO) just plain sucks.  When I've navigated to a sub directory in an app (say via a ""Open"" dialog), it will remember that location for the next time it is opened.  However, let's say you click ""Open"" again - you'll be dropped back in where you were (which is fine), but you have no way of going ""up"" a directory any more (since it's not in the current history).  The only thing to do is change file views at this point so you can see the entire hierarchy, then click where you need go.  I know how to do this, but my wife still hates it.<p>She also gets frustrated when an app is already running (she doesn't know that), and she clicks on the icon in the dock and it does not come to the front of other windows.  She thinks the app is not responding, and gets frustrated.<p>I can go on if you want more...<p>Thanks!",1241557149

The idea is that a short nap helps you feel refreshed if you can keep it just that: a short nap.

There's even a diagram in there that shows 32.2% of textbooks prices come from printing costs.<p>But here's the thing: the full ""printing cost"" category includes ""paper, <i>printing, editorial costs.</i>"" I'd wager, like most physical media of our day, the manufacturing costs are just a sliver of the actual margin. The value does not come from the grade of plastic on your DVD, it's the content, obviously. In other words, ""editorial costs.""<p>These include things like office rent in Manhattan, employee salaries and stuff that's not going to be affected a single bit by the distribution channel.

594659,comment,591236,594041,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"> Yup. And then that thing will become available to the poor. Do you really want to argue that it's good to slow down that cycle?<p>To an extent, yes - we've gone over this already.  As mentioned, the very fact of this imbalance can cause a society that is overall less happy.<p>> Actually, you weren't. You explicitly stated ""the society where the cure does not exist at all, and all are in the same boat"". Even if we rewrite that to ""no availability short of universal"", we end up with ""no progress"" because you can't start with universal. You have to start with expensive and rare and grow from there.<p>Whew, way to quote out of context.  Yes, I stated that the society where such a cure was unknown is likely to be happier.  This is not the same as advocating zero advancement.  There is a suffering generated by partial availability of such a cure, and a suffering generated by the total unavailability of such a thing - and  my point is that in the US and UK the latter is neglected.<p>quoth me: ""No, I am not a commie, and I am in full favour of some income disparity as a motivator towards useful output"".<p>You've set up a straw man.  I could do the same to you - I could imply that you favour a society where the richest 1% have 99% of the wealth, can afford genetic manipulations that make them vastly physically and intellectually superior to the rest of society, while the rest have little more than they do now.  Really, though, in the end we're talking about a matter of degree, not absolutes.<p>> Me - I'm glad that rich people are willing to pay to be alpha testers.<p>Poor analogy, implies that there's some kind of cost/downside to the rich in this role.<p>> Actually, it's largely a construct of an envy campaign. Telling people that they have it bad has consequences.<p>So the fact that people know they're massively less well off than another segment of society (despite working 63 jobs and getting hardly any time off) makes them unhappy?  Sounds, well, kind of like what I've been saying.<p>> Do you really think that ""happy, brutish, short"" needs no justification? (Not to mention that ""happy"" is overstated.)<p>You're right, the lives of western european nations are happy, brutish, and short, thanks to their smaller income disparity.  Have you ever visited?  They tend to be happier, have longer lives, and experience less suffering.  Class mobility is vastly higher than in the US.  It would probably be a stretch to call them brutish, although those who spend much time driving in Paris may disagree ;).<p>> Look. You've accused ME of lying. How about some actual evidence.<p><i>shrugs</i> I have none.  After all, I can't see inside your head.  That's why I said 'I think'.  It's not so much of a stretch, though - it's in the interest of the wealthy to advance justifications to support their position, whether they're reasonable or not.",1241554904

Macs use basically the same hardware as the PCs (with some exceptions), but the way it's put together is different. I'm perfectly happy with my MacBook Pro. In fact, I've never been this satisfied with a computer, and I've been working on them since I was 4. But, that's my own personal experience.
