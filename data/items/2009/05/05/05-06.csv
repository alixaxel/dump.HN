Even kernel developers use kd to debug driver code. You done much kernel debugging with gdb? Oh, here's a fun one: debug a running OpenBSD 2.x kernel. Hope you enjoy /dev/kmem.<p>You're the whatever-you-are. I'll let you pretend that disinfecting a compromised running kernel is feasible anywhere.<p>Sorry. I'm sure you're a great guy and you've had lots of experience doing interesting things, but I think you're just dead wrong here, and --- all due respect --- now you're just blowing smoke to cover it.",1241502892

593715,comment,593286,593459,0,0,jawngee,,,"I'm going out on a limb and guessing you've never written an application of any complexity that required it's own binary file format.  I don't mean that as a slag, but your comments leads me to believe that is the case and, therefore, your understanding of the issue is purely speculative.<p>I also think you missed the point, PSD is not designed to be an interchangeable format nor a public one.  It is designed to operate specifically with it's origin application, therefore why should Adobe care if third party developers have a hard time implementing it?  That's not their problem.  There is no onus on Adobe to create some magic file format that third party developers can easily implement.<p>What is their problem is a performant file format with backwards and forwards compatibility that <i>must</i> store a lot of application specific stuff.  Stuff that only their application needs to deal with.<p>As someone who has written a PSD importer for Delphi (in Pascal!) using Adobe's docs, it's really not that terribly difficult for most use cases.  It's just as clear as working with any other RIFF-esque file format.  You can write a simple importer in a couple of days, and a more in-depth one within a week.<p>ymmv, ianal.",1241502835

593700,comment,592918,593668,0,0,mahmud,,,"I have used both, and the win32 API, debugging or otherwise, have often left me baffled and short-changed. Our argument will ultimately break down to source code and its availability. There is also the difference in uses of debugging on win32 vs unix: one is often adversarial while the other is cooperative. It's easy to debug a willing process on Unix and get all the information you want, while in Windows it's easy to debug <i>any</i> process and get as much information as you could.<p>I know ptrace is horribly broken, and so is the entire GNU debugging chain, down to libopcodes. I haven't touched it since '02 when I went full Lisp, but I had many a nightmare debugging a process that forked other children. The mess got worse with LinuxThreads.<p>As for rootkits on Unix, you're the security guy, I will let you pretend removing a Unix rootkit is the same as removing a win32 one :-)<p>And finally, remember that it wasn't long ago that any good Windows debugger had to load <i>under</i> the OS.

While color & refresh time are attractive, LCD devices come at a cost when it comes to serious reading (eyestrain, battery life). Also, like others have mentioned here, I'd want a dedicated reader w/o the distractions. However, the prospects are still enthralling though, with Mary Lou Jespen's Pixel Qi developing LCDs specifically designed for reading for example. Whether it's new e-ink devices, CrunchPad, or the Apple tablet, the innovations (& lowering costs) are just so exciting for an avg. consumer here.<p>I'm curious about the extent to which traditional publishers will shape this market.
