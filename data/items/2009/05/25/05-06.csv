Foster a healthy appreciation for one's children, male or female, so families aren't forced to get rid of their daughters through early marriage. Remove the stigma around condoms; we all fuck and it's a beautiful thing, just be careful kids. Empower women and give them equal employment so they have more time to reach for their dreams and less time popping out kids to latch onto a single source of income personified as a male patriarch. Develop family farms and agriculture and introduce automation to the process, so farmers don't depend on their offspring for labor.<p>etc.",1243231160

(At a <i>multiple</i> of how much you get from the ads!)  Why isn't that someone you?<p>Conversely: if you are not charging money because your users are just piss-poor at actually paying for things (like most apps focused on music -- where most of the cool crowd hums ""yar har diddlee dee, being a pirate is alright to be, do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate"" under their breath), then ads aren't going to succeed either, because no one wants to buy ads targeting people who don't spend money.  (Well, OK, Madison Avenue loves selling those ads and chalking it up to ""branding"", but advertisers are gradually learning to actually measure ROI on those spends, too, and they're terrible.)",1243230315

While the investment of time I've put into iPhone apps has been a very profitable one, it's not quite what you'd expect.<p>Indie development virgins that I know seem to think that the app store is the ONLY feasible way to launch something you've developed on your own. And lots of people I've met who are web developers just want an iPhone app that launches their website or something because they think it'll magically make their website popular.<p>The reality is if you publish something on <i>ANY</i> platform and get it in front of people and put a price on it, you'll make money. It's just that it's intimidating for people who have never published anything on their own.<p>The App Store is certainly has some nice upsides. But the cool thing (and overwhelming thing for newbies) about publishing on normal platforms is that there are a LOT of variables you can control in how people actually find and buy your software.

625082,comment,625034,625062,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""The tech sector had a crash (remember that one?!) and it was not based on decades of old technology.""<p>Was it?<p>I've heard a rather compelling argument that the cause of the 2001 recession wasn't Sept 11 or the dot-com bubble, but the huge drop off in corporate IT spending after Y2K.  The enterprise software market enjoyed a huge run-up from 1996-2000 as enormous companies replaced their aging COBOL mainframes with new Y2K-compliant enterprise Java systems.  Most of the Indian IT consultancy market owes its existence to this, and many other domestic firms (notably Sun Microsystems) also benefited heavily from it.  The consumer dot-com bubble was a relative sideshow compared to this.  And enterprise software is about as price-opaque as you can get.<p>When Y2K rolled around and nothing much happened, all that spending evaporated.  Suddenly, all these companies that had hired a bunch of mediocre Java-monkeys to do quick Y2K fixes found themselves without customers.<p>It does seem a bit different though; in the examples he cites, the industries themselves collapsed, perhaps because of outdated technology and lack of transparency.  In the tech industry, the tech industry's replacement of its own outdated technology created a huge bubble, and then collapsed once that bubble was no longer necessary.",1243229602

Any services would would be more and they did not know how much more until he agreed to pay the 400 bucks.\nFortunately a mutual friend is a nurse and he was able to text him and get a surgeon to unofficially give him a look over and let him know he did not need stitches.\nHe was not convinced when first discussed the issue but less than 24 hours later he agreed based on his new experience as a member of the newly uninsured.",1243227898
