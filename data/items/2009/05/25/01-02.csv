I have invested a lot in AIX, DB2, Oracle and Solaris over the years. It's just that handing the reference to what your product should be compatible with to Microsoft and then trying to compete against them in one of their cash-cows is pretty much the ultimate stupid thing one could try.<p>Microsoft has been caught more than once in unethical and illegal activities, so, why take the risk? Are the APIs so far superior than anything else around? Is it working? Is it bringing a meaningful flow of new cross-platform software? Are the languages so wonderful nothing else comes close?<p>And yes: the US patent system is deeply flawed. And so is he justice system that allowed MS to abuse its monopoly numerous times. I can only hope both get fixed because the US is too an important market to ignore. It seems the EU has a good grip on the situation and maybe the US can follow its leadership on this.",1243216170

People who set out to <i>intentionally</i> (""with the intent"") intimidate, harass, or distress another individual (""a person"") deserves punishment. The word ""substantial"" demonstrates it's for incidents far beyond just saying something like ""You're a dick"" or ""You're wrong because X, Y and Z.""<p>As is usual, though, the problem here isn't with the law as-written but the way it can be <i>misinterpreted</i> and abused by unethical lawyers and judges. How do you prove <i>intent</i> to cause distress? If I were to make a flippant comment about ""Christians"" believing in ""fictional characters"", let's say, it should be obvious I'm not intending to offend or cause emotional distress to ""a person"", but could the law be twisted to force me to prove my innocence in such a minor instance?",1243215340
