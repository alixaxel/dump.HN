The whole funding model of universities in aus now means you get funded on the number degrees granted and bums in seats.  It seems like a way to game the system by lowering the quality bar.  So I remain unconvinced that this is a better approach.  Taking 5 years to do the same overall content, 3 year generalist and then 2 year masters just seems too long (may be experience bias though).  I always though the generalist was things you should just be doing on your own.<p>Bond university when it existed, allowed you to do law in 2-ish years I believe; no holidays and extremely small classes (< 15).  Expensive though.",1243223988

Why not do something that bucks the geek/nerd stereotype?  Why not help someone else do it?  Why not encourage/help someone who's not a stereotypical nerd into the field?  Why not just object to stereotyping of programmers?<p>These aren't problems that are going to change immediately.  Being reminded that there are still problems isn't a bad thing imo.  Just as being reminded that people do care about the issue, and would like to make things different (as you have done).<p>So the problem has been recognized.  There is a will to do something about it.  Let's do something.
