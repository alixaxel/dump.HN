610566,comment,609861,610170,0,0,bokonist,,,"In the U.S. a variety of factors caused law enforcement in the major cities to break down in the late 60's and 70's (factors include: supreme court rulings, the great society, demagoguing politicians, lawsuits).  As a result, crime shot upwards.  In the 80's and 90's there was a backlash, and law enforcement increased significantly (Rudi Guiliani, etc).  As a result, a lot of criminals ended up in jail, and the crime rate dropped.<p>The paradox of lax law enforcement is that in the long run you have a much higher rate of imprisonment because lax law enforcement creates more criminals.  Conversely, Singapore, with its ultra-strict enforcement has very low crime.<p>In terms of policing, America is like the awful parent who alternates between allowing their kid to drink and get in trouble, and then every once in a while throws a fit and beats the kid.  The recipe for good law enforcement is consistency and nipping problems in the bud.  If you've ever studied American law enforcement, you'll find it operates in the exact opposite manner.<p>The crime rate differential between the U.S. and Europe goes back a long time.  If you really want to understand it, I highly recommend this book: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=NGBLAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=crime+in+America+and+the+police"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=NGBLAAAAMAAJ&printsec=f...</a>  Written in 1920, it barely needs any updating today.  And what is the primary causes of the difference in crime rate?  President Taft sums it up the best: ""It is not much to say, that the administration of criminal law in this country is a disgrace to our civilization, and that the presence of crime and fraud, which is greatly in excess of that in the European countries, is due largely to the failure of the law and its administration to bring criminals to justice.""",1242395999

610560,comment,610263,610406,0,0,ars,,,"There are plenty of uses for null. For example: last failed login date. What do you put if it never happened? You put NULL.<p>As a general rule, there is no good ""empty"" value for things that are not strings, so you use NULL for those.<p>For your boolean: you have a new user and want to ask if he wants the widget enabled. They could say yes or no - but until you ask, you set it to NULL, and it's an excellent flag for your application that means: ask the user.<p>If you have never used NULLs in your databases, well, that's more a failing on your part than a failing on the concept of NULL.<p>Sometimes you want them, and sometimes you don't - that's why the database asks you.<p>NULL is used as the answer to x/0.<p>NULL is used to indicate lack of records on an outer join.<p>If you ask for the average value of something - and there are no rows, you get NULL - what else should it return? 0 is not the correct answer.<p>> a computer that says ""I don't know"" is not a useful computer<p>And a computer that returns incorrect information is worse. You asked it ""what are the total sales for august"". You did not ask ""what are the sales so far for august"".<p>Without the NULL as the answer, how does your front end application know to collect the running average to display to the user? You most certainly do have to detect NULL.<p>I will admit it's very rare to use NULL instead of an empty string (in fact in some versions of oracle NULL and the empty string are the same). But NULL is used frequently for other datatypes. And it's used frequently in other parts of databases.",1242395826

Off-the-cuff reactions are often pretty defensive. If you have an articulate counter-argument, that's different, of course.<p>Also, as a general rule, it's probably worth trying to avoid being snide.

I don't know if you're a procrastinator, but I am, and one of the things I've discovered about myself is that my procrastination is closely linked with my perfectionism.  The things I <i>really</i> care about are things that I want to be perfect, so I put off doing them.  Example, let's say I want to redesign my blog.  I start off with a couple simple improvements in my mind.  However, I really want this redesign to be <i>perfect</i>.  Pretty soon, I've turned a small, simple task into a huge project and the burden of accomplishing it is just too large, so I put it off.  Do I really care about this redesign?  Yeah, I care way too much about it.  If I didn't care, I'd just knock it out in a few minutes.<p>I've since learned that I have to force myself to accept the ""good enough"" solution, to work in iterations, and to do timeboxing (I use the pomodoro method) so that I just get started on something, without worrying too much about the big picture.  Most of all though, it really does come down to just mental discipline, to recognizing when you're putting something off (which itself can be difficult to a life-long procrastinator) and forcing yourself to just do it now.  Sadly, like a recovering drug addict, I'm afraid it's something I'll always have to fight against.",1242392751
