They lock accounts without reason and don't offer much support as to why<p>I'm not sure this is what keeps people from using Paypal on the consumer side but from the vendor side I can attest to how damaging this can be.  At my work we took PayPal for donations until one day a donor called and told us Paypal ""wouldn't accept money""  I looked into it and found they had, for whatever reason, decided we weren't a non-profit.  They then locked the account with not so much as an e-mail to us.<p>There is pretty much no way to get an actual person at paypal so I had to upload scans of our proof and just wait for paypal to ""review them.""  All in all it took 9 days to remedy the situation and who knows how much money we lost in the meantime.<p>Worse yet, I'm almost sure we lost a couple first time donors forever simply because seeing ""This Paypal account has been locked"" makes a company (us) look disreputable",1243341092
