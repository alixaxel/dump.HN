I wish I had the motivation you do when I was in your position.<p>My suggestion is to take a year out anyway even if you don't find something and work a part time job while doing some open source development. This way you will get the experience of working on a large development project with people. When it comes time to interview you will have code that has made it into software that your prospective employer might even use. Also when they google you your name will appear associated with this work.<p>The successful applicants for the Google SoC have been announced already and there are a whole load of good projects that didn't get picked. You could pick one, approach the team, and tell them you're willing to work on it if they'll mentor you a bit.",1241952742

To make that point I need only cite all the Microsoft Execs who were quoted saying ""OS/2 is the way of the future and We'll be phasing Windows out""<p>*  Vista isn't popular with ""die hard Windows fans"".  In fact, a big part of the reason Vista is failing is because there are a lot of things you can do in XP that you can't do in Vista (try right clicking on a network drive and looking for ""Search"" if you don't believe me)<p>*  I don't see how you can have this sentence ""Today’s Microsoft is impulsive and sloppy."" and then follow it immediately with this ""It has become massive and complex with too many layers of management, committees, and bureaucracy to produce anything great ""  You're either bureaucratic or impulsive but you can't really be both<p>*  Microsoft did not ""rest on their laurels"" after IE6.  What did happen is that Jim Allchin decided Windows = IE and disolved the IE team by integrating them into the Windows team.  So when Vista's development timeline went to hell so too did IE.  But there were always people working on it.<p>*  Microsoft did not ""get lazy"" and miss the Internet boat in the mid-90s.  What they did do was ""get proprietary"" and back MSN as a competitor to the Internet (remember that back then AOL was the competitor to beat and they didn't even have Internet access integrated yet).<p>I could go on but the point is made I think.  You should know a little something about Microsoft before you write a post on how the company went wrong.",1241951869

Individual implementations vary.<p>Your image just shows you don't understand very much about the language. It's not ""wrong"" once you understand what it's doing and why. Show it to anyone who understands what is happening, and you'll look quite foolish. It's not massively complex once you read ""Javascript: The definitive guide (O'Reily)"" - the best book on js by a mile.<p><pre><code>  var obj1 = {};
  // var doesn't return anything, so the interpreter shows 'undefined'.
  var obj2 = {};
  // same again
  obj1 == obj2;
  // Well no, they're different objects. So you'll get false
  var thing = {};
  //
  thing[obj1] = ""hi"";
  // OK this is an odd thing to want to do, but you're doing it anyway.
  // You're using an *object* (obj1), as a key.
  // The js thinks you're idiotic, but complies by calling the .toString() method,
  // and gets ""[object Object]"" or similar by default.
  // (You're free to override that on your object).
  thing[obj2]
  // Once again, you're using an object as a key
  // and acting surprised that js has changed it into a string.
  // So, you created an object and set thing[""object Object""] = ""hi""

So instead of ""Wow! js is retarded"", my response to that code would be ""Why is he trying to use objects as keys? and why is he surprised when js converts them to strings?""
I recommend the above book to clear up things like this.",1241951686

All the author says is that Google tracks us on the internet. So what?<p><i>""Search engines like those of Google, Yahoo and Microsoft can provide the companies that own and manage them with detailed information about many aspects of our lives, including our intimate, personal lives.""</i><p>He doesn't elaborate on this point. What data about my personal life do tracking cookies give those companies? Oh no, Google knows how much I futilely try to disprove Rule 34.<p>Google does have my email and calendar, which could be a problem, but I'm more afraid of the government subpoenaing or PATRIOT Act-ing my data than Google misusing it, and the government can get it no matter who has it. In fact, Google's sheer size increases the financial incentive they have to not misuse my data. Their reputation is incredibly valuable.",1241951281
602002,comment,601891,601996,0,0,tumult,,,"No I'm totally with you, AS3 and C# are way better languages than JS. The CLR (and JVM, too) are all good ideas, I think that's what JS should have been instead of a weirdly dynamic C-syntax language with some useless prototype extension bolted on top (among countless other problems.) But JS, like most of the web technologies we're stuck with, weren't so much designed as they were a series of hacks layered on.. series of tubes.. anyway, I'm preaching to the choir I'm sure.<p>Silverlight is actually a lot better than Flash in most ways that I've found, too bad it's not installed everywhere like Flash is. I would make some comment about MS being evil, but I think they're about on par with Adobe these days (except they still seem to employ engineers occasionally.)",1241951276

There are cameras everywhere, and the government collect detailed information about all citizens.  Strict regulations exist to ensure that this information can only be used by the government, and there is an outrage only when these regulations are broken.<p>It is not surprising that these two views on the role of information in society clash.  Information is power, and the question if this power should be centralized in the government, or spread out to the people.   The risk of abuse is far greater for the later, but the consequences of abuse is far greater for the former.<p>Some may prefer a third way, an opaque society where public information won´t be collected, even though the technical means for doing so exists.
