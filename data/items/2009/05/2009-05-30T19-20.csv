634026,comment,633700,633836,0,0,boundlessdreamz,,,"the ""maybe"" was for the ""china"" thing. But it is a big maybe. Here is why<p>AFAIK Google didn't hand over any user info to chinese authorities. They just merely censored the results. Between getting no access to google and having censored results, even if i was chinese I would have preferred getting the censored version.Why? because google is not used to find the censored topics. It is used more widely to get information on non censored topics. The loss of the world's biggest search engine would have been quite bad.<p>Also, google stood up to the US authorities when they demanded handing over user info while yahoo and MS happily handed it over.<p>So in my eyes, google has not screwed over its users or its partners. The biggest crime they may have committed is pulling the plug on some services ot letting some rot (feedburner). But those are free services and if it doesn't generate profit for them, they are right to pull the plug. In most of the cases they allowed the user enough time to get their data off the pulled service.<p>You can bash google for all you want but I think it is on very flimsy grounds.",1243712090

There are alot of people who are students and alot of businesses and people looking at connecting for monetary purposes.<p>The thing is, when people who do not fit into those demographics sees that it is possible to make money and easily communicate,it drives interest, attention and people not longer within those 2 demographics to try and give it ago. Some may be successful in achieving what they want some may not.<p>As for the third demographic, lots of celebrities use twitter and i know people who actually just signup to follow and get the latest (semi truthful news as they put it) through twitter.

633995,comment,633946,633946,0,0,triplefox,,,"I'm going to speak in terms of techniques rather than tools. These are the best/fastest techniques I've found:<p>1. Procedural generation in your own code. People forget about this option because classical 2D games were too processing/memory-constrained to allow for anything but tiles loaded direct from ROM, but it's really great for environments. It works out to be very fast to produce because you can iterate and randomize and come up with a lot of variations without extra work, but you have to know what you're going for first. The download size savings is a bonus too.<p>2. Characters are cheapest to do with 3D only because of animation time. If you don't have a lot of anims, hand-drawn tends to give a more lively result, especially in low-res pixel art styles, but even then, painting over 3D will reduce your error rate. Invest in a Wacom if you want to get serious about drawing on computers, but start with the smallest size: you rarely need more.<p>3. When I need a clean cartoony look I drag out Inkscape and do a vector trace over the image I'm working with. This can take quite a while, but the results are really good when you go all-out and use two vectors per outline to give them variable width.",1243710148
