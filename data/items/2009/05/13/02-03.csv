606440,comment,605207,606281,0,0,derefr,,,"""Happiness"" is a vague emotion, like love, not an objective, short-term, measurable one, like calm, contentment, or excitation. However, all states of happiness usually share in common a factor of endorphin release.<p>Endorphins are basically one of two basic mechanisms for ""fitting"" data in the brain-as-neural-net, with the other being pain: pain is the reinforcement mechanism that trains your neurons to <i>not do that again</i>, while endorphins tell your brain to <i>do</i> please do that again. People are ""happy"" (have endorphins) when they're doing things that their body encourages them to do. To be happy is simply to be one with your body's material desires (though note that your brain is <i>part</i> of your body, and it has material desires of its own, for things like friendship.)",1242183543

Most other Google apps in their alpha stages can just take advantage of running on, basically, App Engine; this seems like one of the ones that can't, so it has to run on a separate architecture that hasn't been scaled yet. That would be alright for some <i>other</i> company's demo—if they were anyone else, they'd just use limited, cached, pre-defined data sets. But they're Google, they have the raw data, and they wanted to show off the possibilities of working ""from scratch"" on anything they like in realtime. Thus, it was similar to an app without any scaling consideration as-of-yet (consider a normal startup webapp) drinking from the entire search index firehose on each query.
