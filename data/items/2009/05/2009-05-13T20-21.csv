promote nutritionless sand as substrate to replace soil
use the expensive fert (surprise! they sell it too!) to enhance plant growth
use expensive 'full-spectrum' light
use heater to give vertical water movement
co2 tanks (you can make DIY using sucrose and yeast)<p>and of course without saying, spreading FUD to fuel collaborative manipulation<p>in the end, i end up just using soil, sun, no fert, no tech ... plants had lived for centuries on those with great success!<p>hey ... maybe i should go sell some ferts :D ... i still have bags of KNO3, H2PO4, MgSO4, FeSO4, ZnSO4, MnSO4, Na4EDTA lying around collecting dusts",1242248369

I agree with this.<p>Now, however, when we send information to the developers, it seems that Stallman has switched sides, and doesn't believe that that recipient or holder of the information should be free to do as they will with it.

Nothing can truly be trusted from whether there is any ""me"" to survive death all the way down to the accuracy of memory and the individual perceptions of my senses. Some more fundamental assumptions are more solid than others - such as the assumption that what I perceive through my senses reflects an objective reality that you also perceive through your senses. I only want to lock down a particular assumption in the context of solving a particular problem and only so far as empirical evidence supports. I want to mark down the appropriate set of assumptions (with perhaps a common base that is ""identity"") as known and solid then attempt to solve my problem and move on or revisit assumptions as required. So, my actions and values are in a constant state of doubt and while certain of my base beliefs seem very solid now - so did rejected beliefs of yesterday. This is my only core belief, that it is best to keep an empty mind, a mind free of preconceptions making minimal operational assumptions based only on empirical evidence (as time allows). I tend to think identification is overcompensation - people really NEED their religion to be correct because of the fear of the great unknown, death.",1242248177

At least in the Netherlands. (More info at <a href=""http://www.iusmentis.com/copyright/crashcourse/ownership/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iusmentis.com/copyright/crashcourse/ownership/</a> .) And yeah, that's pretty sick from an employee perspective, but great if you want to protect yourself as a company.  When I was employed, I actually read my contract, so I had a side-note added with exceptions.  If you're involved in any open source project, that's probably a smart thing to do.
