598395,comment,598079,598079,0,0,saikat,,,"I have had a chronic pain in my upper back right above my right shoulder blade, below my neck, and a little to the right of my spinal cord (the area is about two square inches in size).  I got this injury from (surprise surprise) a marathon coding session (40 hours straight) sitting in an uncomfortable chair without taking enough breaks, and it has been plaguing me for about six years now.  It used to be a very sharp shooting pain, but now the area is somewhat numb and mostly gives me sharp pains if I do certain awkward motions (like turning my head too rapidly), lifting heavy objects using that particular part of my back, or coding for long stretches of time.<p>I have tried just about everything from traditional back exercises to acupuncture to cure this, and up until recently, nothing really worked.  I finally went to some doctor in India who gave me a different type of exercise that made a lot of sense.  Normally, chiropractors will tell you to do things like rotate your head or stretch your neck by looking up and down for 10 seconds at a time - basically minor motions that put minimal stress on your back in the hopes that it will strengthen the back.  The doctor in India said my problem was not that my upper back muscles had grown weak from RSI, but that my particular injury had caused some muscles to start pressing down on a nerve there, which is why I have such a local pain and why that area has started going numb.  So, exercises putting more strain on that area were in fact worse for me.<p>To get to the point, the ""exercise"" works as follows:
1) Stand up straight and straighten up your neck.  
2) Gently press on your forehead with your two hands such that the force is pointing behind you.  While doing so, press forward with your head against your two hands so that your neck stays straight (very important that the neck stays straight the entire time).
3) Do this for 30 seconds (I started off with 10 seconds).
4) Repeat steps 1-3, but instead of pressing on your forehead, I press on the right side of your head, the left side of your head, and then the back of your head.  
5) Repeat steps 1-4 three times, and then do the whole thing 3-5 times a day.<p>This has helped tremendously in getting feeling back and reducing pain.  Apparently, this part of your back is usually under some minor stress from holding up your head (and this strain is increased when you hunch).  So, after my muscles started squeezing down on my nerve in whatever awkward way, this minor stress that is otherwise normal was pressing down on my nerve all the time, causing it to hurt.  This exercise will, five times a day, take the pressure off my back and into my hands and let the nerve have some time to slowly get back into place.<p>Also, I have started using a standing desk for at least some time a day and it has done wonders to keep me from hunching while working (which in turn has also made my back feel much better).",1241720324

598392,comment,598079,598079,0,0,rdouble,,,"I have 3 squashed discs in my lower back from a skateboarding injury. I've tried everything for back pain. Before I share what works for me, I'll say that if you don't have a structural injury you probably just have very weak ""core"" muscles and the best thing you can do is get into a general state of good fitness and then add in some core strengthening exercises.<p>After doing tons of PT, and trying everything from yoga to pilates to accupuncture to cyclobenzeprine, I figured out three main exercises that strengthen the muscles in the lower back:<p>- ""superman"": lay on your stomach on the floor. raise your left arm and right leg up at the same time. hold for a count of five. repeat on other side. do this 10 times for each side.<p>- ""planks"": this is like a pushup but you're on your elbows and instead of doing a pushup, you just hold in that position. It sounds easy but is very hard if you don't have strong abs. try to work up to 3-5 sets of 60 seconds at a time.<p>- ""bird dog"": like the superman but you're on your knees and 
hands, doggy style. raise left leg and right arm at the same time, hold for count of 5. alternate. do 10.<p>Those three things, and being generally in shape have helped my back more than anything else I've tried. You can find videos of them on youtube if you google those exercise names with ""core fitness"" or similar search strings added in.<p>Other lifestyle changes are good, too. Don't sit down in a pile for 8 hours at a time. Get up and move around, even if you're just getting out of your chair at least once an hour. Change your position. Sit on an exercise ball for a while, lie down on a couch with a laptop for a while, work standing up for a while. Go for a walk at least an hour a day.<p>I've found that pilates is much better for back care than yoga. many of the yoga moves are not good for your back if you have slipped discs. in particular, ""downward dog"" which is the staple move of most yogas is not good if you actually have a back injury like mine. Pilates arose out of rehab so most of the moves are safer for your back. I mention these activities because one of the side effects of back problems (or sometimes the cause of back problems) is very tight hamstrings. You'll need to do some sort of stretching to get the hamstrings back in order and I've found this easier to do in a structured, class context.<p>I'll be semi controversial and say that you want to have strong abs, but you DON'T want to do situps. do planks instead. Situps strengthen your abs while pulling your back into the same position that makes it hurt. planks strengthen your abs but you're also extended and working all your stabilization muscles at the same time.",1241720169
