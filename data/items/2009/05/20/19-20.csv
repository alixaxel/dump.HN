619201,comment,618906,618906,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Just talk. Talk about anything and don't let your feelings get involved. Some of the best advice I ever heard was that shyness was just self-centeredness getting in the way. Focus on the other person and how they are responding to you. If you get ""real"" responses, keep talking. If you get ""yeah,"" ""nope,"" or apparent disinterest then disengage from the conversation.<p>Don't think about trying to get a ""connection"" with the person, it's just conversation, not an interview.<p>The important thing to remember is there is no reason to be embarrassed: this person has nothing against you, she just doesn't feel like talking to you. Maybe she would at some other time, maybe never. Either way, It's Not A Big Deal, just talk to the next girl you meet instead. After a while it gets easier and you don't even think about it.",1242849565

Not trying to be harsh, but this is known as guaranteeing the failure of your business. Most businesses fail. That means most businesses will never be able to ""afford it"". Ergo, you will never realize a vast majority of your potential revenue.<p>Further, your suppliers won't be as charitable as you are with your clients. You'll be paying bills to support clients that aren't giving you any money. You won't have income. You'll have increasing expenses. You'll have a disincentive to actually trying to growing your business. Disaster all around.<p>The goal of business is to make more money than you expend. If you want to be nice, found a charity - even then you'll need to brake even one way or another.<p>An overall better option would be to do as my linked examples have, and provide less of a product for less of a price. Most startups simply have no need for Accenture style services hence, they can purchase something that better fits their needs.<p>Do yourself a favour though and drop this ""pay me when you can"" idea forever.

Speculative derivative contracts are like heroin in the sense of being socially destructive but they aren't like heroin, cigarettes or cocaine in the sense that they can be traded on street corners if they are not sold in corner stores.<p>Derivative markets depend on the legality of the contracts which are written, indeed they depend on large, public entities guaranteeing them. Consider: it is no longer legal to take out a large life insurance policy on someone you have no other relationship with - the murders got to be a bit annoying. There is no noticeable black market in such insurance policies either. Yet insurance for those who can show a need for it is still legal and available.<p>Regulating speculative derivatives would have relatively simple mechanics. However, it would also require that this society adopt a different regulatory paradigm than the present belief that Casino-like-speculation benefits the economy and society as a whole. This dovetails into the things Paul Krugman said recently.",1242847168

If you don't do that you're inflicting mental overhead on the developers to support the project manager's waffling.  Depending on the nature of the topic and how modular and well-factored the code is, it may be more or less of a chore to maintain multiple branches, but unless both you're going to release both versions of the software, I say merge the branch ASAP and save yourself the trouble.",1242847012
