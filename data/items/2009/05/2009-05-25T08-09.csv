625198,comment,625034,625034,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I've worked as an ER/Critical Care nurse for 15 years, and this author is correct in saying that health care costs in this country are particularly opaque.  I have absolutely no idea how much the stuff I do costs.  That can be a good thing as well as a bad thing.  I'm not tempted to ration care at all because someone doesn't have insurance.  So, if you get sick, we take care of you regardless of ability to pay.  We have to, it's the law.<p>But, the other part of the problem, is that people without insurance often come to the ER when they are ill, because they haven't established a relationship with a doctor or clinic.  So, when they get sick, they go to the ER and purchase the most expensive care possible for their earache or sore throat.<p>Think about it, in the ER, we are trained and prepared to save lives in a heart attack, keep you alive long enough to have an operation if you get shot in the chest, or administer antidotes in case you get bitten by a rattle snake.  We have all that equipment lying around just in case, and we're trained to use it.  But, many of our patients have ear infections, runny noses, back aches and sore throats.  Not exactly cost effective care.<p>A big reason for the lack of transparency in hospitl billing is that there are different tiers of payment depending on insurance.  The hospital negotiates different rates with different categories of insurers.<p>Out of network private insurance pays full 
price or at times refuses to pay full price.  In-network private insurance generally negotiates a 70-80% rate.  Medicare and state public insurance generally pays a 15-50% rate.  Non-Insured patients get billed at the full rate, but generally only 20-30% of those people fully pay their bills.  So, many hospitals will give you a discount if you pay cash within a month 
or two of your visit.<p>Also, doctors aren't able to bill by the time they spend with you.  Because of Medicare, the whole industry pays per diagnosis.  So, if you get diagnosed with a pneumonia, Medicare pays a flat rate no matter how long you stay in the hospital, either 1 day or 10.<p>Finally, most hospitals, if they are making money at all, are operating on a 1-2% profit margin.  It doesn't take much for them to go under, and they often need and get subsidized from the state or federal level.<p>15 years ago, I was very Conservative politically, thinking that market forces would sort it all out.  But, the longer I work in health care, the more I think that we should just go to a single party payer system.  I actually think that it would actually <i>eliminate</i> a lot of bureaucracy and cut a lot of costs.  It'd be a hard sell in this country, though.",1243241360

For all the histronics about how bad the health care system is in the US, I've found the care is quite good if you do some research and are willing to pay for it. My policy is about $250 per month, covers all emergency and severe horrible things, I can visit my doctor within a few days of scheduling, I can get a metabolic panel and have the results emailed to me for $10, etc.",1243241137

It just gives you a few more bits to play with.<p>There's always been a sort of divide between people who prefer to only make the models in the instructions, and those who get creative and make whatever they like. It's a skill that needs developing. I'm sure Lego could do more to prompt kids to do that, maybe with generic sets that just have ideas and no instructions - ""Build a crane"", etc then ask the kid to photograph and upload it for a possible prize.<p>You can still buy specific general technics sets, they're part of the 'education' range, but afaik anyone can buy them.<p><a href=""http://www.legoeducation.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=1277&bhcp=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legoeducation.com/store/detail.aspx?ID=1277&b...</a><p>Similarly you can buy a pack of about 30 minifigures which is fun, and part of the same range.<p><a href=""http://www.legoeducation.com/store/detail.aspx?CategoryID=155&by=9&ID=420&c=1&t=0&l=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.legoeducation.com/store/detail.aspx?CategoryID=15...</a><p>Also go into a LEGO store, and you can get a tub, and fill it up with whatever bits they have in the wall that week.<p>Lego is still one of the best toys for developing creativity, mathematics, etc.<p>BTW, If you missed it last time, <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5022769/exclusive-inside-the-lego-factory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5022769/exclusive-inside-the-lego-factory</a>",1243241058

In effect you are breeding a class society based on money.<p>Adam Smith (""invisible hand of the market"") was quite aware of the Darwinian nature of business people, who will try any angle to ""conspire against the public"". The free market is effective, yet must kept under control by the law. Certain labour standards are part of that equation.",1243240973

Any trip to the Emergency Room or stay in the hospital is going to run into the thousands, and easily into the tens of thousands of dollars.  The regular non-emergent basic stuff can and should be taken care of at an Urgent Care or at your primary care physician's office.  Those visits are usually less than a couple hundred bucks.  And, those can be managed by paying cash.<p>If you're interested in buying supplemental Health Insurance, may I suggest reading Consumer Reports section on Health Insurance:  <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/health/insurance/health-insurance.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consumerreports.org/health/insurance/health-insur...</a><p>They're a non-profit consumer advocacy company, and my $25 yearly subscription to their website pays for itself every single year.

625188,comment,624683,625110,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"In my view, there are some aspects that go beyond the traditional ideological boundaries in this debate. Regardless of what minimum wages do to unemployment, there's also the question of what they do to innovation.<p>If a business has a large supply of cheap labour, what is the incentive to use technology to reduce dumb work? There's undoubtedly less incentive and therefore I think a case could be made for high minimum wages in order to foster innovation.<p>At the end of the day, I believe that high tech societies have less unemployment, and apart from that reducing dumb work is what I consider progress for humanity.<p>On the other hand, high minimum wages are a disincentive for some people who do dumb work to learn something and become innovative themselves. So this is a counter argument to some degree. However, there are a lot of people who will never become educated or innovative or entrepreneural and pushing them into abject poverty violates my sense of human dignity.<p>Human dignity is the answer to your question of why not $50 minimum wage. It's subjective, I agree, but people living in a card board box violates my sense of human dignity as does watching people die from treatable diseases. Not being able to buy each new edition of the iPhone does not violate my sense of human dignity, nor does living in a run down neighbourhood.<p>One question that opponents of minimum wages never answer is what about the next generation? You can take the position that people who do nothing to help themselves deserve to live in poverty. But poverty is passed on to the next generation. Some admirable individuals are able to break that viscious cycle but most are not. It's very difficult to help the kids of poor people gain access to equal opportunities without to some degree helping their parents.<p>I'm afraid there's no way around spreading the wealth around a bit to people who may not deserve it if you want equal opportunities for the next generation.",1243240574

625184,comment,625168,625168,0,0,mahmud,,,"The article is hardly about ""bending a language to your will"", and more about ""why doesn't the sole vendor of my language implement features suggested by the greatest living language designer"".<p>Alright, now that we have paid lip service to GLS, let's ask a question:<p>The author speaks of the lack of operator overloading in java, and my question is: why not use a language that allows you to add your own operators, better yet, one with <i>no</i> concept of officially sanctioned operators? Remember, operators are just functions with syntatic-sugar (i.e. they're usually allowed to be infix instead of prefix.) why not work with a rich, expressive language that treats your ""extensions"" as first-class citizens?<p>It seems like the gripes of mainstream programmers about their tools boil down to two things: 1) lack of vendor responsiveness in implementing much needed features (which varies from one programmer to another, whence the lack of vendor response ;-) and 2) demand for solutions to augment, or make-palatable, a brain-dead design.<p>Don't worry about making the language ""succeed"" or ""win"" against the competition. If you're struggling with your tools, don't hesitate to look for better options.<p>Your tools should be so efficient that you no longer think of them consciously, much less inspire a long gripe in prose.",1243239584
