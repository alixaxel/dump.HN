623073,comment,619110,619705,0,0,njharman,,,"> Affirmative action for the unintelligent is unlikely to lead to wonderful economic success on any scale.<p>Yeah, so? ""Affirmative action"" (I call it society's obligation to care for the unfortunate) for blind, crippled, veterans, mentally retarded, etc is also unlikely to lead to an economic success.<p>Why don't we just round up all the ""burdens"" on smart, successful, beautiful people and kill them.  They're limiting society's economic success!  And as we all know money is the most important consideration in any decision.",1243047349
623072,comment,622858,622958,0,0,wheels,,,"I think the ""paying the bills"" thing is pretty normal, at least within a certain class of folks.  And it's something you can learn to work with.<p>I have <i>all</i> of my bills auto-paid.  I've learned from experience -- having the power cut off, the phone cut off, the internet cut off -- that it just works better that way.  I've never had a shortage of cash, but sometimes even opening the envelope with the bill inside seems oddly intimidating.<p>But again, you can work with that.  Now everything is auto-paid; I don't even bother to open the bills.  Nothing gets cut off anymore.  I still get the odd annoying thing to deal with, and I've tried to get in the habbit of when there's something that I catch myself ignoring to open it immediately.  I've also become a huge user of to-do tracking and set deadlines for myself -- having my daily checklist with past due things staring back at me in red works wonders.  Everything goes in there.  Mails to family, mails I need to respond to for business stuff (I have a hot key that creates a to-do list with a 24 hour deadline to answering a mail), stuff that needs to get done for a next release.  It helps immensely.<p>These patterns are far too normal, especially among gifted folk for me to be willing to call them an <i>illness</i> and my feeling is that medicating people for these things represses some of the responsibility to build coping mechanisms that people have traditionally used to deal with this sort of thing since time immemorial.  They also change your personality.  If I weren't so restless when doing stuff I find boring, maybe I wouldn't have done as many interesting things?  Maybe I'd still be working in a standard 9-to-5?<p>Surely there were smart people that had to overcome difficulty focusing before the intervention of amphetamines.",1243047345

623054,comment,622643,622643,0,0,mellis,,,"As one of the creators of Arduino (and currently its lead software developer), I'm happy to see such a lively discussion of the platform.  I'd also love to hear any suggestions you might have for improving it.<p>I should note that we've done very little promotion ourselves, apart from teaching lots of people to use it in various workshops.  Of course, we're happy that Make is such a fan.<p>One interesting feature of the platform that hasn't been mentioned here is the fact that the whole thing (hardware and software) is open-source.  We've had lots of people take the Eagle (CAD) files and design their own custom variants, which creates a vibrant ecosystem.<p>Finally, if anyone wants to get involved and help make Arduino better, check out our developer pages at: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/arduino/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/arduino/</a>",1243045652

I'd say the PIC 16F84 and a Picstart programmer are more like the Altair than the Arduino is.<p>I do agree, though, that having entry-level boards that are easy to use is a huge step up for the large class of people you mention.",1243045120

It expands their minds and shows them possibilities and understanding not seen when one just views a piece of hardware as some mysterious entity.<p>As for what the Arduino can do for this end, it requires a community of dedicated and enthusiastic users as well as hardware and a (software) programmer. A group of people with a diverse set of interests, experiences and educations (artists to engineers and everything in between), the aim of ease-of-use, learning and understanding is required for this kind of excitement and interest.<p>There was a similar group for PCs but I found my community with the Apple IIe and LOGO for that was what the local user groups were using and what my middle school teacher taught me. Now, the ""local"" user group is the entire internet. Had I gone to a different school maybe there would have been an assembly community.",1243044159
