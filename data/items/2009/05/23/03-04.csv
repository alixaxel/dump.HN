623116,comment,622618,622765,0,0,shiro,,,"That's exactly what I meant in ""In CL ... (b) using packages greatly reduces accidental shadowing.""  So I'm not sure what you are asking to be convinced.   CL certainly does not prevent you from messing with package-private symbols, but usually a convention is enough to avoid disaster.  I mean, I won't write (let ((your-package::private-symbol list)) (your-macro ...) ...) unless there's absolute need to do, such as emergency workaround of a bug in a third-party library.<p>On the other hand, one of the reasons Scheme avoids explicit module prefix is, I think, that it breaks abstraction.   Suppose my-module defines my-macro and my-function.  My-macro expands into a call to my-function.   But I don't really want my module users to call my-function directly, so I only export my-macro and keep my-function private.<p>In your proposal, my-macro will expands into prefixed-symbol like this:<p><pre><code>    (define-macro (my-macro arg)   `(my-module.my-function ,arg))\n</code></pre>\nBut... if we allow module-private function to be called with module prefix, we can't prevent ordinary code from calling my-function as well.<p>This is a language design choice.   Some may not mind others to mess with module-private bindings; CLers certainly would not.   But <i>if</i> you want to hide module-private symbols, <i>and</i> want to allow macros expand into them, how will you do that?   One idea is to mark the output of macro expansion so that the compiler can distinguish whether the reference is from legitimate macro expansion or not... well, that's what hygienic macro is doing.",1243050674

Major TV stations have industry analysts covering their industries. I suspect that any more drilling down would result in journalists not having enough 'good' stories to be economical for them. Journalism works for the journalists because they can gravitate towards the stories wherever they are happening.

Despite what people think of him now Richard Nixon was a tremendously popular President (the electoral vote count in '72 was 570 to 17) so most were not asking for him to be exposed.  But Journalists did and it was exactly what they should have been doing.<p>The problem with Journalism now is it's been corrupted.  Now we have Liberal MSNBC and Conservative Fox News and they both are just spin machines for their side's agenda.  That's where tech comes in because people simply don't trust Journalists anymore so they are looking more and more to other sources.<p>As for saving journalism I don't think true journalism needs it.  My favorite modern example of true journalism is Bob Woodward's book ""Plan of Attack"".  During the 2004 election it was recommeneded by both the Bush and Kerry camps and it was a best seller because of it.<p>Because truth appeals to everyone.",1243049976

You can almost think of it as an extremely clever query-replace functionality in your text editor that always happens before you compile or run your program.<p>This is why so many Lispers claim that Lisp is at the top of the heap when it comes to language power.  If you can arbitrarily expand your code into some other form at compile time, you can pretty much do anything any other language can do.  A canonical example of this is that the object system added to Common Lisp is just a bunch of macros.  Name your programming paradigm, and there's a very good chance someone has implemented it in Lisp, with macros.<p>What you describe sounds more complex than Lisp macros, which brings us to the necessity of all the parentheses.  The idea of macros only works well when the language is built up out of a data-structure supported by the language.  In Lisp, of course, programs are lists and macros let you do anything to your program that you can do to a list.  When people try to add ""macros"" to languages where the code is not a data structure, there usually needs to be some intermediate representation of the parse tree, and then things tend to start getting ugly as the relation to what the source code would look like is quickly lost.<p>Having said all that, I'm curious if anyone that knows both Smalltalk and Lisp can name concrete examples of programming in Smalltalk and finding something you were unable to do without macros.",1243049441
623094,comment,619110,621295,0,0,joetrumpet,,,"Those small grocery stores aren't the same as a supermarket, and the supermarkets listed aren't really in Trenton. For some reason some of them are listed as such, but if you look at the map they're a bit off elsewhere. We don't consider that part of Trenton--one of those is in Hamilton, for example. Trenton's last supermarket closed back awhile ago and it's an obstruction to food access often-mentioned by non-profits in the area.<p>I'm not sure about rent. In states south from NJ those rents are high for suburban areas, for housing in much worse shape (chipping lead paint, etc). You're right in terms of staying within New Jersey--those are low in a state with very expensive housing (and everything else), but considering both health and the pay people get in the poor areas receive I'm not sure if it's a fair comparison. In my own experience, the suburban poor do seem to be better off than the urban poor (and I think it all trumps rural poverty)--and I love cities, so I really wish that weren't the case.",1243049418
