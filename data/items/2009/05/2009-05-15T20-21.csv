I think some people take comfort in the notion that they are not ultimately responsible for whether the machines work or not. Sorry if that sounds terribly arrogant.</i><p>A specific instance of a much more general principle. Responsibility and understanding are hard, and passing around the problem as a black-box for someone else to solve is far simpler.<p>The arrogance isn't yours; it is with the people who feel entitled to someone who will take their black-boxes and return a solution, and otherwise assure they are never responsible for understanding anything.

Interestingly (and happily) 80% of businesses that monitor employees (and 75% of 'em do, supposedly) actually do it in the open.  So I think what businesses wanted was a cheaper/lighter version that was entirely manager focused and didn't offer quite as many employee controls.  It's a good alternative to stuff like Spectorsoft (<shiver>).<p>The absolutely <i>awesome</i> part of this is by offering the more restricted version, we've seen a notable increase in the open version (which is the one we really believe in).<p>So far, we're guardedly optimistic that this is a net positive for us and for the world...

What if you've already learned the technology contained in the tool, and you're ready to stop worrying about it? Maybe letting the wizard do the work isn't a loss of knowledge but simply a form of storage: the tool as convenient information repository.""<p>Right, and this is what a lot of code generation tools do. After understanding the problem, you write a tool which can write code to solve that problem in a more general sense.<p>Almost all the software we write can be thought of that way; they are information repositories for problems we already solved.<p>However, with a lot of things that require deep understanding, there are walls. These represent the places where a person can no longer fake understanding, and either have to stop immediately and develop some or give up. Before the days of wizards, users would encounter plenty of warning signs that their understanding was not enough well before hitting the wall. Example: your 100 line C program is segmentation faulting; time to better understand about pointers and memory allocation before you write a 20k line program depending on the same.<p>The problem is that wizards are very undiscriminating on who experiences the easing. The output is mostly the same for the experienced engineer as for the non-engineer. The brick wall for the non-engineer still remains, however warnings of danger ahead are hidden being a easy-to-use interface. There is no encouragement for them to go understand better before progressing, and instead they rush straight on into the wall. The still need all the understanding once they get there, but the encouragement to develop it comes later, and so the rate at which it needs to be learned comes faster.<p>The question this poses is really difficult: how do we abstract away the need to apply knowledge to the same problem repeatedly, yet avoid abstracting away the need to have that knowledge?<p>Otherwise, very worthwhile article. She captures the spirit of curiosity that drives the need for deep understanding in me, and probably most people here.",1242420764

However, using the term RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate) from your link I found far more interesting stuff.<p>The short version: yes crash dieting can lower your metabolic rate, but the effect is small, and not permanent.<p>It can be a difference of 10% of your RMR which is 60-75% of your total calories burned per day. Therefore crash dieting can cause you to burn 6-8% less calories. So that's roughly 1 lb of fat less lost (or more gained) per month.",1242420736

The quality gap was relatively easy to overcome.  The American electronics manufacturers were not very innovative.  When Sony came out with transistor pocket radios, American radios were still table top vacuum tube boxes.  When the Japanese captured the TV market with integrated circuits, Zenith was advertising the benefits of hand soldered components.  Ampex invented the VCR, but couldnt produce the recording heads needed for the home. The Japanese got their reputation by concentrating in quality on a few key industries.  By 1984 HP was refusing American made memory chips, because they were so inferior.  That triggered a restructuring of industry that powered the economy for the next 20 years.<p>Interestingly enough, the Japanese had a similar structure to the Chinese with large companies and lots of subcontractors.

It takes time, China started to really develop in the mid 90s, so it has only been 15 years or so. It takes time to develop environmental, health, workers compensation and IP regulations.<p>Even once you have the regulations in place, it takes years to make the business community aware and respectful of them. Many (if not most) of the factory bosses are former peasants or lower class people who have little to no education. They are just trying to build a small company. That does not excuse the gross abuses of power, but it does explain them.<p>There needs to be a certain ""societal"" education on these issues, it took a hundred years in the west, and the environmental (sustainability) mouvement, started in the 1950s is only mainstream since 2006ish.

This has absolutely nothing to do with modern religion - which is so often little more than the most angry book club ever.
