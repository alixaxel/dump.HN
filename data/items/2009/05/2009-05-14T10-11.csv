This is like saying I will pull out the identity of the person who browsed through my blog and left a comment. It is definitely possibly to do it over a period of repeated visits. And assuming I spend all that time to dig out information.<p>So, instead I am positively noting that you cannot assume it is anonymous and think of ways I would benefit from it whether identified at an aggregate level or an approximation or even uniquely.<p>The author listed few examples which he words as 'exploits' the non-anonymity and I mentioned few more but rather positively. It might be a very fascinating view of the web if we can start browsing it from a world map, don't you think so ?",1242298601

608523,comment,608466,608466,0,0,philh,,,"The eee PC and Aspire One, which I believe are two of the best-selling netbooks, both have horrible distros. I gather netbooks were targeted for doing internet and office, so the disros are optimised for doing that and nothing else. If it turns out most people want to do more with their netbook (which the hardware is certainly capable of), it's no surprise that they would avoid linux when linux makes it difficult for them to do what they want.<p>Does any netbook ship with a non-crippled linux distro? I'd like to see sales figures for that, especially compared to a windows version on the same hardware.",1242298119

608515,comment,608431,608467,0,0,boundlessdreamz,,,"Yeah, If you are being bogged down by legacy code and increasingly falling behind competitors due to slow innovation, it makes sense to do a rewrite. Mozilla had nothing to lose by a rewrite and everything to gain. In the short term they suffered immensely falling behind even more but in the long term it helped them emerge stronger.<p>It is the same with Classic Mac -> OSX. The former was crumbling under its own weight but OSX enabled Apple to out innovate others.<p>The key point is that a rewrite should always produce something better and leaner.

608510,comment,607487,607487,0,0,rdl,,,"I've been in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003.<p>There are a lot of issues with the way aid is distributed.  The most successful parts of both places, the wireless networks and decentralized power systems, have been totally market driven, and actually hindered more by centralized efforts and regulation than helped.<p>Somalia, where it is too dangerous and chaotic for aid agencies or telco regulators to operate, has cheaper Internet access and mobile calling than almost anywhere else in Africa or the developing world!<p>Communications infrastructure (roads, signals/fiber/wireless, electrical grid) is one of the few areas where scale can be helpful.  In Afghanistan there is a lot of money coming through the military to pay for a road network (with benefits to both the foreign militaries and the local economy; dual use technology at its best).  Communications is basically wireless backed by satcom, with some microwave backbone and upcoming fiber, with microwave/fiber driven by military and government customers paying top dollar, then going out to connect up the cell systems.  For $20/mo you can buy 3G service.<p>One of the biggest issues in Afghanistan is that aside from the US Military, the other US funding agencies (primary US AID) have to operate through local contractors, and a rather inefficient process which leads to overpaying for everything, and thus not accomplishing enough concentrated change to be successful.  The ""Provincial Reconstruction Teams"" are afraid to go out except with a huge military presence, and are pretty sheltered from everything, whereas I was riding around in an old pickup truck with a 9mm and no problems.<p>Irrigation systems are probably the next thing to do after roads (the military has roads under control); these can be done for $5-12k each by local labor, and 20-30 systems per district, all in parallel -- or, you can pay $500k via US AID and get 1-2 systems done after 2 years.  The US AID requirement to use local contractors is ""trickle down economics"" -- basically the hope is that paying an Afghan with political connections $500k to do work will lead to $500k staying in the local economy, paid in wages to other Afghan laborers, etc.  It turns out it turns into the connected Afghan spending the same $5-10k to get the project done, and then buying $490k in real estate in Dubai or Canada.<p>Government and government contracting is the opposite of the startup world in every way.  Very few people seem to have done both.",1242297180

Nobody said anything about magic.<p>The point is how can you ever verify that two beings react exactly the same to all stimuli?  How are you determining ""no measurable difference""?

608506,comment,608202,608433,0,0,noss,,,"A sales tax break for goods originating from US is, in all ways, a trade barrier. You can expect global mutual treatment. That means decreased foreign demand for US products.<p>So you end up sponsoring US companies that were not capable to compete with more efficient foreign companies. Which is in itself a more interesting problem. Most European countries have as high, or higher, standard in working conditions (and TAXES!) and they do have positive trade balance.<p>Does it really seem like a wise decision to make US produced products less attractive on the global market, for the hope that tax cuts on domestic products will match up, and then some, with increased income tax from the new jobs?<p>An alternative is to instead use taxes to set up better public transport, so the time-and-cost-to-get-to-work radius around companies increase. Making it both easier to find the right competence (larger area, more people to chose from) and making more real estate close (time-wise) to the city, making the cost of living lower.",1242296668
