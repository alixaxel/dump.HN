I'd expect that to be in both networks: in ""black"" as a synonym for ""coal"" or ""cinder"", and in ""white"" as a form of ""ashen"", ""pale"", etc.<p>More widely, why must there be K non-overlapping networks that cover the entire language? Naively, I'd expect an unbounded number of non-overlapping small networks. But the two ideas of ""Basic English"" and of specialized vocabularies lead me to posit that every ""significant"" network (a network with a N number of members, where N > 5,000) overlaps with at least 1 other ""significant"" network. As a result, I would suspect that it would be difficult or impossible to find K non-overlapping sets that partition the entire language (where K is less than... oh, let's say 100).",1243219496

Copy pasted from wikipedia:
    * Centralized Backup - Allows backup of up to 10 PCs,[7] using Single Instance Store technology to avoid multiple copies of the same file, even if that file exists on multiple PCs.[8]
    * Health Monitoring - Can centrally track the health of all PCs on the network, including antivirus and firewall status.[8]
    * File Sharing - Offers network shares for computers to store the files remotely, acting as a network-attached storage device. Separate categories are provided for common file types like Documents, Music, Pictures and Videos.[8] The files are indexed for fast searching.[9]
    * Printer Sharing - Allows a centralized print server to handle print jobs for all users.[8]
    * Shadow Copy - Takes advantage of Volume Shadow Copy Services to take point in time snapshots that allow older versions of files to be recovered.[10] However, after introduction Microsoft has recommended not enabling shadow copies on HomeServer for unspecified reasons, and had not fixed the problem by September 2008.[11] A web search in May 2009 did not locate a fix.
    * Headless Operation - No monitor or keyboard is required to manage the device.[8] Remote administration is performed by using the Windows Home Server Console client software provided in the bundle. Also supports Remote Desktop[12] connections to the server while connected to the same LAN.[13]
    * Remote Access Gateway - Allows remote access to any connected PC on the network over the Internet.[13]
    * Media Streaming - Can stream media to an Xbox 360 or other devices supporting Windows Media Connect.[8]
    * Selective Data redundancy - Guards against a single drive failure by duplicating selected data across multiple drives.[8]
    * Expandable Storage - Provides a unified single and easily expandable storage space, removing the need for drive letters.[8]
    * Extensibility through Add-Ins - Add-Ins allow third-party developers to extend the features and functionality of the server. Add-Ins can be developed using the Windows Home Server SDK, to provide additional services to the client computers or work with the data already on the server. Add-Ins can also be ASP.NET applications, hosted in IIS 6 running on WHS.[9]
    * Server Backup - Backs up files which are stored within shared folders on the server to an external hard drive.",1243219035

While that explains why IBM contacted Bill first for no apparent reason, the story says that Bill did the right thing and redirected them to Kildall. Kildall had a fair shot at the deal, but passed it up.<p>Again, contingent on the story being effectively true, there is no way Kildall was going to get that deal, family relationship on Bill's part or no family relationship. He saw it more as a distraction than an opportunity.<p>(It's a pity he became bitter because it sounds like he already had ""fuck you"" money; <i>I</i> certainly don't have a yacht or personal airplane or any of the several other things he had.

624937,comment,619511,624728,0,0,netsp,,,"Thanks for jumping in. Welcome.<p>I hope I haven't come across as critical at your expense. I was very intrigued by your project and I read the site more or less cover to cover. The house is very beautiful. I also agree with much of what you say (and the things you didn't say) about zoning restrictions being used in a way which is harmful. I do not think there is sound economic reasoning compelling governments to artificially inflate housing prices. I think if anything, the opposite is true.<p>Regarding the discussion here: Most of what I was saying doesn't necessarily apply directly to you but vaguely to that part of the ""sustainability movement"" that I don't have a name for. That is people who have a certain aesthetic (for lack of a better word) preference for home grown foods, locally produced goods, traditional practices and such. A lot of it seems to be reactionary to industrialisation.<p>Ecological arguments (with climate change being the contemporary variety) become a vehicle for making this preference part of something bigger. Often  the arguments themselves are very silly. 'Food miles', are a perfect example. That is, the ecological effect is zero, harmful or negligible relative to the level of advocacy. At other times they are not silly in this way. That is, the proposed action or lifestyle may be actually ecologically beneficial. I'd like to note that I am inclined to think this project falls into this latter category. However, I am also inclined to think that it is not a scalable solution and is therefore unlikely to be part of a wide solution to the ecological problems it averts. Regardless, the logic is still backwards.<p>The ecological arguments are not the starting point with houses such as these the logical solution. I think that if  mass produced housing or increased scale agriculture turned out to be solutions to the same ecological problems, they would not have the same advocates. The house (or a hobby farm or local produce), is a preconceived end  searching for a grand Raison d'Etre. This sort of flawed logic opens doors for the type of illogic you can see in food miles. More harmfully, it opens the doors to bad government decisions or outright exploitation such as the (now dead, I hope) US plan for ethonol production.<p>The other reason this rubs me the wrong way is precisely because it is beautiful. Just like garden markets & hobby farms, I like this house. I would be very proud of it if it were mine. I am frustrated that those that share my preference feel they need more of a justification then this.<p>In any case, the overwhelming response here is positive. Even the criticism is not really a criticism of you or the project, but of a general phenomenon.<p>I may be near Wales in about a year. If I am, I think I'll be tempted to drive by for a peak.",1243218580

In each of those cases, the ""buyer"" doesn't understand the rules of the game, and misjudges his odds of payoff, and what that payoff might be.<p>In my opinion, when it comes to the app store, the root of the problem is that people are grossly overestimating the number of dollars that are up for grabs, and because people are ashamed to admit their app isn't selling well, and because Apple only publishes vague numbers, no one has a really good way of determining how much money IS out there.
