Cappuccino Rocks Da House!!! :-)"" is closer to ""leet speak, fanboi terms, and first post claims"" in general than it is to contributing to the discussion.<p>Why is being told that your post is not contributing considered ""punishment""?  There's only a single axis for people to express their vote on, and thus that's the only effective way to communicate that someone thinks something isn't contributing.  Downvoting is not a personal attack (shouldn't be used as such and shouldn't be interpreted as such), but the belief is that it sufficiently sends a message that such content isn't wanted, for whatever reason (the fact that no reason is supplied is a deficiency in the system itself, having only one axis, not in the use of down votes).",1242853179
619312,comment,619121,619121,0,0,gameguy,,,"Very cool, though I don't like the misuse of technical terms just to sound more important.  It's not actually fully 5-dimensional... each 'dimension' has only 2 or 3 states.  The first 2 dimensions are limited by the size of your media.  The third dimension is based on your laser focal plane resolution (think 'depth perception' in a way) and is currently limited to two layers in optical discs.  The there's the color (in this example, 3 colors) and polarization (here, 2 orientations).  So it's 12 times more dense than current mainstream technology, with the added benefit of a tighter placement of data on in the plane.<p>The disruptive technology here is really the use of nanoparticle gold instead of etched polystyrene, and the fact that there is the polarization element.  Unfortunately these points are kind of glossed over and lost in the fancy media mumbo-jumbo.",1242853114

People who think that the poor are lazy and shiftless are scum.<p>Some of the poor maybe be lazy and shiftless, but having middle class / wealthy parents doesn't just give you money and education and health -- it also gives you the very habits and abilities (saving, studying, deferring rewards, working hard, etc) that keep people from being poor or staying poor.  Even things like applying to college are different if you have parents who can help guide you through the process -- I read a heartrending account of a (poor) child who got a scholarship to go to a private high school but his parents couldn't afford the transportation and he didn't have the institutional knowledge to know that if they'd told the school that, the school would have helped.  So he declined a great education for the lack of $400.<p>Growing up middle or upper class also gives you all the social markers people look for -- whether it's straight, clean teeth, the ability (and skill) to dress appropriately for a variety of social situations, the proper manners to eat in a range of restaurants from a greasy spoon to a 3 star Michelin, a good suit to go to interviews, acne medication so you don't have acne scars, the ability to make small conversation about art, etc.  If you read the literature, most Americans drastically overestimate the social mobility of America and are shocked when they hear how very heritable wealth is.",1242852940

619293,comment,618594,618656,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Seriously? You wouldn't even pay, say, $0.99 to <i>rent</i> a book? I pay more than that, in time and gasoline, every time I check a book out from the library.<p>Just driving to the library or the post office, spending 10 minutes, then driving back is a 30-minute commitment for me. If my time is worth $20 per hour, that's $10 right there, not counting the cost of gas or the odds that the book I want isn't available. Unless I'm very diligent about checking out books in large batches (and how many books can I really read before my three weeks is up and they become due at the library?) I might be saving money with a Kindle [1], even if each book self-destructed, Mission-Impossible style, three months after I paid $10 for it. Which they don't.<p>I am an old-school book collector; it runs in my family. And, yet, when I look at my shelves I dream of actually owning fewer of them. The world has changed. Amazon and Abebooks exist now. By this point, very few of my books are sufficiently precious and sufficiently likely to go out of print that I need to physically hoard them myself -- such books do exist, but they're much fewer in number, perhaps no more than a single bookshelf's worth.<p>Yeah, I guess the apocalypse could wipe out Amazon and Abebooks, or the copyright Gestapo could create some kind of digital Fahrenheit 451. But, really, what are the odds? To worry too much about that is like hoarding beer because Prohibition might come back. I'm literally more worried about my house burning down.<p>I'll worry when we reach the point that important books are routinely published in electronic form <i>alone</i>, with no paper copies <i>anywhere</i>. But I don't think that will ever happen. Indeed, the preservation of archival versions might become an even more significant <i>raison d'etre</i> for paper publishers -- we really need <i>more</i> archives, and more librarians and editors, to select, print out, and preserve all the great blog posts and HN comments that will otherwise be lost to linkrot, or buried in spam and rendered unfindable, within my lifetime.<p>I still love libraries. Shelves of books make me happy. But that thrill is not what it once was. Because it was the exciting feeling of knowing that you were surrounded by the work of centuries of scholars, that the world's knowledge was within reach. And that's true all the time now. I live in a library 24/7. I have to take special measures, like hiking out of cellular range, to <i>escape</i> that feeling of being surrounded by knowledge. I could sit here in this chair for the rest of my life and never run out of interesting things to read, watch, or listen to, so long as someone keeps paying the Comcast bill.<p>---<p>[1] Ignoring the cost of buying the Kindle in the first place, of course.",1242852645

Because they can see everything at once, and they know they won't realize halfway through their project that they are doing something wrong.  People hate learning, and making sure there's nothing to learn will make a language (framework/environment/whatever) popular.  Sad but true.<p>(I wrote a whole book on how to best use Catalyst.  A year later, it's nearly all wrong.  This seems to upset people, as now they ""are wrong"".  But it doesn't really matter;  they can incrementally move in the direction of what we consider ""not wrong"" today, and, wrong or not, it's not like their app doesn't work.  Personally, I am happy that everything becomes outdated so quickly, as it means that I can be more productive, and my apps can be easier to write and maintain.  But people are weird...)<p>I think programmers will also trade actual flexibility for an IDE that appears to make their language flexible.  Are there any really popular languages today where bloated IDEs aren't ""required""?  (I consider Java and C# to be the ""really popular"" languages today.  I don't use them, but millions of other people do.)<p>The main problem with all of this is that programmers aren't really responsible for deciding which programming technology will be used.  A programmer wants macros.  A hiring manager wants the ability to throw a dart at a list of names and find a programmer that knows that language.  Guess whose input wins?  (Combine this with the fact that people think programming is a ""cool"" profession, and you end up with 90% of the practitioners not actually knowing how to program or what programming is.  Does it surprise anyone that cool GUIs beat complex computer science topics?)<p>The good news is, you don't have to be part of the problem.  There is hardly any reason to use the ""popular"" languages.  They don't have better platform support, they don't have better libraries, and they don't have better tools.  So don't worry about them, they are for other people :)",1242852576

The hydrogen feeding into the fuel cells needs to be very dry and pure, necessitating ultrapure water.  Furthermore, the hydrogen would need to still be stored on the vehicle.  
Storage on the vehicle is actually not that big of a problem.  Hydrogen is explosive, but people forget that gasoline is also extremely explosive... and yet we drive around sloshing tanks with very few issues (unlike the movies where the slightest fender-bender results in a fireball).
The fuel cells are the hard part.  The cheap ones are fickle, with narrow active temperatures and intolerance for contaminants.  The most efficient ones run at very high temperatures, are heavy, and involve nasty chemicals... very useful for sealed stationary applications, not so for cars.",1242851756
