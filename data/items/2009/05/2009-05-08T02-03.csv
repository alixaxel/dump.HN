599083,comment,599013,599013,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"The game Dragon Realms (play.net/dr) implements a system very much like this. It's actually a mud and not a video game, but that actually doesn't make a significant difference in this context.<p>DR has balance, so that the better balanced you are the better you can attack and defend. Some weapons are better than other at unbalancing an opponent, and you can also use spells to gain balance or unbalance something else.<p>It also has stamina, so that when you swing a sword over and over eventually you'll start swinging wildly, and eventually you'll fall over from exhaustion. This also negatively affects your balance.<p>The mechanic of position is also used, and as you play you learn how to respond to attacks or execute sequences of attacks to gain a better position.<p>Benzim mentioned having thrust, slash, etc, and DR implements this idea with thrust, jab, chop, sweep, slash, charge, etc.<p>The DR system differs from the one in the article in that you can face multiple opponents, though that's a skill you have to level up or else you'll be overwhelmed.<p>Overall the combat system is very engaging and different from the typical MUD system of typing ""attack"" and watching lines of numbers go by. Worth playing if you're into that kind of thing.",1241751449

They were willing to waive the monthly minimum and sent me a schedule of straightforward low rates, however, they still weren't as low as CHASE Paymentech.<p>They even went so far as to say that I got a better deal with CHASE Paymentech and subtly suggested we use them until we felt we needed Braintree's value added services which seem to be the best in the industry.",1241751423

599071,comment,599013,599013,0,0,benzim,,,"Another interesting mechanic would be different types of attacks: thrust, slash left, slash right, slash down. The player can see the attack beginning and has a small amount of time to choose the correct defense to that attack. Choosing the correct defense reduces the amount of focus lost. You could also add shields. If you press block with a shield it'll block any attack with minimal loss of focus. Shields would have hit points and break if used too many times.<p>Mount and Blade is the closest game I've played to this. It still has hit points, but that makes sense for a medieval game where you're fighting heavily armored humans.",1241750690
