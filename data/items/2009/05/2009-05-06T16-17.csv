If a service specifically tells you that from time to time you can expect a few hiccups, you can't complain, paid or not. If Gmail were to announce that it had developed the perfect spam filter, and people switched to it for that very reason, they would have every right to complain if it didn't work.",1241629162

If you want to get interesting take a look at how unique IDs are generated.<p>They rely on the Scheme random number generator which is seeded using the milliseconds of Unix epoch.  Since PG regularly restarts the server it should be possible to get a window of time in which to test a succession of random number seeds.  If you could hang around until the server was dead (say test every few seconds), then login and obtain a cookie you'd have enough to do a prediction of the server seed.  You could then run the random number generator forward predicting cookie values and then run them by the server to see which ones are valid.<p>As people log in you'd be able to impersonate them.

(<a href=""http://www.recessframework.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recessframework.org</a>) It's got annotations for a declarative, meta-programming style. It's inherently RESTful (and more fine-grained content negotiation is coming soon). The Models/ORM are lazy so that you can chain together queries that evaluate at the last minute. Recess deploys just fine to commodity $5/mo servers and was designed to be lightweight and fast without giving up object-oriented design (a la Code Igniter).<p>What I feel gets lost in the ""PHP is terrible"" literature is a distinction between PHP as a programming language and PHP as a technology / platform. As a programming language, from an academic perspective, PHP is embarrassing. As a technology/platform it's incredibly well suited for web applications because that's exactly its intention. PHP's shared-nothing execution model, simple deployment, efficiency & performance make it a great technology for authoring web applications. Tooling has gotten much better too with Eclipse's PDT & XDebug.<p>If you're growing tired of PHP and looking for a platform/framework to develop on that is more productive and enjoyable try taking Recess for a spin.

596059,comment,595515,595515,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The thing I always wonder about is 'PhD stupidity'. Basically, PhD's usually seem to get a sense of entitlement, which may put them at a disadvantage when entering the real world and leaving the academic world. What the author seems to be misunderstanding, is that employers aren't impressed by a PhD for an entry level job (actually it probably makes them very hesitant). However, the PhD is likely to get trapped into the whole 'I have a PhD so I'm important' mentality that seems to go around, so they never figure out that the PhD is stopping them getting a real job.<p>I think the other major problem is that people take PhD's that won't help them get a job. I've known forensic scientists who've been stuck in deli counters, because there's only a handful of available jobs in the entire western world. I've known journalist grads who've been flat out rejected because of their degree, because it teaches them poor skills (the main skill desired now is the ability to write with personality, which journalism courses actively discourage).<p>So I'm sure there's a lot of ways that can contribute to a PhD making you unemployable, however it's probably always down to poor choice or poor judgment.<p>Personally I'd love to get a PhD in physics out of pure interest. However, the one thing I'd worry about, and I've told to friends going the PhD route, is that taking a PhD keeps you out of the career field for 10+ years. So you have to really evaluate if 10+ years of experience is better for you career wise than a PhD and 0 years experience, because all the fields I'm interested in (career wise, not academically) don't give a damn if you have a PhD, so even though I'd like to have a degree in something I'm not going to waste my time.",1241627426

596053,comment,595860,595860,0,0,cardmagic,,,"PHP is not a language that was designed to be a language. It was originally a set of scripts that slowly morphed into a kind-of language. Because of that, PHP lacks a lot of the language features (threads, namespaces, proper OO design from the ground up) that ""serious"" languages all have. Ruby was buit to be the best language Matz could think of. Erlang was built to be a great language for programming telecoms.

596045,comment,595860,595860,0,0,mdasen,,,"There are lots of reasons.<p>* PHP attracts idiots.  Partly that's because you don't need to know anything to make simple PHP.  So, in the large pool of PHP programmers, there are a ton of idiots.  And those idiots produce a lot of verbose code that gets used because it does something.  Ruby, Python, Perl, etc. all put up a larger barrier because they don't just come with a session handler or whatnot built in.  And that weeds out more of the idiots.  Doesn't really have to do with PHP the language, but it is nonetheless significant.<p>* PHP has a bad type system that leads to errors.  There, I said it.  The fact that 0 == ""string1"" and 0 == ""string2"", but ""string1"" != ""string2"" is unacceptably bad.<p>* PHP has no namespaces.  Yeah, they're planned for 5.3, but the implementation is just ugly.  This makes it more likely to botch something in a larger project.<p>* Which leads me to my next point: include/require.  In PHP, it's decently common to say require('some_file.php'); and just grab a huge hunk of code.  Eww!  That code could be doing anything - adding in variables, executing code, etc.  While it's true that other languages can do that as well, that's generally not the case - other languages are more in favor of importing objects or functions.  Partly it's a language thing, partly it's a culture thing.<p>* Magic!  So, how does mysql_query() know which database to connect to when you don't pass in a database connection?  I mean, I'm guessing they're either using a global or if it's in C a static external variable, but PHP is littered with this crap.  It's not necessarily bad, but it's magical.<p>* Functions!  So, PHP now has cool object oriented stuff.  Still, it doesn't use it at all.  I don't object to strlen($var) that much when compared to $var->len(), but there are other cases where it's just crappy.  So, PHP has a function strpos() which will return the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string.  Quick!  In what order do you put the variables?  In this case, it's string to be searched, search string.  What about preg_match()?  Oh, there you put it in the reverse order!  And really, when writing functions, there is no ""proper"" order, but if you're doing $string.preg_match('/^apple$/'), there's a clear order.<p>* Looking more at preg_match().  What does it return?  It doesn't return a match, it returns a count of the matches it finds.  If you want the matches, you need to pass in a variable that it will take a pointer to as an argument so that it can place the matches in there.  Bleh!  How would this be done in a nice OO-way?  $var->preg_match('/^apple$/').count() would get you the count and otherwise you get the match returned.  Easy in a way that requires less memorization of weirdness and doesn't feel so wrong.  And crappy things like that are done throughout PHP where things are weird, but end up<p>* php.ini.  Terrible idea.  PHP allows you to change very important things install-wide, directory-wide, app-wide, ick-wide!  It's not just magic quotes.  It's more that you never quite know what you're deploying to in a bad way.<p>Finally, it's that PHP is an older-style language without the cool things that newer languages can do.  PHP isn't bad per-se, but it isn't good either.  The biggest thing it has going for it is that it's easy on shared hosting.  With VPSs coming down in price to the point that they don't represent a huge premium over shared hosting, that's become less of an attraction.  PHP is fine, but there's a decent amount to get annoyed with when creating a larger application.",1241627179
