After reading the article, I was quite surprised that it went back to HN perfectly. I also tested it with a longer back/forward history. In one attempt, I was able to back/forward through seven pages(that's all that I had been to in that tab at the time) without having internet access.

I still don't believe that the metaphor stands up at all well.<p>For example, I could write a really simple operating system that consisted of pretty much nothing but a filesystem and a tcp/ip stack, in order to see any of the content on the disk all you need to do is telnet to port 31337 and enter the string ""bobsyeruncle^M"" and it just streams out the contents of the attached filesystem.<p>This operating system would be invulnerable to all windows viruses and worms on the net, just like OS X, but to say that it is ""more secure than windows"" is extremely disingenuous at best. If for some completely bizarre reason it ever became popular, putting that claim to the test would show even Joe Sixpack that it was indeed not at all more secure than windows.<p>This is the same as the situation with OS X, if it gains majority market share it will have to deal with the same hostile environment windows currently has to deal with in terms of attackers, worms, viruses, exploits, etc. Nobody at the moment is bothering because it is only (8?9?)% and thus they can pretend that OS X is immune to viruses just like I could pretend my theoretical operating system is immune to viruses.<p>That doesn't make it so.",1242262427

It <i>will</i> do is hire the ""clock punchers"" who punch their clocks 1930 instead of at 1730: the focus here is still on _having an appearance of doing work_, not on doing work.<p>It will also create a great degree of churn: people will put on a show just to get the job and then leave after a few months. Churn is <i>always</i> incredibly expensive and demoralizing and kills start-ups: to some degree it's not avoidable in a start-up, but this is just asking for it.<p>So how do you hire hard working and passionate people? It's much simpler: is this something that they do for fun? Do they have side projects or participate in open source projects (which may conflict with the idea of them spending all their time at the office!)? Do they give any indication of a passion for their work (instead of just putting on a show and telling you what they wan to hear?)<p>Lastly, this is just plain bad advise for employees as well.

For a tech startup, 10M is a price point at which you have a small team and a product with a few man-years of development behind it. Acquiring the product without the team is only worthwhile when the product is a brand. Otherwise, the team/product combinmation is what gives the company most of that value.<p>To name one example: in 1999 my company paid $13M for a company with 11 people, most of them developers. The company failed to offer them an interesting package so they quit after the acquisition. A team on our side was left to deploy the software. After a few weeks we decided it would be easier to develop the same functionality from scratch.<p>On the other hand, the assumption was that you 'owned' 5% of the 200M company.

On the whole codesink1 wins with the Boyer Moore suggestion. In broader terms, algorithm selection beats optimization and all is right with the CS universe. (KMP's poor showing surprises me, but I've not used it before and don't know what to expect.)<p>If we assume the data is out on a hard drive, then we get these numbers (same machine, a WD Green Power HD which is an evil thing to benchmark with because it has variable spindle and seek speeds, but suffice it to say it is not terribly fast). All OS caches flushed before each test.<p><pre><code>  algorithm  milliseconds

Here disk read time sets a lower bound, algorithm is still important, but not so much as before. I have a sneaky suspicion that mmap() is a poor choice here. There doesn't seem to be much overlap between the IO and compute when looking at the memcmp0 times.<p>Testing on a beefier machine, with a Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz, OS X gives this:<p><pre><code>  algorithm  milliseconds
    memcmp0      1100     =========================
    memcmp1       180     ====

The processor is several times faster, but bringing pages in from the OS is slightly slower. I don't know how to flush OS buffers on this machine so I can't do the disk reading tests.<p>Update: well crap. this fell of the front page before I finished testing. No one will see these results, but I enjoyed the tests anyway. It is useful to update my rules of thumb and preconceived notions.",1242259813
