620362,comment,619511,619573,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Last night, I disagreed with this, but wasn't sure why, so I didn't post.<p>One reason I prefer manufactured things to handmade things is that the manufactured ones seem ""right"" in a way that the handmade ones never really do.  When I make something by hand, it's never really done, because I can always see imperfections and problems.  When something is made by machine, even the imperfections and problems seem like <i>part</i> of it, rather than mistakes, because the machine (ideally) does the same thing every time.  It appeals to my sense of completion.<p>Another reason to prefer manufactured things to handmade (or custom) things is precisely that there's less information associated.  It's more relaxing -- less cluttered, in the same sense as the Stuff essay ( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html</a> ).",1242911474

In one year a store with merely twenty five dollars of losses a day must increase sales by 175,000 dollars to break even.
