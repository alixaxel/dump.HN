632675,comment,632335,632335,0,0,calambrac,,,"I believe its dangerous to assume that the jobs we're losing as our technological abilities advance will continue to be replaced by new ones.  Keep in mind, we're not just talking about losing manufacturing jobs (which is all the author seems to focus on here).  We're also talking about losing  human resources departments, which previously had to track all the other human employees in the company, and managers, who had to manage the underlings and the human resource department.<p>Robots aren't going to stay confined to manufacturing plants.  CAT is heavily invested in robotic trucks.  One of the coolest videos that I've seen that's been posted to this site showed a robotic fulfillment center.  There was one just today (admittedly, kind of silly) about a robotic garbage man.  This is only going to continue.<p>Then there are the jobs that aren't necessarily disappearing, but that aren't growing, either.  Software is letting accounting and finance departments ramp up their productivity per worker.  A company can these days grow in complexity and revenues but only needs to staff at replacement levels to keep up with the increased work load.  And, as it becomes more and more obvious that there are very real benefits to offloading to service providers rather than maintaining your own data centers, ops teams, and IT departments, companies will.<p>This isn't surprising.  This whole community is formed around the idea that these days, starting a viable business is completely in the power of small teams of smart people.  We've talked about the real jobs that are coming along with these companies as they become established, but I would bet that they're running at a level of productivity that shames companies of their size from just 10 years ago.<p>It's a real question:  where are the new jobs coming from?  For the next few years, we'll have a nice little bubble in the healthcare industry as the Baby Boomer wave crests, but that's hardly sustainable.<p>I think the real question is, how are we going to restructure to deal with high levels of unemployment, so that we stay stable and productive?  How do we incentivize the smart and capable to keep pushing us forward without completely dropping everyone else?",1243626808

632658,comment,632335,632335,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's surprising that a piece like this hasn't generated that many comments considering the number of comments similar articles create.  I think that's a testament to how measured and informed the article is.  However, the final paragraph stuck out to me:<p><i>The biggest challenge we face over the long term -- beyond the current depression -- isn't how to bring manufacturing back. It's how to improve the earnings of America's expanding army of low-wage workers who are doing personal service jobs in hotels, hospitals, big-box retail stores, restaurant chains, and all the other businesses that need bodies but not high skills. More on that to come.</i><p>Earlier in the article, Secretary Reich had noted that supermarket checkout clerks were being replaced with self-checkout machines.  I'm not sure why one would expect big-box retail labor to fare better.  In fact, we're starting to see how they won't fare better.  Automation is coming to retail.  Right now, it's mostly visible in self-checkouts.  However, think about Amazon: I'm sure their warehouses use a very high level of automation to minimize labor.  There was a posting on HN a while back about robots that went around a warehouse bringing the products all to one person which eliminates the labor of fetching products.  Is it that outrageous to think that a store like Walmart or Target will be able to stock their shelves in an automated fashion in the future?  How about a retail store where you can go around and look and play with things and then you just note the product numbers of the things you want and punch them into a computer at checkout.  Then an automated system bags up all your stuff and delivers them to you.  No labor needed at all.<p>Likewise, I yearn for the self-making bed.  Roomba is already vacuuming floors and while one can argue that it isn't as good as a hotel might need, it's not hard to see that it will continue to get better.  Is it that hard to see those service jobs seeing less labor as well?<p>The problem, in my mind, is that we simply don't need much unskilled labor anymore.  Skilled labor can create things that do unskilled labor better than unskilled laborers can.  If it isn't happening now, it's not hard to believe that it will in the future.<p>The question then becomes, how do we as a society deal with the fact that there might be some people who aren't able to be skilled laborers?  What happens when the only jobs available require more skills and intellect than the unskilled jobs of today?  Do we just let their salaries languish and let them be impoverished on the streets?  I don't think that would be a good thing.  Job retraining is definitely a possibility, but to what end?<p>It seems like the skills required in the world today are changing at a much faster rate than they have in the past.  Where change might come after many lifetimes, today one might have to learn many new skills in a generation in order to stay relevant.<p>It's friday and I skipped lunch so I might not be so coherent, but it does seem like there might be a point at which all low-skilled work is automated and we possibly can't educate a portion of the population high enough that they can become part of the class that creates capital goods (rather than those that simply use capital goods like a cash register).  How do you take a cash-register user and turn them into a cash-register designer/maintainer/troubleshooter?  How do you take someone that stocks store shelves and make them someone that designs robots to do that task?",1243626366

632645,comment,632374,632374,0,0,markessien,,,"He's wrong for a simple reason: Breasts are expensive. They are expensive to maintain, and no other animal maintains them. So even if it had an advantage at some point in time, as he describes, rather than maintaining an expensive evolutionary line, this ""fashion"" would change quickly.<p>I think that breast serve a concrete purpose that is essential for our society. And the fact that we have breasts is strongly tied in with the difference between us and other animals. We are different from other animals in that we are more clever and more social. We are also different in that we have breasts. It's likely that the two are tied together.<p>My theory is this: breasts are an age indicator. In traditional human societies it's difficult to judge the reproductive health of a woman. A woman can hide her true reproductive health by various means (like body painting or ovulating on the sly), so as our societies grew bigger and bigger, it was neccessary for the society as a group to make non-hideable means of judging how fit the particular woman is.<p>Breasts benefit the community more than they benefit the woman according to my theory. I.e, humans are supremely social, and the best evolved human is the one that works the best to move the entire community forward. A society of very selfish people will not survive.<p>Humans have certain traits that help the community more than they help themselves. Breasts could be one of them.<p>Small, large, medium, the size of breasts is not really critical. However, perk and 'young' breasts would always be judged more attractive than long sagging breasts. It's clear that the function of breasts is correlated to age. And that sexual attractiveness increases the more attractive the breast is.<p>Similarly, if a young woman is starved for a long time in a sand blown deserts, the first things to go are the form of the breasts. She is not in an ideal reproductive state, as rearing children requires a lot of water. Old women who are past reproductive age often have their breasts change to a different less attractive form.<p>Conclusion: Breasts, and some other female parts are a simple indication of youth and reproductive health for a society that is clever enough to fake the other things usually used by other primates.",1243625901

But note that it hasn't been published anywhere, so it is not as if the scientific community is accepting it as science.<p>You seem to have the opinion that anything that is not science is at best not worth doing, and at worst evil. I urge you to re-examine that assumption.<p>Now, if there were a scientific way of answering the question that the article considers, that would be a very different situation. In the absence of one, it is ridiculous to suggest that no one should think about it. And if people think about it, they will present their attempted answers to the world. Hopefully, their arguments will rest on logic, even if not empirically verifiable. This is an expression of human curiosity, and I think it is natural and wonderful.<p>I say we should continue to discuss articles like this, but doing our best to keep in mind that they are not proven theories. As our experimental abilities improve, it might turn out that today's speculation is fertile ground for tomorrow's experimentation as a bed of hypothesis to test and accept or discard.<p>Finally, even if one's sole concern is the dissemination of scientific knowledge, I contend that the article is still useful if it makes people think and learn more about the fascinating, fascinating phenomenon of Fischerian runaway (to give just one example).",1243624774

That Keynes was part of the group that designed the Brenton Woods agreement isn't brought up by Krugman or that the U.S. survived many recessions without expanding the money supply. There was a very severe recession that started in the early 20s and the government did nothing and we never read it about because it ended quickly.

(Yes, it does compete with some other, more modern forms of socialization.) Everyone who tries to knock you down is either building their own confidence or testing yours, or both. You are supposed to learn to use this to drive yourself more. Overconfident males who take risks are good for the social group and very good for the few males who become wildly successful, but not so great for the rest. But screw that, I'm a male, I know I'm smart, and I'm going to be one of the successful ones, dammit! Failure is not an option!<p>I'm a male, and I think I can accomplish anything I choose to do. That makes me ridiculously overconfident, which is probably necessary for accomplishing something new and important. I know about the odds, but I'm just not wired to care about them very much. My problem is that the prospect of great success doesn't really motivate me. This is not what males of the species are supposed to think, as much as evolved creatures are ""supposed"" to think anything at all. Some wires have gotten crossed somewhere. I am a mutant, and not the cool kind, like an X-Man.<p>Part of me already realizes that this defect will prevent me from fulfilling my role as a male, and reduces my chance of accomplishing something great from slim to almost nothing. I am a dud in the evolutionary scheme of things, not just a long shot, but a crippled long shot. The other part of me, the part that still works ""properly,"" if there is a proper way for an evolved mechanism to work, believes that this is a problem that can be overcome. I can accomplish anything I want, after all.<p>The red light blinks, and the diagnostic routines whirr busily. The doll sits and waits patiently, confident that it will be able to carry out its programming. The confidence has been built into the doll, and it is almost as if the machine can sense the power of the deterministic forces that drive it. As if, in the stories its highly evolved brain carefully assembles from its memory banks, it could see the outlines of its future, astride the summit. As if its missing leg, and the tens of thousands of other machines streaming past it, some of them already halfway up the mountain, were insignificant trifles.<p>The machine sits with serene confidence because it knows something that the other machines do not. It knows that it is different. It knows that it can succeed where others have failed. It knows that when the diagnostic routines have finished and the problem has been resolved, it will be able to surpass all the machines that have moved ahead. It knows that it is overconfident, but it also knows that overconfidence is part of why it will succeed. It knows that it is following a story its brain has been programmed to tell, but it also knows that it is a story following machine, and that the story is also a necessary part of its eventual success.
