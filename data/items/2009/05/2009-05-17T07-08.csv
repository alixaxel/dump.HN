For desert, Hershey Kisses with almonds or chocolate chip cookie from the grocery deli. And to drink, I make 1/4 cup orange juice with 3/4 cup soda water. It's a homemade Orangina but not nearly as sweet. And every other day I allow myself one coke. Breakfast is usually Kelloggs Mueslix or oatmeal.<p>I'm 48 and have been blessed with having never been sick. I exercise regularly also. This may not pass muster with a lot of you but I attribute my good health to a positive mental attitude. Something has to make up for my diet... :o)<p>I",1242547162

Maybe it is only because my Mandarin is finally getting respectable, and I can now interpret what was there the whole time.  But it is an interesting contrast.  Our workers get 'cash-outs' or 'guaranteed bonuses' in the case of bankers.  Their workers are forced to share in the profits, AND losses of the company.  Time will tell which is the better incentive system I suppose.<p>One more thing I know people will get a kick out of, over there they also have another crazy idea.  If they make profits, they split it among the shareholders as well!  I think it was Yunnan that just made the largest payout ever to A-share holders a few months back, March maybe. Largest payouts for China that is, but there is a bit of a competition among the companies to one up each other.  Imagine that.",1242546070

Though spear-fishing is doubtlessly a great way of impressing the ladies, it requires a lot of technique and it can be lethal. If you live by the coast and the waves aren't too mean, something cool is kayak-fishing. I have tried and it's lots of fun.
