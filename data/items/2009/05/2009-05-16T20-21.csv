Sometimes they are just really slow to create general purpose programs compared to traditional text-based programming. I still remember the labs I had to do in Labview where to insert an element into an array, I had to drag like 3 different blocks unto the screen, convert the data into right types the and then wire them up, just inefficient.",1242507544

Did you get everybody in your real estate office to sign up for a YCNews account and upvote this comment?<p>The mortgage problem is resultant, largely, because of lack of information between buyers and sellers.  Note that I didn't say lack of information between a homebuyer's Realtor and the seller's broker.  In economics, we learn about the concepts of <i>buyer's surplus</i> and <i>seller's surplus</i>.  In real estate, there is this third entity (usually colluding brokers, agents, etc.) eating away, often entirely consuming all potential surplus.  Why else would this mortgage meltdown have happened?<p>People make decisions based on information presented to them.  Mortgage brokers and their Realtor friends go <i>out of their way</i> to throw up as many brick walls and  make the process as overwhelming and confusing as possible.  If you're a Realtor, you surely are aware of the antitrust case against the National Association of Realtors:<p><a href=""http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/nar.htm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/nar.htm/</a><p>Home buyers are usually required to sign STACKS of papers during closing.  During this process, they rarely notice that one <i>most important to the Realtor & Co</i> which is the one they slip in there that states the ""percent"" that the Realtors are making and the ""percent"" that the brokers are making in the deal; this number is NOT mandated by any laws, but Realtors and Co. always give homebuyers the impression that it is; after all, all the other papers they're signing are supposed to be for their ""protection"".  After all who would hire a Realtor who didn't claim to ""be working for you""?<p>They talk dollars when it comes to house prices and percents when it comes to what <i>they're</i> making in the deal.  This is evil, deceptive practice and it should be illegal.<p>I think most rational people would think twice about taking out a loan to pay five or six figures to somebody who calls shuttling around in an SUV and counting their riches ""work"".<p>I'm not even remotely ""communist"" as you seem to be implying; I simply think that this ""rolodex"" argument you're making is beyond outdated in the 21st Century.<p>After all, your risk-reward argument only makes sense <i>if</i> there's competition.  And if you'll look over the DOJ case I linked to above, you will see that the National Association of Realtors does everything in its power to restrain competition.<p>Need more evidence?

I am not very concerned about NKS specifically).<p>But I am also not sure exactly what you want. For example, would it be strange to you if I found ants fascinating? Even though there is no scientific idea at first. Maybe if you look at ants for a while, you'll generate all sorts of ideas (and even in Goedel-Escher-Bach, which I guess is very classic AI, they make an appearance).<p>So I am not sure that I accept your complaint that you can see no scientifical idea. Actually I am not sure, what is a ""scientifical idea""? (Honest question)<p>Looking at cellular automata I get all sorts of ideas. So I find them fascinating. And why is it not a ""scientifical idea"" for you to build complex things from simple rules? I don't think it is such an obvious idea.<p>I am willing to try to answer your question, but first please explain to me what aspect exactly you want to hear about (""scientifical idea"").<p>As for McCarthy, I don't really worry much about what he thinks, especially since LISP is actually from the ""classic AI"" side of things (I don't mean that as disrespectful - but he is a specialist for LISP and computation, not for complex systems). I think finding the smallest Turing machine was just something to be done for fun - I don't think Wolfram thought much more about it either. So that finding it did not blow McCarthy's mind hardly disqualifies the whole subject in my opinion.<p>Also, could you link to the No Hidden Variables vs Wolframs suggestion please?
