What little I know about divorces and children suggests that marriage functions as a crude insurance policy for the kids - which seems reasonable.

Perhaps, it is also more expensive to run experimental sites on than, say, Django).<p>I frequently have ideas which I want to experiment with, and know should take less than a weekend to hack together with one of the newer frameworks/libraries.<p>So, two questions: first, what are the best frameworks to get a <i>prototype</i> as fast as possible. Scalability is not a major issue for now: I think if an idea's good, it will still be used if it's slow/unreliable (e.g. early Twitter), and one can scale in the meanwhile.<p>Second, how does one learn enough to hack something quickly together in the framework you suggest?

They are smart and literate, and most of them had parents who read to them as children. But when students read aloud at first, I notice that they are trying to read the meaning of the words.""</i><p>I suspect this had to do with the students' expectation of what their teacher wants. I bet if the same student was given a copy of ""Room on the Broom"" and a willing toddler, they would read just fine.<p>I wonder whether some rephrasing from the teacher (such as ""would you perform this text"" instead of ""read"") would make a difference.<p>But there is a big difference between the music example and reading. Aside from the level of required skill, playing a piano sonata takes the same time as listening to the CD; however reading aloud a book takes significantly longer than reading. Which is why it makes sense for short forms, but not for whole novels - unless you can't read at all (eg. while driving).",1242767592

1) I worked on the search engine and Larry has been saying this for years. I worked on search quality back in 2005 and even back then he was talking about indexing everything and indexing it in seconds instead of hours.<p>2) Search is won on the margins. Yahoo and Google do equally well on most queries, but users decide which engine is better based on how it performs over all of the types of searches they have to do. So when you take the 80/100 searches you do that are not real time and use unique keywords and you know what you're looking for Y! and G come out the same. It's on those other 20/100 that Google wins users.",1242767472

So if your girlfriend is working office hours you might find that you've got a lot of flexibility, just not when she does. So then you find yourself busy when she's free and free when she's busy.
