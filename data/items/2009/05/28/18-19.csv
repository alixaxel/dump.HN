Perhaps it's better termed as ""superior, seamless customer experience.""<p>Perhaps they're onto something.  If Google really doesn't offer better data than Microsoft or Yahoo, then Google's advantage is in their Brand.  Microsoft can combat this by starting a new Brand, and stand behind it with the same quality of data, but a superior customer experience.<p>EDIT: On second thought, Microsoft may be behind the game again.  The target to chase shouldn't be Google Search.  I suspect it should be Facebook and Twitter.  Google Wave might leapfrog Microsoft here.",1243537171

The point is there may be more applications on Platform X than Platform Y, but as long as there are no ""killer apps"" and both have thriving developer communities that's all that matters.<p>I think my comparison with Blackberry and Nokia was perfectly apt, because that's the market Palm are actually entering. Palm are going to be releasing many phones on many networks on multiple price points based on the same operating system - the Pre is just the first of many. If you were to believe the hype, you'd imagine that Blackberry and Nokia don't matter, rather than selling the millions of smartphones they do, and that Palm couldn't potentially have huge success without selling their phones to a single iPhone customer. I think it's only fair to compare it to other manufacturers on many carriers, not Apple's self-enforced network limitations.<p>I'd be very interesting in reading what you personally think Palm should be doing, because apparently a relatively small company building something that compares favourably to the market leaders in their (expanding) product area isn't good enough.
