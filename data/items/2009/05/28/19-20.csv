You can be careful about the points at which you use classical reasoning (or, here, probability), but then the whole proof is no longer constructive.  The argument in favor of the constructive approach is that you can very carefully decide when you depart from it.<p>For a (Curry-Howard) corresponding intuition, a program is no longer functional the moment any computational effect is involved (mutable state, control effects like continuations and backtracking, etc.).",1243540771

Well, duh -- there's no micropayment infrastructure, so no true micropayments.</i><p>Exactly. There is no data in his argument - you can argue that people wouldn't want to pay a little versus nothing but how can you know? There is no real opportunity to test this on the Internet. In real life, there are people who make a living from busking, which implies that there is no universal psychological barrier to tossing a quarter in a tin can for a snatch of a tune that put a smile on your face. (You can argue that there are people who never give to buskers, but that is not really the issue).<p>As for the transaction cost - well indeed, this is why the micropayment problem has not been solved. This isn't really my field, but I imagine the way forward is to somehow ""warehouse"" and broker payments until they are no longer ""micro"". For example if I make 10 micropayements of $0.25 to 10 different recipients, i am debited $2.50 once, and all that debit goes to one recipient, with everybody else's money shuffled around until all recipients ultimately get their money in as few transactions as possible. Nobody said it is an easy problem to solve.",1243540658

The visibility problem worsens with multiple touch, since you may have both hands between your eyes and the screen.<p>When manipulating something small or fine on the screen with a coarse fingertip, it can be difficult to know if you actually have a 'grip' on it, or precisely which face/edge of it you're pushing/pulling.  (In the physical world, we receive tactile feedback through our fingertips that helps us grasp things.)  Frustrating, since much of the promise of multi-touch systems is in modeling physical-world manipulation.<p>Also, PC touch screens can quickly get greasy, worsening visibility even when your hands aren't on it.  I developed for a PC-based multitouch environment last fall; by the end of a debugging session on the test system, its screen would be difficult to read.  If I ever do that again I will buy silk gloves and learn to type in them (and hope that they are fine enough not to block input on a capacitive touchscreen).",1243540611

In fact, you can't even do it for ""most cases"" in C because you don't know what type expr will evaluate to, but if we could cheat and assume it will be an int:<p><pre><code>  #define aif(expr, code)  \\n     {                     \\n     int it = (expr);      \\n     if (it)               \\n        {                  \\n        code;              \\n        }                  \\n     }\n</code></pre>\nBut this is still not close because in a Lisp, if is an expression that returns a value.

Well, duh -- there's no micropayment infrastructure, so no true micropayments.  The business models that exist today are the ones that somehow get the customer to cough up a couple of bucks.<p>Then the main thrust of his argument is that consumers won't accept micropayments because there's a big difference between ""free"" and ""very cheap.""  I think this has some merit, but the success of not-very-micro payment services like iTunes shows that consumers are willing to pay for content while the value proposition is right.  They just don't want to be hit with a continuous stream of charges that can add up to a massive bill at the end of the month.  That's why metered data plans were such a PITA: it's hard to see how much you're using when you're surfing, and there were a lot of horror stories about people getting bills for thousands of dollars at the end of the month.  Nobody wants that.<p>What a micropayment system needs to succeed is to drop the transaction cost, so that very small payments (maybe even fractions of a cent) are feasible, and then they need to be transparent to the user.  The charges can't just happen silently and then end up on a bill at the end of the month; that makes (smart) people understandably nervous.  You need to show how much money people are spending so they can see that it's a comfortable amount to spend.<p>I think if you had a system that let you toss virtual pennies around, people wouldn't hesitate to spend them any more than they hesitate to spend real-world pennies (which is to say, not much).  As them for a few bucks and they will stop and think, but a couple of cents?  I don't think they will.
