I'm not all for open source (it has its uses but not all software should be open source) but I am all for good arguments.<p>""If developers give away their software, where is the food going to come from? Lots, perhaps most, open source developers have salaried jobs. OSS is a side project, but if you want it to be your money maker, perhaps it isn't for you.""<p>Much OSS is developed commercially by people who are paid to develop OSS.<p>""Do you want to focus on managing an open source community or focus on your customers? Managing forks? Maintaining control?""<p>You don't have to do any of these things.<p>""There are myriad OSS licenses. These licenses are like viruses. If you use code that contains them, your code contains them. They attach themselves to everything you write and everything you distribute.""<p>False. GPL is viral but not all open source licenses operate like GPL. He's confusing open source with copyleft.<p>""I've lost emails on two different occassions because of bugs in Thunderbird.""<p>That's nice, but I've paid for bugs too. What I want to see is an accurate survey of software quality between proprietary software and widely used open source.<p>""I don't even want to count the number of Linux distributions available."" ""How many browsers are built on top of webkit or gecko?""<p>Sounds like he'd really be upset counting the number of distributions of, say, BSD's TCP/IP code. Linux is a <i>kernel</i>, it's not a usable product by itself. Webkit is most of a browser, but it's not an application. Same with Gecko. Maybe it needs to be made more obvious that a lot of open source projects build components rather than finished applications, but if you don't grasp that concept, you're not qualified to argue this point.<p>""Okay, well the fact that there are multiple distros makes the OSS world more confusing for the end user and what the end user wants is simplicity.""<p>So he wants a monopoly on browsers and operating systems?<p>He doesn't want to be ""confused"" by the fact that someone makes a Linux for servers and a Linux for datacenters and a Linux for Google's own personal compute cluster and a Linux for wristwatches and toasters? Then stop shopping for datacenter and wristwatch software. The number of desktop Linux distros designed and widely adopted for consumer use is fairly small.<p>""You'll spend a lot of your time doing code reviews instead of writing your own code.""<p>Only if you really want to. It's not a requirement of the license that you actively maintain the code and manage contributions from others.<p>""You may end up with too many cooks in the kitchen.""<p>You can always close the door and inform them they can experiment on your recipe in their own kitchen. Don't most open source projects have a small core of dedicated contributors anyway? And the ability to selectively allow newcomers into this core? I can't just walk in and start fucking around with the Linux kernel because Linus and crew won't let me. What I <i>can</i> do is fork Linux, create Philinux, and break it to my heart's content. And if it sucks, no one will notice.<p>""If you open source your software your monetization options become limited.""<p>True. But I don't see the point of this argument--you can open source software that you <i>don't</i> intend to sell, or <i>use</i> open source software, without having to open source the software you're trying to sell. That goes without saying.<p>""How many billion dollar open source software companies are there? How many closed source?""<p>Sometimes instead of building your own private park on your corporate headquarters, you can put the corporate headquarters next to a city park and volunteer for park cleanup.<p>Linux was built for free because Linus wanted to build a kernel. It's maintained because some individuals and some companies want to invest time and money in it. Just because Linux isn't a product of some company doesn't mean it's worthless, or that it can't be used to make money.<p>""Imagine telling...attorneys to open source their skills.""<p>They do. In fact, the law itself is open source--each and every line of ""code"" is published by the government in volumes of leather-bound books titled ""US Code"" and the like.<p>As for private laws, like contracts, some lawyers write up example contracts that you can copy and use, and publish them. Of course, like with code, it takes someone who knows the language to make sure that boilerplate applies to your specific situation.<p>""So the argument that the consumer of OSS is free to modify it to do whatever is a myth. It just doesn't happen like they say it does and most end users don't know how to do it even if they have the source.""<p>Google is the consumer of Linux, and they do modify it to do whatever. Okay, maybe you're not going to modify your email client to not lose emails anymore, but that doesn't mean there's no use to having the code to anyone, ever, in all of computing.<p>""Plus, the black box makes it harder for hackers to understand.""<p>Security by obscurity?

631114,comment,631012,631012,0,0,mdasen,,,"<i>In the Rails world, the layer which generates the final markup sent to the browser is called the View layer. In a Rails View, you can chuck as much rails code as you like in amongst your markup.<p>Some of the early sites I worked on many years ago were written in PHP, which had the same idea.</i><p>Um. . .  Sure, you <i>can</i> put any logic you want in a Rails template, but people don't.  Rails applications tend to have a nice separation of layout and application logic.  Django really likes to constrain users here - not even letting them use a full ""if"" statement.  It's really unfair to just say Rails == Unmaintainable PHP.  PHP often becomes that way because there is no immediate way of separating the code.  Smarty and others can force you, but both Rails and Django put a really obvious place to put your app logic and developers tend to respect that.  Part of this is just how much rope do you give a developer and it's fair to say that one shouldn't give developers that much leeway.  However, it's wrong to just equate the two.<p><i>Multiple Apps in a Project</i><p>Really, neither framework (or any code) is as pluggable into random situations as we programmers would like.  The author suggests that you can use models from different applications in Django.  That sounds cooler than it is.  They're all running off the same database and in the same project.  Really, what Rails creates are projects in Django-speak.  And the ""apps"" convention in Django doesn't help you in development.  It helps in organization sometimes - especially the admin interface - but it isn't some spectacular thing where you can just reuse random code in a way that you can't with Rails.  Well, I take that back, there is one way that is really nice: namespacing.  You can have a blog app that has an Entry and Category model without having to name it BlogEntry and BlogCategory because it would conflict with your Category model for, say, a real estate part of your app.  And that is helpful in a way that Rails doesn't solve nicely.  However, for the most part Rails and Django provide decently equal utility in this area, they just name the things differently.<p><i>URL Routing</i><p>Django's routing is really verbose.  You have to specify each route you want.  Rails has a bunch of shortcuts for common cases (REST as well as :controller/:action/:id).  In a way, this is just the explicit vs. implicit thing.  Django makes you explicitly state your URLs while Rails will let you state them, but you don't have to should you like the defaults.  The Django folk say that it takes very little time to write routes (true) and that one should be thoughtful when making URLs (also true).  But sometimes it just feels tedious.  Really, it's just a matter of preference.<p><i>Ruby (Perl’s Ugly Sister)</i><p>This is kinda low at some points (why I went to it last - I don't like dwelling on such poor arguments).  Ruby doesn't actually use that many symbols ala Perl.  All variables are done without symbols; I think strings built as ""#{var} is cool"" are easier to understand than ""%(var)s is cool"" % {'var': var}.  And it isn't like Python doesn't have weird things like ""/"".join(list).<p>Really, my beef with Ruby would be how easy (and common) it is to add methods to ancestors without really making it clear.  As you start adding methods to Object, you can get yourself into a position where Python's explicitness is really nice.  However, when you want to get something done, Ruby can be nice in that respect.  It's like having a circular saw: really good for both cutting wood and cutting your hand off.  Likewise, Python's mixins are put onto attributes of the model - so that you have things like house.photo.url rather than house.photo_url (although Django did create the second for a long time).  That makes it very clear what you're adding while if you say ""acts_as_nested_set"" in Rails, you don't immediately see which methods are being added.<p>Ruby's problems aren't really syntactic, but it can have things that one could define as problems.<p>--<p>I've put out two sites in Django and one in Rails and at this point I'm developing two projects in Rails.  The Django community is really smart and understated and I still read a lot (smart information translates well to anything), but Django just doesn't see the same pace of development that Rails does.  Even something simple such as following reverse foreign keys isn't implemented in Django.  Yep, if you try Entry.objects.all(select_related=""comments"") it will just silently fail (how's that for letting errors pass silently that shouldn't!).  And it is difficult and Malcom has way more on his plate than any normal person could even conceive of, but. . .  it's still missing.<p>And the Rails community has calmed down a bit, the Merb camp seems to be adding nicely to Rails 3, the Rails framework covers so many more edge cases than it used to as well as just seeming more reliable, and deployment has really stepped up with Passenger.<p>Django is a wonderful piece of software with great features and really smart, considerate people using it.  It just isn't seeing as great a push toward little simplifications for more edge cases in the way that Rails has been.  Frankly, they're so much alike in all the meaningful ways - I think that's why I have such an easy time wrapping my head around both.<p>Eh, I have to get dinner.",1243548810

I very rarely use them and so never need to use the module.<p>Finally, use accessor methods to work with instance variables instead of accessing them directly. This also makes it easier to add logic to handle your instance variables without having to rewrite or break any code.<p>If you follow these three steps alone, you will have about the same amount of symbol soup as you would in python, which is almost none.<p>(By the way, I am also a fan of both python and ruby and think they are both great languages).",1243548753

Through refactoring, writing tests with QuickCheck and sharp thinking the authors found ways to make the paths to simpler design and correctnes lead in the same direction.  They used data structures that embodied more domain knowledge.  Thus they eliminated the need for many runtime error checks.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/blog/2007/05/01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/blog/2007/05/01</a>",1243548617

Words like ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" have become incredibly loaded terms, and the notion that they describe everyone is absurd oversimplification.<p>At a very basic level, the combination of social and economic issues is silly.  The politicalcompass.org site/method is not without bias, but at least they break it into a two dimensional problem.<p>I've found that a great number of hackers/engineers skew towards more libertarian beliefs, where they may be ""liberal"" on one issue and then ""conservative"" on the next, but overall maintain a perfectly rational & consistent basis for their beliefs.  These types of people don't fit well on a simplified 1-dimensional line between left & right.",1243548349
