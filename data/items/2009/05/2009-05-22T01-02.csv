Not knowing what you're doing shouldn't stop you from doing it, it simply means you have things to learn before you're done.  If you're willing to accept that and seek knowledge and help where appropriate (and don't deceive others about it, as pretending tends to imply), behaving as if you know what you're doing is a good means of personal growth and getting fresh ideas into a project you're joining.",1242957215

It's about time that usability started being a buzzword in the tech industry and started being a real focus. Bear in mind, however, that ""being able to load programs faster"" and ""being able to play more realistic games"" are qualitative measures, which was one of the points I tried making with my original post: consumers care about qualitative things, not quantitative.
