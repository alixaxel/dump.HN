In fact I was building a service on there but moving it based on this.<p>The economics have changed drastically and really don't even compete with a basic shared hosting account.<p>1GB per day and 6.5 CPU hours for free is nothing much really.  There are plenty of other cloud providers now that can compete on price.<p>One huge advantage to GAE was the free quota which was a huge draw.  The limiting architecture and broken platforms were ok to deal with at that.  But why not just build on EC2, Media Temple gs, Mosso, Joyent or some other now where you can install almost anything you need as well as having the scalability?<p>Very bad move by Google to reverse this drastically on the free quota which is only now just a gimmick.",1241409222

Our blood may not even be what we think of blood today, but a synthetic blend of water, nutrients, gases, hormones, protiens, and other items that our bodies need.<p>For example, there was a time when everyone wore spectacles.  That technology that improved the wearers' vision was obvious and on the face.  Now some people wear contacts, which most of the time are invisible except to the wearer.  In the future, our eyes will be replaced with advanced photo optics, night vision, and a frame storage rate much higher than our minds can currently comprehend.  We'll play it back like Tivo today, which will also be a thing of the past as well.  We'll just play movies on our mind.<p>The goal of the technology is to make itself invisible -- an intangible benefit to the quality of life.

Soon (security being one Big Problem to solve), it will include people's blood pressure, heart rate, your bath's temperature and water level, your home's water consumption, your caloric intake, number of steps you've walked, the book you're reading, etc.<p>By immediately actionable, I mean a ubiquitous spread of what we now call API's - although I imagine they won't just be for applications or programs. Your iPhone will control the elevators you're in (and your children will have trouble imagining the insanitary notion of touching buttons a dozen other people have touched), start your car, fill your bath, serve as your communications tool, etc.<p>Already, the first thing I do after turning off my alarm (<i>before</i> getting out of bed) is check/answer my e-mails.
