It's like meeting somebody who doesn't like art. It is so common and there are so many kinds out there that categorically disliking it entirely is strange. Most people probably do not want to be seen as strange.<p>It's also possible that in Western culture, not liking music is traditionally associated with something sinister. For instance, in <i>Julius Caesar</i>, Cassius is described as follows<p><pre><code>  ""...He reads much,
  He is a great observer, and he looks
  Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,
  As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music.
  Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
  As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit
  That could be mov'd to smile at anything.
  Such men as he be never at heart's ease
  While they behold a greater than themselves, 
  And therefore are they very dangerous.""

Sure, academically, and positing an ability to break into anything, encrypting the passwords and retaining the key is useless.

It could have rate limiting built in, and a storm of alerts to go off if backends request too many decryptions.",1241285718

Everyone is driving like madmen today!<p>Or specific and permanent? Damn it, my car is always breaking down!<p>Yep. The specificity depends on the framing (""everyone is driving"" generalizes over individual drivers, but is specific to the set of drivers - it excludes people in offices, at home, at sea, etc).

590031,comment,589852,589977,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Well also as a security professional (also called Thomas as it happens :P small world) I would point it out as at least a medium security flaw.<p>>  because I would get my ass kicked by my clients and partners.<p>So your reasoning is nothing to do with security - it is to do with saying what the customer wants to hear (low severity stuff can be ignored, right?).<p>I have found the opposite in the past: encrypting passwords is, I agree, a common issue and one that is also usually very simple to fix. You can present that whole fix to the client and it can probably be implemented in a few weeks/months - it's useful because it is not something that will send them screaming to the hills but it is <i>something</i> so they feel they are getting value for money :) (plus you will likely get follow up work - if not to fix the problem then to audit the fixes!). Win win.<p>At the end of the day storing in plain text means it only takes on slip to release all your users passwords into the wild. It IS a big security flaw. If I walk away from an audit w/o flagging the password encryption as something to be addressed fairly soon and then the passwords are stolen my ass is properly on the line (probably more than any other issue).<p>And for the record I am talking as big if not bigger institutions than Fedex and US banks.",1241284828

590024,comment,589852,589981,0,0,gmazzola,,,"From a theoretical security perspective, it's a terrible idea to store passwords in plaintext, but again there's a difference between theory and practice as you've stated. If your auditing can reduce/eliminate unauthorized out-of-band database access, then in practice storing plaintext passwords isn't a huge problem.<p>However, there's another practical aspect to consider: the password security of users. A perfect example from a month ago is a Christian dating website called Singles.org. The 4chan crowd discovered that if you replaced your user ID on the ""profile edit"" page with another user ID, you could edit another person's profile. The page also helpfully displayed the registered e-mail address and password, in plaintext.<p>Now, this is terrible programming on multiple levels, so you might want to discount my anecdote, but the attack vector isn't my main point.<p>The 4chan crowd, ravenous beasts that they were, attempted to use the Singles.org password to log into the victim's e-mail account. And their Facebook account. And their PayPal account. You can imagine the chaos they caused.<p>The user base had terrible password security, so easily around 20% of the accounts had the same password across multiple websites. I don't think it's an uncommon statistic: sadly, even I as a security-conscious person have used the same password more than once.<p>Our efforts should be to secure an application against all attack vectors, but hashing passwords is a veritable last defense to prevent an attack from spreading on to other websites.<p>Regardless of how an application is exploited, it's a safe assumption that the users' poor password security could spread the attack further. I would thus claim that plaintext passwords be at least a ""medium"" security issue.",1241284356

Musical artists as a group have never truly profited much from recorded distributed music - they have made money from live performance.. where, as you look at recent trends with companies such as LiveNation, things are predictably returning to.
