There is at least one service like this. It doesn't really improve anything. People who use it just become self-censoring and clam up.

The weather is fantastic and there are plenty of awesome things to do all year. Since it'll be summer, try driving up Page Mill and one way or another along Skyline, find someplace to hike. Windy Hill Summit or Russian Ridge would both be good, as they give a great overlook of the area. On a clear day, you can see the ocean, San Jose, and San Francisco from Russian Ridge. On your way out, get lost in the streets of Woodside to get a good sense of just how much wealth has been accumulated here. Hop on 280 North, and head up to San Francisco, get a burrito in the Mission, hang out in Golden Gate Park, watch the sun set from Battery Spencer (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1197"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1197</a>), etc. Spend some time wine tasting in Napa or Sonoma (or Cupertino, Palo Alto, Santa Cruz, etc). Wander around the Stanford Campus (although Spring Quarter will be just ending). My point is, people enjoy living here. There's plenty to do, lots of little communities with their own character, and the weather is great. In my view, that's a huge part of the advantage.<p>As far as specific places... try Coupa Café (<a href=""http://amid.st/p61"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p61</a>) in Palo Alto. On weekdays, I usually see a few people pitching ideas, working on iPhone/web/whatever apps, professors having spirited discussions, etc. Most of the area around University Ave is good for that. Buck's of Woodside (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1</a>) or Sundance (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1190</a>) are good places to spot VC's, but you'd have to know who's a VC to see them. The Four Seasons (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1193"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1193</a>) in East Palo Alto is usually empty. Garden Court (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1192"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1192</a>) is a little more central and usually a little more happening hotel-wise, although there are several other places in downtown that are good.<p>Most of the big VC firms are either on Sand Hill Road or on Middlefield in Menlo Park, although there are several in downtown Palo Alto. Do a search for ""venture capital"" in Google Maps, then zoom in on Palo Alto to get a good idea of where to drive if you just want to see where things are at.<p>You'll be in town the same time as Apple's WWDC in San Francisco (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/WWDC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/WWDC/</a>). You may want to see if there are any parties you can crash (there will be... check Upcoming.org). Or, just hang out at The Chieftain (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1183"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1183</a>), The Tempest (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1189</a>), The Thirsty Bear (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1191"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1191</a>) [surprisingly, -not- a gay bar], etc. There is usually a party during WWDC on the weeknights at 111 Minna (<a href=""http://amid.st/p1194"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amid.st/p1194</a>), although there may be guest lists (check Upcoming).<p>Hackerdojo (a hacker space I'm involved in starting) should be open by then.

607371,comment,607101,607143,0,0,JoshuaK531,,,"I think simplicity for the user is important, but whats even more important is simplicity for the representative.  Ultimately all change rests in their hands, and if your solution makes their lives and jobs more complicated, they're liable to ignore it.<p>Imagine getting 1000 passionate emails on a topic that have nothing to do with your job, or demanding we do something about clean air when you've already supported every clean air bill that's gone through your office.  By increasing the noise they have to deal with, you make it even harder for real issues to get through to them.  Focus on designing this solution around how it would be beneficial to the reps, and how they could better understand whats important to their constituents so they can get reelected.<p>Heres some quick ideas on how to possibly accomplish this:<p>1) Let people click a button if a story or issue is important to them and allowing them to add comments.  As a rep, seeing 1000 emails is overwhelming, but having a control panel that can easily show you how many people care about different issues is helpful.  It could sort the different stories / issues by activity, and you could read comments if it looked like a lot of people cared about it so you could get a better idea of what the sentiment was.<p>2) Somehow show what the stance of your rep is on that issue.  Theres no reason to blast them with comments if they're already supporting the issue.<p>In summation:  If you make something that the reps want to use, then people will gravitate towards it so they can get their voice heard, but if you make something that they don't like, then it doesn't matter how great your users think it is.  If it doesn't lead to change, they'll eventually stop using it.",1242239423
