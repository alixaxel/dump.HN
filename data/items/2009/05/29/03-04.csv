Everyone thinks their child is capable of becoming the next great whatever, but the reality is that there are only so many people with original and useful ideas out there.<p>Higher education is dangled as the carrot that is the means to achieving greatness. Everyone speculates that the future will yield awesomeness, but when it takes too long to reach our unrealistic expectations we overreact in the opposite fashion. We have this never-ending cycle of overinflated possibility followed by reality and an overreaction of conservation.<p>Is it perhaps a flaw in our culture? Selling an idea is more important than the idea itself. Getting ""traction"" or ""backing"" is more important than delivering something real and of actual value.",1243569488

631486,comment,629879,630430,0,0,gruseom,,,"So? If you don't understand what a function does, you read it; if you don't understand what a macro does, you read it. This whole ""macros make new syntax so they make code unintelligible"" thing is an argument made by the ignorant, for the ignorant.<p>The vast majority of Lisp macros don't create new syntax anyway. They integrate seamlessly into the s-expression format. That way they blend in nicely with the rest of a program and it's easy to write other macros on top of them. An experienced Lisp programmer would only introduce new syntax when there is a big win in clarity - big enough to justify breaking with the surrounding structure and certainly big enough to make the above objection pointless.<p>By the way, one of the <i>real</i> problems with Lisp macros is that it can be hard to tell a macro call apart from a function call. (Various techniques have been developed to deal with this, such as indentation and naming conventions.) If macros were so syntactically convoluting this would hardly be an issue.",1243568740

At some point you have to ask if the tail is wagging the dog.<p>You could fit most universities' endowments in the interest payments Harvard gets from the fixed income allocation of their endowment alone.  Don't take my word for that: look at the list of universities in the US with gigantic endowments:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._colleges_and_universities_by_endowment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._colleges_and_unive...</a><p><i>Harvard does not exist to provide a financial return to its investors.</i><p>It really does -- Harvard is the sole investor in Harvard, and Harvard went for aggressive growth and a 15% CAGR.  (The article talks about a multi-billion interest rate swap which had a speculative payoff in the billions.)  The typical behavior of endowments is ""We're going to husband this carefully and spend about 4 or 5% a year to supplement our other sources of income.""<p><i>Harvard is known for their educational merits, not their endowment.</i><p>I didn't say their PR arm was ineffective.",1243567482

Recently, they were talking about how strange it is that they need any kind of qualifications to do the thing that they get paid for. They tell undergrads that the demand curve slopes down & the supply curve slopes the other way. That knowledge is freely available and easily accessible. Yet their students bid up the price of the best academics to tell them this.<p>A better professor's demand curve slopes the same as a crappier one's.

631463,comment,631048,631254,0,0,drawkbox,,,"Actually I live in Chandler, went to ASU as a graduate.  I like what ASU is doing to urbanize Tempe and even Phoenix downtown.  It is growing too big probably but it does drive lots of technology. The engineering 'brickyard' at ASU right there in a highly trafficked part of town is a good message to send to people. The ASU Research Park for instance has many high-tech companies there and it is also a park for people to come to and play. This is similar to what Intel does around their locations in Chandler, AZ.<p>Anyways, as long as it doesn't harm the educational experience then it may actually help the area as a whole.  I feel I got what I needed out of my education but that is really up to the student in the end.<p>Also, on the sports teams, most of the time this funds a large part of the school so in the end it is a necessary evil.  Much like how defense brings the most innovative technologies, even this here internet.<p>I agree that schools need to focus on quality education experiences and get better professors. I think that the internet and universities that open up to that can share the best professors with the world.<p>We will see an enormous change in this regard in our lifetime, the University as we know it will be much different. It has taken some time, but the internet and cost reducing measures to information and education are shaking harder at the pillars of these college institutions.",1243567245

We musn't cut spending on education!""<p>This logic is running rampant right now and is a major player not in the economic collapse, but our inability to convince our governments to deal with economic collapse. When the answer to ""Are we spending enough on education?"" is simply hard-coded to ""No"", you get very stupid budget behaviors.<p>In point of fact, there must be a point where we are spending enough on education, enough on police, enough on health care, enough on welfare, enough on anything. There must even come a point where we are spending enough on educating the disadvantaged, enough on health care for the elderly, enough on programs for poor children.
