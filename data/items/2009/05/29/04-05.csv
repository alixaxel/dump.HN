631558,comment,631251,631537,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Unless I'm completely mistaken, the capital commitments refers to investments the Harvard endowment is making in <i>other</i> funds, not investments being made in its own fund.  For example, when a VC firm raises a new fund, they don't take delivery of the entire amount of the fund, they just get commitments that the funds will be available from investors (like Harvard, in this case) when needed.  It's not unreasonable for an endowment fund with tens of billions of dollars to commit roughly $1.1 billion per year to various investments over the coming decade.<p>As far as paying bonuses of tens of millions of dollars to the managers of the endowment, Harvard has to compete for qualified managers, too.  If they offered $250k or whatever the professors get paid, it's doubtful that they'd get any qualified applicants.<p>(And yes, I'm aware that the guy they hired apparently wasn't qualified either, but that's not the point.)",1243572542
631557,comment,631399,631544,0,0,Shooter,,,"My original, long-winded answer:<p>I think much of the answer is historical, but part of the answer is also cultural (and these two factors intertwine and reinforce each other.)<p>Historically, Chicago technology startups have tended to be more industrial and/or infrastructure focused than the startups in other hubs.  There isn't a major,'exciting' Yahoo or Google-type company headquartered here that gets lots of press and that will buy a non-profitable startup from you.  Instead, there is Motorola and companies like that.  There simply isn't the strong history of computer-oriented VC firms in Chicago like there is in Boston and SV.  Part of that is just historial anomaly (owing to Stanford and Shockley, etc)...but the ripples in SV and Boston turned into waves because people nurtured them.  Some places needed technology to become a major industrial base, so their economy and education system rewarded technology research and technology startups.  That is not the case in places like New York or Chicago, which have plenty of other industries to keep all the yachts afloat.  Of course, once an area builds the infrastructure and the talent pool, it tends to just feed on itself and amplify, making it difficult for other places to catch up.<p>Culturally, Chicago is a fairly pragmatic city...there isn't as much of an interest in the flashier, consumer-focused startups as there is in Silicon Valley.  The ""IPO or Flip or Die"" strategy is much more prevalent in the Valley or Boston, whereas internet companies in Chicago tend to be more interested in slow, organic, <i>profitable</i> growth.  Investors in Chicago are more risk-averse and are not likely to invest in something that just wants to aggregate eyeballs and figure out a business model later.  The downside of that conservative approach is that you will miss out on companies like Google.  And you will miss out on fame and excitement.  The upside is that you are more likely, statistically, to end up with a stable and profitable company.",1243572514

631555,comment,631048,631048,0,0,lvecsey,,,"I'm always surprised when people suggest ""community college"", as opposed to an elite university, for the masses to flock to. I don't mind if people take on vocational tasks like welding, and as Mike Rowe of dirty jobs explained at his TED talk society definitely has a problem with imbuing meaning towards regular tasks. But all too often I hear that snide remark, which translates to: ""Not everyone can excel towards, or afford, an elite education with all the debt and opportunity it offers. But get yourself to a community college and do something basic, to get your portion of the pie. Otherwise you are nothing.""",1243572456
631554,comment,631399,631399,0,0,Shooter,,,"I run a private equity fund in Chicago that invests exclusively in internet and financial-services startups.  As far as I know, we're far bigger than any firm in Boulder, and our AUM exceed most of the Sand Hill Road firms.  But we're boring and low-key.  There are several other VC and angel funds in the area that invest in internet companies, and they tend to be the same -- boring and low-key.  Basically, we all require a business model.  A 'boring' and profitable business is better than a business that is 'slick and quick.' I would personally rather cash checks than be written about in TechCrunch.  I'm more likely to invest in a SaaS company that manages the back-office networks of pension administrators than in a company that aggregates social network profiles, for example.<p>The fact that the Chicago VC/angel establishment is not constantly funding Google takeover targets (or on TechCrunch all the time) doesn't mean we don't exist...it just means we work differently.  We're definitely much smaller than the Boston and SF contingent, but we're here if you look.",1243572435
631553,comment,631012,631114,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"""Django really likes to constrain users here - not even letting them use a full ""if"" statement.""<p>Yes, but as you've noted it's for a good reason. This is really one of the few places where Django gets opinionated by default, and personally I'm OK with that; keeping people off the slippery slope of ""well, I <i>should</i> write this in a cleaner way, but for now I'll just stuff some application logic in the template and fix it later"" is a goal I can get behind.<p>""The author suggests that you can use models from different applications in Django. That sounds cooler than it is. They're all running off the same database and in the same project.""<p>Not really. I can have multiple different Django ""projects"", each running its own settings, its own database, its own URL configuration, its own templates, etc., but all using the same single copy of an application module somewhere on the server. Last I checked this was non-trivial to do in Rails, while in Django it's made very easy since it's a common use case, and encourages neatly abstracting/encapsulating common pieces of functionality for reuse.<p>""The Django folk say that it takes very little time to write routes (true) and that one should be thoughtful when making URLs (also true). But sometimes it just feels tedious. Really, it's just a matter of preference.""<p>Personally, I tend to view this more as a security concern than a programmer-convenience concern; if my framework is auto-mapping URLs to any code it can find, it may auto-map some things that I didn't want to expose (this was the source of an exploitable vulnerability in Rails a while back, as you may remember). If the framework only handles the URLs I tell it to handle, I don't get that situation.<p>Mostly, though, I like Django because it (and Python) fits my brain.",1243572426

I am truly learning a great deal, but that is not what I am paying for.  All of the information in the classes I am taking is readily available for free or extremely cheap.<p>From my perspective I am paying for 3 things:\n1. A ready made (albiet small) community of other math grad students that can answer my questions when I don't understand some of the freely available information.\n2. A highly educated professor that can provide further explanation and advice if my peer group of math grad students can't explain it well enough to me.\n3. (arguably most important) A respected institution prepared to certify to prospective employers that I really have gained gained those skills.<p>The knowledge is free, you can get #1 on your own with a little work and a little luck, but #2 is hard to get without being an actual student and #3 is is very hard to get without the institution.<p>And before people say you don't need #3, it helps you get interviews if not necessarily jobs.  I have been that hiring manager that has to weed through dozens of resumes to determine who I am going to spend my time interviewing.  A degree was certainly a good discriminator for who was worth my time.  I certainly didn't require it and I interviewed people who had experience but no degree, but they had to have something else on their resume to show me it was worth my time.<p>I worked for a small company, when dealing with middle management (or worse, HR) at a big company, they really want to be able to cover themselves and show why they hired someone on paper.  To many of them being able to justify the decision is more important then actually getting the best person.  The degree makes it alot easier for them to do that.<p>If you plan to start your own company, a degree is meaningless of course, but even Paul Graham says that path should be approached with great caution if you are married with children.",1243569945
