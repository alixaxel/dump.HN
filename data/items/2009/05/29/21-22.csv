I do strongly support our President but I do feel a discomfort over owning 75% of GM.<p>On one hand, we've seen this before with Conrail. Huge success. And even with Chrysler 30 years ago.  On the other, if the company can't turn around, when does a politician decide that, despite sunk cost, we need to abandon support and liquidate.<p>My reason for posting, though, is I think the way you're casting the auto business is way off mark.<p>A full 10% of our GDP is tied to the auto industry thru the huge amounts of suppliers. If GM and Chrysler were ""let go"" as you put it, the world wouldn't see anything but a massive depression for a good long period.<p>Furthermore, nearly every significant supplier (say, over $10MM in annual sales) is supplying at least a couple automakers if not most of them. They've all pushed hard to diversify. And most of them are in peril after 3-5 years of tough times at the ""Big 3.""  If Chrysler and GM are let to fail, huge swaths will go under, and Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc, will no longer be able to get the parts they need. That could very well be the economic ""stiff breeze"" needed to blow over a few of the remaining global automakers that are themselves teetering.<p>And even after we pull out of that mess, I find it unlikely we'll see any 'startups' in the auto biz. It's just got too many working parts. Product development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and service are all multi-multi-million dollar problems.<p>Finally, the ""last century blue collar jobs"" you mention is pretty far off base as well. If you're talking unskilled labor, then you mean simple assembly tasks. But a lot of the simple assembly has been automated. But I'll grant you that by and large, assembly is ""last century blue collar."" Thing is, most of the workers (by far) aren't doing assembly. And it's not just the ""car designers"" either, which are really quite a small bunch.<p>What you're missing is the huge middle. The machinists and fabricators. People programming CNC machines. People fixing those same machines.<p>And you're missing the huge corporate structures. The AR and AP clerks, the IT staffs, the sales and marketing. The HUGE numbers of engineers designing each hinge, each screw, each spring.<p>This industry is vital to our nations economy. No question about it. The Midwest would be ground zero, but the depression would spread globally.",1243634171

I think you mean influence on the press.<p>To understand how to do without connections, it's probably helpful to understand what value connections have.  The point of connections is authentication.  If I recommend a startup to a reporter or an investor, they know I have to tell the truth, because if I start to be a source of bum leads they'll stop listening to me.<p>The value of authentication is that it makes judging you easier.  If you come highly recommended, a reporter or investor will at least talk to you.  (The joke is that the YC name can get you rejected by any VC in the valley.)  If you don't, they have to judge you for themselves, and that's hard, because they get tons of inbound requests and  don't usually have technical backgrounds.<p>There are two possible solutions: (1) get authentication by some other means than personal recommendations, and (2) get publicity through venues that don't require so much authentication.<p>The best strategy for (1) is to get lots of users.  If your traffic graph (or better still, revenue graph) is going up sharply, reporters and investors will pay attention to you.  In effect, users are recommending you.<p>You may say: how can we get lots of users without publicity?  The same way Facebook did: make something so good that users tell one another about it.  When you have exponential growth, you can start with a very small seed-- just your friends and friends' friends-- and you'll still win.<p>A good example of (2) is to talk about your startup on venues like HN, where many readers understand technology well and are capable of judging whether something is good or not without any external seal of approval.  Being on HN is not the same kind of traffic boost as TechCrunch, obviously, but it's a start.  Literally, sometimes: sometimes TC gets leads here.",1243634058

The fact that it's so common indicates it hasn't been publicized well enough, especially for crypto implementers.<p>My recommendation to use libraries is so all engineers can benefit from the review. The more crypto libraries there are, the less reviewed each is. I get all twitchy when I see how many different single sign-on and cookie verification libraries there are out there.

When something is written, people either use it and customize it over time, or they just find something else and say it didn't suit their needs.<p>It's when an extremely useful/general library is PROPOSED that it becomes a huge disagreement. This is, for instance, why C++'s Boost still doesn't have logging or a unified XML library, and won't likely have a garbage collection library before a C++ TR defines the interface: everyone argues over the color of the bikeshed, and the people who try to write the libraries get caught up in infinite microdiscussions over details.<p>Conversely, someone like Linus Torvald's success is that he just makes the things he needs/wants (ignoring bikeshed discussions), and people generally end up using his creations.
