The post-exercise calorie bonus for this type of exercise probably accounts for only about 10-30 additional calories burned beyond the exercise bout itself.<p>20 calories.<p>In practice, exercise also makes you hungrier. It is far from clear that it's even a net win for weight loss at all, when you look at studies and data.",1242327599

Whether his dislike of Stallman is justified is another question, but that's my point:  he doesn't bother justifying it.  His only concrete criticism of Stallman is his claim that AT&T never threatened to sue anyone over the patent.  His writing manages to drip with disdain without making any other concrete claim:<p>""hippie pipe dream""<p>""promiscuous computing""<p>""harangue""<p>""I always thought only boring people went to Heaven.""<p>""characteristic inaccuracies"" (here referring to the idea that AT&T ever threatened to sue)<p>""bizarre form of political correctness""<p>""eager misguided nerds who in a healthier environment would probably be protesting the killing of rats in biology class""<p>If he had come right out and said Stallman was an attention-whoring fool whose ideas were incoherent religious baloney, we'd expect him to back it up.  So why should we accept him using indirect language to say the same thing?  I realize he was posting something he wrote fifteen years earlier, but he didn't say anything to disown or apologize for his intemperate language.",1242327350

You probably don't want pages in your history to be downloading data, playing video, etc.  Ideally, you'd probably want it to start playing right where you <i>left</i> it when you click back.<p>What about if the thing in my history is a 1gb video file, and I type ""gmail.com"" in the address bar.  I have Firefox set to remember my state between sessions, and I rarely close my gmail tab.  So, that video file might stay in my back-button history for months.  Is it reasonable to expect it to freeze the video player's state and keep hold of that forever, every time the browser starts up?

We don't think people have an absolute obligation to always make the morally optimal choice.<p>As an ideologue and a moral gadfly, Stallman is less compromising than most.  That's central to his role and value to the community.  And it makes him annoying.  Pike's statement was trying to swing sympathy from Stallman to him by pointing out that he (Rob Pike) is like us -- more compromising -- and Stallman is a purist who doesn't cut us the kind of slack we're accustomed to allowing ourselves.<p>Which does give me sympathy for him.
