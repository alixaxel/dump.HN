If it's something long or that I can read later, it goes into the starred bin.<p>What's wound up happening is that I have (I think - Google doesn't give an exact count) several thousand starred items in that list that I have yet to read through. I used to feel pressured about this, but I've recently stopped worrying about it. If there's something important I want to come back to later, I can search through it, and if I didn't read it, obviously it can't have been <i>that</i> important.",1241297663

I never hit anything but the all-items feed and I'm pretty strict about leaving zero unread before I navigate away so I can't just pop in for a quick read unless I've got at least 15 minutes to kill.

590198,comment,590135,590135,0,0,doosra,,,"The author says ""instead of scouring the Web for interesting stories, everything came to me!""<p>I believe the author is confusing the presentation of content with the filtering.  The author went from using a browser, to an RSS reader, back to a browser.  What remains unsolved is the problem of filtering uninteresting stories.<p>The real reason his new solution works is because he's manually filtered stories.  But this approach doesn't scale with the number of websites that are being tracked.<p>What remains unsolved is an algorithm to find stories that are interesting to the author.",1241296501
590197,comment,590135,590135,0,0,rufo,,,"This system is the entire reason I switched to RSS (first with NetNewsWire, now Google Reader) in the first place. I found myself wasting an <i>incredible</i> amount of time just reloading a website to see if anything's new, processing the page, trying to figure out which articles I might have already read, etc.<p>Now, in Google Reader, I typically use the ""all items"" feed and blast through the list, only looking at the headlines. If something interests me, I'll either hit ""s"" to star it (meaning read later, not now), read it inline (if it's a full-text feed) or middle-click it to put it in a tab and read as soon as I'm done scanning.<p>If there's under 100 items, it probably only takes me about 5 minutes to go through them. If there are more, I'll typically load up the most post-heavy blogs (which I keep in a folder) and speed through them, then switch over to all feeds and read through them.<p>My only problem with my current system is that I check Google Reader <i>way</i> more often than I should - but I'm generally fairly happy with how I do it.",1241296358
590196,comment,590135,590135,0,0,carbon8,,,"Really, this isn't a hard concept to grasp: RSS is not email. You don't need to read everything. You don't need to feel overwhelmed. You don't need to feel guilty. What an RSS reader allows you to do is have a central location to categorize and read updates from all the sites you want to follow, and you get the added benefit of knowing what you've already seen. So what if you have 10000+ unread items across all feeds in your aggregator?",1241296352

It's still possible to brute force the database, of course, but the time required makes the attack less profitable.<p>I would thus argue that a secure hashing schema is significantly better. This is assuming the programmer uses bcrypt in the first place, which is a questionable assumption: even popular projects like phpBB use MD5 for password hashing.

If chemical X occurs naturally at varying concentrations one can interpret poor health in areas of low concentration as suggesting that it is an essential mineral and that a little should be added where the naturally occuring concentration is low.<p>Conversely, if high concentrations are linked with poor health that suggests it is toxic and water treatment in areas with high concentrations should seek to remove some of it.<p>If however the concentration in question does not already occur naturally in water drunk by large populations, you lack the vital data on the consequences of low-level, life time exposure.

And as mentioned, you don't know which were the ones that ""got away"" -- founders that went back to school because they didn't get in, but would have been even larger successes.  Reddit would have been in that group if you hadn't had a last-minute change of heart.<p>As for the relentless founders, was it really that difficult to recognize that Sam Altman was one of those people?  For the obvious cases, it's apparent to all four of you; and for the less-obvious cases, you lack the data to know how many were false negatives.  All you know is the false positives; but that's going to be the most common outcome anyway.<p>Being ramen profitable working on something you don't especially like is silly compared to what you COULD be making at jobs in the Bay Area.  A website is not a startup, and most of them lack any major potential, barring irrational market exuberance.<p>Considering Yahoo! Paid 6 billion for Broadcast.com and 4 billion for Geocities shortly after paying 95 million for ViaWeb just shows the most important skill is finding someone with billions of dollars and talking them into throwing it away on your unprofitable business.",1241295000

A department member (but not a tenure-track professor) with a PhD who primarily taught calculus courses was fired.  By all accounts, he was a good teacher and required much of his students.  However, I recall that the professors' union was opposed to allowing non-faculty to teach because it was a slippery slope toward faculty elimination.
