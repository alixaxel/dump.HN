They invented the thing so they are experts in it, and have a big head start over everyone else with things like the Spelly and Rosy robots, and likely a more scalable infrastructure than the reference implementation they plan to open source.

There are other car companies these suppliers can sell to. Of course there will be disruption, and probably some job losses, but not the whole 2-million-person industry (to use the industry number). And if some of those jobs do disappear, maybe it's because demand for the product no longer supports them.<p>I know my perspective is different on this, because I'm 25, and honestly cannot fathom a lifetime with one company. My career will be a couple years here and there, and most likely I'll have more than one career as well. So it is alien to me that anyone wants to protect (or even prefers) this idea of having a single job, at a single employer, for life. Why is it so terrible that someone might have to find a new job or that a town might die out?<p>That said, I'm not unfeeling about this issue. I realize these are real lives here (my dad is a GM retiree). What I don't understand is why we are bailing out the <i>company</i>, and not the workers.<p>I'd rather we spent the money on retraining the employees, hopefully giving them skills in an industry that isn't slowly dying. And this generalizes to all those losing their jobs, no matter the industry.
