Sure, we can have a long debate about whether the Pirate Bay is legal or not under different interpretations of the law, but I think it's reasonable to say that such a site is of questionable legality if for no other reason than it being a somewhat new phenomenon that, until the recent case, really hadn't seen a lot of law spelling out exactly what was and wasn't ok.<p>NFS hasn't been at the center of any big controversy and they're more motivated by ideals than by profits.

It can help you keep your private life private should people not like what you're doing, but you're perfectly entitled to do it.  However, if you're doing something like the Pirate Bay, you're likely to be named, even if found innocent.

Competence never entered the picture; even when I would ask about it, I was always told ""it's not what you know, it's who you know,"" as if to reassure themselves as much as to admonish me. In some cases, the recommendations are truly noble-minded, but never underestimate the social pressure people have to practice nepotism.<p>I will caveat this by saying I've been hired in one or two places where the recruitment tango started through a recommendation. One of those places, it stopped mattering as soon as the phone screen began. The other, well, the person who recommended me was the hiring manager, so I'm not sure that counts. :-)",1244588557

I'm not sure of the details, but I assume you can disable warning for regions of code like you can in C#. So when you know you did things right, you can tell the compiler (and other coders that follow you) you know what you are doing. If you didn't do things right then the compiler reminds you to check things out. It's a win in both situations.",1244588438
