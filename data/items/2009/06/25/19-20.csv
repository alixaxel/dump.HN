Comparisons are made mostly to help folks understand the differences not to argue superiority. One argument is that a schema-less approach solves the issue of dealing with schema evolution. Having worked with O-R mapping issues for years as well as OODBs and persistent heaps and so forth I think document databases provide a fresh look. The technology choices of JSON over HTTP, Javascript and Erlang all the way down are also very compelling. It strikes me as just good timing. YMMV",1245959818

That's not to say that a formal education is bad -- it will just never be a substitute for real personal motivation.  If you have the motivation it takes to start learning a subject on your own, then I don't see any reason not to use every vector available to you to increase your knowledge, including college.<p>So, I don't think that a formal education is the biggest factor in one's ability to pursue interesting projects.  However, there are some cases where a college degree could come in handy.  At least in the initial stages of pursuing your dream you'll probably need a day job.  Unfortunately, many employers dismiss out of hand resumes that do not meet their education requirements.  Granted that employers that do so are probably not the best to work for, but sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do to pay the rent.",1245959327

The bed has a lid that closes over top (think coffin but roomier inside).<p>2.  Bed has temperature control system to vent air and adjust to sleeping preferences.<p>3.  Bed mattress has cooling pipes to control mattress temperatures.<p>4.  Lot of control systems to monitor air temperature, mattress temperature and body temperature and keeps them all in check.<p>5.  Integrated lighting in the dome of the bed is used for waking and mood setting<p>6.  Bed sits on motorized incline to help with morning assist routines<p>The fun with this projects comes in setting up the control system for optimal sleep cycles.  With the variable being temperature (air and mattress), light, sound, and bed angle.<p>Any takers?<p>Edit: additional note is this could be considered a ""green"" bed because it has a self contain heating/cooling system which is more efficient than heating/cooling your entire house.

674261,comment,672582,673091,0,0,gruseom,,,"I've been reading various things about Naggum that have appeared in the last few days. It's changed my view of him. For example, I wouldn't write ""consummate intellectual bully"" to describe him anymore. He was more subtle than that (though his language was not) and had a kind of integrity that bullies don't. I hadn't read enough of him to grok this, but recent posts by his intelligent admirers caused me to take a deeper look. Truly a fascinating character.<p>Online communication is a limited medium that is prone to feedback loops of escalating misunderstanding. It's easy to slip into thinking that one is talking to a computer rather than another human being because, in a way, one is. At that point, why bother with anything other than the intellectual satisfaction of formulating what you have to say in the sharpest, most absolute way possible? Many of us are prone to this. Naggum took it to an extreme. I still think there's something to criticize here, but perhaps not in terms like nasty, cruel, etc. It has more to do with dissociation (as when the cognitive apparatus becomes disconnected from emotional or other information). Which is another something many of us are prone to.<p>One other point about Erik Naggum that deserves a little more attention than it's gotten: during much of the time he was writing this stuff he was suffering physically pretty badly.

It is somewhat dated, and the arguments weren't very convincing, in fact they struck me as typical marketing FUD.<p>Sure the Postgres folks have years of experience and so forth but it's not like the literature is not available to be incorporated in new approaches. CouchDB hits a certain sweet spot in combining a few new ideas together and the folks hacking it are some of the best.

But you can't compare every phone to smartphones. A lowly Nokia 1100 costs less than $30. But it's your basic mobile phone. You won't find people doing a lot of browsing from it.<p>But if you don't like the terms of deployment you are free to develop for other platforms. Usually, someone will come along and brag about how they won't develop their application for the iphone. But there are thousands of others that put up with it everyday. The fact is Apple took a page out of the microsoft playbook. They got the developers to invest early which brings users, which attracts more developers. Compared to the price to get a person with brains 99$ is just the price of doing business. Paying full price for an iPhone to test in is also the price of doing business.<p>But I've met a few Indian developers working on the iPhone. They need them to do their job so someone is buying them. Even if it is only a few Indian iphone developers.<p>What the $99/299 price is a small barrier to entry. It's like Apple is saying we want only serious developers submitting stuff to the Apple store. The world is full of good ideas but littered with half completed projects. This is one way of getting through the noise. And if $99 is too much for you then you weren't serious about it to begin with.",1245956676
