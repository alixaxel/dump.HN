And that could be done by telecommuting if I were willing to search for that kind of job.<p>My house is built on the east side of a hill. If I were starting from scratch, I'd seriously consider building it <i>into</i> the hill. With solar heating and all the windows on that side -- that's where most of them are now anyway -- and the rest of the house underground. In the summer, my walk-out basement is cooler than the air-conditioned main floor and Minnesota has about the same level of solar insolation as Austin, TX so we have more than enough sun to do it.<p>I like this guy's house and there really shouldn't be any reason it couldn't be built in the average suburban subdivision except for idiotic zoning laws and even more stupid Homeowner's Associations: how people can live in those things is beyond me!",1245963483

Does anyone make a cell phone with the same size screen as the iphone that's significantly smaller?<p>Re: Screen - While I've read that the iPhone is a magnet for screen cracks, I'll note that I've carried three generations in the same pocket as my keys, am clumsy as heck, and haven't managed to damage my screen yet.  Very nice optical glass covering.<p>Re: Battery - Yeah, a $10 Replaceable battery would be nice.  One (major) suckage about the iPhone.  I carry a couple extra TruePower batteries for my iPhone.  For $80 It both powers as well as charges the internal battery.  I can go on a trip for a week without an external charger, and play games, watch movies, listen to music, etc...  But they are big, bulky and expensive.  Thumbs down on the iPhone on this one.<p>With all that said, the iPhone is not overhyped, it really is a pretty amazing/revolutionary system.  I've had 3 generations of Treos, and honestly - the iPhone is almost a different _class_ of hardware, it was so different.    A not uncommon scene when hanging out with friends is for us to all kick back with our favorite iPhone Games, Apps, Movies and just sit back for three hours with them.<p>Ironically - on a feature-by-feature comparison, the iPhone actually doesn't compare with a fairly large number of devices, but the Application experience is incomparable.    Kindle, Eucalyptus, iPod, Camera, Clock (Stopwatch, alarm), Google Maps, Photo Roll, ZombieVille, GoogleEarth, WhiteNoise, iTunes, AppStores, WorldWar, SitckWars, FlightControl, Warfare Inc, are all Apps/Games I use (out of around 80 installed) _every day_ - I don't recall ever interacting with my Laptop with such a diversity of applications on a constant basis.<p>I've got a couple _seasons_ of TV Episodes (seamlessly) synced from iTunes, and I do the majority of my TV watching on my iPhone now.  Don't even bother with the Laptop Screen most of the time.  It's been at least seven years that I've actually turned on a television.",1245963450

You won't find people doing a lot of browsing from it.""<p>Correct but the point is moot because the IPhone doesn't have even one percent of the <i>smartphone</i> market in India(mostly Nokia, with Blackberry second with assorted others third. IPhone is nowhere in sight. The IPhone was a <i>collosal</i> failure here and likely to stay that way.).<p>(EDIT: Some rough numbers: Total number of cellphones sold in India annually = About 130 million. Number of <i>smartphones</i> sold in India annually =6-8 million. Number of Iphones sold in India  so far = about 9,000.  The math is ... interesting)<p>""What the $99/299 price is a small barrier to entry. It's like Apple is saying we want only serious developers submitting stuff to the Apple store. The world is full of good ideas but littered with half completed projects. This is one way of getting through the noise. And if $99 is too much for you then you weren't serious about it to begin with.""<p>This is different from what you said earlier. First, you said.<p>""Development is free. It only costs you when you go to submit it to the store.""<p>As you rightly point out in your next post, this is simply not true. You have to pay at least 99$ to develop an app and deploy it on your Iphone to test it. (unless you are claiming that ""deployment"" on a phone to test it is somehow outside ""development"").<p>Now you are saying you have to pay Apple to prove your seriousness. This is a different proposition from """"Development is free"".<p>$ 99/299 to develop for the IPhone can be interpreted in many ways but ""free"" is not a valid interpretation. Hence my response to your claim that IPhone dev is free.<p>"" It's like Apple is saying we want only serious developers submitting stuff to the Apple store. ""<p>No it is not. In that case Apple should charge 99$ the first time anyone tries to sell a product in the Apple Store. By charging the money to allow a developer to deploy an app on his own phone, Apple is saying <i>developing</i> for the IPhone is some kind of privilege one has to pay for.<p>I for one will <i>never</i> develop for the IPhone where I have to pay to develop for  <i>my own</i> phone, but that is a purely personal decision and certainly not ""bragging"" as you claim.

In fact, those dreams were some of the best and most vivid dreams I've ever had, presumably because you're never more than 20 minutes away from consciousness, so you remember the dreams clearly, and the dreams are strongly correlated to your mental state going into the nap.<p>Everyone should try the polyphasic experience for at least a few months of one's life.
