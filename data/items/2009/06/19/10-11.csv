664928,comment,664815,664870,0,0,trif,,,"The idea that an indie game programmer shouldn't be doing their own marketing is at the heart of your argument against entering the market. If developers aren't willing to make that leap, they are not approaching games as professional artists, but as hobbyists. If you want to make money, you have to let marketing lead a lot of design decisions. There's still TONS of room to be creative given that one constraint.<p>The act of advertising the game is mainly a matter of getting it posted and reviewed online in places where your audience is most likely to look: If you're doing a niche, indie type of game, that doesn't mean catch-all portal sites. It means enthusiast communities. Most of the time it's just a matter of emailing whoever is in charge and having a few materials ready(screenshots, video). If the game is good it'll get a link. Multiply those links against every little blog you can find and you can gradually garner some support, even if the game is ultra-niche.<p>Pricing of the game-as-product is also an overly constrained way to consider monetization. It's hard to sell games because games generally don't sell themselves until you've spent hours playing them. So your two main options are to quickly grab the cash of the unsuspecting, or to build the rabid support of a few and give them ample opportunity to further buy in to your vision. And both of those two strategies can be taken far beyond just selling the game itself.<p>The real problem is making the game. It's easy to get lost in the multitude of challenges game development presents. If your motivations are poor, then there is absolutely no hope for the end result being any good. Jeff Vogel complains that it's hard enough for him as it is. But if you look at the games he makes, they're workmanlike and nearly interchangeable at first glance. They've definitely become more sophisticated over time, but <i>not</i> in ways that would help to grow his fanbase, build a brand name, or attract renewed attention.<p>You're wrong when you say ""you're not building a brand."" You most certainly are - you can build a brand around the type of games you make, the IPs within the game, the style of development you practice. Successful indies have a lot of style, even when they lack for production values. Nintendo is the king of game branding simply because they were the first - and one of a very few - to realize the importance of making their entire product line work as an ""ecosystem"" of high-quality brands and genres.<p>You're also wrong on there being no ability to iterate in making games. That is in fact the biggest advantage of indie/online development vs. retail: you can make dramatic changes and improvements via updates, add-ons and sequels, without spending a lot of money to push out a new SKU. Updates with ""pre-registration"" discounts are how the development of Mount & Blade was funded, for example. And the top retail developers have funds to effectively build the game two or three times in ""reboot"" iterations before releasing anything.<p>Essentially, what it comes down to is: looking at games as a product business will make the financials look bad. Looking at them as an attention+branding business, with a subsidiary monetization process, makes them look a lot better.<p>Even within the mainstream industry, a huge number of companies don't understand this, and coast project-to-project, with very little focus on tech reuse, design iteration, or brand development, and ultimately see nothing for their efforts. As well, most developers that do understand this are too undercapitalized to ever get a foothold. Game developers need a lot of runway - not to get great production values, but to have the time to iterate and build up their brand.",1245409143

Here's a quote from the book linked to above<p>"" ... In The Plan-as-You-Go Business Plan, Tim Berry makes these points much more eloquently than I ever could. Tim argues that the planning process (along with regular reviews) is so important that business owners just need to get started somewhere, anywhere, and continue to build your plan as your needs change. This is 180 degrees different from the classical ""big bang"" approach to business planning where we work for months at a time developing a huge document before we ever get started working on the business.""",1245408966
664922,comment,664815,664815,0,0,aaron_vernon,,,"In my opinion there are really two types of indie games, the dime a dozen shovel-ware games sold cheaply in portals and the art-like, experimental and edgy ones. I think the key is for the latter to avoid competing with the former.<p>This type of distinction is made all the time in different areas of life. Gourmet food targets a different market segment than take away food, they do not compete directly against each other and as such they are priced independently.<p>If indie developers make a game that is trying to take a new direction and has some depth then they should be bold and market/price the game accordingly. What is great about our current environment is that the barriers for developers releasing and marketing their own games are much lower. There seems to be a real shortage of original games and thus good independent games tend to stand out. Braid is of course the pinnacle example of this but there have been others recently.<p>As with all kinds of development you really need to find and target the right market. If you do that then you don't have to compete on price with the 'casual' games where it is very hit and miss. If your game is a delicacy, a fine wine, then I think you should not hesitate to price it as such. Of course the upper limit to pricing is the price of AAA titles.<p>Jeff has really succeeded in finding the right under-serviced niche and focusing his efforts on it. I really enjoy his blog posts and he has actually been part of the motivation behind my decision to quit my job and start an independent game development studio instead (I do have games industry experience before you think that I am completely crazy!).<p>I really hope that the indie scenes continues to grow, strengthen and keeps taking those risks that the big guys are too scared of taking, especially in the current economic climate. In order for this to happen though, they really have to make sure that they don't price themselves out of existence.",1245408909

664919,comment,664815,664870,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There's another issue that folks rarely talk about (or maybe even understand): Game development is a ""fun job"".  Fun jobs have tremendously more people doing them than the market will profitably support.<p>Like being an actor or a musician or an artist is the fantasy of coffee shop employees the world over, making games is the job a lot of nerds <i>want</i> to be doing.  In fact, so many people want to be doing it so badly that they'll do it even if they don't get paid (much) for doing it.  Thus, you don't find a lot of people getting rich doing community theater or playing in a garage band, but you do find thousands of people doing it, anyway.  Fun jobs only pay the bills for a small number of the most successful practitioners of the craft...and often they are so successful by virtue of skills other than the craft itself.<p>On the other hand, building your bingo card software would not be a ""fun job"" for the majority of software developers.  Building enterprise software is not a ""fun job"" for most software developers.  Building systems management software is not a ""fun job"".  At least, not for enough people that there are thousands of new products entering the market every month competing for the attention of the available buyers.<p>Add this to all the other issues you've mentioned, and it adds up to games being a lot like hopping on the bus for Hollywood.  You're probably not going to be a star, and the industry will still have a hundred more just like you to chew up tomorrow.  Of course, most of us aren't exactly destitute.  If any of the folks here make a game and it fails (I've started building a brain games company in my spare time, so I've voluntarily entered this market, knowing enough to know that the odds of it being profitable are astronomically against; so I'm one of those folks), we'll still be working on other stuff and making a good living doing jobs that are not ""fun"", by most folks definition.  I only spend a couple hours a week on my games-related stuff, and 10-12 hours per day on my real company.",1245408655
