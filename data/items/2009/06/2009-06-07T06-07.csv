645690,comment,645478,645545,0,0,alex_c,,,"<i>it's left leaning government expenditure programs. [...] Commie mentality. It's the blend of this socialist and capitalist ideology</i><p>I keep reading similar sentiments, but I don't really understand it.  I believe the tax rate is basically on par with Canada's (so, pretty high).  However, to give two counterexamples, California obviously doesn't have universal health care, and I've never seen as many homeless people as in the Bay area (the weather might have something to do with it).  So what does all that money get spent on, compared to other states which might be more right-leaning or have lower tax rates?",1244357272

Length makes convolution much easier to pull off (How complex can you really make a 1-page constitution?), but it doesn't guarantee it.<p>That said, Texas's may be just as crazy, just in a crazy way that somehow works.

I've lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle for most of my life, and have wanted to move to California, but have not done so precisely because of the high taxes and the dysfunctional politics, which make some sort of disaster seem almost inevitable.
