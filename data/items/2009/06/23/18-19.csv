If you are charging for something that is flat rate, charge ahead of time. Then if they dont pay, they dont get access.

670933,comment,670844,670890,0,0,haidut,,,"Yes, we definitely have clustering. In fact, it's more extensive than simple word distances like cosine b/c we also take into account synonyms and word relationships (set membership, etc). For instance, in our system sentences like ""Tiger chases antilope down the river"" is very closely ""related"" to the sentence ""Lion is pursuing a buffalo by the lake"" b/c both sentences essentially say that a large cat is pursuing a prey of bovine origin near a water source.\nIn terms of the ""most viewed"" and how we control for that - like I said we cross-track news on multiple news sites and weight the cross posted one more often. We also cross-validated the most important tags for an article by using Google Trends data. Basically we tracked topics on multiple sites and then performed some statistical analysis to see how those topics did over time based on their presence on the web (topic momentum and longevity). We also run a partial search engine in house that crawls a subset of the web so we can ensure that the numbers we get from Google/Yahoo are legit. Finally, there is linguistic theory of topic popularity and how memes propagate over time. We use some of that theory to control for the crowd effect - i.e. sometimes people pick up and spread topics that are of no real importance to the world. Example: Paris Hilton's latest escapades may be widely discussed online and appear important news but the latest report on the recession estimates and projections is of much higher ""impact"" to society. So we try to account/estimate some of that ""impact"". Combining all factors gives an article a composite score. No two article really have the same score but a lot of articles cluster close to each other in terms of their ""importance"" cores. We fed the articles in a machine learning algorithm that is a combination of Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Naive Bayes and when a new article is fetched by our crawler the model ""preditc"" its various scores (controversial, engaging, popular) based on the data set that it has already learned. Deception detection is much trickier and is almost entirely analysis based - i.e. no machine learning there. There is quite a bit of research on deception detection published online. Just search google for ""deception detection ext:pdf"" and it will come back with a lot of results.",1245783076

If you have an expertise, or a strongly-typed business niche, your followers can keep up with your periodic announcements relating to your area. Since nothing meaningful can normally be communicated in 140-character chunks, tweets often are just pointers to more meaningful content. This is a non-intrusive way of pinging people for such business ends and works better than Facebook for this purpose.<p>I would guess Gen-Y doesn't yet have as much need for the specialized-use forum as it does for the social aspects of Facebook.

On a similar note, anti-alias your logo and save as a png (with a background if you don't want to alienate the ie6 crowd).<p>- The killer use of this, IMHO, would be the ability to integrate your technology into an already existing block of text hosted elsewhere just by dropping a line of js into the page (like <a href=""http://www.apture.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apture.com/</a>).  I know that's not a tiny feature, but I imagine a lot of bloggers would love to offer this sort of ""live editing feedback"" on their blogs (and might be a paying audience).  Either that, or provide tools to ""publish version to blog"" and have integrations for popular blog software.<p>- More on screen help.  This is really hard, particularly for an interface that requires users change their behavior.  We're so used to looking at text and assuming it's static that we need some tooltips or something that says ""here's how to use _this_ text.""  Maybe something that can be dismissed once a user has seen it (that's what we're doing), but don't rely on your document creator to add directions on how to use revizr in the document directions.  They're already advocating for you by using your tool; don't make their job any harder by making them explain it to people they want to use it with.<p>- ""Tag the new version"" -- tags are cool and useful and keep things organized, but why do I get prompted to tag my version when I advance to a version?

Almost all major sources have sections ""Most viewed"", ""most read"", ""most email"" etc. So as we have been collecting the top ranked news we also kept track of topics that have been top ranked at multiple sources. For instance, if a news article on Iran's riot gets to the top ranked in both NYT and Yahoo News it gets more points in our training set.<p>As far as your other point, Misleading is really a less legally loaded word than ""deceptive"". You are right, it's not very clear why the articles are misleading but the bottom line is that the language used in the article has high ""deception markers"" that other articles from the day. So when you sort by Misleading, it's not really that the article is beyond a doubt deceptive, it's just the ones with higher rate of deception markers (i.e. content and structural indicators associated with deception). The science behind is pretty solid and comes from forensic psychiatry - i.e. interviews/interrogations with criminals and analyzing their statements for deception hints.

I email support with a, ""Uh, wtf guys?"" and they say my CC was declined when they tried to auto-renew (wtf? their crappy backend told me that change that gone through!) and that I had a grace period but didn't renew -- I save all my emails and never got one from them about these domains (I get a ton of email from these guys, but often have noticed that it's sort of random -- some domains will generate an email when they auto-renew, some won't ... but whatever, it had never been a problem before).<p>So now I can't afford to stay with GoDaddy and risk losing a more important domain (like, railsforum.com), so I need to transfer to a more reliable registrar.<p>Two questions: 1. Any suggestions for registrars with competitive pricing, good support, and that don't suck? and 2. Bonus points if it is easy to transfer ~50 domains.

The site is entirely algorithmic but its ranking mechanisms are based on human preferences. Euraeka uses a massive machine learning model trained on the preferences of million of users about what news are worth reading. However, it also includes objective metrics of content quality based on natural language processing. The objective metrics are used to dampen down the propensity of the crowd to get swayed too much over controversial fads. In fact, we can measure controversial topics directly and you can use the sorting mechanism to get Controversial, Engaging or Popular news. One of the most important features of Euraeka is its deception detection mechanism. Again, using natural language processing techniques the site can detect deceptive intent in news articles. We think this feature is something long overdue in the news market - i.e. a barometer of lying essentially. Along the same lines the site can also detect political bias in news (liberal/conservative). Finally, the site also can learn a user's preferences and will recommend news based on those preferences.\nAny feedback on features or user interface will be appreciated.
