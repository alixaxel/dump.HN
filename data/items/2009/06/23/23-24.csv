671362,comment,671291,671291,0,0,bbuffone,,,"""Many websites can become faster with little effort, and collective attention to performance can speed up the entire web...""<p>This is true - I have been working with many over the last 3 years to help them improve web site performance.  Most sites will see a huge performance improvement by just concatenating (bundling) their JavaScript and CSS. Tools like; YUICompressor and www.rockstarapps.com Eclipse tools simplify the process.<p>One issue I have found is that developers always leave performance tuning of all projects to the end.",1245801560

671359,comment,670836,670836,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This is an outstanding idea and distinct from current GoogleDocs or other wiki implementations precisely because it's asymmetric (one owner, many commenter/editors). I think you could enable a business model based on remote copy editing by 3rd party labor where the owner has the ability to accept or reject the changes. I can definitely see this as being offered as an alternative to the basic browser WYSIWYG editor for blog and wiki systems where the user ask for help with final edits or copy editing. I see a lot of potential for this. We did some research a while back for a wiki startup and this supports a mode that some prospects were asking for which wikis today do not support: an individual owns the page and can accept or reject additions/edits. This is different from the wiki model but appropriate for many projects (or as a finishing step where a lot of peer review/development has already taken place in the wiki).",1245801426

I take that as a given in any discussion of recent events. But that fact alone does not mean they will lose their power. Unfortunately, it probably <i>is</i> up to them, since they have most of the power in Iran.<p>In order for the Iranian government to lose its power, it must either relent and cede some power in the hopes of maintaining what some of what they have, or the Iranian people have to revolt.

671340,comment,668381,669441,0,0,jcl,,,"Yes, ALGOL-derived languages contain English words, and chunks of code can be read as English if you imagine the right words being inserted, but the same is true of Scheme code, and to about the same extent.  In fact, it's true of most programming languages.  The languages that it is most true of -- languages like Ada, Cobol, Inform, etc. -- are not notable as good beginners' languages.<p>Here, for example, is typical C code, right out of K&R:<p><pre><code>  for (count = 0; count < MAX; count++)\n    printf(""\narr[%d] = %d."", count, arr[count]);\n</code></pre>\nTo read this in English, you need to fabricate a lot of words, like this: <i>""Repeat</i> for <i>several times, first initializing</i> count <i>to</i> zero, <i>as long as</i> count <i>is less than</i> MAX <i>and, after each step, taking</i> count <i>and adding one to it: call the</i> printf <i>function with the arguments...""</i>.  How is that exercise any worse for the equivalent PLT Scheme code?<p><pre><code>  (for ([count (in-range 0 MAX)])\n    (display (format ""\narr[~a] = ~a."" count (vector-ref arr count))))\n</code></pre>\nAn English translation of C's ""while"" statement is easier; the ""switch"" statement is harder; a C function declaration is nearly impossible without sounding awkward.  Yes, <i>actual</i> ALGOL would be easier translate to English than C, but there are even less people starting with ALGOL than with your hypothetical assembler -- which suggests that the real reason people start with the languages they do is primarily because the languages are popular, not because of the degree of similarity to English.",1245800287

(e.g. a bar - random dropins vs art showing - people interested in art). A general networking event may rate low on this index but a Ruby brigade meetup (shared interests) may be high<p>Continuity - How likely are you to meet these people again? How involved can you get?<p>By this rule, local monthly <i>small</i> entrepreneur, coder, hacker meetups may be a much better use of your time than trying a general purpose networking event. Every time I go to a big networking-type event (where I meet people whose job it is to network), I get reminded that its not really my thing; I really go just to observe how bad/well people can make small talk. It's good practice. If you really want to observe good networkers, go to a political fundraising event (these people are pros, for better or worse).<p>I have met people at networking events - the key thing is you'll know pretty quickly if you hit if off with someone - the whole point of networking (as explained to me by the best networker I know - a woman president of a tech company) is to setup a ""1st date"" to follow-up if you hit it off - you don't go to networking events to have a 20-min conversations with one person but to meet a number of potential people who you might hit it off with for lunch or business.<p>If you go to a networking event and participate, good luck and remember: ""One of the most difficult social tasks is to join an activity that is already in progress."" Basically that means going up to a group of people who are chatting. There are techniques for doing this but theory is cheap, execution counts.",1245799199

These are OK but too one-dimensional.<p>Stephen King, after years at his trade, emphasized basics - master grammar. I would add (with TallGuyShort), master rhetoric. In addition, I threw myself into the study of classical languages (Latin and Greek) in order to master complex sentence constructions, fine points of verbs, etc. Once you learn all that, it is important that you basically throw it away - that is, that you never come across as pedantic.<p>The great example of a light and brilliant style by someone thoroughly grounded in the classics is P.G. Wodehouse. His topics are all fluff. His style is priceless. Fun, light in tone, yet full of subtlety (all drawn from his classical training with words and with literary allusions). Read about how Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, who played Bertie and Jeeves in a BBC series, positively gush over his style (they don't exaggerate).<p>As an autodidact, it would seem you are a natural to throw yourself into this area as well.

Say, survival training, martial arts, extreme sports, etc.<p>This would probably never work in Europe because it would bring back memories of Hitler's youth. I am totally pro-freedom and anti-fascism, but I think that leaving teenage boys bored in the cities and suburbs with nothing to do is dangerous. The amount of money spent on teaching them how to fight, rock-climb, whatever, would perhaps be saved in less prisons and criminality.<p>Giving a teenage boy something challenging to do can be a huge self-confidence booster.
