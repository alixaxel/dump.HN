Maybe ""look and feel"" but even that pushes it. It also requires lawyers, which are well, expensive.<p>Creating a Strong Brand - Requires you to have enough users who like you to use your product and get some buzz. Reduces to building a good product.<p>Creating a Following _^_<p>Blog - That'll really help with your page rank in the beginning if you update regularly and is a way to build community but it doesn't really have anything to do with preventing knockoffs. If your stuff is good you'll get to the stage where the vast majority of your users aren't even aware you have a blog.<p>PR & SEO - Worth doing only if you have something people will stick around for after they get to your site. You must have something there first.<p>Making the Product Complicated - You mean having solutions to non trivial problems baked into your product? Now <i>that</i> raises the barriers to cloning substantially. And unless you're solving a Hard Problem that has no value proposition (which would be a kick in the teeth if you discovered that was what you'd done afterwards) you've made your product better. As has been mentioned by pg, if you're considering two ways of doing something, one of which is harder, the harder one is almost certainly teh one to go for, because you're only considering it because you know it's <i>better</i>.<p>Trade Secrets - I was going to diss this one but it's actually among the best on the list, and is I think more or less the same as above.",1243994364

If you were to jump a Bronco, it would be nothing like the Rally Fighter and we have plenty of Bronco Jumpers in our team to prove it. Short wheel base short travel, Bronco's make for a spine pounding ride over 35miles per hour on a baja desert.<br><br>

Many kit cars take 200 hrs to build...Lone Star (7 days), Factory Five same, etc. You must be good to make this time, but 2000 hours is excessive (though possible for certain people on certain builds). The whole point is that we started Local Motors to addres those scary long build times. Come aboard and give it a little try before you declare so unilaterally that it will never work. Are you so desperate for it to fail? We are pretty good at listening to our faults and appreciate all of your criticism. Hope to see you on the site. (www.local-motors.com)",1243994189
