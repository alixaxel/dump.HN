640686,comment,640243,640243,0,0,simc,,,"SQL is popular because it was the query language that was available in the Oracle and IBM relational databases, which were the first relational database products to come to market. SQL subsequently became an ISO standard. Eventually all relational database vendors switched to SQL. Other DBMSs (Ingres, Informix, Postgres) originally used QUEL which was thought by many to be superior to SQL eventually switched as SQL became dominant/the standard. (Although QUEL can still be used with Ingres). There may be other reasons, but I think that in large part these are the reasons why SQL is dominant today.<p>Relational databases became popular because the declarative high level query language was less time consuming to write queries in than earlier non-relational database.<p>SQL is far from the perfect query language though. It's syntax is often bizarre and confounding, and has many non relational extensions (column ordering, duplicate tuples in a relation).",1244072687

Meanwhile, a search for just ""tympanuchus"" (the genus, which includes more than just prairie chickens) returns Attwater's Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge, which seems only tangentially related.  Terms with multiple meanings (which is precisely what structured search is supposed to help with) don't seem to recognize this multiplicity--consider a search for ""peripatetic"", which is both the name of a school of ancient Greek philosophy (which is recognized in the results), and a term meaning wandering or itinerant (which is not recognized, even when the search is changed to ""peripatetic definition"").  Even the most straightforwardly categorical queries don't seem to work that well (""dungeons and dragons classes"" returns a list that is neither complete, nor correct).  Speaking of neither completeness nor correctness, if you think my query choices were a little too farfetched, consider the query ""search engines""--it returns none of bing, Duck Duck Go, and cuil in the first 50 results (although, somewhat entertainingly, Yahoo is the first result and Google is the second).<p>Is there something I'm missing that this engine actually does well?",1244071448
