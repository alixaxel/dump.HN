644814,comment,644615,644784,0,0,halo,,,"Palm will incur the cost of making a single part with different layouts for each region, but the cost of this is negligible as to make it a complete non-issue. Companies like Blackberry, and indeed Palm themselves, already do this and laptop manufacturers have been dealing with major keyboard differences for years, so I don't see why Palm will suddenly have any significant problems associated with it.",1244300357

LLCs are going to be the least work.  You won't sacrifice things down the road - worst case, you and your partners create a new Corp and sell the LLC to that corp.<p>Most likely, you aren't going to attract VC investment (most companies don't).  LLCs can grow very large (like Fidelity Investments which has profits of $1B per year).  They require little anything to run them.<p>Just make your product.  If you're successful, it won't matter.  If you're unsuccessful, it won't matter.  This is just distracting you from making your product.",1244300284

It's required by California law.  You won't be able to if it's an LLC.   This may not be a big deal for you, but it was for me since I wouldn't have been able to do my startup if I couldn't get health insurance through the company.",1244300060

It should be seen these days.<p>We didn't get support from anyone and still don't, so that should explain the barebones.
But there is a lot to be changed, especially about the mood, this should be most of all fun.
And challenges will be awesome, I promise. =)<p>Thanks again! Cheers!",1244300033

I mean, it's one thing to say an electron really exists as a probability cloud and not some little particle, that it collapses into a particle. It's not there, but it's ""in there"" somewhere. Even electron tunneling is understandable: the electron is kind of in this ""smear"" and sometimes that smear can cross barriers. It's quite another thing once the cloud reaches the boundaries of the universe, and the particle can pass through a solar system and still not be affected.<p>It's everywhere, it's nowhere. It's huge, it's small. We've got all the classical bits of silliness in there.",1244299772

644802,comment,644689,644786,0,0,dejan,,,"That's a nice way to start a conversation :) Thanks for the encouragement, I get those a lot :)<p>You are absolutely right about what you say, but, I don't think you got the point of Aleveo. We're not trying to be next Google or Yahoo Answers, or any sort of similar service. What you describe is answer service.<p>Also the focus is wrong. We do not aim at making money out of students' ideas, but to provide them with help to get in touch with companies, so that they can have better jobs tomorrow, and there is space for profits too. I know it's difficult to understand social oriented business, but here is one.<p>If we think about companies, they do not have problems, or if they did, they wouldn't talk about. They have employees to solve their problems. But, Aleveo provides the company with this channel for external input on their offerings, with constructive feedback how to improve stuff, or make new.<p>Lets say I think of a new automotive door handle that is easier to user, looks better, yet is cheaper to produce. What will I do as a student? Build a company around that? Not really. But at least I will show it to someone who will appreciate it. If lets say FIAT adopts this idea or thinks its viable, they award the student with something either money, sponsorship, internship or whatever they like. Moreover, the company gets to see who can is suitable to be part of their innovation culture.<p>There is no innovation in tried and tested model, and for sure no entrepreneurialism. It's not all about the money.<p>The major idea of Aleveo is for students to push ideas to companies. And this is especially needed in visual things such as industrial design let's say. So, for the student above, he could tag his idea ""FIAT"" and when someone from Fiat logins, he can see ideas submitted to them. Challenges are a ""pull"" method on the other hand.<p>Indeed, we've been doing a research on the topic for 6 months, but the development took only one. I'll post the research as an idea, I think you'll find it shocking what the current youth unemployment situation is doing long term.<p>Thanks for the critic, I find it highly constructive, and I appreciate your toughness.",1244299605
644801,comment,644689,644689,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I like the challenges part because many ""scratch your own itch"" startup ideas are narrowly focused on very few social or entertainment areas that younger startup founders are familiar with. Startups often lack real problems to solve in my view.<p>You should try to get companies to sign up and describe the really tough problems they have. Not the every day cruft that they might like to offload onto students. I think you should avoid the kind of mood that dominates sites like elance or mechanical turk or all the Q&A sites. It's so horribly depressing there.<p>The challenges should be BIG. That doesn't mean the ideas/solutions have to be big. Big challenges to incentivise small experimental approaches. That's what I would love to see.<p>Good luck.",1244299486

644799,comment,644744,644744,0,0,Flankk,,,"I feel as if I'm the only one who is incredulous of the evangelism surrounding the Pre. The device rips off everything innovative about the iPhone including the accelerometer, the ambient light sensor, the proximity sensor, multi-touch, the App Store, notifications and hardware design.<p>Color me skeptical that a company that has only produced mediocre handheld PDAs is going to compete head-to-head with the widely successful iPhone. You can't beat Apple at their own game by cloning their design. Apple entered the cell industry forty years late and changed the game. It's deplorable that no competitor can muster enough innovation to compete with the device.<p>Give me innovation. I want to buy a book and the screen will instantly switch to eInk and I'll be reading said book. I want seamless syncing with my desktop across the room, or across the world. I want to record high definition video and I want to play it back on the built-in holographic projector. I mean, it's the 21st century; give us something worth getting excited about.<p>I'm sure the Pre is an excellent phone. All I'm saying is, to any reasoning person, the iPhone will win versus its second-rate copycat when they are at the same price point.",1244299128

644795,comment,644218,644218,0,0,mgcross,,,"Using an eeepc with Ubuntu, the screen will dim after a couple of minutes without clicking. That's more a problem with Ubuntu's energy saving (or maybe the eeepc-specific kernel I'm running) than with the site, but it does underscore the presumption of clicking being linked to interfacing (scrolling does not keep the machine from starting the energy saving process - only clicking).<p>The site is a neat experiment, but I can't help but feel that most users are conditioned enough from previous flash sites and non-flash rollover actions (drop downs, tool tips, etc) that they would find it easy not to click.<p>The animation was more than a little sluggish on this poor atom processor. It could have been more effective and less distracting had the animations been limited to rollover/click interactions. I guess that's the case with most flash sites. I'd like to see the site executed using html and javascript.",1244298744
644794,comment,644648,644779,0,0,sho,,,"Oh tell me about it. Quantum mechanics is just nuts. And if you think the normal stuff is bad, try reading up on Foam Theory et al; guaranteed to make you wish you had been born a duck or something and had never even heard of science.<p>However, the point I was trying to make was - (almost) too small to measure is just so, but in vast quantities becomes significant. And everything's like that really, it's just a matter of degree. What ""classical"" physics would call an atom is treated as more of a probability field these days. This seems to be the same thing, just with the probability turned way down!",1244298741

Love the layout and typography, although there's maybe a little too much bold text, starts to feel patronising.<p>Not sure about the whole ""ideas from young people"" thing; I have learnt over time that the experience of actually trying to implement ideas radically changes ones' perspective on them and their viability. That's one of the reasons I like programmers so much, really - it's one of the few groups of people with direct everyday experience of actually implementing ideas, and so have a very realistic view of what is actually a good/useful/viable idea and what is not. My non-programmer friends seem to lack any such perspective, and I assume most students are in the same boat.<p>But whatever; looks good and I agree with you on the file saving idea.",1244297944

The easy part is over, and now the very difficult part will come, and this is where you have a 90% chance of giving up.<p>Also, your focus is wrong. I know you won't change it, because you've spent 6 months working on this idea and I'm just some random dude, but as-is, you will have a very hard time gaining users for your project. This is what you can change to actually be successful:<p>""Companies post a process or business problem they are having. Students post solutions. One students answer is rated as the best and the companies pay.""<p>That is a tried and tested model that works. You will have the students because everyone is looking for cash. I mean, think about it for a moment! What is all that text! What is all that signup form? Make a single field with an email address where the student can give in his email address, and he recieves the projects from the companies strraight up. When he wants to answer and earn $200 or so, he needs to give in his details then!<p>And charging companies?! You know you are aiming at the enterprise market if you follow that model, and I sure as hell hope you know how to do enterprise sales.<p>Let me give you an example of something that would work:<p>Student John Field comes to site. He sees the text - ""Help companies optimize and fix their business processes with your ideas - and get paid for it. Enter your email address"". He thinks, sure, why not, enters his email and forgets about it.<p>Joes Bicycle Shop stumbles across this website. He thinks - ah, I need to get cheaper bicycles from Asia down to my shop. Maybe these guys know how that works. He posts this. John Fields recieves the posting. He sees that he can make $90. He researches on the net, posts a reply.
