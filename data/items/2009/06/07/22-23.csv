One of these was halfway down the column for what turned out to be Google. The other was the top result for Yahoo.<p>Then I searched for ""wriggly wrolly,"" which I sometimes call my dog. I ended up clicking for Yahoo again, which had all 4 results.<p>Sure, only two tries, but I was really surprised with how rewarding this experience was.

We can find whatever niche we want and create our own echo chamber.<p>Before the internet, newspapers had to operate somewhat similarly to how our political parties operated.  You had to offer enough to all people in your area that you'd be financially sustainable.  Jonathan Sarna (a professor at Brandeis) has talked about this as to why US politics doesn't have the fringes that Europe does.  Because American politicians are elected locally (for the most part), it becomes suicidal to be fringe.  Sure, maybe 10% of the country agrees with you, but never 50% in any given area - no matter how liberal or conservative.  By contrast European countries generally give a party representation in proportion to their take at the polls - even if they don't win a single district.<p>The internet is like that European system.  There might not be enough in one area to support niches, but there are across a larger population.<p>And, to be honest, I find this a little troubling.  On the positive side, there are more beliefs able to be published and heard.  But really, what seems to happen is that the beliefs aren't heard wider - just more often by a sub group.  And there are such things as wrong beliefs.  Things that are scientifically inaccurate or something we might deem terrible for society (for example, I fell very comfortable saying that Nazism is a wrong belief).  Before such echo chambers, there were at least buffers where one would have to hear wider (one could criticize, mainstream) views and wouldn't have people backing up their view constantly (or at least not exclusively).<p>It's quite the double-edged sword.  I can understand why people like reading HuffPo or Fox News, but it can be somewhat dangerous.  There's a great sorting trend happening in America where we surround ourselves with those who think only like us.  Lack of contact with people who think differently both makes us demonize them (even if it's only to the ""how could they think that"" extent) and makes us very vulnerable.  The second part needs some explanation.  This makes us vulnerable in the same way that genetic engineering (or lack of bio diversity) would.  Are we so arrogant (on all sides) to think that we have <i>the</i> answer (to life, the universe, and everything) that it wouldn't be good to hedge our bets?<p>I'm not saying that it's terrible or anything, just that one has to be careful about only thinking one way.  If we aren't careful, we'll become people analogous to hammers and miss the solutions that aren't nails.",1244413149

However, I have a degree in philosophy, albeit one from a program which was heavily analytic (and thus removed from/disdainful of much of what passes for postmodern philosophy).<p>That said...<p>My biggest problem with postmodernism is simply that there seems to be no ""there"" there. Of course, postmodernists would likely argue that that's the point, but it's terribly hard to talk about something so nebulously defined.<p>But the result of decades of postmodernist (and deconstructionist, and poststructuralist, since they're all interrelated) thought, to me, has ultimately been nothing but a game. One plays the game by choosing some particular thing (the ""text"", which of course is not required to actually consist of text) and:<p>1. Denying any and all conscious intentions the author/designer/creator may have had.<p>2. Reading into it any and all assumptions/positions/prejudices which happen to be fashionable to assign to one's target, by liberally playing with language or context.<p>This is problematic to me because it has no justifiable basis -- it's just as ad-hoc and just as unsound as a Freudian constantly asserting this or that unobservable, untestable subconscious motivation. Of course, within postmodern thought this is considered valid because postmodern thought admits the existence of nothing but present subjectivity.<p>And the worst part is that the largest visible result has been nothing more than the fulfillment <i>by postmodernists</i> of what Foucault had described in his work: an entrenched power which can bring itself to bear against dissidents and which structures all discourse to its own advantage through things like its use of language.<p>Meanwhile, what you consider to be ""cool ideas"" are not necessarily new, and not necessarily foreign to people here. Take, for example, ""the map is not the territory"": this is not a particularly new insight, and it would be a poor programmer indeed who confused, in the style of Magritte's famous warning, an instance of a Pipe class in a program with an actual pipe.",1244412396

Do you think the state deserves more than a 579% increase in revenue from property taxes since 1980?  No other tax has increased as much.<p>The truth is the California government doesn't know how to spend within its means.  Why do you believe we would be in better shape without prop 13?  I'm sure we would have simply increased spending and leveraged out the state more.  With the devaluation of homes it would have just hit us harder, representing a larger percentage of our income.<p>It is easy to claim California would have more revenue without prop 13.  That is a prima facie argument.  What you need to do is prove that taxpayers should have paid more, that California is responsible enough to have handled the money, and that the burden should be borne disproportionately by property owners more than it already is.",1244412161

We've also had some hard core outdoors fans find us and send us great suggestions and even data.
