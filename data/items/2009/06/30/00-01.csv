I'm tired of people treating me like a freak just because I care about my weight and have actually accomplished something in that direction.  I used to be a mess (5'9"" and over 200 lbs, on a relatively small frame) and now I'm much better -- still overweight, but in better shape than some of my friends.  That creates some resentment for people around me who are self-conscious about their weight.  I'm expected to completely avoid talking about my efforts to get in better shape.  It's not a matter of demanding credit; they simply don't want to hear that I have to work at it!  When I have a beer with them and they ask me how I'm feeling, they  don't want to hear that I had a good run this morning, or that I feel bad because I had a bad run.  Okay, fine, I get it, I won't mention it.<p>But what can you really do?  You can't do a Jedi mind trick when you wheel your bike into work.  ""This isn't a bike.  This is just something I found in the parking lot, after I parked my car.""  What do you say when somebody asks what you were doing when they left you a voice mail earlier?  ""Uh... stuff. Yeah, I was doing <i>stuff</i>.""  When somebody asks you why you didn't eat all the fries that came with your burger, are you supposed to lie and say you didn't like them?  There's no way to completely hide the fact that yes, you are trying to do something a little different.<p>Plus, the same people who get annoyed when I talk about my struggles with my weight feel free to talk about their own.  They want to talk about <i>their</i> efforts at diet and exercise as if it's normal, but we have to pretend that <i>mine</i> are beyond reasonable.  Never mind that the only difference between us is that I'm twenty pounds overweight and they're fifty pounds overweight.  I'm supposed to remember that if <i>my</i> lifestyle were normal, then that would reflect poorly on them, so we have to pretend that <i>their</i> lifestyle is just one or two small tweaks away from being totally healthy, and <i>my</i> lifestyle is the product of an eccentric, overenthusiastic, probably unhealthy interest in fitness.  What?  I'm still freakin' twenty pounds overweight!<p>I'm not trying to be a freak.  I'm just trying to be NORMAL, trying to live a lifestyle within the bounds my body is engineered to tolerate.  I'm just trying not to eat so much food that it harms me.  I'm trying not to live a lifestyle so sedentary that my body doesn't know how to cope with it.  That's all.",1246323402

That's not eating too much and gaining fat, (but with a couple of minor exceptions). That's a fundamental problem with the idea that eating too much leads to being fat, and eating less leads to losing fat, the end.<p>The equation, energy delta equals energy in minus energy out doesn't change, but the causal relationship and the whole perception of it changes.
