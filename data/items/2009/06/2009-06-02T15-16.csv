I wonder why. ;)<p>Although I understand the author's position, it is obvious this is a tech person and not a well-rounded business person.  The thing about programming is it's not all about tech.<p>A program typically serves one purpose: to make a company money.  This requires more than just pristine tech.  First and foremost it requires time to market so that a company can stay competitive.  It also requires the ability for more than just a handful of people to be able to write it for expandability and, God forbid, staff changes.<p>C is fast.  But slow to market.  And slow to pick up a program.  And slow to test.  That's why there is so much WYSIWYG.<p>Don't get me wrong: there needs to be a lot more code behind and a lot less script out there, but in the end coding is a balance.  Anytime anyone says it's all this or all that, you know the position is not sound.  It's part speed, part usability, part scalability, part development speed, part readability, part expandability, part pretty pictures, etc.  Balance in all things.",1243958088

Good for performance, terrible for scalability.<p>PHP (and Rails/Django, if you ignore their ORMs) encourage you to store state on some collection of backend servers and communicate via RPC to retrieve that.  This is bad for performance, but good for scalability.  The front-end is just a dumb intermediary that converts data into HTML, so if you need to scale, just add more of them.

637954,story,,,3,1,rumpelstiltskin,"Ask HN: Ad revenue with relation to RSS ",,"Ad rates on most sites are based on the number of unique visitors and overall pageviews. Enabling full feeds via RSS, as convenient as it is, drives a chunk of this traffic away from the site. Has anyone considered restricting their feeds to previews or just removing RSS availability totally in order to drive more traffic to the site? The loss in RSS ad revenue can be more than made up by the increase in on-site-ad revenue.<p>Take Techcrunch for example - over 2 million feed readers who take avail of the full TC feed. In all probability, there's a sizeable chunk of these people who don't visit the actual site. Restricting the feed, which is a bit inconvenient to the readers, can funnel these 'extras' to the site, thereby driving up ad revenue.<p>Apart from the inconvenience factor, is there anything else wrong with this logic?",1243955798
