678451,comment,678112,678343,0,0,patio11,,,"I think the strategy is hope that girls are accomplished enough logical thinkers to be successful programmers, who can nonetheless be bamboozled into believing that a career in computer science will involve a lot of telling fantastic stories about golfing dragons without ever having to write code.<p>You are never going to address a gap in the number of female programmers by playing around with dragon-and-drop programming.  Industry does not need dragon-and-drop.  They need people who will take an intensely boring specification document about business rules for an insurance company, and translate that specification document into functional Java code and XML files.  Your XML editor will not have a dragon-and-drop interface.<p>A large part of me thinks that people who are not programmers are not programmers precisely because they have some notion of what programmers <i>actually do</i> for a living and <i>would hate it</i>.",1246247687
678450,comment,678223,678373,0,0,zmimon,,,"Same here.  As far as I can tell most of the hype about Twitter is driven by the fact that the people most in control of the popular tech media (slowly expanding to media generally) are also the ones who benefit most from Twitter's success.  So every single publicity whore tech blogger is out there evangelizing twitter precisely because they see it as a way to drive people to their blogs where they can make money through ads.<p>We still have almost no evidence as far as I can tell that Twitter is being adopted as a widespread general communication tool.  That's not to say that it won't, just that what we see now is still 90% hype driven and it's anybody's guess whether the thing will collapse or not when the hype dies down.  For communication among my friends I still vastly prefer instant messaging which has so many features that twitter and SMS don't that using twitter feels like returning to the stone age.",1246247639

It sounds to me as though LinkedIn could have approached the matter with some tact, but it should be said that translators as a whole are pretty prickly.  We have to be.  The better we are, the less visible we become.<p>And it's a common scam in the industry (less so now that we congregate online) to take a document, break it up into chunks, then send each chunk to a freelancer as a ""translation test"" to be done free of charge.

678427,comment,678144,678396,0,0,roblocop,,,"I don't think pure academic advancement is the answer as a means to invent and thereby dig ourselves out of the recession. More kids graduating high school really doesn't imply that they'll find better jobs or rather even be better off because of it. I would argue it's even the same metaphor for college. Most people go to get better jobs, but in reality, the risk is just as high to not find one, especially in this economy. Honestly I think we're still at the point where people are too prideful to get work just for work. I know plenty of college grads who are ""above"" working at Starbucks or restaurants of the like. The problem is that there's a definite devaluing of infrastructure type jobs that keep the country running. I think Mike Rowe (my hero) summed it up best: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.htm...</a> \nMaybe it's just another crapshoot, but I think it's another way to rethink our education system.",1246246586

It's certainly an admirable cause, but is this a better introduction to programming than something like Logo, which has been used to teach programming to kids for many years?<p>Alice is impressive, and you can see the obvious programming influence, but it seems like ""Moviemaker with control flow and objects"" more than anything else. What problem is it trying to solve?<p>For me, the hardest part of learning elementary computer science was not things like OOP or if-statements, it was data structures, algorithms, and the difficulty of keeping many different interactions in your headspace. It seems like in many CS programs, the data structures or algorithms class is the ""weeder"" that separates the CS majors from the wannabe CS majors.

Especially since most phones made in the past few years have the capability to send a text to multiple recipients, I highly doubt that Echo is typing as many texts as she receives -- both because she's more likely to get mass texts, and because she may herself be sending mass texts (which are charged as multiple texts, but are only typed once).
