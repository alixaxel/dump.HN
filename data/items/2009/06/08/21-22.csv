It usually works out in the end since many if not most companies provide valuable services to their customers.

They won't have the stopping power or ""bite"" you need to stop quickly. If they get wet or dusty, then for get abou tit. Ditto for suspension if you are going to be making a turn at 20 mph or even 10. At speeds above 10 you really have a motorbike.<p>I work in san jose and saw some guy on a, as you put it, simple traditional steel roadbike with some kind of gas motor on it, going about 20. He tried to take a gentle turn along Tasman in front of Cisco building D or something and almost lost it. It was busy traffic and he could have died if he had gone down.<p>These things aren't bicycles with electric motors. They are motorbikes. These are not the same things. The handling is all different ( you lean into and push into turns ). A serious bicylist might know what I'm talking about. I think the difference is the motor. :) The torque it makes has different characteristics than a bicycle with a fast rider on it.<p>Executive summary: be careful out there. It's harder than it looks.<p>As far as hating bicycling...I don't...but I'm not going to get killed for the sake of commuting since bicycles on roads meant for cars are more or less incompatible in traffic.",1244498138

It is entirely possible to share the culture of the people who one lives nearby and yet practice a different religion. It is also true that this has been going on for a long time. In the case of the spread of Abrahamic offshoots (Islam and Christianity), a couple of thousand years. In this sense religious expression has always been fluid. However, I think that is different than viewing religion as an object. It is a modern move to split culture into many different categories: public, private, family, government, religion, education, medical, etc, etc. This way of understanding and ordering the world is a particularly Western (some might say Germanic) form.<p>Furthermore, there are languages that still survive to this day that have no word for ""religion"" as such, something I talk elsewhere in this thread. This says to me that in some cultures religion cannot even be conceived of as separate from culture because the language does not provide the imaginative capacity to understand it that way.<p>So, always fluid, yes.

I do think there is a problem when we view other cultures from the outside, and when we focus only on the ""fancy"" aspects of culture because it's more interesting than how people arrange their bedding, or whatever.<p>However, I think you are focusing too much on religion as ritual specifically. Yes, indigenous Americans, for example, have certain rituals, rites, and special events that stand apart as specific expressions of their unique culture. If those rituals seek to connect the individuals who participate in them, and the community as a whole to an ""ultimate reality"" or an unseen world, we in the west call it a religious ritual. Most indigenous American people (all, as far as a I know) do not even have a word for ""religion,"" however, so the mundane and the ""fancy rain dance"" are each simply forms of culture with no defining boundary.",1244495374
