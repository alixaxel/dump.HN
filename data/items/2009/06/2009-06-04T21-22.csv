642325,comment,641787,641787,0,0,ATB,,,"So far, I don't see a lot of people asking the really tough questions of what this non-competition for employees (especially engineers / developers) actually means.<p>* If some of the top companies are implicitly not competing for you (as an employee), it means your value as an asset is lowered. There is simply less desire for another company to lure you away with more money, better benefits, a more attractive project to work on, etc. Once you work at one of the companies ""on the list,"" none of the others will come knocking. Your value is also lowered in terms of being able to negotiate a better salary, for instance: HR (and perhaps your manager) knows that you do <i>not</i> have an offer from Yahoo or Google just waiting to whisk you away.<p>* The basic effect on general engineers' salaries is thus: the less it costs Google/MS to hire a Silicon Valley A-lister, the less incentive they will feel to look for bargains by hiring outside the circle of ""made men"". Thus they will hire fewer such relative-newcomers, at lower salaries. Thus there will be less upward pressure on non-Silicon-Valley-A-list salaries: fewer engineers will leave the broader pool for Silicon Valley and those that do will be receiving less money to do so, so the competitive pressures on the non-SV-A-list employers are weakened too. So less salary for SDEs broadly. This knock-on effect is likely minimal for junior ASP.NET bank programmers etc. but likely significant for hotter engineers at more high-powered dev/research/etc. workplaces throughout the US.<p>* Because certain kinds of employees' labour mobility is lowered, it means that access to engineers is somewhat more limited. Your company may not be able to get the rockstar/ninja/hip term of the week who already knows the valley, doesn't need to relocate, and just wants to pay off his SF condo more quickly. Inversely, you  may not want to compete for top graduates from places like Stanford with the 90k/100k first year salaries that Facebook and some others have been throwing around. This means you can either get second-tier native talent that may need relocating or that hasn't proven itself yet ... or you can play the H1 visa game and get a much cheaper foreign programmer who is contractually tied to your company, often fears for his immigrant status, and is thereby much less likely to leave your company for another one. This is a <i>bad</i> thing for US graduates or relatively inexperienced programmers, as it depresses their salaries, as well. In terms of the free market, I guess it's only a natural expression of international labour mobility.<p>* The lack of commentary on the above may be due to the current economic conditions and the ""thank $DEITY I still have a job"" attitude I've seen quite a bit. On the other hand, we got plenty of people on here with the kind of inside knowledge who would be able to tell us more on this subject.",1244152125

642320,comment,639762,639762,0,0,voberoi,,,"While a speed boost is great and all, don't you have the added concern of making sure your blocks don't wear out on an SSD? Because log structured file systems commit metadata and data in large sequential writes to the hard drive, they have background processes that constantly move data around to prevent massive fragmentation from files that are later deleted. It seems like there would just be too much writing going on if what you want is a long-lasting SSD.<p>They do mention in the article that it would be a bad idea to use NILFS on your root partition because of heavy traffic, so lets say I decide to use it on a volume where I store all my media (where I pretty much write once, read a lot, and never delete). Now, a) why would I use an SSD for this given that they're so much more expensive and b) wouldn't I get comparable performance using an HDD here since my files will be laid out pretty much sequentially given my workload? Doesn't the same apply to companies storing mounds of data? Where is the middle ground where I would want to use NILFS on an SSD? One where I a) won't be sending enough write traffic to my drive to wear out my SSD too quickly and b) will be reading a lot of random blocks?<p>What am I missing? I see the merits in using NILFS, but I just don't see the purpose in comparing its performance against other filesystems on SSD's.",1244151993

We do it that way so the business logic exists and is enforced in one place rather than being scattered around this desktop app and that website and so on. Only the most trivial applications can afford to put all their business logic in the middle tier.</i><p>But of course, the middle layer that applications talk to need not be the database.  A simple RPC server between the apps and the database makes maintaining the system significantly easier.  Your procedures are ""normal code"" that you already have a toolchain in place for dealing with.  (Testing, libraries, version control, etc.)<p>The environment is richer, which means the middle tier can handle caching, sharding, replication, auditing, and anything else that you might need to add.  And, you can add these things incrementally, without touching the apps that speak to this server.<p>IMHO, stored procedures are a quick hack that are barely viable for even the simplest tasks.  Many people seem to disagree, but I doubt they have ever considered any other way.<p>(A notable example of this system is Flickr.  Their internal apps, like the public web interface, use the Flickr API to do their work.  In this case, the web app that powers the API is the ""middle layer""/""RPC server"".

As another commenter mentioned, ITA supplies the backend for a number of these sites. QPX had a month-long search way before any of the other sites, which is useful for me since I rarely have to travel on specific dates. And it doesn't try to sell you hotels or rental cars. In fact, all of the so-called ""value adds"" that distinguish the sites relying on the backend data are things that I find incredibly distracting and useless. QPX also doesn't have a habit of showing fares that don't actually exist, which happens on every other airfare search site I've ever used.

I've since learned how to read between the lines, ask a lot of questions hiring managers aren't expecting to be asked, and to request interviews with team members if it isn't offered (and refusing the position if my request is refused).<p>Additionally, you'll hear enough horror stories if you talk to those who work in IT departments in regular companies that aren't doing anything interesting because no one's been able to present a solid business case as to why IT can add value or affect the bottom line.  Though sometimes the works is simply gummed up by political battles and everyone's afraid to go to HR or to make an attempt to knock down those walls in fear of losing their job.  What you read about on HN is what you'll see at the right-end of the bell curve, and often isn't representative of your average company.<p>Most of these issues were driven by politics.  In a lot of situations (electronic hand-crafting, manual bug-tracking) I was able to drive change from within.  Granted, they took months.  However people were afraid of opposing the head of QA because A) she was a lifelong friend of the founder's life B) she was predisposed to think all developers were idiots C) they weren't equipped to traverse that delicate political minefield without at least losing a leg in the process.<p>The scalability/performance issue one?  This was at a private sales-oriented company with a billion dollars in annual revenue.  Again, mired in politics.  Their entire e-commerce system was built by guys who were completely green at the time, and they hacked it together.  He was best buds with the CIO, and was... a pretty passionate guy, and very defensive.  The average person with a spouse and kids to support didn't feel it was worth risking their job to improve the architecture if they couldn't present a decent argument and it came across as hurting his feelings.  Me?  I spent far too many lunches talking with developers, guys in network ops and analysts to come up with ways to cache data and partition functionality so the thing could handle the existing load and scale in the future.  It took buy-in from stubborn developers who normally pointed the fingers at the database or the servers, network ops guys who pointed fingers at the developers, and a testy data architect who had a serious row with the development manager.<p>I've learned <i>a lot</i> from those experiences, especially the social problems that can exist in team-based development, and how to present solutions where even the most stubborn-minded individual can ""get it"".  I've also learned that these problems exist nearly everywhere, just more so in some environments than others, and when you can solve these problems and when it's instead best to learn and move on.",1244149580
