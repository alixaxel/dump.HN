667774,comment,667411,667588,0,0,russell,,,"Actually my degree is in economics.  When I got it, the arguments were in terms of ""utiles"" instead of dollars.  A utile would encompass quality, but was such a nebulous concept that it was of very little practical use.  So when I said ""rationally economic"" I was speaking in terms of dollars, which you can measure and not utiles or feelies which you cannot.  I dont think that giving everyone an HSA is going to give Friedman's desired result of lowering health care costs, because it depends on people making dollar based decisions.  I think improvements in the cost structure will be made the monopolistic components of health care, including drug pricing, and reactions to insurance optimizations like factory medicine.<p>I made the decision to switch from economics to programming a long time ago, pretty much for the reasons I gave above.  I WAS expecting a scientific approach and pretty much got mumbo jumbo like Friedman's essay.  And if you think things are very much better, how come Greenspan and the quants and politicians lead us into this economic disaster we have now.

So, the way this works is that I look at the last digit in each of the totals, then ask what is the probability that we should observe such a distribution of final digits if the final digit were distributed as discrete uniform U[0,9].  I use a chi2 goodness of fit test, then calculate the p-value with H0 = the final digits are distributed uniformly.  We would reject H0 and say the election was rigged at an alpha level of 0.9, but not at 0.95.  Take of this what you will, but I'd hope to have a higher significance level for elections.  : shrug :",1245615955

I have a CS degree but almost no db experience.  I'm considering moving forward with the project with plans to hire an expert to redo the database later if the business gains traction.<p>I'm curious if anyone on HN has been in a similar situation and am curious how you handled it.  Would you take several months to gain expertise before beginning rather than learn while doing with intentions to replace the code later?  Are there utilities to do some of the heavy lifting for the database portion that are good enough for use in production?  What would you do if you were in my place?",1245614758

That's usually apparent when someone below points out the errors of my ways.  I think down modding because of a differing opinion is a bit rude.  When I dont like someone's opinion, I upmod someone else.",1245614707

In one of my old employers, we hired a guy in his early thirties who'd been a sysop in the military, serving a tour of duty in Iraq.  He had no relevant work experience and his technical skills were weak, but he was taking programming courses at a local community college and seemed eager to learn and really excited about the job.  Turned out to be a pretty good hire too, as he <i>was</i> eager to learn and excited about the job.<p>If you do this, the burden will be on you to show why you want to jump into programming at such a late age and why you haven't done so already.  People don't change on a dime, so your interviewers will ask you about this.  (In my last job hunt, I got questions about why I was looking for a position in Mountain View when I lived in Boston, and why I wanted to work for a big company when all my previous experience was with startups.)  But if you have good reasons for this (where good != ""I wanted to make more money"" (outside of the financial industry) or ""I really wasn't any good at my last job, so I'll try something new""), most people are quite willing to give you a fresh start.",1245614428
