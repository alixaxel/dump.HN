It's supposed to discourage heated back-and-forth replies, which historically have low value.  Replying a level up defeats the purpose.<p>PG, if you're reading: Instead of delaying the display of the reply link, it might be better to instead display the link, but during the cooling-off period make it go to a page explaining <i>why</i> the user can't post right away.

I have to move to another country and accept <i>their</i> social contract, instead. I have to go out of my way and leave the land I was born in and the continent that my ancestors lived in for centuries before these governments were even established, and refusing to do so means I have ""accepted"" a social contract whose terms can change outside my control and against my most spirited resistance.<p>I can accept an argument that voluntary human interaction does not scale well enough. I can accept an argument that we need institutional violence to keep a continent-wide civilization in order. I can accept an argument that the benefits of civilization outweigh the costs of this institutional violence. But don't pretend this state of affairs is voluntary. We are born into a system, raised knowing no other way for humans to live, made to recite pledges of allegiance in the classroom before we know the language well enough to understand what we are saying, and as adults, expected to obey arbitrary rules with no realistic recourse of change. And we are expected to believe that we freely chose the shape of the society we live in.<p>Yes, you can vote. You can even assert your constitutional rights and try to convince five judges, rather than fifty million voters. But even then, the voters might vote to amend the constitution to take your rights away. So in reality you're always at the mercy of authority--be it the authority of the courts or the authority of the mob.<p>When, exactly, in the Indian Wars did the tribes accept <i>their</i> social contract? Does the fact that your ancestors lost a war really constitute consent to the rule of the victorious government just because that government has conquered and subdivided your homeland?<p>I'm well aware that blood has been shed to secure what little choice we have under this government. Blood has also been shed to force an entire race, under gunpoint, to live under this government against their will. And blood was also shed to take two steps forward and one step back--no more slavery, but on the other hand, if your <i>entire state</i> votes to opt out of the federal government, it gets burnt to the ground by General Sherman.<p>There is no social contract. No one freely chose to live under government, though many of us do accept the status quo, and many more simply resign themselves to the belief that there is no alternative. We do have a society that seems to work acceptably, and that may outweigh the cost. Government seems necessary for civilization, and civilization is a wonderful thing. But voluntary? No, sir, it is not.<p>(Edited)",1244136732

Do people in this community keep their ideas out of the patent records, or do they patent?  I come from a finance background and have recently returned to school to pursue an MSFE.  In the financial world, new strategies, often implemented through algorithms, are the lifeblood of a lot of quantitative firms.  Do people think it is better to not publish a patent if your business depends heavily an a very unique idea?",1244135551

It's true that in some cases doubling the price cuts the number of customers in less than a half, in which case the the ""charge more"" advice stands. But in other cases charging half of the current price may easily quadruple your paying userbase.<p>Finding the right price can be done only through trying different prices. At some point Amazon was giving random discounts to their users and trying to pinpoint the ideal price for the item. It didn't last long, of course, as people started gaming them, but it just goes on to show that the price validation <i>is</i> a big deal.<p>Also keep in mind if you start with $200, see zero sales and then start gradually reducing it to $20, then you basically shoot your own credibility as a merchant as the $200 -> $20 drop makes you look greedy, detached from the reality and ultimately incompetent.<p>In the end it all very much depends on the application and the target customer base.",1244135522

A fact that is always overlooked is that this hypothetical patent would have expired sometime in the 5th century BC. To make this argument one would have to find more recent examples. How about anything created within the last 20 years? In my view, the greatest things aren’t practical to be patentable and the practical ones aren’t anywhere close in magnitude to the Pythagorean Theorem. So, where is the problem? And by the way, comparing algorithms to ""words"" (in this context) is just silly, with all due respect to Knuth.",1244135044
