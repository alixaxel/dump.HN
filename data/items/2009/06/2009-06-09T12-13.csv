No one has the money to do an exhaustive review to ensure their own compliance with all regulations, not least because after they did this, they'd be spending yet more money complying, while all their competitors sailed along in ignorance and made more money.<p>The first startup I was involved with was a competitor to e-gold, and one of the conditions of my relationship with them was that I had to move outside the US while I was involved on a day-to-day basis with their hardware and software, because they saw this coming (this was 2001).  Of course, being so careful cost lots of extra money, and that helped sink them before they ever really became a noticeable competitor.",1244552335

standing on the back stoop//
one on each side hanging on//
and looking down into//
an elegant open Mercedes//
with an elegant couple in it//
The man//
in a hip three-piece linen suit//
with shoulder-lenght blond hair&sunglassed//
The young blond woman so casually coifed//
with short skirt and coloured stokings//
on the way to his architect's office//

And both scavengers gazing down//

at the cool couple//

You generate lift by increasing angle of attack, but the idea is that the wing should stall, and thus stop generating lift, before. The amount of lift a wing can generate depends on its airspeed, so if you keep the airspeed down, the only situation in which it could generate a dangerous amount of lift would be if you entered a region of very high horizontal windshear such that the airspeed all of a sudden increases to above maneuvering speed.
