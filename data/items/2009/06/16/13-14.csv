It's not an easy problem to solve, and is fraught with contradictions.

You seem to show no awareness of this, which makes me think that your bombast and self-righteousness may be misplaced.<p>You may be right that there is such a thing as a higher moral ground, and you may even be right that it applies here; I think it would be difficult to define in an off-hand 10 line comment, but I'd be glad to read your attempt should you care to try.",1245160660

So movement should be smooth and not dependent on frame rate.<p>physic thread in response to player input calculates new functions for objects (only for X next turns). These new functions are encapsulated in event objects, that are added to events priority queue.<p>On each turn (of physic thread) events for that thread are executed - each event takes set of game objects (not always all objects) and time and returns changed set of game ojects.<p>In C++ this will be much easier to write at first (no hard thinking needed:)), but later it could become nightmare to change because of side effects.",1245160384

660125,comment,659976,659976,0,0,k0n2ad,,,"I've used Adderall, Concerta (Methylphenidate, like Ritalin) and Modafinal when I was in college. Adderall, which I would bum off my friend's prescription, pretty much gave me a rush of focus power and euphoria, which I usually squandered on things that weren't my schoolwork (guitar playing, wikipedia surfing and video games). I then got ""diagnosed"" with ADHD so I got a prescription to Concerta. Concerta was similar to Adderall, but given that it was sustained release, it lasted longer and worked differently depending on how I ate. I actually crashed really hard on it. I stopped using that after a while and just relied heavily on caffeine, along with learning methods to focus naturally.<p>Modafinal is an interesting drug. It just makes you feel awake and alert, without feeling like you are tweaked. It saved me when I pulled all nighters. Stayed awake for 3 nights once during finals and it was one of the strangest and most uncomfortable trips I've ever been on - but that's a digression I should save for Erowid.org.<p>That being said, if you rely on ""cognitive enhancers"" (I hate the euphemism, more like ""speed"") now, you may have to rely on them for everything in the future. They don't cure your symptoms, they just mask them. The thing is, focus should come about naturally because you have a passion for something. I believe that you would feel the most success from developing the ability to focus on your own. Did you try exercise? Meditation? Are you simply overloading yourself with too many courses? Are you in the right degree program? Such activities and considerations, though a greater time investment with more room for failure, are healthy ways to get your brain ""in the zone"" and prepare yourself for future cognitive demands in life.<p>Or, you can depend on drugs. It's really your choice.<p>People with ""ADHD"" have a broad range of symptoms that are conveniently lumped together and treated with various drugs on a trial and error basis. The science of psychology is still greatly in it's infancy. We still have a lot to learn about symptoms such as the inability to focus, hyperactivity, impulsivity and the like. It is highly probable that there is an underlying cause to any or all of these symptoms, one that has been fostered as we were growing up. The whole ""chemical imbalance"" theory really irks me - there is probably an environmental reason to most of the ""chemical imbalances"" that we read about, hear about or experience.<p>Another thing to try is getting a really good therapist (hard to come by) and talking these things out - figuring out on your own. In either case, good luck to you.",1245159145

If so, study harder.<p>Personally, I've found that I can go for days without doing anything useful if I am trying to avoid boring work.  I feel really tired and generally run down.  The way I combat this is to do something interesting, and let the momentum help me do boring things.  (Video games also seem to help, a cup of coffee and an hour of Geometry Wars puts me in a great mood.)<p>Anyway, if I were going to go on drugs, I would do it in a structured way.  Don't medicate yourself, get a doctor.  Before you start taking anything, get in the habit of keeping a diary.  Write down what you are thinking, how you feel, ideas you have, what you did with the day.  Then, start your medication.  Keep writing your in journal.  If something changes, it should be easy to see.  Your drugs might not make you more useful, they might just be lowering your standards.  (My friends think they are much more interesting than they actually are when on certain recreational drugs.)<p>Finally, maybe your standards are just out of whack, and you are imagining things that aren't true.  I often feel inadequate, even when I consider that I have written 100+ pieces of software that people actually use (with about 10 maintained at any given time), I've written a book, I write a moderately popular blog, I am invited to give talks around the world, and have high HN and StackOverflow karma.
