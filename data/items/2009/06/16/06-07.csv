None of the questions even touched on the hairy issues. This is probably not the kind of question that's suitable for hunch.<p>I did another quiz asking where I should go on vacation. That lead to an interesting result. I should go to Tokyo. Next time I'm going to ask whether my startup idea can succeed in Tokyo. If it says no, but it could work in Shanghai, I think I'm hooked ;-)",1245134860

Be consistent, Mike. Free speech isn't just for the stuff you like. If you're against free speech, just say so.<p>Facebook is wrong if they think this is a First Amendment issue. It's not. They are well within their rights to remove any comments that deny the Holocaust. However, it seems inconsistent for them to call pictures of breastfeeding mothers ""offensive"" and remove them if they're going to allow Holocaust denial on their site.",1245134712

My base expenses are less than $500 / month in the Philippines.<p>10,000 furnished apartment.\n~5,000 food\n~2,500 visa\n~1,300 internet\n~1,200 electricity<p>Total: 20,000 / 47.5 = $421<p>I'm probably forgetting some things.  There are misc expenses which would bring me up to the $500.<p>That's not to say I actually live here for that though.  Those are my actual expenses and I can get by with just those but I choose to have a little more fun.  Beer is really cheap here but it adds up if you go out a lot.  A 1/4 lb McD's meal is 135 pesos, so your expenses go up if you eat out a lot.<p>You can nearly cut that rent fee in half if you go for an unfurnished apartment but you have to pay more initially to put in your own furnishing.<p>You won't be traveling on a budget that low but you have to leave the country once every 16 months (I think) for a visa run if you are on a tourist visa.<p>Another big one is taxes.  So if you are running your own business then you have to make $500 / month after taxes.<p>I would say that $750 is a pretty decent figure for a single person not living high on the hog.  As the article mentions, for $4,000 / month you can live like a king.<p>Anything I'm forgetting?<p>ETA:  This is for Dumaguete in the Philippines.  Cebu is more expensive and Manila is more expensive than Cebu.<p>ETA2:  I didn't add local travel expenses because if you stay in Dumaguete for a decent amount of time you might as well buy a motorcycle for around PHP 40,000.  Gas is cheap because you don't use much.  Dumaguete has banned taxis so your only option is a trike which typically costs a total of PHP 60 to go downtown and back.",1245134643

Once economy of scale starts working with the battery tech, this will work out better economically for a large fraction of consumers.<p>Even better, EVs with 100 mile range and an optional petro fuel or propane generator module to turn it into a series hybrid on long trips.  I only need the long-range capability of an internal combustion engine occasionally.  Why do I want to pay for the overhead of hauling such equipment around when I'm just commuting or running to the store?  Essentially, that's what many of us do with our internal combustion cars.  We drive a heavier, noisier, over-capable long range vehicle that's less appropriate for the short neighborhood trip, just so we have the long range capability available, even though we use it only occasionally.",1245134066

I can assure you people over 30 have a good amount of experience and knowledge they can contribute to a business like that. It's through old people who say ""Oh yes, this problem is exactly the same as they used to have in shipping goods on old trains, look in this book for the optimal answer, Brunel figured it out in 1840""\nthat you can short circuit the learning process and gain an edge.<p>Or in simpler words, you gain perspective.

Facebook isn't the congress, it's a private company; one which apparently thinks the revenue from a few neanderthal racists outweighs that which might be lost from people who take offense. Facebook can do what they want, just as PG can wipe my account for swearing on HN if he sees fit.

Pretending that the rules of one should apply to the other is nonsensical.<p>The reason this distinction is important is that many people claim that Apple is impinging upon their rights with the restrictions built into the OS, but they don't actually <i>have</i> any rights over the OS and ownership of the hardware does not grant them any. By analogy, owning a book does not grant you any rights over the copyrighted contents.  People readily understand the latter, but seem to violently reject the former.<p><i>All they should do is void warranty if someone tempers with the OS.</i><p>That <i>is</i> all they do.
