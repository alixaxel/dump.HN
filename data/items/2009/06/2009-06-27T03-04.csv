 John McDougall MD on the perils of dairy products<p>He has advocated a low fat, whole foods, plant based site for decades,
and this type of diet has been clinically shown to prevent
and even reverse heart disease (see studies by Dr. Dean Ornish, probably others).<p>The diet consists of fruits and vegetables, with starches
such as potatoes, yams, beans, and oats featuring as the staple calorie source.<p>The pre-1950s Okinawan diet was like this, with the staple being sweet potato.  Their percentage of calories from fat was in the single digits, with carbohydrates being over 80% of calories.  Okinawa has been known as having one of the highest number of centenarians, not to mention healthy long-lived people overall.  Sure there are more factors than diet, but it is worth considering what they ate.<p>The ""Star McDougallers"" area of the site has many
testimonials of people helped with their health problems
far beyond weight loss, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.<p>Taking it to the next level:<p>The 80/10/10 diet<p>also low fat and plant based, but all raw (fruits instead of starches, basically)<p><a href=""http://vegsource.com/talk/raw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vegsource.com/talk/raw</a>  Message board for the 80/10/10 diet, by Doug Graham<p><a href=""http://foodnsport.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foodnsport.com</a>  Doug Graham's site<p><a href=""http://30bananasaday.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://30bananasaday.com</a>  80/10/10 enthusiast forum & social network",1246073528

The man that came did some damage to the house before he finished. Dad refused to pay, he refused to finish the job. We had no TV, a large hole in a ceiling, and more...<p>Dad was pissed but apparently I was even more angry after I was told someone would come by only in a week or so. So what did I do?<p>I went on Google and found the email of the head of the south east region of Comcast. I sent him a long email expressing my unhappiness and I told him I was going to post my story on my blog. I didn't think it would lead to anything, I did this without my family's knowledge.<p>Next morning I awoke as my dad shook me asking me what I did. We had 3-5 Comcast vans parked outside our house in addition to an insurance repair firm fixing the hole. I had a blog for the purpose of learning what a blog was, messing around with HTML/CSS, no viewers. I didn't say that of course. The threat was enough.<p>With twitter/facebook, it's even easier.
