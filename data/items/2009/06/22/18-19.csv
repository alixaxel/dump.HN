That's what ""votes"" are for in a democracy, right?<p>The habit of only using downvotes to signal disagreement when a comment is highly-rated helps a bit, but isn't universally applied and and throws time-of-vote in as a confounding signal. (There are comments that I will upvote if <0, abstain if 1-2, and downvote if >2 -- so it all depends on when I see it. With others doing the same, totals are more reflective of 'the last few voters' than the community.)<p>These could be addressed by UI changes. One idea I've plugged before would be to offer a separate axis of voting which is explicitly agree/disagree -- so people aren't tempted to use promote/demote that way.<p>Agreement scores could also be hidden until a user votes -- so each vote is independent. This makes more sense on a pure agree/disagree scale than promote/demote. PG clearly wants to discourage demote piling-on; he first tried through suasion  and when that failed now enforces in software the -8 floor. And discouraging piling-on makes sense: demotion-votes sting with a sense of community censure, while disagreement is just a normal healthy part of conversation. My ideal comment would be a +50 on the promote-scale, and a -50 on the agree-scale. It means people appreciate having heard something they disagree with, so some novelty/signal/thought is occurring.",1245696225

Most of the work across all of the fields of programming is probably maintenance.<p><i>If you are doing exploratory programming, what does unit testing get you?</i><p>It gets you the ability to change your mind and do deep reworkings of very complicated systems with a higher degree of confidence.  It's most valuable for maintenance, while duck typing, however.<p><i>How can you write the tests before the code if you don't have a spec to work from in the first place?</i><p>You end up doing better interface design at a finer granularity than you would have to otherwise.  It slows you down, but requires greater discipline in terms of good architecture, so you end up saving time that way.  Test first is really just design-up front, but with 3 or 4 orders of magnitude more iterations.<p>This is best for duck typing languages.

By this interpretation, they <i>were</i> reciprocating (in the only way they could, given they have no budget).<p>""Technical skills make a technical success, but business skills make a business success"" - business skills being about how to make your product ""easy to buy"". For example, a higher price can make it easier to buy, especially if it fits into a category of products that the organization is used to buying - and in the <i>way</i> they are used to buying them. It's part of ""positioning"" it in the customer's mind. This is all simply seeing it from the customer's point of view. These things don't directly improve your product, but they do help to communicate it to other people, which is also intrinsically worthwhile.<p>The economy is bad and perhaps also comp sci is finally ending its multi-decade growth phase. There's always a place for anyone who creates value, but perhaps the days of ""it's raining soup grab yourself a bucket"" are over, and a different strategy is needed (Disclaimer: this is a guess. I'm not yet sufficiently deluded to think I can predict the future).<p>More generally, I think I have had exactly your dilemma (and still do). I don't have a solution, but perhaps some camaraderie. It's the philosophy of doing whatever does the most good. It feels good (and I think it is good). I believe that if you create value, someone will work out how to pay you. It's a wonderfully inspiring and freeing philosophy - and it makes me feel happier and feel like a pure, innocent person. Also, people want to help you. And for me, it was also inspired by Bucky (his epiphany by the lake - which some spoilsport pedant has apparently debunked as the exact place for it, claiming it's more like a constructed founder's story. Anyway).<p>The disillusionment for me was in open source: for a developer tool I wrote, people took the help I provided, but didn't give anything back [1] . I did have sales [2], but because there was no pressure to pay, huge organizations would take 3 months to pay [3]. I really hated waiting for the other shoe to drop [4].<p>Today, I believe that if I create value, it is OK for me keep some of that value. This seems to be right and true... but it doesn't make me happy, and it isn't inspiring or freeing.<p>I'm currently working on a patentable enterprise developer tool, that I plan to initially sell at a high price to large organizations. As the tool becomes more general, I will lower the price, until eventually it is cheap  enough for anyone to afford. I think this is good, and sensible... but it also makes me feel a little sick at heart. So I don't know the answer, but hopefully I've offered some camaraderie. Do let me know if you work out an answer! :-)<p><pre><code>    [1] which is part of the open source deal - I just didn't like it\n    [2] dual licensing, like Ghostscript\n    [3] to be fair: everyone who said they'd buy it, did eventually buy it\n    [4] I'd much prefer they didn't tell me they were going to buy it,\n    so I didn't have to worry for 3 months.</code></pre>",1245695628

People pay operations-research consultants hundreds of thousands of dollars for this.<p>Something to consider: good code is an asset, and it's a <i>compounding</i> asset.  The better your programmers are, the more likely that they'll produce code that they can build upon, and build upon, and build upon, all with relatively few bugs, so that you can go faster as time goes on and the product grows.  Mediocre programmers often produce code that requires more maintenance and slower development as time goes on.

Probably should run an IRR comparison against your cost of capital and decide based on that.<p>This, BTW, is why companies like Google try to find the best talent they can, no matter what the cost.

I find that going direct means that you usually deal with people who are much less slimy.<p>The key to getting paid is the willingness to walk away.  First, if you are doing work before getting paid, remember you are giving them a loan.  Never loan someone more money than you are willing to walk away from.  And cut your losses early.   If they won't pay you after one month, they probably aren't going to pay you after two or three months.  stop work.   do something else.  If they decide to pay you, great. you win.   If they don't, well, you are only out one month rather than 3 or 6 months, so you don't lose quite as much.",1245694514

It's more akin to handing the cell a new set of work orders, but it doesn't mutate the cell's DNA.<p>Second, I think the ""port"" is not that the RNA is similar, but rather the virus has a protein key on it's surface that physically allows it to enter the cell.<p>In the micro world things move by atomic forces. In this case the virus has a protein on it's surface that is the same shape as a protein on the surface of the cell. The same shape means the electrical charges line up, and the virus is drawn toward the cell by electrostatic forces.<p>If the charge pattern does not match up, the virus will not be drawn toward the cell. Remember the virus has no ability to move.",1245694421

The Cell has one main core (PPE) and 8 Synergistic Processor Elements (SPEs). These SPEs are not as powerful as a normal core (and I think one of them is reserved for the OS), and (I think) they're main purpose is solely for graphics (well mainly good at dealing with floating point nums). If I remember correctly, the 360 has three general purpose, equally powerful cores (PPEs) in its version of the IBM cpu.<p>I can imagine someone from IBM probably selling a Sony exec on how the Cell processor can save money by having Cell do both general processing and handling all the video rendering without a separate GPU... which we all know didn't quite work as well as Sony had hoped, since PS3's had an NVidia chip plopped in last min (this probably explains why programming for a PS3 really sucks since Sony wasn't planning on having a separate GPU)",1245693902

Or the answer may be, ""This has to be made right before we can add these 27 other things to the system or we'll all be in deep sh*t.""  How do you know which?  Experience.
