642407,comment,642164,642164,0,0,krschultz,,,"We've past all the long hanging fruit. Everything from here on forward is going to take more time, money, and people than. 100-200 years ago there were thousands of people at best with the education to push things forward. Often they were experts in several fields. Today we have hundreds of thousands of people pushing on these fields (of which people are only an expert in one or two things). All of the easy answers are gone.<p>This is compounded by the bar being really high and the regulation really thick. What counts as a great innovation in alternate energy today requires at least being competitive with existing technology, which has almost one hundred years of development by tens of thousands of engineers at thousands of companies. It is no wonder it takes longer. And you have to worry (rightly so) the environmental and safety aspects of things that wouldn't have mattered 150 years ago.<p>All of these things slow down progress and make it more expensive. One of the reason progress was cheap in computer science was because the field was young, but as it matures we will see a slow down in innovation. Only fools will continue to believe Moore's ""law"" has any truth looking 20 years into the future.",1244156296

642401,comment,641946,642224,0,0,solutionyogi,,,"I thought I had the worst version control story but you won by a large margin. None the less, here's how version control worked  at a place where I was contracting:<p>They used VSS for version control and in team of around 30 people only two folks had check in access. So how do I check in my changes? When you are ready to check in your files, you fill in a 'blue sheet' (a blue paper with form printed on it) <i></i>by hand<i></i>. You are supposed to write name, location on your computer for that file, VSS location of the file and comment for each file which you want to check in (by hand on blue sheet). I used to take one day to implement a change request but would take as much as two weeks just to check in the damn files as those gate keepers were always busy. And god forbid if someone else checked in the file which you intended to check in. The gatekeeper will send you back to reconcile the changes and you will be again at the end of the queue. Trust me, I used to get 'blue sheet' nightmares!<p>When I asked them why they have this weird policy, I was told that it was to prevent people from checking in the code with breaking changes and enforce code review. Mind you, while I was there, gatekeeper didn't review my code even once. Reminds me of the monkeys and banana story.",1244156085
