641243,comment,640263,640889,0,0,kragen,,,"""moving the atoms closer to each other"" is what I was talking about; under some circumstances, that could manifest as a shift to a different crystalline structure.  (If you search for information on high-pressure crystalline phases of materials, you'll find a lot of interesting things.)  ""Iron is incompressible"" is often a useful approximation, but no material is <i>actually</i> incompressible (that would entail, among other things, faster-than-light propagation of shock waves and infinite hardness) and many day-to-day materials are less compressible than iron.  Glass, for instance.<p>Most metal objects do actually have voids in them, but you can manufacture metal objects that don't, and it's not clear that having voids in your cable would cause it to be damaged by pressure.",1244116684

I would even argue that the term ""scalability"" bandied about these days is really a reversion to batch processing - even caching algorithms are a form of batch processing.",1244116325

641238,comment,640859,640859,0,0,patrickg-zill,,,"My suggestion: the US should create a class of corporate trusts similar to the ""canroys"" that Canada has.<p>Under this setup, as long as a certain high percentage of the profits are distributed to the shareholders each year, the corporate taxes are non-existent or very low.<p>In this case, Microsoft would not pay much US taxes, but the individual investors would be the ones paying tax on the dividends received.

641237,comment,640235,640808,0,0,zcrar70,,,"Yup - I'm amazed. The Rails community has gotten some flack for this kind of issue before, but rather than listen to the criticism and learn from it, they make the same mistake over and over.<p>It's as if they feel that Rails is a direct product of their personalities, and that because Rails is so successful, anything they do is vindicated by that success. That's just the wrong approach.",1244115854
641236,comment,640504,641221,0,0,antirez,,,"Even without the persistence you can say something is a database. It's not a coincidence that the term ""in memory database"" exists for example.<p>Btw everything is used to store data permantly, reliably or not for your specific needs/tastes, is a database.<p>Also you can use Redis in append mode if you wish, this will sync your data ASAP on disk. For now in order to do this you need to use netcat, but this will be supported with ad-hoc tools in the future. Still this will be the <i>discuoraged</i> way to do things.<p>And about reliability, it's worth to note that with Redis there is a delay between the memory copy and the persistent copy of the dataset, but this is not about reliability of the whole dataset, all your data that is not about the latest few minutes is stored on disk permanently without any kind of risk.<p>Also, you appear to claim that if a database for design limits the amount of data it can hold to the amount of free ram, it is a cache. This is not the case IMHO.",1244115771

641229,comment,640102,640102,0,0,progLiker,,,"Hindsightly I'd start by reading a book about internet security. The only sound thing is to start with a book,\ngiving an overview of the matter and gather information\nfrom that point onwards. Most rational thing to do.\nThat's my recommendation.<p>You wanted to protect your site from attacks:\nI found a pdf document on the net quite informative:\n""ethical hacking""(pdf). It covers packet, transport and network layer security up to ""google"" hacking.\nIt is broken on [<a href=""http://www.scribd.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com</a>], but there are several other similar guides there. \nAnd it is out there I found it via google.<p>There are some good documents at defcon.org as well,\nI read one about firewalling which was impressive.<p>You must go elsewhere for cgi security issues, protocols, encryption and all that.",1244114763

641225,comment,640410,640410,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I wish we had either (ideally both) in the JVM. I frequently come across situations with clojure where using a coroutine or continuation would be the cleanest solution. There are various libraries that use some kind of bytecode instrumentation to achieve it, but this places serious constraints on where and how you can use them.

There would probably be some issues in selling the engine though: there would be a certain chicken-and-egg factor in selling an unproven engine to a new MMO-building company.",1244114386

The myth of the perfect corporate drone is just that - a myth. Everyone does weird stuff. It's just that, within the corporate environment, that weird stuff is repressed and hidden, so you never get to find out about it.<p>Hopefully the corporate world will wake up to this some day and become a competitive employer again - I mean, hopefully for them. I'm sure some of the leading companies (large and small) out there are already ahead of that curve, and they have an edge over more backwards rivals who only hire people who behave ""properly"" all the time.",1244113216
