672159,comment,664866,664866,0,0,coopr,,,"I've started businesses in a diverse range of industries: automobile parking, gourmet packaged foods, real estate, online retailing, physical retail.<p>One key difference I've noticed between industries is the speed with which they adopt technology. I believe many tech entrepreneurs mistakenly assume that non-tech industries are as welcoming of new technology as tech-heavy industries. Understanding the pace of technological uptake in your target industry is highly important - and don't think you can change it!<p>One of the best ways I've found to understand a new industry is to attend a trade show and talk with lots of people. Tell them you are new, and ask them to explain the basics. Buy people drinks at the bar and quiz them. Get the same few questions answered by a number of different people. Ask who the industry experts are, then find them and get them talking - experts tend to love to share their expertise!<p>I've found particular success by applying technological advances that give me a competitive advantage in an industry that is otherwise slow to adopt technology. Don't try to sell the technology, or otherwise compete on the basis of the tech itself - instead, use the technology in a way that your competitors would be slow or unwilling to do, and thus gain an advantage.<p>For instance, in my gourmet packaged food company I used a (then) new digital label printing technology to allow me to experiment with new labels rapidly and at very low cost. The labels weren't ""perfect"" looking, and my competitors would not tolerate anything other than ""perfect"" labels, but customers didn't care. I was able to quickly and inexpensively refine my labels, which resulted in higher sales, without spending lots of money on new printing plates (which my competitors assumed you needed to change labels). In this case, I used a technological advantage (new digital label printing) to compete on an industry-standard characteristic (label content) - I'm emphatically did NOT try to sell digital label printers to the gourmet packaged food industry.",1245855555

Not so much the rote repetition but the uninspired and dull methods of teaching.<p>At the moment I have been shoring up my math skills with a College Algebra text book, the book ""Mathematics for the Non Mathematician"" (highly recommended - it is the book that has re-inspired me to learn more math), and a tutor that meets with me for one hour once a week.<p>The tutor is an excellent resource - even though I don't remember everything I learn from him because my time is short and I can't always practice problems outside of our session; I still pick up tid-bits here and there.<p>Having an online resource geared specifically for hackers would be absolutely awesome - to sort of compliment everything we do for ourselves already, having a resource built by a hacker for hackers is very exciting.",1245855508

I remember playing, with the USA no-less, and sitting on a piece of land void of any oil. With time ticking on I sought the weakest opponent I could find and built a large, though somewhat outdated, fleet. I strategically planned a shock-and-awe tactic and managed to conquer the target city in a single turn. Then all the world hated me and the most powerful Civ declared war, wiping out my fleet in a single round with his well-fueled destroyers.<p>Such is history.<p>I lost that game.",1245855266

Obviously, the author knows that height is already taxed.<p>The real point is that some members of society are more productive than others.  Apparently, tall people are more productive than short people.  What we want to make equal (from a utilitarian point of view) is income per unit effort.  If you're from a disadvantaged background, but put as much effort as a person from an advantaged background, then you would make the same after-tax income.<p>He's demonstrating that this point of view is impractical in reality.",1245855174

There's a reason why we have shades on our windows (and don't build houses entirely out of windows), and I think it's more likely that this generation is going to rediscover those reasons than to discover they weren't necessary.<p>As an old fogey of 30 who has been on the net for a long time (by most standards now), one thing that I personally find very lacking in Facebook is that you can only have one identity. Probably the <i>biggest</i> reason I don't join Facebook is that the resulting collision of high school/social etc. (which I'm not that fond of anyhow and would face the choice of either ""friending"" a whole bunch of people I don't want to friend or offending them by rejecting them) and my tech/blog life would be very annoying for both sides and very, <i>very</i> annoying for me.<p>In fact, I think this is the root problem. If you had two personas online, one a party animal and one a professional one, that were only poorly linked, then we wouldn't have problems like ""you can't be hired because you have been pictured drinking"". Old technology did this by default; every forum, every newsgroup, every email chain I can be a new person, in fact I hardly have a choice.<p>We do this in real life all the time, even when deciding who to hire. Until that concept catches up with the online world in a bigger way, I think there's going to be trouble. The young'uns may yet be right that it's not a problem, though, because we may yet <i>return</i> to this idea. (I emphasize the word ""return"" to highlight that this is not a new idea, so going back to my first sentence, there is some hope that we can settle on this because, again, humanity hasn't changed and what worked once can work again. Those shades are there so that behind them, we can choose our persona freely in our own living space. They are not merely there to ""hide"" bad things, they are persona firewalls.)",1245854018

You can never go into public office if you've gotten publicly drunk, had an affair, smoked weed (Hi Bill Clinton)<p>So now we have this charade where people get their past sanitized and we live with a public/private schitzophrenia that is incredibly unhealthy.<p>I was born in 68 and I feel like I am stuck on both sides of this.
