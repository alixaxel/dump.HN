I think there are two ways of doing it:<p>1) The PR bot is actually a thinking human, and knows full well what he/she is doing. Just as ATB has done a PR-to-Human translation here, the PR bot does a Human-to-PR translation before posting.<p>2) The PR bot comes to sincerely believe the PR. This could be because he/she is just stupid, or because his/her salary depends on whatever is being pushed and this has subconsciously affected his/her brain.",1245283015

662690,comment,660066,661660,0,0,rjurney,,,"My suggestion is to do your marketing up front, concurrent with development, to get incremental buy-in and iterate concepts until you find a good one, instead of on the back-end.  I find you have much better results that way.  You can arrive at something that 'sells its self' by aggressive customer contact and pre-selling.  But in fact, it didn't 'sell itself,' you just did your marketing up front to make sure you built something people wanted to pay you for.<p>As to marketing being able to sell bad products, I reply: New Coke.  ;)",1245282709
662689,comment,662479,662615,0,0,russell,,,"Being the altruistic guy that I am, I read the article for you. :-)  (Not to mention that I was wondering my self.)<p>My take on LLVM is that it is a low level interpreter, near to the actual hardware.  Parrot probably is itself, but the big bonus with Parrot is that it inherits a huge library from Perl and CPAN.  That's the advantage for somebody developing a new language: an already existing massive library.  Like the advantage the Java VM has with all the class libraries.  This advantage is not so great if you are developing a language where the library violates the constraints of the language, e.g. immutable objects.<p>I surmise that Google went with LLVM for Python because Python already had that massive library and didnt need Perl's.  Both Parrot and LLVM are register based interpreters which give a nice speed improvement over stack based interpreters, like CPython and JVM.  The registers are an abstraction and dont have anything to do with the available machine registers.  Even compilers targeting real hardware use abstract registers internally.<p>A minor misstatement in the article.  Writing a parser is not hard.  There are a huge number of tools out there.  Parrot's is just one more.  And if your language is simple, hand coding a recursive descent parser isn't all that difficult.  It just isn't worth the effort.",1245282690

The ones who express safety concerns tend to be concerned by trucks and most don't consider cars at all.</i><p>And, yes, I'm concerned with the <i>prevalence of truck-sized vehicles</i>.  Thanks for finally getting on the same page, only requiring me to repeat the phrase 3 times.  (Though you seem to do this by claiming the concept as your own.)<p><i>I know a lot of people who have these vehicles, so I'm not assuming anything about them. I know that the vast majority use close to their vehicle's capacity an interesting amount of time even though they also do a lot of single-passenger driving.</i><p>Your sample size is, what, 12?  24?  Look, I'm not pretending to have a significant sample size, or rigorous methods, but in terms of people I've observed in Houston Rush Hour, it's more like 100's.  Also note that I'm not assuming anything about any individual.  I'm just thinking: ""My god, there are a <i>lot</i> of those goddamned things!""<p>Just because you know a handful of people who use their big vehicles a lot, doesn't mean you have anything resembling a <i>refutation</i> of my position.  At most you have some relevant anecdotes.  Please remember ""anecdotes are not data.""  Recalling a few anecdotes then declaring the someone <i>wrong</i> on their basis is an all too common display of mental fluffiness.<p><i>I certainly don't know why taking a couple of kids requires more equipment than invading France.</i><p>Been over in Europe lately?  We Americans just like driving much bigger vehicles than we really need to.  The marketing strategies of US auto manufacturers were designed to exploit this specifically.  Why is it some random guy in Tuscany can run a plumbing business with a little mini-pickup as small as an econobox hatchback, while my friend has to have his Ford Ranger to run his?  He'd love to spend 1/3rd as much on gas, but his customers would <i>look at him funny</i>.<p>By and large, the populace is brainwashed into doing things against their best economic interests.

Let me be clearer: I do not think that is right for me to do in this case, and I do not support doing it.<p>What do you mean by ""right""? The point I was making is that <i>you have to make the choice</i>. Life is something you participate in. You have an obligation to make the choice. Quite frankly I don't care which one you pick. I chose not to support hacking their sites. You may choose otherwise. Or not. Instead of just asking ""what makes it OK?"" perhaps the better question is ""How is this different from X for me?"" It's your job to figure out your own rules; not go around saying the problem is insolvable. That's whacked. Nobody is looking for a universal solution. What's required is a personal choice.

662686,comment,662620,662620,0,0,ATB,,,"It's interesting to see PR in action, especially as Proggit, HN, and several popular blogs have been sounding the HTML5-induced death knell for Flash in the last week or so. Translating the double-speak is actually good fun in this case. With all due respect to Jon Gruber, here is the PR-to-Human translation of this link:<p><i>The current WhatWG proposals called ""HTML 5"" have been stirring up a lot of polarizing speech lately</i><p>Positive attention to new technologies is only beneficial if Adobe has a clear monetization strategy for them. So we will introduce a controversy and try our best to make it ""polarizing.""<p><i>It's hard for Adobe to have an official opinion</i><p>But unofficially, Adobe will do everything possible to undermine the excitement over HTML5 and torpedo it at all cost.<p><i>whatever this consortium of minority browser vendors chooses to do</i><p>MINORITY. Get it? Unsupported! Unofficial! What happens if the minority goes away? Don't buy Tucker. Buy GM.<p><i>seeing what the final agreement turns out to be, and how it is eventually manifested in the world, both are prerequisites for practical tool-making</i><p>Given that we are a tool vendor, this is the only interesting part. And since we largely control the tool market for our tech, this is a major threat to us.<p><i>Still, I'm glad that an analyst asked a question about it at the quarterly financial call. Here's what Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen had to say</i><p>What a threatened tool vendor CEO has to say is what you should use to form your opinion about a technology and its future viability.<p><i>I think the challenge for HTLM 5 will continue to be how do you get a consistent display of HTML 5 across browsers</i><p>The biggest challenge for HTML5 will be the constant undermining from companies that see their current tool strategy and quasi-monopoly threatened, such as us.<p><i>And when you think about when the rollout plans that are currently being talked about, they feel like it might be a decade before HTML 5 sees standardization across the number of browsers that are going to be out there.</i><p>If we keep repeating the fear of how long it might take to implement again and again, it will take even longer. Your hesitation equals cold hard cash for us.<p><i>we still think that actually the fragmentation of browsers makes Flash even more important rather than less important</i><p>When asked about a potential competitor, I always mention how its rise will make our product more important. Because that's what the board pays me to do.<p><i>Adobe's about communicating your ideas -- publishing to various channels -- not just about Flash. Dreamweaver, ColdFusion and the imaging tools all benefit from an increase in HTML.</i><p>Hey guys, remember ColdFusion? ... Guys?<p><i>Adobe profits from easing communication in general</i><p>Positive communication about Adobe products. And sowing FUD about competitors. But since Slashdot posters ran the term 'FUD' into the ground ten years ago, you can't use it anymore without being derided. SCORE!<p><i>Flash is a strong bet for emerging platforms</i><p>I'm high as a kite.<p><i>I'm increasingly uncomfortable with calling the WhatWG proposals ""HTML 5"" though</i><p>Giving something that might become a standard the appearance of legitimacy is dangerous to our business model. Open standards are the enemy of our proprietary tools.<p><i>What counts is not a press release, but a realworld deliverable</i><p>What is not deliverable, for instance, is Flash on iPhone and possibly many other portable devices, which appear to be the biggest growth market/land rush of the next decade. Allowing an open competitor like HTML5 to dominate that market would be fatal for us.<p><i>Shantanu's last point in there really resonates with me</i><p>Please give me a raise.<p><i>this whole ""HTML5"" campaign will likely benefit Flash, because few remain who oppose the idea that ""experience matters""</i><p>Our experience in making cold hard cash from selling Flash tools matters the most. Using ""scare quotes"" will help de-legitimize HTML5.<p><i>Things are quite a bit different than five years ago.</i><p>We now have a virtual monopoly on serving casual video on the web. We will fight anything that threatens us.<p><i>iPhone helped to radically increase the number of phones with Flash support</i><p>The new QuickTime X plays Flash videos natively. We might be screwed.<p><i>the ""HTML5"" publicity helps marginalize those few who still argue that images, animation, audio/video and rich interactivity have no place on the web</i><p>HTML5 uses open standards to play those file formats natively, which severely undercuts our tool/server profits.<p><i>Flash will be able to deliver on those heightened expectations, regardless of what each separate browser engine does.</i><p>Fuck you, WHATWG, Chrome, Mozilla, Safari.",1245282597

As programming has gotten more reliable, we've tackled larger problems, and we continue to wish to tackle larger problems.
