Looks like they don't know what HTML5 is nor the state of its support in current browsers: pretty much all (but IE, of course) already have some support for it. Not sure how that makes minority of browsers, not to mention, that browsers on the new smartphones which are worth something are Webkit based—and that means support for HTML5. Apple specifically advertises HTML5 and CSS3 on its Safari webpage ( <a href=""http://www.apple.com/safari/what-is.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/safari/what-is.html</a> ).<p>I completely fail to see how the release of iPhone ""helped to radically increase the number of phones with Flash support"". If it did help something this is to realize that we can do
just fine without Flash.<p>So no, you don't need to wait ten years before HTML5 arrives, it is already on your doorstep (have you seen Google Wave?). There will be no wait, so ""during that wait, Flash becomes more and more powerful"" doesn't come to fruition. Adobe still cannot make Flash to run without hogging resources on anything but Windows, do they think I will buy this ""more powerful"" crap?<p>I don't think that HTML5 will kill Flash though, but if it forces Flash out of the places
there it does not belong (full flash sites, flash navigation, etc.) Web will be a better place and I will be a lot happier.",1245283615
