I am wondering if other people in the Bay Area with access to the SDK, would like to meet up once/twice a week at some coffee shop, library or any other place and help each other out.<p>It would be a good opportunity to learn, teach and network with fellow developers and maybe even create teams for future.<p>Cheers.",1246121939

So unless you're Native American, it doesn't really matter.<p>More importantly, 10,000 years is enough time to see some evolution, but when we are talking about the ""diet we evolved for"" the time-scale to look for is probably 100,000 years at least. 10,000 years is enough time to have evolved resistance, but not much more: Europeans get less obesity and diabetes on the ""Western diet"" than other peoples who have had agriculture for shorter periods of time. But that doesn't make the Western diet great for them. Agriculture was the biggest human health disaster ever recorded (read Jared Diamond's essay on this).<p>Grains were not a substantial part of the human diet until agriculture. Tubers and vegetables were to some degree. Fruits like anything you'd find in a modern supermarket were simply not available in most climates.<p>95% of calories from meat is too high for anybody except the Inuit. I think estimates are closer to 60% or so. But the Cambridge world history of food volume one is a good resource. Basically, it's a matter of looking at those hunter-gatherers who are left over and seeing what they eat. Of course, the hunter-gatherers who are left are naturally in the most inhospitable areas of the globe (otherwise the agriculturalists would have killed them all by now). So it's not an exact science by any means.",1246121746

So many well-known sites are publishing terrible native apps for the iPhone which could have been much more effectively implemented by some CSS/js tweaks.<p>For instance, the PayPal app is utterly terrible, and gives only a fraction of the functionality you get from PayPal's full site.  A few weeks, at most, could turn the PayPal site into an incredible custom iPhone web app.<p>And to add insult to injury, they don't even take advantage of the benefits that a native app gives you on the iPhone. For instance, they don't use the keychain to securely store login credentials so you don't have to re-login each time you launch the application (if the user requests it).",1246121477

Recall, Kirkhoff's law dictates that the security of a cryptosystem must not depend on the secrecy of the system itself, but on the secrecy of the key's involved (and probably P != NP).
And now, remember again: There are some ridiculous well-going open source programs (linux, gcc, ...) and even more, there are certain really well going commercial open source systems (such as mysql). Thus, I am pretty curious, if there is a similar kirkhoffs law for software (as in: the commercial success of a software can be achieved even without keeping the source secret, or something similar).",1246118501
