As most biologists understand (since Gould & Lewontin's 1979 ""Critique of the Adaptationist Program"", anyway), evolution makes mistakes and leads to nonoptimal outcomes. There is every reason to believe that conscious human design can construct better systems than some sort of anarchical survival-of-the-fittest scheme.<p>In fact, saying so is blisteringly obvious. Virtually every human accomplishment has required conscious design. Evolution by natural selection could never have designed a wheel -- but we did.

635336,comment,635192,635192,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I hate to be the cynic here but I think you need to really change your attitude if you want to succeed in life.   To me your post seems to be ""I sort of like computers and my life isn’t working out the way I want so I now want to pursue computers because it looks like my best chance out of the life I’m living""<p>Well, sorry to say, that isn’t how it works.  Don’t get me wrong, if you really work at it I’m sure you can do it but you are WAY behind the curve if you’re 20 years old and have done nothing but tinker with BASIC and C.  That said here's my advice...<p>First, accept you need to work day and night to accomplish your goal.  Again, you’re already way behind so you have a lot of catch up to do just to be competent.  You should be looking at 70 to 80 hour weeks of pure hard work (including your grocery job).<p>Second, learn Python (or some other language) backwards and forwards before you even start anything else.  Tinkering doesn’t prove anything.  Anyone can write a ""hello world"" app but true programmers have to think in a very specific, logical fashion.  You might not have the aptitude for that and there’s no point wasting time pursuing this goal if you’ll never be able to get good at it.   You can learn everything you need to know with a search engine these days so there’s no excuse here.<p>Third, stop thinking in generalizations.  No one succeeds by saying ""I want to found a start up.""  You need to latch on to an actual idea and you need to start working on it as soon as you are able.  From where you live and the experience you have I figure you’ll need to create a whole product just to interest anyone.<p>Again, I apologize for the harsh tone but I think it’s justified.  As rude as it sounds someone who gets in your position usually doesn’t get out.  Getting out will not only be the hardest thing you ever do it will be close to the hardest thing anyone’s ever done.  You literally have to remake yourself at a time when many of your instincts have already been formed.  It’s not easy, it’s not fun and it will be tons of work and tons of time before you see even a little bit of results.<p>But if you want to succeed you have to commit yourself to that reality.",1243820802
635334,comment,635217,635236,0,0,splat,,,"<i>""This word ""over-regulation"" and these arguments about government intervention are all bogus. It is because the government backed off what many called ""over-regulation"" that we are in the very mess we are in!""</i><p>This may be what some website with an agenda told you, but unfortunately reality is a little more complicated than that.  This crisis has a number of causes and the economists who have been studying it from the beginning still don't fully understand it.  True, the repeal of certain regulations was an important factor.  But another important cause was excessive encouragement by the government for homeownership.  This sort of ""over-regulation"" was certainly disastrous.<p>The point this article is trying to make is that the notion of ""spontaneous order"" is fundamental to both the theory of evolution and the free market.  One would be hard pressed to design from scratch a working flamingo, and one would similarly be hard pressed to design from scratch a working economy.  Both are extremely complicated systems and one cannot make a change to a single part without watching the consequences ripple out to affect seemingly distant parts of the system.<p>In the case of biology we can perform experiments so that we can isolate the specific effects of a particular action.  This is what makes medicine work.  A pharmaceutical company does not make the right drug on its first go--it tries thousands of chemicals before getting anything that works.  Unfortunately, we cannot do this in the economy--it won't fit in a test tube.  If Congress changes a certain regulation, the effects of this change will be felt in distant parts of the economy in ways that no one could have predicted.  But because we can never have a ""control economy,"" we will never be able to figure out what those effects were, exactly.  In effect, we're hoping that we can come up with the right drug on the first go.  This is nothing more than the Law of Unintended Consequences.  Perhaps there exist certain regulations that would make the economy run more efficiently--but until we can apply the scientific method to the economy, we will never be able to definitively determine what they are.",1243820683

You need a job, a drivers licenses, and a residence for X amount of time.  Check the local laws.  Figure out which of your courses transfer.  Figure out how to work the system so you can graduate in two years.  You'll be 23 or 24 and have a degree from a top 10 computer science department.  Sounds like a pretty damn good life to me.<p>Now let's talk some more specifics.  You'll probably need another year to establish residency in Georgia.  In that time, you need to make yourself a more attractive candidate so you can get in.  If you can, get yourself down to Georgia Tech and get a job around there. A system admin job in the school's IT department would be ideal.  Sit in on classes, conference with admissions officers, and call in any favors you have to get a good recommendation from someone in high school.  Study for the ACT (or SAT if GT doesn't take the ACT).  Honestly with half a year of preparation you can raise your score a ton.  A strong standardized test would improve your application a lot.  Take classes at a community college for a semester near GT.  Get at least two kick ass recommendations from professors there and make sure you get a 3.5 GPA or higher.  Note, getting good recommendations is an easy process.  Just let your enthusiasm for computer science show, go in to the professors office hours to ask questions, and work on an independent project with them.  Honestly, since GT is a public school, there are probably incentives in place to take a certain number of community college students per year and that can help you.<p>Some people here might advise you to teach yourself what you need and try to make it on your own.  Let's be realistic.  You don't even know if you are capable of working hard yet on highly technical projects.  School will teach you that, and give you the ability to get a job if starting a company doesn't work out.<p>To give you a bottom line, you need an associates degree, at least a 3.5 GPA (> 3.7 is much better) in your community college classes, and at least two excellent recommendations from professors there.  You also need a kick ass essay, which you should spend a lot of time writing and sharing with people.  Any personal connection you can establish with people at the school before you apply is just an added bonus.   You can make it happen, and three years from now the world will look completely different.",1243820023

635298,comment,635192,635192,0,0,iigs,,,"Hello. A lot of your early years sound very similar to mine: Liked computers, grew up in a place where nobody knew/cared about them, was smart but never worked very hard, got by in school but never excelled. I lucked out and knew a professor that knew someone and when I dropped out of college I left for industry and have been able to keep inertia up to where I am. My advice:<p>1) Keep Moving. If I only had two words to tell you it would be those. You're behind the eight-ball as far as education, math in particular, goes but you can fix that... but it's not going to fix itself. Take any other classes you can in parallel but Just. Don't. Stop. What you're looking at as an crushing, insurmountable mountain of work is really only a few years.<p>2) Get a degree in a field you care about and can find work in. The school doesn't really matter. The old ""just get the piece of paper"" advice is generally considered deprecated, but you <i>do</i> need to have the skills. Unless you go somewhere that is actively known for its bad program (and even then that's only likely to be known locally) it will be a net positive.<p>3) Attempt to seek out people that are smarter and more curious than you are. I can relate to your high school experience, and I don't have a lot of hopeful to say about the people that stayed in the town I grew up in. Always keep your eyes open, though; you may find people that seem smart at first that don't seem like it after you see their weaknesses.<p>4) The ""cities full of intelligence and ambition"" thing is romantic but won't pay the bills. Be on the lookout for cities that have a solid economy and job opportunities for people with your skills and education. I suspect you'll do better more toward the west than the (north-)east, but I don't know much about the south-east. You may be better off right now than you know.<p>5) Use your desire to learn about geek stuff (SICP, Python, et. al.) to feed your general sense of curiosity, and your ""technical taste"" but don't bank on it for preparation for entrepreneur-hood. {major dissenting opinion ahead} I believe that people searching for the next big thing in the fields of the last big thing are generally wasting their time. Too bad for me (and possibly you) this industry is what I love. Tech is a great industry to be working in, but every big thing started with an itch to scratch.<p>Good luck!",1243818516

You make a good point, but part of the reasoning behind modern receipts (of the kind you hate) is that thermal paper involves the least amount of operator overhead - put in a new roll every so often, no need to worry about separate ink cartridges etc., plus they're fast.<p>If you want to propose an alternative, I'd start by obtaining a copy of Quicken POS (a common piece of software) and a consumer photo printer, to see how practical it is to print out custom receipts. Then you could look into commercial volume printing solutions and see what sort of budget you'd be looking at.",1243818459

Have any of you touting regulation to 'correctly align incentives' considered how much regulation has existed already?<p>From the GSE's (Fannie and Freddie), the SEC, the mere existence of a central bank, to scores and scores of other existing government interventions in the economy, what we've seen in the past few decades cannot really be called free-market capitalism.<p>The current crisis clearly indicates that something is broken. That we have too much regulation is as plausible an explanation as that we have too little. And yet, very few people seem to even acknowledge this fact.",1243818407

It's that the teams that were beaten by the full court press thought it broke some sort of unwritten rule of youth basketball that supposedly reads, ""don't full court press"".<p>The whole point of the article is that in areas of competition or warfare, very often, one side lives (and sometimes dies) by obeying rules that don't actually exist. Goliath thought that, win or lose, the battle should happen hand to hand and David knew to use a sling and a rock to his advantage.<p>When one side is playing by a certain set of rules that the other side doesn't have to acknowledge, then the side with fewer rules has an advantage.

We are fighting for the very existence of intelligence in the universe. We are fighting to preserve the most unique thing we know that exists -- life itself.""</i><p>That sounds terribly naive to me. According to the gene-centric view of evolution, that is completely wrong.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution</a><p>I like to watch documentaries about simians because they're the animals closest to humans. They live in society, share tasks, and generally do a lot of things humans do. Some male simians even pay for sex! It happens that the alpha male gets to impregnate most females of the group, and most males are left with nothing. These males obviously don't like being reproductive losers and rebel against the <i>status quo</i>. They will try to kill the alpha male and fight among themselves to see who the new alpha male will be. They will kill the former alpha male's babies so that they can impregnate the females and let these take care of their offspring, not someone else's offspring. They don't care a fig about the species, they care about fulfilling their biological role, which is to procreate with the best females of the pack.<p>Humans are not monkeys, but most of us aren't that different in terms of behavior. Given that there are limited resources such as food and fertile females, caring about the species makes little sense to most animals. Maybe it makes some sense to humans, but I personally think that's baloney. We have evolved beyong the basic primate level, but not as much as some people think.",1243818196
