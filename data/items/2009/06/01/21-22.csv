It buys you time, to match their improvement, or even improve on them. Therefore, in tech, I think competitive advantage should be measured in <i>time</i>  * : our good image gives us 1 week; user inertia is 1 year; adapting to another interface is 3 weeks; our server farm speed is 6 months; PageRank is 2 months.<p>These times only come into play when a competitor offers something better in some way (if there's nothing better, then these timers aren't engaged). It's like a better product is a pressure or voltage differential, and the competitive advantage is the resistance.<p>Of course, when you're ahead is the time to grow your competitive advantage, even though it's not needed, so that you have it when it is needed. It's an investment. The parts of the model are: the users you have; the relative attractiveness of a competing product; and what stops your users from switching.<p>Actually, I think this is just one kind of competitive advantage, and it only covers existing users (not new ones). For a start up, it's not enough to just retain users, you need to get them in the first place. You're better off focusing on getting them (by increasing the relative attractiveness of your product) rather than stopping them from switching... but Warren Buffett is always going on about competitive advantage - what exactly does he mean?<p>[ * ] for half their users to switch",1243892343

It uses <canvas> heavily so no Internet Explorer either, sorry microsoft (and google's ex-canvas doesn't do the trick, it doesn't have all the features iconfu needs).<p>In a previous life I developed web applications at a bank and occasionally we needed icons. Finding the right icon was next to impossible, and MSPaint was our only option for drawing. Most frustratingly of all, in many cases all we needed to do was take a little ""adjective"" icon (a miniscule '+' or '!' for example) and overlay it on an icon we already had ... not possible.<p>I figured there had to be a better way, so I quit my cosy job to make iconfu. Technically, it does almost everything I'd want an icon editor to do - especially drawing a given icon on top of another icon. And drawing icons, pixel-by-pixel if necessary. There are some neat features I'd like to add - layers, more HSV controls, multiple parallel edits for example - but not yet.

I'm sorry, but China has a notorious history of political instability, only two times in history has it <i>not</i> been in Civil War.

But the flip side of that is that there's a lot of other events of a similar nature, but with less of a geeky focus, that I'm afraid I wouldn't see. If they're not manually added, how are you ensuring that all events that could be potentially targeted are included?<p>2) It might be nice to include a throttle for the refresh speed. 5 seconds, for a high-volume item like the BEA, was total information overload.<p>EDIT: I should be more precise about #2.

Offroaders do too, but the segment is infinitely smaller.<p>It seems to me that the car is not built for the demographic you are targeting.<p>a) Design: lower the chassis, and the car is pretty much the ideal design of what a hybrid coupe would look like. An offroader should look mean. It shouldn't look out of place covered in mud.<p>b) Engine: Expensive to modify, expensive to maintain, requires a space shuttle manual to work on.<p>c) Price point I know it says 50K, but we all know that its going to be higher once production begins. I just don't see that there'd be such a high demand for a 50K+ dedicated offroader. Not unless the thing completely trounces its competition.<p>Take a look at Bowler Wildcat/Nemesis cars, thats pretty much what you are going to be competing with in your price range. And those things have actual racing pedigree with tons of wins under their belt.<p>Anyways back to the sports car market. Yes its a saturated market, but its so much bigger than the offroad market. There is plenty of space as long as you build something people will want. And you have the whole build by people like you thing going for you, which would have helped.<p>To me, if I were in your shoes I'd scrap the whole offroader idea and build a sports car.
