Perhaps ""NSFW"" is too localized to actually be the name of the tag, but I think there should be a tag that means ""give a warning before displaying this content.""  It would cover NSFW stuff, but could also work for spoilers, or answers to a quiz, etc.  There's no way there could be culpability for omitting this sort of tag since it IS a value judgment, just like <em>.",1245027500

657765,comment,657369,657369,0,0,bokonist,,,"The rust belt cities have been the victims of two great forces, one internal, one external.<p>The internal force is the incompetence of democratic city governance. Detroit had utterly incompetent elected leaders who in the 1960's and 70's allowed rioters to loot and burn large swaths of the city. Homicide rates rose by an order of magnitude. If you look at homicide rates in Europe, you have to back to the 12th century to find homicide rates as high as those in modern Detroit. Order and security are base requirements for economically productive societies. When the violence came, industries and productive residents fled. This process happened in major cities across the country: St. Louis, New Haven, Cleveland, Baltimore, etc.<p>Unfortunately, in a democracy the quality of government is proportionate to the human capital of the voting population.  Now that the human capital has left, effective governance is even more unlikely.  Thus the prospects for Detroit look grim indeed.  The only hope is to put the city into receievership and grant a competent executive the authority to clean up the city (perhaps this would be a good job for General Petraeus).<p>The second factor is the American seinorage empire. Since the end of Bretton Woods in 1971 the primary export of the United States has been its own currency. China, Japan, Korea, etc, ship cars and steel to the United States. The U.S. ships back freighters full of dollars in return. As a result of China and Japan buying the currency, the exchange rate is artificially low. That makes it very hard for domestic manufacturers to compete with the Asian producers. What should have happened is that as American industries failed, we would have less exports which would weaken the dollar, making foreign products more expensive, thus increasing the profits of domestic manufacturers and stopping the cycle of decay. Instead, China and Japan continued to ship us cheap goods, and in return bought treasuries and financial products from Wall St. This greatly enriched the U.S. government and Wall St., but screwed over domestic manufacturers. The result was a growth in ""service jobs"" which were essentially jobs feeding off of the ever growing Washington bureaucracy. The United States is playing the role of 16th Century Spain. It exports a currency in return for foreign goods, while the domestic industries die.<p>The final blow to Detroit has been dealt by monetary incompetence on the part of Washington. The U.S. is currently experiencing a monetary contraction. Monetary contractions should never happen with competent economic stewardship. The government can always simply renominate the currency and avoid the problem. When a monetary contraction does occur, people dramatically cut spending on durable goods. Thus again, Detroit is punished for events completely outside of its own control.",1245027324

As illogical as it is, tenure-track positioning is generally related to research skill, as opposed to pedagogical interest and/or ability. Most large universities would prefer to have great researchers (who publish works with the schools' name on them) who teach as needed and without passion, as opposed to the other way around.",1245026862

657753,comment,657119,657389,0,0,JimmyL,,,"The presence of ""freedom of choice"" for the consumer depends on how you look at the industry. From a student's perspective, there is no real choice - you use the textbook you're assigned. Some professors will offer a few alternatives, but unless they're very diligent about always giving references to each book (and I had a few professors who did this well), the students who use the number-one book - the one the professor uses when he's lecturing and doing examples - will generally have a better idea of the material and the standard they'll be evaluated on.<p>From the professor's point of view (considering them as the consumer), however, there's quite a free market. They can get free evaluation copies of any textbook they want, and most schools give individual professors the choice of what book they use for a given class. So the problem then becomes getting professors to switch textbooks, which is tough. Most professors - especially in things like science - will teach the same courses year-on, and will become very comfortable with the material in a given book. They'll know what to skip, what to supplement, and what to offer additional comments on.",1245026518
