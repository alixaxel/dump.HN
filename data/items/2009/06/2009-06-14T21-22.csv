The only reason I'd ever put them in functions is to avoid circular import issues.<p>There's really no need to use comments; reading the module should be enough to figure out what the grouping is. My only convention is sticking all the global imports in one line at the top (PEP be damned) and grouping stuff from there.<p><pre><code>  import os, sys, datetime, xmlrpclib

I love reading biographies of people on Wikipedia that shows chronologically how they came to realize or produce something great.  What was it that led them to their ideas?  How did they become so productive?  Did they meet someone, read something, or had some other type of epiphany?
