Most people are, in fact, not employable as software developers.<p>The funny thing is, I actually found the Indian outsourcing teams I worked with nearly unusable as well.  It may have to do with culture.<p>I gave broad, general guidance about what we needed to do (store the millions of variables in a non-linear program in memory in an efficient data structure), and I got back code that used <i>arrays</i>.  It's just one single example, of course, but a result like that is enough to want to dismiss the entire team and start over.<p>But you know, I doubt Americans are producing all that many programmers who can do this either.",1245679103
668745,story,,,4,20,log0,"Ask HN: How bad is the decision to work as a co-founder without legal contracts?",,"Thanks for reading.<p>Hi all, this has been biting me a bit.<p>I've been invited to be a coder ( me + 2 coders and the organizer as ux ) to a startup, and was verbally promised a share of the revenue ( equal ). The organizer is not a close-friend, but merely someone who invites me because I suited the capabilities.<p>The idea is quite nice, not era-shifting though, and looks like there are going to be a lot to learn side-by-side, too : lega, marketing, business stuffs I don't know and never did before. However, all of these said future have no legal contracts until the <i>formal registration</i> of the company ( where names are formally noted, and registered to the government ), which is when revenues start pumping in.<p>The startup requires devotion other than my full-time day job, which I can use to do other stuffs ( meaningful and constructive ). It's going to be a year or so. I am thinking without a legal contract guaranteeing the benefits of each member, it can be dangerous to me ( and the other memebrs ), as ""coders are expendable"". There will be no salary.<p>My best case :
Idea goes live and launches. Profits come in, I get my shares. I learnt how to do business. And promising future.<p>Best case out of bad cases :
Idea goes live and launches. Died soon, I get my shares. I learnt how to do business.<p>Bad case :
Idea dies halfway. Initial projection of time dragged too much. I learnt how to do business, albeit at a cost of time and more.<p>My worst case :
Idea goes live. Initial projection of time dragged. But the organizer plays dishonesty and kicks me / other coders out, taking the whole share.<p>My questions :<p>1. Without the legal contract, how bad will things be if things blow up?<p>2. From past experiences of you, do people really respect verbal agreements?<p>3. Could there be any legal issues on me?<p>4. What could I do without a written agreement witnessed by a lawyer?<p>5. What could I do without an informal written agreement ( no lawyers involved )?<p>I understand there is a risk to take, and I also understand that ""getting excited by the future"" could be the height of a folly, but then I might be wrong. I also understand that despite the risk, this failing in most cases could teach me a good deal of lesson, too.<p>I appreciate any smart advice from you all experienced people.<p>Thank you very much.<p>[edited linebreaks of questions.]",1245679102

Certainly a clear-eyed analysis shows that ""genius"" is really a set of exceptional skills cultivated through disciplined study. We should probably shelve the notion of genius as an innate, almost irrepressible gift and speak instead of expertise, talent or even greatness - terms that hint at the work underlying supreme accomplishment.</i><p>Perhaps we should kill the notion of genius, although the author seems to consider genus soley as someone who achieves the highest heights, while the traditional understanding of a genius is someone who is exceptionaly intelligent, regardless of their achievements. I do not know is such people do exist, however there are individuals with a very low intelligence hence perhaps it is safe to assume that there are individuals with a very high intelligence.<p>More importantly however, the author seems to disregard intelligence and emphasise work, while in truth both of them are needed as much. In the crem dela cream, most of those people got there by working very hard and putting in the hours, as most of them have this passion therefore, the winner will be the one who has a slightly higher intelligence.<p>Not in any way to undermine the effect of the environment, but the environment is something we can control as such it is a good bet many other people are on an equal level ""nurture"" speaking, but as we can not control our innate ability, then the winner I suppose is the one who has a higher ""intelligence.",1245676460

There are tons of startups that could only be done in India, and not in America. These startups need to be done by Indians, not by Americans.

Compare Kraftwerk with Tiesto or ATB for example to see what I mean.  You may need to listen to trance for a while to be able to distinguish between, say, Goa and Psychedelic, but saying that all genres of electronic music are ultimately the same thing comes across as ignorant.  (I understand that any electronic music sounds like noise to some people, but it's a genre as rich and diverse as any other.)",1245676042
