642643,comment,641332,641440,0,0,embeddedradical,,,"I've been using VitaList, and the best part is that they have an API (JSON or XML).  I made a small app that fills in the one thing Vitalist doesn't have, auto scheduling.  I know there's calendars, but I like for some things to just show up in my todo at certain times of a month, or once every few months, or every other week and putting 'Do Laundry' on every friday in my calendar is no good.  Calendars don't auto roll tasks onward too, and I might not do my laundry on Friday, but by fridays its time to do that in the upcoming few days, so a rolling todo is better.  VitaList is iPhone friendly as well, so I get my todo to go.<p>Once I thought they had lost my data.  Turns out if you change your password and log back in with your old password, you get some weird old data from I don't know when -- this resulted in my recreating about 75% of VitaList on a Friday, and then realized I had not lost my data and stopped.  I'm keeping that code around, just in case they start charging for the API or something... :).<p>edit: one more thing, i find the view by context feature really handy - my contexts are ""home"" ""work"" ""errands"" - and being able to quickly group by that (or by project) is nice.",1244172774
642642,comment,642568,642568,0,0,chops,,,"Power users are definitely useful, but I find that catering too much to the power users (who are more willing to try new things and have more specific feature requests) results in the end in a product that may be a little overwhelming to new users.<p>But yes, the power users are very important and must be nurtured to help generate more users.

642631,comment,642254,642453,0,0,cameldrv,,,"Thunderstorms can kill in a variety of ways -- the turbulence isn't your only problem, although I wouldn't bet that a storm as severe as this one (50kft tops) couldn't have done it.<p>The kind of bumps you get in something like that aren't what you think of as turbulence in a plane.  Airlines have radar and always go around the big cells.  This one would have been strong enough to fling people out of their seats and kill them from blunt force impact with the interior of the plane.<p>Second, in a thunderstorm, you have lots of rain, which if strong enough can interfere with the engines.  There is also hail which can do significant damage to the skin of the plane and make it very difficult to handle.  Third, there is lightning, and while airliners are supposed to be able to take a lighting strike, there are different types of lightning, and ""positive lighting"" has been known to poke holes in airplanes otherwise believed to be protected.  Fourth, there can be lots and lots of ice.  Airbus has already issued a letter warning of the danger of pitot icing as a result of this crash, and they know that at least one of the airspeed indicators wasn't working properly, probably because it was iced over.<p>Furthermore, with extreme turbulence, it can be difficult to even read the instruments.  With lighting going off all around you, no visible horizon, and you being vibrated and thrown around in your seatbelts, it is very easy to become disoriented and lose control, possibly to the point of overstressing the airframe and ripping it apart.<p>A thunderstorm like this is about the most dangerous place for an airplane to be.  I'm certain that one way or another, that is what did them in.",1244171453

This resonates with my own experience.<p>With no disrespect intended, the early adopters in many markets are a little like heroin junkies willing to try anything new for 5 minutes. This may look great from a user registration perspective but, in general, these people have very little interest in buying into your long term vision.<p>Coming from a B2B background, I'm still working out the best way to engage at a deep level connections made through online marketing for hosted apps and getting that long term buy-in, if it's even possible. It's easier (for me anyway) to do this face-to-face because there is a more solid context for the relationship.",1244171399
