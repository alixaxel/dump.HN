Instead, he shows that what's wrong is the notion that economic survival/success is simple.  Instead, it's complicated - fitness functions are unknown, context sensitive, and variable, just like life.  And, whenever organisms interact, so do their fitness functions.<p>The only people who don't understand that are the ones thinking that they can buy silver bullets.",1245023601

657718,comment,657573,657573,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>If you’re not happy with your job, instead of re-organizing your life so you can be a vagabond, consider looking for a more interesting line of work.</i><p>Why? This statement makes the fallacy that happiness comes from the <i>type</i> and <i>duration</i> of labor, rather the overall <i>fruits</i> of any labor you choose to do. If being a ""vagabond"" (in the Tim Ferriss sense) results in more net happiness than that attained by someone who loves their ""interesting line of work"" then being a vagabond is still advantageous.<p><i>I also have grave doubts that there are that many business models out their that will support this sort of hands-off management.</i><p>The most popular business models clearly do. The majority of large and mid-sized companies - as well as many small ones - operate with ""hands-off management"" from the people who take most of the profits. Shareholders do little work for the corporations in which they hold shares but still, often, collect the largest profits. Even ignoring shareholders, well structured companies over a certain size are not reliant on <i>obligatory</i> day-to-day management by a single person. That's what tiers of management and boards are for. If Steve Ballmer chose to run away to Thailand for a few months to go kick boxing, Microsoft isn't going to stop producing a tubload of cash each month.<p><i>Among other things, the people doing the actual real work may become disgruntled at the absentee landlord. But hey, if it works for you...</i><p>Why? There's almost no precedent for this except in situations where the workers are being mistreated or underpaid. Larry Ellison spends lots of time on his yacht, flying planes, and whatever, but are Oracle employees generally ""disgruntled"" by this? If so, what rationale would they have unless they believed Ellison's permanent presence were to have a significant effect on their paychecks or job security?",1245023381
657717,comment,657369,657369,0,0,reduxredacted,,,"""The problem is that economic growth in the US over the past several decades has largely been driven by urban development (for which read: suburban sprawl)""<p>Detroit is a nightmare, and I don't think there are many people who fully understand just how bad it is out here unless you live around here.<p>There are basically three pockets of Detroit that you can walk around on-foot.  Take a ride on ""The People Mover"" (a very poorly thought out monorail) and you'll run through areas of Downtown that are good and areas of Downtown that look like they were used for bombing practice.  Venture beyond Downtown, and you understand why some property in Detroit is selling for $1 and why that's highway robbery.<p>I used to do contract work for several companies.  One of our companies was a charter school just on the edge of the border of Detroit.  You'd take Mound Rd. to get there.  Mound is a mile south of Van Dyke, which starts in the heart of Downtown and ends in farm country.  The progression was clear...the closer you got to the edge of Detroit the more things started looking like a third world country.<p>It's subtle at first: recognizable brand names start to become very sparse.  Then occupied buildings in places other than intersections vanish.  The intersections are littered with Check Cashing Liqour/General stores.  Those are replaced in kind by the same but with bars on the windows and graffiti everywhere and eventually even those are gone replaced by what was once a Liquor store but is now a square of abandoned cement.<p>My parents and my wife's parents all lived in Detroit when they were young, as did all of their friends.  They got out when crime went up.  With the plummeting price of housing, even those who were once way too poor to live outside The City are getting out.  Crime has increased in the area I live, but violent crime is still rare.  Those who can find a way out, get out.<p>The city's decline won't stop.  The burbs have created ""The City"" experience with great restaurants, great entertainment venues, great shopping and safe living.<p>Most of Detroit's Mayors were of the quality of Kwame Kilpatrick (other than Dennis Archer).  The people of the city resent the folks who left, and folks running for mayor or city counsel do best if they blame Detroit's problems on the suburbs.",1245023331
