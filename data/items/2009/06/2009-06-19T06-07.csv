Not because of the family ties between the companies, but because why does Google want or need to own a piece of a biotech company?</i><p>At the risk of belaboring the obvious, Google wants to own a piece of a biotechnology company because it is owned by the wife of one of the founders.  If nepotism were a phenomenon unknown to the human experience, we wouldn't have a word for it.<p>Theoretically, adult supervision is supposed to intervene at some point and say ""Um, this is both embarrassing and a waste of our shareholders' resources bordering on embezzlement, perhaps we should reconsider?"" but, even in a straight-laced old-economy company, it happens occasionally.  People also occasionally get thrown on out on their rumps for it, and for less than $2 million, too.",1245394684

Still, that's an excessive fine.<p>All legal systems that I know are completely broken because the consequences of losing are so different for the parties involved. For that woman, losing the case means total financial ruin for the rest of her life. If the RIAA had lost, it would be just a blip in their legal budget if anything.<p>In my view, the right way to set fines would be to ask, what percentage of their profit have record companies lost due to the actions of that woman. She should be fined that same percentage of her disposable income (excluding minimum wage).",1245394124

She also admitted that she followed the court case that shut Napster down and knew that it was not legal. Given her knowledge and experience with file-sharing, her claim never to have heard of KaZaA and never to have downloaded files might seem suspect.""",1245393896

664737,comment,664621,664705,0,0,rjurney,,,"'The next big thing' may not be the default model in the valley - in fact I was impressed by the thousands of startups building tools for the guy at the 'next bench.'<p>Unfortunately though, the 'Next Big Thing' is pop culture, and we here in Atlanta tend to draw the game plan that I oultined from what we THINK we know about the valley.  Even when what we're pursuing isn't a 'next big thing' opportunity, and even when nobody here would ever fund such a thing - we have the reality on the ground in CA in our minds, and look forward to raising money instead of getting our first check from a customer.  Our ideas are larger than our budget.  Its there in most everyone, at a deep, deep level because the stories of the icons we look up to enforce it.<p>Therefore I would submit that my advice is good, because I've seen the pattern play itself out here a hundred times.  We need customer driven development in Atlanta.  Those are the kinds of opportunities we can pursue and do well at.  But I don't presume to give advice to SV startups - I don't know anything about those.  Obviously someone like you can pursue any idea he wants and make that work - you and your companies have a thousandfold more resources than we have available to us by virtue of your experience and location, and you have first-rate talent for building and picking startups.<p>The 'right model for the right kind of startup' is right - but most people mess that up terribly, so the advice is insufficient.  My suggestion is that Customer Driven Development be the default that we hold in our heads - rather than the California State of Mind, which is ruinous to us.<p>Bad advice is espousing and embracing the Valley model (as we understand it) to the rest of us, because it does not apply.  How many of your companies raise series A's right out of Y-Combinator?  Do you have any idea how unlikely that sort of thing is here?  A Y-Combinator startup has options other than customer-funding once they reach the stage of exiting Y-Combinator.  An Atlanta startup usually does not, unless they leave.  The sooner we accept that reality and deal with it, the sooner our rate of growth will increase.",1245392490

The one thing I would have liked to see is some cross-cultural data. For example his theory is that the interval available for innovation is being reduced due to upward pressure at the low end (people take longer to get academically qualified to start ""real"" work) but no corresponding expansion of the upper end (just because people are starting 8 years later than they used to does not mean they keep being innovative 8 years after they used to stop). He attributes some of this to the extended training period, which means PhDs don't really get going until 31 whereas a century ago they started research at 23.<p>But their is a large cultural diffence in this value right now. Back when I was getting my academic training, the typical age of a US PhD was 30, whereas in the UK it seemed to be 24-25 [I do not know whether this is still the case]. So if his point is that the squeeze in ""fertile years"" is linked with a social drop in scientific innovation, he should be able to show that in countries were the academic qualifications happen faster, those countries are more scientifically productive.<p>But without looking up his secondary references, I have to admit to being very surprised at the thought that R&D is less productive now than it used to be (per person involved, I guess). If anybody can figure out how they measure that and in what areas of endeavour and can explain it in a few words, please do so.",1245391991
