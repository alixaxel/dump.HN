This has died down as people have realized how motion can help clarify interfaces (iPhone's intertial drag helped lots), but we're still not at the point of universal acceptance that animation helps increase the total number of people who find the message accessible.<p>My point was that the arguments against richer interfaces have died down, as the browsers slowly advance to bring such abilities within reach. There will always be criticism of the leading edge, but Silverlight, iPhone, and ""HTML5"" have each helped convert camps away from the belief that only permissible medium is lengthy English text.<p>(SEO has had the gosh-darnedest amount of misinfo spread about... search engines have reached inside SWF for years and years, as the old Slashdot example query of ""'contrary evidence' filetype:swf"" showed.

Much like the IB program I attended in highschool, the Computer Science program in college forced me to learn how to learn.<p>It seems silly thinking about it, but looking back I remember a great deal of my peers in the lower level, general knowledge courses who complained about writing two page papers on something they'd just discussed in class. This should not be difficult. A 5-6 page paper was a single night ordeal for me, and a 2 pager just seemed like a silly thing to worry about. For me, it was a walk in the park because I had already learned to write from my time in IB, and before that in the honors middle-school program.<p>A trend? Yep.<p>So after college when I took a salaried job writing ColdFusion, a language I had barely even heard of, I picked it up quickly. Of course, that was thanks to having to learn a ton of languages, constructs, and their memory layouts in college. I had <i>learned</i> how to <i>learn</i>, just like highschool taught me to question things and middle school taught me to write (and enjoy writing).<p>That said, there is definitely nothing that will ever replace real-world experience. However, that coupled with a college education might just save you from picking up a bunch of bad habits and give you that much more of an edge in both life, and your career.<p><i>Disclaimer: All mispellings and terribly grammar are to be politely discarded lest the trolls be fed. ;)</i>",1245354211
