The main issues I have with it are a) the admin interface is significantly harder for normal folks to jump in and start using, b) it's really inefficient unless you do some serious tuning, and c) theming is a nightmare.  I mean, once you get a theme all up and running, I'm sure it's great because it's easy to edit, but the task of converting an HTML mockup to a full Drupal theme is a huge pain in the ass.<p>I can take an HTML / CSS slice, convert it to a Wordpress theme, throw up a new installation, configure everything the way it should be, add some basic pages and content, and launch the thing in about 90 mins.",1243882695

I can't tell if what frustration I am experiencing is just due to not being used to it, but I will say that any other time I've tried doing this (Yahoo, Live, Ask), I've quickly switched back to Google simply because I couldn't get my work done.  The fact that it's been more than an hour and I haven't given up on it says a lot.",1243879856

So I sat down (at the only machine left with a floppy drive) and clicked through it for about an hour.<p>It is certainly very different from a usual novel. For starters you have no idea how long it is. Hyperlinks aren't highlighted as we've come to expect and so I have to admit that I was doing some Myst-style random clicking at times. You'll often get back to the same paragraph but through a different path, these paragraphs are usually written in such a way that they would make sense by any path that you'd arrived at them.",1243879733

You could have an arbitrary number of years that were colder in a row, with rising CO2 levels, and still have a world where CO2 causes a temperature rise. It would simply require a countervailing force that's stronger.<p>The noise level is irrelevant; I'm not sure why you would bring it up. If there are naturally forces that fluctuate up and down in a random walk, and CO2 is a much smaller but consistently up force, inevitably we'll wind up with increasing temperatures over time. You could argue there are larger climatic signals (<i>not</i> noise) that we should be concerned about, but what you actually said is simply wrong.",1243879661
