How do I automate a functional test? I talk to the people who run the test manually. How do I learn how to do this and that with a given box? I talk to the engineers who designed it.<p>""I'd google it"" is the wrong, right answer. It's the right answer because you should have some ability to research things you don't know. It's wrong because there's no way Google will teach you what you need to know. Sometimes you need to read a book or make an appointment with an engineer in the other building, or run controlled experiments.",1244678268

People at singles bars don't act remotely ""themselves.""  The guys are puffy and douchey.  The girls are silly and giddy (or drunk and slutty.)  There's no point in picking someone up in a singles bar unless you don't give a crap what they're really like, because they're acting completely differently than they would in any other context.  Basically, singles bars only work for the people who are in heat, hook up, and have sex.  If you don't get laid, then all you get out of it is the name and phone number of someone who is essentially a total stranger whom you know nothing about.<p>That's why people give up on singles bars, except for guys who are hot or slick enough to get laid and the girls who are actually looking for sex and not a boyfriend (or who think that having one-night stands is a good way of looking for a boyfriend.)  Most guys are disillusioned when they figure out they're not getting sex, just phone numbers from girls who look a lot less interesting in sunlight and sobriety.  Most girls are disillusioned when they figure out that the only way to get any attention is to act like they're in the mood to put out if they meet the right guy.  Both sexes are disillusioned when they realize they want their sexuality to be an integral part of who they are, not an entirely separate aspect of their personality, an inner douchebag/hoebag that comes out at night and does embarrassing, tasteless things.",1244676554

When you excessively (as in: more than is warranted) exaggerate to get attention, you might succeed in the short term but ultimately you just breed cynicism.

And by far the most important is arable surface. Every food (except fish, which is already not doing so well) depends ultimately on cultivated land. Eating bread and cheese takes a lot less space then eating beef or pork - but the final currency is still surface. And that is not unlimited.<p>There are other resources too. Every technology consumes some amount of hard-to-replace materials. There are a lot of rare metals in a computer or a monitor.

Knowledge representation and machine learning has become a hard enough task that many researchers are back to developing algorithms for specific tasks, which embeds the knowledge of the researcher in the algorithm, precluding the system from learning anything truly novel.<p>They say we can't see past the Singularity because things will change too much and too fast.  Right now we can't even see the Singularity because too many things would have to change too much and quite fast.",1244675399
