Sexual attraction isn't about the kind of rational things you can communicate over our current, low-bandwidth digital connections. It is well and good to describe your personality with words and pictures, but in most cases it isn't enough. It might even be counterproductive for people who are unable to look good in a photograph.<p>The things described in the linked post (commonalities) <i>are</i> important parts of dating and attraction, but initial attraction is much more about the subtle things: Body language, subtle personality cues like clothing and hair style, all sorts of instant non-verbal communication, social proof etc. So either you have to remove these factors from the equation entirely (I can't really see how to do this) or you have to make an arena where they can be properly expressed.<p>This would mean, essentially, arranging real-life encounters where everybody has a decent chance at relaxing and being themselves. The thing is, nightclubs do a pretty good job at this already. The biggest solvable problem of nightclubs is differentiation; if you go to a nightclub you invariably meet the outgoing, confident, secure club crowd. It's always a high-pressure arena. But actually, relaxing and being yourself around strangers is pretty damn difficult as it is.<p>This is just the basic human part of the problem. But there are much deeper issues to think about. Sexuality and relationships are a very sore and difficult part of human nature, and it is never rational. There are chaotic, unmapped social issues here as well; for example a lot of women are interested in sex just for the physical thrill but have a huge social barrier against casual relationships. On the casual dating scene, this manifests itself as a series of games of playing hard-to-get, blaming alcohol for a successful one-night-stand, etc. I don't think <i>anyone</i> has the vaguest idea of all the other similar, irrational cultural norms that will bite you in the ass if you try to tame this problem.<p>Online dating is difficult because<p>+It is hard to convey your personality over an internet connection<p>+No one is able to tell you what you're doing wrong, since the rational and quantifiable part of dating is so small<p>+There are a lot of unmapped social and human behaviors that will fuck things up<p>Basically, I'd just try to tackle some difficult technical field instead.

There's unfortunately not much money involved in prevention.<p>Personally I find zapping my organs with electricity inferior to choosing better food. :)<p>In the case of hypertension, some of the obvious actions are: Cut out processed foods with high sodium. Get plenty of heart healthy Omega3/6/9 oils (promotes blood vessel elasticity). Reduce caffeine and stop smoking (causes blood vessel constriction and hardening.) Drink plenty of hibiscus tea. Exercise and get to a reasonable body mass.",1244668386

I'm of the philosophy 'launch a crappy version one and iterate' (I read a lot of pg's essays), he's worried that if his site isn't really good when he launches, he'll put off a lot of potential customers. I countered that in the early stages it's simply not going to encounter enough users to put off any significant slice of his market.<p>To be fair to him, though, he needs a critical mass of users to get his site off the ground much more than I do; in such a case, a big 'launch' can be helpful.<p>Has anyone tried the tactic of: crappy beta -> feedback from a few thousand users -> get decent -> big marketing launch?
