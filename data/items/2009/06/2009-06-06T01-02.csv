It was a huge diversion from actual economic growth into pyramid building.<p>If done for a profit, going to the moon would <i>be</i> economic growth, but as it was, it was essentially a program to build a legacy for Kennedy and Johnson, at which it was immensely successful!  After all, people associate those two with the space program more than with the Vietnam War, now, as far as I can tell.",1244253597

It's basically a design by committee standard pushed by Rational to web enable clearcase; it's a very verbose protocol and there was an entry in Sussman's blog about replacing WebDAV with a better wire protocol like Mercurial's. Getting WebDAV into SVN was basically Greg Stein's idea - he had worked at Microsoft and had observed them transitioning over to WebDAV in a big way and started pushing for its usage in SVN as well - a move that was not well thought out. WebDAV is not very popular even with some of the SVN hackers.<p>Berkeley DB was certainly old when it was adopted by the SVN project. It's not like the NFS issues with  BDB were unknown.",1244253566

644350,comment,644007,644321,0,0,gchpaco,,,"My experience has been that the alternative to many small commits, occasionally batched (because who really wants to look at ""cleaned up Checkstyle's warnings"" endlessly?) is one big commit two or three times a day, which is significantly harder to digest.  But in any case, as you allude to in your response, this is a <i>social problem</i>.  I contend that the sort of people who work in a cave somewhere with a DVCS and then throw it all over the wall in a huge hunk would either do that anyway (see Linux kernel features before they make it into the mainland trunk for evidence; this was going on well before git, and if anything git has made it less of a problem) or wouldn't contribute at all.",1244253250
644349,comment,644007,644293,0,0,durin42,,,"You say that ""Subversion was not that great of an idea"" but if you go back to 2001 (which is when svn became selfhosting), or even 2004, CVS was <i>such</i> a disaster for some use cases that the need for a replacement was readily evident. Add to that the fact that svn was a compelling replacement for Visual Source Safe, and it was definitely a worthwhile idea. Sure, it's now the ""old safe standard"" of version control, but there's a lot of value in that for many companies.  Several of the original svn team (including these two) have admitted that some of the design decisions (the handling of tags and branches most notably) were probably mistakes, given the value of hindsight. They got a lot right too, though. The delta editor interface is nicely abstracted to the point that hgsubversion uses the same delta editor as the svn command line client to do something the original design spec never would have anticipated. Yet it works extremely well.<p>Subversion is <i>much</i> simpler for people to ""get"" than other systems. I've been a heavy evangelist of DVCS tools and workflows for a while at work, and it's taken since October (8 months) to get any critical mass behind actually even <i>investigating</i> switching to those from SVN.<p>Let's face it: Subversion is many <i>many</i> times better than nothing, which is what a ton of people do. Most college graduates in CS or CSE come out of school <i>never</i> having touched version control in my experience, and the ones that have seen it were exposed via open source, not their coursework. Evangelizing Subversion is (really lousy analogy warning!) like convincing people to smoke cigarettes instead of doing illegal drugs. At least it's less bad for them, and the barrier to entry might be a bit lower. When we had a poll of the local Python users group one meeting, ""email"" was the most popular version control solution, followed by a basic dead heat between svn/bzr/git/hg. The fact that people still view email as a valid answer is <i>far</i> more troubling to me than evangelizing an old and very mature tool instead of one of the new upstarts.",1244253186

Using centralized system you don't have much choice - either you don't commit, or you commit and everybody sees your ugly code.
With DVCS you can have your private branches and work on your code as long as you want. When you a happy with your work, just push it to the public repo (hosted on github for example). Even more, you can have a lots of tiny working commits and then ""squash"" them into one big and nice final commit.",1244252823

If you have a stomach virus, you may find yourself puking all over the floor. Nobody asks ""why is he puking all over the floor? Can't he see that's inconsiderate?"" At that point, you are unable to help yourself. However, it's clear that if we take you to hospital and get you well again, you will be able to get on with your life.<p>The problem with mental illness is that it messes with the concept of ""intentional"" behaviour. If you are mentally ill, your sick brain may motivate you to do something antisocial or even criminal that, were you mentally well, you would never do.<p>So just because it is intentional _at the time of illness_ doesn't mean it is truly intentional, conscious behaviour.<p>2. Consider a diabetic. Without regular shots of insulin, they will lapse into a coma. More ""criminally"" antisocial behaviour? Many forms of diabetes are a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors -- these people have a ""tendency to lapse into diabetes"", if you will. However, with regular shots of insulin and other lifestyle changes, they can be perfectly productive individuals.<p>Again, with mental illness it is harder to see that someone with a genetic predisposition to imbalanced levels of, say, serotonin, triggered by drug abuse, is not at fault for their condition. But with medical treatment and lifestyle changes, they too can control their condition.<p>In both cases, it is in society's interest to help them do so, even from the barest economic principles.

I've learned from painful experience that if the ad server doesn't respond to a JS ad tag, the entire page will stop loading until the ad server times out (up to 10 seconds).<p>I'd rather have a page be 10-20% slower with IFRAME tags than use JS ad tags that are effectively a single point of failure for my site.",1244250973

WebDAV, for example, or the endless, endless iterations of Berkeley DB corruption.  It is, in a lot of ways, an excellent illustration of the dangers of trying to solve the wrong problem.",1244250964

That is:<p>cost of providing housing and essential care to homeless + cost of treating any of those with mental disabilities < economic benefit from increasing general quality of environment.<p>Sure housing prices would rise, but the left side of the inequality is direct tax payer money. The right side comes indirectly from sales, public facilities, and property. Knowing that prisoners are locked away in interest of lowering crime rate, at a $20K+/year/prisoner [1], that seems, on a hunch, difficult.<p>It looks quite intricate. And, knowing that modern corporations will have no business in doing this, it is a public service; some people might not be interested in paying this tax. Hence, doing nothing seems to not be very far from optimal, as it looks.<p>Or, is that inequality correct, and RHS - LHS gives a good number?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisons_in_the_United_States</a>",1244250488

Part of what I mean by that term are things that look good in the demo, but it turns out the demo is pushing the idea to the very limits. A demo of a good idea by necessity can only scratch the surface, not exhaust the idea. With demoware, it only works as long as you don't bring the idea into contact with the real world. It looks <i>great</i> as long as you stay in demoland, but that's it.
