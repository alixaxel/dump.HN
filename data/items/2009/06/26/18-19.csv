The technical merits versus XP can be argued, but its poor image is hard to contest: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Windows_Vista"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Windows_Vista</a>.<p>We take that as a premise, because the technical bits don't matter any more, in the presence of Windows 7. The meat is the use of price as a tool to drive better initial reception of 7 than Vista. There's no need to analyze ""Vista bad"", because it is already widely believed to be bad.",1246042798

If the last <i>ten years</i> is ""mere weather"", then the error bars should have reflected that.<p>That is how you judge science as an outsider. You may not understand materials science, but the bridges the materials scientists help build behave as they predict (mostly). You may not understand organic chemistry, but plastics behave as such people predict. You may not understand political science, but the real world only sort of acts as they predict, so their science is less reliable.<p>You may not understand climate science, but their predictions completely fail to come to pass. Fairly routinely, too. Make your conclusions about the validity of their science based on that. You don't have to be a climate scientist to do that. (As it happens, it is the same standard they should be using themselves, and the field's apparent refusal to do so is also very telling.)<p>(Where no predictions can be made, there is no science. Sometimes that's just the way it is; economics isn't going to be a very real science anytime soon. There's nothing wrong with that, there's only something wrong with according it the belief levels in the predictions made by the field that should be reserved for real science.)",1246040971

Both would operate from independent institutes, funded by all stakeholders.  If you let me collect and analyze my own data, I am open to all sorts of influence depending on who is funding my work, peer pressure, etc.  Once the data has been collected, then the analysis portion could even be split tested, with two independent groups funded to do the analysis independently on exactly the same data set, and then we can compare truly independent conclusions.<p>The other problem that pervades climate change is the shockingly bad statistical analysis.  At the least, there should be a separate statistical institute that can put its stamp of approval on the statistical parts of the results.  With such limited historical climate data older than a very recent period, and projections made far into the future, we must ensure that only the very best statistical analyses make it into the public awareness.

I think making the computer small made it easier to approach for a lot of other people. You know, less intimidating. I've read quite a few books about the Mac, and they had their eyes on IBM, not Atari, as their primary competitor. And I think we have to credit Jef Raskin for a lot of the design decisions, after all, he was the one who started the Macintosh project in the first place, although his original vision for it was more like a netbook than what it eventually became. I still have my Mac Plus at home, sitting in a box, and it still works perfectly as it has since 1989 when I got it before entering university.

You expect nothing from it, and have to support it completely.  Care for your infant business as you would care for your infant child -- with loving attention, with no expectation of any reward... your infant grows at its own pace; sometimes slowly, sometimes instantly, in a quantum leap.  As James Allen says, Be not impatient in delay, but wait as one who understands.  Your infant business will soon grow to adolescence.""<p>""The adolescent business can take care of itself, but it certainly can't take care of its owners.  In fact, the owners may still need to come in with some additional support if the adolescent stumbles for some reason, maybe because it's trying something unproven or risky or new...""<p>""If you keep focusing on your dreams, and if you're patient and persistent, your company will grow into maturity and be able to support you and many others abundantly.""<p>In the comments people are doing the math to calculate that you need 2K a month to live on.  Whatever the amount is, it is then your job to provide yourself with that income to support yourself, separate from your business.  You shouldn't expect or depend on your infant business to provide you with that 2K, because you don't know how long it will take for your business to grow up.  That your infant business isn't yet supporting you isn't a reason to give up, it just means that your business hasn't grown up yet.<p>In <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html</a> Paul Graham writes: ""A couple days ago I finally got being a good startup founder down to two words: relentlessly resourceful.""<p>Being relentlessly resourceful means that you come up with the 2K a month.  Get some investors.  Do some contracting work.  Work nights and weekends.  Hold a yard sale.  Deliver pizza.  Do <i>whatever it takes</i> to make 2K a month, separate from your startup.<p>Your other question was should you sell your 10K of stocks to support yourself.  Because you're in the B2B space, you're doing sales.  Dave Ramsey notes that people don't buy from a desperate salesperson.  Desperate salespeople smell bad.  People buy from relaxed, confident salespeople.  So, the answer is, in your particular situation, you should start making the 2K a month to support yourself before you need to sell the 10K of stock.  Because, with the 10K in reserve, you won't be feeling desperate, you'll be feeling confident.  And with that confidence you'll be able to make sales.<p>How to succeed in your business is fairly simple :-) do what your business needs you to do.  If your business needs you to make 2K a month to support yourself, then go do that.  If your business needs you to make sales, then do the things you need to do for yourself so that you can be a confident salesperson.  And sooner or later, your business will grow up, and you'll reap the benefits.",1246040003
