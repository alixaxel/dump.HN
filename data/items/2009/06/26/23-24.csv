In theory when you double your sample size you do reduce your margin of error by a reasonable degree, but reality does not mesh until you start taking a large percentage of the population.<p>Think of it like a coin, that has a 1% bias you want the percentage to some accuracy (say 4 digits) how many flips do you need?.  Now what if the problem is not the coin but the person doing the flipping.  At some point more testers help more than more flips.",1246060598

I've been doing it for about 2 months and it really is the most effective all-around workout I've done. The focus is on functional movements and a mix of strength and metabolic conditioning. And you really only need 30-45 minutes to do a warmup and workout.<p>That said, there is a somewhat off-putting Crossfitter ethos of overdoing it and injuring yourself, and some of the folks give off a cultish vibe. But if you're smart about learning the movements and knowing your body, I really think it's worth trying. I was skeptical and now I'm hooked.",1246058190

I agree that beginners should be cautious about learning the movements properly and scaling.<p>Crossfit hits all the major groups, but not every day. You might hit squats one day, then the next be doing running and pullups--one group recovers while you work others.<p>I'm not claiming that Crossfit is perfect for everyone. If you're training for specific sports or for general bulk or for a model's physique with a lot of non-functional muscle, then maybe Crossfit isn't ideal for you. I just haven't seen any better all-around program for a sound athletic base.",1246057854

(This has nothing to do with Lisp, BTW, but rather with the design of the system and runtime.  The syntax is nice, but largely irrelevant.)<p>The closest I've ever come to day to day use of a Lisp machine is Emacs.  It is wonderfully different from ""worse is better"" systems like UNIX and Clojure/Java.  With a few keystrokes, I can use my tool to change my tool... instantly.  Everything is as deeply aware of everything else (if it needs to be).  The result is an extremely comfortable environment where anything seems possible.  (I recently switched from bash + ansi-term to eshell.  UNIX is much nicer when you can see it through a lisp-colored shell.)<p>Anyway, I guess this isn't really related to the article... but if your view of programming consists of strings being passed along pipelines and huge, monolithic cathedrals that claim to be ""IDEs"", you are not seeing the whole picture.",1246057768

It's as if they didn't understand the way most people operate and behave. No one wants to watch a 1 minute video of someone expressing their opinion when I could read the same comment in text in less than 5 seconds. And I've always gotten the impression that those who do actually make video comments, who actually position their camera, look into it, and press record, are those who think their opinion matters a bit more than the rest. Most of the time, from what I've seen, people try to project some sort of personality with their comments, which is fine and all, but that usually, in my opinion, takes away from what they're actually saying. Also, Loic always tried to pull it off as video for Twitter, which is really flawed. Twitter's beauty is in the speed of the information stream. I can glance at tweets tens at a time. You don't get that with video. And I didn't quite understand their raccoon mascot and what they were trying to pull off.",1246057641

There <i>is</i> something wrong when someone goes out of his way to criticize something for no reasons other than ""it doesn't fit how I think things should be"".<p>For a proper criticism, I would have liked at least a little more explanation of the advantages of actually <i>using</i> Lisp all the way down.<p>I'll try my hand at that: having a system built out of a few simple types of parts interacting in tons of different ways also leads to flexibility and power. Ant hives and bee colonies work in similar ways, one individual alone is useless and will probably die soon, and having a whole mass of ants just meandering around won't get you anything. Now, create a few (by which I mean very <i>very</i> few) rules for what happens when an ant meets another ant, and immediately you get a structure out of it.<p>For example, ants have the property of laying down pheromones. The interaction rule is knowing to follow another ant's pheromones (there are some subtleties with detecting certain types, for sure, like danger signals, but we'll keep things simple). If an ant doesn't have a trail of pheromones to follow, it will wander using its senses to find food.<p>Combine all of this and you end up with a system that gives you the quickest way to a food source. Simply because ants who have found the shortest route to a food source will probably return soonest, and other ants follow the pheromone trails they lay down.<p>Note that there's no real comparison method where all the ants sit down, compare notes, and try to figure out who has the shortest path. It emerges naturally.",1246057225
