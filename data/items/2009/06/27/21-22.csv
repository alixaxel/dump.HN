Glad it happened in such elaborated way.<p>Although I have explicitly expressed to ignore prejudices, you started with one assuming you knew everything about this kid. Moreover, you compare yourself and your biases with me. We're not the same, and especially seems we grew up in different centuries. That makes a difference. The world is not the same, since this moment I write until you read it.<p>I accept I am a kid. I am, and hopefully will stay forever as passionate and young minded =)<p>- I am not bitter, especially regarding the job searching thing. It is a personal reflection on the process. A lot of my friends are going through even worse things, yet many of them ended up with jobs they hate. I am having much more luck than it seems in the text.\n- The website I've built is far from my first project, and I don't expect a stampede. \n- I've had full-time jobs in different countries, as well built a successful non-tech (finances) company. I have great social skills. Want a copy of my CV? :)<p>There is a big difference between GetSatisfaction, UserVoice and Aleveo. If you find a real engineer's solution and not a complaint or feature request on those, I'll accept. If you show me that they are helping people get jobs, I'll send you a pack of beer wherever you are. If you show me that they are not Marketing/PR but Open Innovation tools... I'll send you a Chianti from here in Italy.<p>1. I am aware of this. However, your focus is on the wrong thing. I am talking about lead-user innovation and open innovation. The users >want< to contribute, but companies are not listening. Would you say a young kid needs to get a job to have a great idea? If you didn't at the time, that doesn't meant someone else doesn't: Facebook, Microsoft, ViaWeb, Apple, FedEx... The list is long. And of course these kids have to prove people like yourself that they are capable, as all they get is discouragement and ""NO"" from people.<p>2. Exactly. You don't seem to see a problem in that, how the company is losing?<p>3. Rant is a proof of passion and determination I hold. We need more of that in the world. Go read Tom Peters' ""Re-Imagine.""<p>My post has not a single line of complaint. I am glad you responded, I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like that so I left the starting disclaimer. Truly, I haven't even read it yet.<p>The points that are made are that: \n- everyone holds knowledge how to improve the world, companies and their offerings\n- everyone can be an inventor in the same way he can be a video producer, journalist and musician. The web allows that and the world should adapt to it.\n- external ideas are a proof of a need to rethink some stuff.\n- there is no clear channel for companies to reach external ideas that people >demand< to give. Websites are built by designers and IT people. There is no business strategy beyond presence and online sales. There is more that can be done through the web. Accept it or be crushed by it.\n- the way of recruiting is wrong, as people do not enter companies. Ideas do, so why not take a look at those a little bit for a change, you might find your gold fish, as Apple and Google did. If you don't care about people's ideas, you will lose the people, whether your customers or employees.\n- companies should not be ""faceless"" as you say, and should have same ""people"" skills you mention in their attitude.\n- companies need more ""intrapreneurs"" / entrepreneurial spirit as a way to establish an innovation culture that embraces agile methods of testing ideas against reality.<p>I believe that a viable business opportunities can be found in the lines I've written. I have taken one, not out of bitterness, but passion to test against the world.<p>If I do attack businesses, than every single business book (good one at least) does.<p>Thank you for your sincere reply, you gave me space for a reflection on my thoughts. Your points are clear and valid, but that is exactly why I want to stand up to them. They shouldn't be. Not today. Not ever again.",1246138586

The center can afford sophisticated technology such as geographic point identification of the call, bucketing multiple calls about the same incident, maybe even things like voice stress detection. And because of the size and geographic diversity, spikes in certain areas could easily be handled because they would make little impact. Even time zone diversification would cut costs, because traffic incidents from commuter times would be more evenly distributed.<p>Not to mention training.
