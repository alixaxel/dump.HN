677337,comment,677203,677308,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"""Hopefully, even projects like Django could move to 3.x for new releases while supporting 2.x on an older release.""<p>Not really, no. There are two things going on here.<p>First, many people seem to have a different view of the Python 3.0 migration process, when compared to what's been discussed and planned for by the Python development team. Put simply, nobody who actually works on developing Python expected that this would be a quick transition, and mostly they seemed to expect (and plan for) large projects taking at least a couple <i>years</i> to get to the point of running only on 3.x. That's why there will be a Python 2.7, and possibly a Python 2.8.<p>The other thing is simply that many end users can't do a quick jump to 3.0 installations and will be pretty upset if they lose new releases of software as a result. So ""we're jumping to 3.0, too bad if you can't"" isn't an attitude we can take. And, honestly, most of the operating-system vendors aren't going to be there with packaged 3.x Python and packaged 3.x libraries anyway.<p>So what we're doing is a process of deprecation: one Python version per release. Django 1.1 will be the last release to officially support Python 2.3, Django 1.2 will be the last to support Python 2.4, and so on until we hit Django 1.4 (hopefully) sometime next year. At that point we'll only officially be supporting 2.6 and newer in the 2.x series, distros will have had time to catch up, major installations will have had time to lay out upgrade plans and we'll be at a place where a 3.x port is far simpler to undertake.",1246146537

The classical hero's journey may be rendered, as the journey hinges on choices pivoting on classical ideals. Ideas that are rendered in word and deed will have consequences in the gameworld. Historical events such as The American Revolution may be brought to life, as players listen to famous speeches and choose sides. As great works of literature and dramatic art center around characters rendering ideals real, both internally and externally, in word and deed, in love and war, the present invention will afford video games that exalt the classical soul, as well as the great books, classics, and epic films—past, present, and future.",1246146441
677335,comment,676943,677211,0,0,vitovito,,,"Oh, the poster really is you!  haha!<p>I would wager your story is very similar to mine, and to others here.  It's why we're here, after all.<p>Balsamiq uses Get Satisfaction to take in feature requests from users, and they go back and forth with wireframes and mockups right there on the site.  That's part of their culture, that's not a function of the site.  It sounds like you're trying to fix a sociological problem with technology.<p>1. If a company is not set up, top to bottom, culture to practice, to take in outside feedback, the effort will fail.  The development culture and practice within a company that treats constructive criticism from their users/customers as first-rate along with their internal QA and engineers is completely different from one that doesn't.  You see this in any company that releases an SDK, publishes an API or licenses technology.  Some will rearchitect entire APIs because they realized they got in wrong once people started trying to use it.  Some will pack up their ball and go home.<p>Having spent years running support and developer relations teams, my cynicism tells me the companies you will attract will be the latter, trying to be the former.  The former doesn't need you; they can do it themselves, because they believe in it already.  The latter will use you, but will fail internally because they don't really want to listen.  You can't change a business model and internal culture with a web site.  Now, with management and process consultants...<p>2. No, I don't care how the company is losing.  It's a <i>company</i>.  It's not a person whose life I can materially improve by helping it.  It's a bureaucracy that exists to extract profit at the expense of its customers and employees.  Inventing something that improves a <i>particular</i> coffee maker doesn't help anyone but the shareholders of the coffee maker making company; everyone who bought that particular coffee maker isn't going to get a free replacement.  You would better serve the <i>people who have the same problem with the same coffee maker</i> by publishing a fix and offering replacement widgets via mail for some token amount, or by making your own coffee maker that solves all those problems and more.<p>3. I'm not going to go back and re-read the post to highlight specific complaints, but the entire <i>tone</i>, I find, is one of bitterness.  It's not wide-eyed idealism, it's ""I'll show you all,"" which comes across quite differently.  This is the lack of diplomacy I mean.<p>Your ""points that are made are that"" paragraph here is better, but remember that your beliefs aren't everyone else's.<p>I believe that most people don't want to be inventors, producers, journalists or musicians.  Most people don't ""demand"" to give ideas.  Most people don't think that hard about anything at all, but technology in particular, as the priesthood culture of technology has trained people to believe that if something is wrong with technology, it's really their own fault (I'd quote from DoET, but I can't find my copy).  And, of those people that have ideas, most lack the subversiveness to do anything about them.<p>Despite all of these things, I really hope you find both some success with this and in the future.  I hope I'm wrong and you change the world.  But, if I'm not, I hope you come to understand why at a level deeper than ""no-one got it,"" because that greater comprehension of the system of the world is what will really help in your next venture.",1246146006

677333,comment,677149,677201,0,0,Retric,,,"That's an important issue.<p>I would suggest having a backup to a large call center if the wait time is over 30 seconds.  The remote call center could have priority to ""escalate"" to the local call center and share information.  Integrating it so the local call center could see what the remote site had typed and replay the message if the caller stops responding would also improve that system.<p>Set things up as a distributed system so each site would accept incoming calls if they had excess capacity and give remote sites access to local conditions.  So you can handle large sudden spikes without excessive staff.<p>The other option would be to try automatically handle some calls using location information while the caller is waiting.

The best default support you can get is 2.4 even at places like Joyent due to Redhat and RHEL and other package systems.  It is unfortunate.<p>I was hoping stuff like Django, SQL Alchemy, Google AppEngine and even Unladen Swallow to focus more on Python 3 btu there is so much vested in older versions.  If everyone could just get to 2.6 or 2.7 at least then new frameworks and old stuff can run for a while.<p>But python evolution is a bit held back by situations like this.  That is one problem that Ruby, .NET etc dont' have and as a Pythonista for the last few years, this is concerning.<p>Google AppEngine may be adding python version support soon.  There should be an easier way to have parallel python libs and switch between them per app.<p>Hopefully this is a focus soon.",1246145099

677312,comment,677149,677149,0,0,derefr,,,"I think the simplest way to fix this particular problem would be to just direct to a ""recording buffer""--like voicemail, but an operator can come in at any time when there's one available. There will have to be voice recognition so they have a screen of what you've said so far; if they had to actually listen to the buffer, they couldn't listen to <i>you</i>. However, if the line has since gone dead, or you're just babbling incoherently or something similar, they should be able to listen to the start of the buffer (while still having you on in the other ear.)<p>On reflection, though, this probably isn't possible; if voice recognition could understand these people to <i>any</i> degree, there would already be priority-triggers based on certain keywords (fire, seizure, etc.) and I'm sure these haven't yet popped up. What <i>could</i> work is if you had a <i>pair</i> of operators for each caller--one who comes in on the call-in-progress, and the other who listens to the buffer and tells the first (or types into a shared display) any additional information they need to know. The buffer operator could then go on to another call, though perhaps having two available operators for each call might help reduce mistakes. :)",1246144573
