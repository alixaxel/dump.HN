We have to guess that he'd want something involving a declared robots-rules-'link' elsewhere.<p>But layering robots-rules as a 'link' from the headers of the root page, or markup tags (if the root page happens to be HTML), <i>still</i> requires an initial investigative hit to a site -- and if at the '/' page, probably involves more bandwidth than a compact robots.txt or 404.<p>Assuming a hostname is a unified 'site' is not perfect -- but in 1994 and now, that's the only inherent and well-defined unit of administrative control provided by the HTTP protocol.<p>By going with this easy-to-understand, easy-to-implement convention, webmasters have had enough freedom to opt out, and crawlers enough freedom to collect, to enable ~15 years of dazzling growth in powerful search applications. And robots.txt files built to the 1994 standard still work, handling 99.999% of what webmasters need to communicate to crawlers.<p>That success satisfies my design aesthetics.",1244011608

It's easier. If you're going to do a show which runs every night, or every week, for many many seasons: for goodness sake, tell some jokes with short shelf life!

The real advantage it has going for it is that Google can throw a lot of weight behind it and maybe push it through with sheer force of will.<p>Here's the problem with Wave: what is it?  Every blog post I've read about it struggled with how to explain it.  I read this entire post and I'm still not sure of how I'm supposed to use this thing or what pressing problem it solves.  Even the videos I've seen are super long, presumably because you can't really show it off in 60 seconds.  ""Well, it's kind of a mix between email and IM, but also with wiki functionality and social networking...oh, and it's got these crazy widgets and media sharing and stuff.  Hmmm...you really have to play with it to understand.""  97% of the people I know wouldn't get that, and don't have the patience to figure it out.  It seems like it's just too flexible, that it can be used for a million different things, which makes it hard to know how to use at first.  Think about almost every successful web site out there and how easy they are to explain, especially when they first launched.  You would have zero trouble explaining Google, Youtube, Facebook, Flickr, Delicious, Twitter, etc. in a 60 second video.<p>Wave is like FriendFeed on crack, and FF is already dangerously close to being too much for most normal people to grok.
