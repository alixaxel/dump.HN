If you're working 100 hours a week, you can't do anything else, and need someone else to take care of everything around the house for you, because you are spending all of your waking hours at work.  This will destroy your relationships in a short period of time.  Furthermore, this will unquestionably reduce your life expectancy.  It takes a hell of a lot of money to compensate for even a few years in that situation.<p>Note:  I'm not talking about working 60 hour weeks, which is very taxing, but nothing like this.  100 Hour weeks mean that there are no weekends, ever.  You're working 14.25 hours per day, which is just enough to wake up, drive to work, eat your meals, come home, and sleep, day after day, with no respite.",1245117551

They view it as an appliance that happens to combine several different sets of functionality into one physical device. If you break out each component you'll see they're almost always very tightly controlled and otherwise not open to general purpose (unlicensed) access.<p>iPod / PMP (Apple, Microsoft, Creative)
Camera (Cannon, Nokia, Sony, etc)
GPS unit (Garmin, Tom Tom, etc)
Phone (cheap flip phone)
Gaming device (PSP, DS)<p>There are exceptions of course -- and workarounds/hacks to circumvent protection (just like Jailbreaking on the iPhone) but more or less these sorts of closed appliance like devices are quite popular on their own. Apple simply combined them into one physical device and kept the same rules.<p>Apple doesn't sell the iPhone as a general purpose computer so any consumer who buys one expecting it to function that way probably bought the wrong product. I can understand why someone might want that option but it doesn't change the fact that Apple does not sell a product that fits those needs and, based on the success of stand alone devices sold in the same fashion, it is almost completely irrelevant in real world sales or usage for most people. There is of course jailbreaking -- there's also Linux on iPhone hardware. I'm not sure how much progress they've made but I seem to recall they at least had a booting kernel a while back.",1245117530
659396,comment,659303,659303,0,0,patio11,,,"Donations are not a business model.  Its putting out a tip cup and hoping money falls into it.  Tip cups do not have a curious property in physics that causes money to be attracted to them.<p>I do downloadable software, of the ""makes people substantially less money than Wordpress"" variety.  Roughly 1.8% of downloads result in people paying me money.  The average paid me is, I say without fear of contradiction, far above the average donation any Wordpress developer with a significant amount of donations has received.  (Edit to add: here's a point of reference.  Back when MoveableType was donationware, the average donation was 38.  Cents.)<p>When you offer something for donations, you're saying ""It would be REALLY NICE if you could put ANY money into this here tip cup because, as you know, almost nobody will.  That $1 there, that makes you a better person than 99.9% of the public.""  This is a cruddy frame of mind to put your I-can't-believe-its-not-a-customer into from the perspective of separating them from their money.<p>When you offer stuff for sale, you say ""It would be TOTALLY MANDATORY that you pay me exact what it says on the sticker for this here thing.  Everybody pays for it, except thieves. [In point of fact 98.2% of people do not pay for it, but I don't clobber my users over the head with that fact, now do I.]  Offering to pay me $1 for it doesn't make you nice, it makes you a <i>cheapskate</i> and parasite on society.""  (And the best part is you never have to tell people this because <i>they already know</i>.)<p>There are people who do well with donations.  Rick Brewster of Paint.NET is the only one who springs readily to mind for me.  He pushes the donations fairly aggressively (+) and distributes a program which is probably competitive with some of Adobe's low-end consumer offerings.<p>+ Another problem with donations: they fail quite frequently because people are embarrassed to ask for money, like they feel they are doing something wrong.  So they bury the tip cup out of the way and don't aggressively promote it within the application, for fear of being thought poorly of by cheapskates who think $1 is too much to pay for $APP.  People with this philosophy will never be mollified, and charging money from the getgo means you never have to worry about what they think of you.",1245117482

You are always fighting against smart people, and there are unknowns.<p>I feel like people shouldn't get into the App Store market thinking that they will make a million dollars their first app. Only a few people can succeed like that at any time. But, if you jump through Apple's hoops, listen to your customers, and try and serve a real need, you can make a living on the iPhone.<p>People expect launching an iPhone app to be like launching a website, which you can do in a single day.

Based on the stories I've read online it does sound like Apple isn't handling their iPhone app store well, but I do take issue with the part of your comment I've quoted.<p>I'd like some examples about why you would expect to be treated poorly (or as you put it abused) by Apple.  Is it only based on their track record with app developers?  If so perhaps it's a problem rooted in the iPhone app process itself and not systemic to the whole company, as you imply.  I would need more examples of Apple's abusive policies to understand your statement, for now though I'm not going to write off Apple as horrible corporation because some app developers cry foul (to which, according to the blogger's own admission, Apple attempts to promptly respond to and rectify).",1245116457

659358,comment,658099,659302,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Firstly, I'm not declaring victory. I think forms of government evolve over time. I'm simply declaring an inflection point, a local maximum, around representative democracy. As a libertarian, I'd love to see more forms of government tried.<p>Secondly, the problem with talking about capability to lead is that it is highly subjective. Your idea of a great leader and mine will probably diverge. Multiply that times a million and there is no standard for great leaders. You're trying apply some scale of competence where in reality none exists, at least as far as the governed care.<p>The best answer for that is to have a pick at the best leader/administrator and then repeat and rinse. This time I think the guy is doing great and you think he sucks. Next time our roles reverse. Over time, this keeps the most people satisfied and convinced that we, in general, have good leaders. This is because the consent of the governed has been proven to be more important that objective competence. Lots of really smart people were highly unpopular and almost sparked revolts while lots of popular idiots  advanced their cultures just fine for their time in office.<p>BTW, World War I is a great example of how the old aristocratic systems a) got the world into a war, and b) completely started breaking down once the people began finding their own voice.<p>Take a look at this from the point of view of a software team. Let's say there are five of us getting equal pay to perform a complex project over the next six months. We might decide that we need to have a project manager. How to select one? Do we give a test? Rank ourselves by intelligence? Ask for references?<p>Whatever our criteria, as the project changes, we're likely to have second thoughts. Gee, the guy who scored highly on intelligence really has no social skills! Or the great social guy can't manage complex dependencies. Or the project looked like this when we started but really ended up somewhere else.<p>This is natural and to be expected. If we preface our PM decision with ""and we're going to vote once a month to keep or rotate the job"" then we have a way to respond to new eventualities.<p>During the month, of course, our PM can make management decisions and do everything we would expect of an autocrat/manager. But as smart or as good as he might be, he still has to think about our feedback loop. When you rotate, you have the ability to be wrong, to adapt. Systems with feedback loops that adapt are much better than systems with a single selection criteria and no feedback loop.",1245115042
