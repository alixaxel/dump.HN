Its hard to choose either without knowing how your product works and what value it will bring to me.<p>I do like the locations on the HN comments though. Pretty cool.<p>One other thing: I have Greasemonkey, and very much appreciate your offering the product as a Userscript. That said, a lot of people might not have GM, or even know what it is.

There are no beaurocracies or regulations when it's your money and your charity. Meanwhile if the government was going to do the same thing it would be bogged down in politics and bureaucracy.<p>As for increasing taxes on the super rich - as far as I know Gates and Buffet both support the idea. They also support a serious estate tax for the super rich (aka death tax). And they cite the reasons you cite. The wealth came from the society as a whole and thus should go back to them. That is one reason they've put so much of their net worth in Gates' foundation. [These aren't my personal beliefs about taxes or the death tax...]<p>I think it would be a very hard argument to say that the money Carnegie or Gates is using could some how be used better by most governments and definitely not by the US government. The Gates foundation even has a lifespan on it. It will cease to exist 50 years after Bill and Melinda die[1]. That is commendable in my opinion. It guarantees it doesn't become a Ford Foundation (etc.) and it ensures the money is spent on the generation that created the fortune.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Lifespan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundati...</a>",1244226942

Do you want a new ipod?  Well, apple doesn't trade in man-hours, they trade in dollars.  So what you need to do is get a job with somebody that will trade you some of their dollars for your man hours (think of an employer like a currency exchange).  Once you have exchanged enough of the currency you have (time) for the currency that the currency exchange (your employer) has (dollars), you can take them to apple and trade them for an iPod.<p>Apple then reverses the transaction.  They take some of the dollars that you gave them, and trade their workers some of the dollars for some of their man-hours.<p>Dollars are just a common currency.  The INPUT (making it a non-closed system) is work.<p>So no, by creating wealth, you are NOT simply robbing it from people.
