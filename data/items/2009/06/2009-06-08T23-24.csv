So being an application developer has a more direct tangible effect on the end user as compared to being a software engineer.

648263,comment,647502,647885,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"The most obvious way for a programmer to pitch to their projects is to use a committee of experts, like YC does.  I'm sure we could come up with other methods too; maybe some sort of web-based voting scheme, for instance.<p>Government contracts are nice for solving certain problems, where you have a narrow goal to achieve, but don't address other problems, such as those that call for a more general, trial-and-error, research type approach.  For example, say you wanted to work on Emacs, or the Leo editor.  I doubt you could get a government contract to do that under the current system, despite the fact that your work has the potential to benefit all the programmers who use those programs.<p>You may be right about academia being the best way to go.  I myself dropped out of college after two years.  It felt like a big waste of time to me.  You have to do a lot of irrelevant work and it's expensive as hell.  The prospect of enduring another two years of that, followed by a Masters program and then a PhD just makes me cringe.<p>I don't see any reason why we can't create an organization with minimal bureaucracy that allows hackers to do their thing.",1244505538

I am further interested in how widespread this sentiment is.<p>I heard a story about a McDonald's closing in a poor area. There are at least two effects of this, the second of which was quite surprising: 1. McD, a source of high-fat food, leaves the area, and subsequently people need to find alternative food; 2. McD, a source of cheap food, leaves the area, and subsequently people have trouble <i>affording food</i>.<p>Apparently McD's distribution chain is so efficient, that their presence resulted in wider access to food. I say nothing about nutrition, jobs, or anything else. Just food that fills your stomach. It seems like nothing is that simple enough to summarize in a single sentence.

648198,comment,645992,646107,0,0,whacked_new,,,"A few semi-questions. Structures that become relatively fixed after five? This seems suspect. There are two major prunings of overgrowth of neurons: once soon after birth (where your case stands), once in puberty (where your case falls). I'm not the best at sources but without evidence in my face my guess would put post-puberty for the ""relatively fixed"" threshold, and common sense confirms this: ""identity formation"" = puberty. And identity formation basically means habits, which are also manifested in parenthood. As for executive functions, we're probably talking about white matter growth, which is mostly genetic. There could be swing cases, but if your white matter puts you firmly above or below your peers, there's no way in hell you will not perceive it and act on this knowledge -- unless there is some crazy conscious brainwashing going on, which doesn't apply in this case.<p>Amount of father time vs mother time, and type of father time vs mother time is unaddressed in your post but potentially a critical difference.
