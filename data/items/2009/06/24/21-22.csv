How does one make the site eternally available?<p>It seems like service like this doesn't exist, possibly because nearly everyone is lost in the current moment.<p>The serivce that I think of should be something like cryonics. Well, not exactly. Cryonics suspends human beings for indefinite period of time in hopes of time being in hopes for future resuscitation. Eternal hosting should keep site alive, just not updated by the author anymore.

I tutored both college students and in an after school program for east african immigrants.<p>What I observed in that experience was that people with good trig backgrounds did very well with the mechanical formula manipulation stuff in Calc. They were mostly having issues with proof structure, etc.<p>The students who had a sketchy trig background had problems with proof structure and also had a lot of issues simply doing mechanical symbol manipulation problems.<p>I majored in math and focused on abstract algebra. I don't think rings, groups and fields are very useful to general programming or even computer science. I actually have the exact opposite opinion on the matter. Unless you're going into crypto algorithm research you don't need to know that stuff, you just use a pre-existing library. On the other hand, trig establishes a foundation for stuff like robotics, DSP, computer graphics, computational physics and so forth. Almost anything falling into the traditional ""applied math"" bin requires you to have gotten trig down cold at some point.<p>However, arguing this is sort of a moot point because I can't think of any elementary or secondary school math sequence where you just skip over trig and take group theory instead. Trig is usually required somewhere along the way and abstract algebra is usually not available in high school unless you're going to a specialized math and science school. Indeed, it's usually not even available in college unless you're a math major.<p>If you have a sketchy trig background and need more practice and inspiration, I recommend:<p>Trigonometric Delights by Eli Maor, for inspiration.<p>Trigonometry Refresher by A. Albert Klaf for practice problems<p>Advanced Trigonometry by C.V. Durell and A.Robson for examples of advanced applications<p>Statistics is very important and totally overlooked by most hackers and even math majors (including myself.)
