I did freelance work on and off for about five or six years, and was always well-paid when I did.<p>Treat your customers better than they deserve, work dramatically harder than you would if you were on the payroll, charge through the nose, and make sure you interact more with the customer than the design (or servers, or database, or whatever; the way you explain things is more important than what you do...you have to do a good job, but if you fail to explain it well and in a way the client understands, you won't get referrals and you won't make the client happy).

In fact, it’s happening all around us, across the full spectrum of how we understand intelligence. It’s visible in the hive mind of the Internet,"" because that relates to something I heard a while back at a lecture by John Raven, current publisher of the Raven Progressive Matrices IQ test. He said that rather than thinking of intelligence as a trait of an individual, we can think of it as an emergent property of groups. Better communication among groups leads to more intelligence for all of humankind to enjoy. Thanks for sharing the article and boosting our intelligence here on HN.",1246130447

People expect software to be bug-free. When people buy a new version of a product, people expect new features. I mean, history has proven him completely correct - today, vendors provide free updates in their software to fix bugs and sell new versions with more features.<p>Secondly, you're always going to have bugs. It's inevitable. What's important is that your software, both in terms of design and testing, is resilient enough to avoid major bugs that a large proportion of people will run into. Historically, Microsoft were good at this - there's a reason they were behind ""Writing Solid Code"". What remains are bugs which are quirks and corner cases, which are generally less important and are harder to test for. Of course, the situation with security is rather different, as certain quirks and corner cases can have serious unintended repercussions.",1246129777
