Nobody minds that. In C++, the usual results are that it performs worse than assumed. Significantly worse.<p>> some jackass wrote a preprocessor macro called ""foo"" which does 18 different things<p>Yes. There is that. Thankfully, they are rare. (I'd rate the preprocessor as by far the worst part of C. Amongst other things, it costs us any number of tools that could help us reason about code)",1256057947

My story is roughly as follows: I'm a twenty year old Canadian who has had open heart surgery twice, maybe half a dozen day surgeries of various natures, and gotten the government-distributed flu vaccine every year for as long as I can remember.  All of this was organized and (mostly) paid for by the government, since that's the way the health care system works up here.  I haven't died a horrible death yet.

892688,comment,891726,892603,0,0,afiske,,,"You're describing the concept of ""consideration"" in contract law -- i.e., that each party to an agreement needs to exchange something of value in order for a valid contract to be formed.  However, one doesn't need to pay <i>money</i> for something in order for there to be an exchange of value.<p>Here, the copyright holder (Mark) has clearly given you something of value -- a copy of the text of his book.  In exchange, you give the him something of value, as well - your a promise to abide by the terms of the GNU FDL (as referenced on the book's copyright page).  Your promise has value to Mark -- if it didn't, he (presumably) would have simply released his work into the public domain, rather than under a GNU license.<p>The enforceability of open source licenses turns on this issue.  The implication of your statement is that an open source license is unenforceable whenever a work is distributed for free (and obviously, this kind of distribution happens all the time).  While there were some in the legal community who took this view in the past, the courts have rejected it.  Check out the 2008 Federal Circuit decision in Jacobsen v. Katzer (<a href=""http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1001.pdf</a>), which turned on the enforceability of the open source Artistic License.  Some of the more salient quotes:<p>- ""Traditionally, copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money.  The lack of money changing hands  in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration, however.  There are substantial benefits, including  economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties.""<p>- ""The choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes, rather than as a dollar-denominated fee, is entitled to no less legal recognition.""",1256056877

For things like UI stateful code is often the simpler solution. However for large, large swaths of a program using stateful objects is a complexity bog.<p>The real question here is whether programmers will bring their stateful OO habits and recreate them in Scala.<p>When I was first learning Clojure I started by creating an object system. And then I realized I was entirely missing the point as well as going against the grain of the language- functional programming is palpable in Clojure's design.<p>If an object maintains state you can't generally view it as an immutable value- that's another benefit to Clojure's approach. You generally design your program around the idea value -> function -> new value (_not_ same object with a different internal state). The transparency of this is quite enlightening.<p>In anycase, I don't know enough about Scala to make an informed opinion, but whether Scala's decision to meet OO programming sensibilities halfway is a liability remains to be seen.",1256056425

Are b and c implicitly invoking copy constructors for other classes as part of type coercion? Is that a normal assignment, or an assignment operator? Is there a cast operator involved?</i><p>If it's such a complicated expression, then the equivalent C code would be correspondingly large and hard to understand, and it would be just as complicated to figure out its cost.  The not-so-hidden cost of C is that even simple things end up being many, many lines of code.  C++ was invented because certain kinds of C programs -- programs that were <i>already being written in C</i> -- were painfully verbose to express and complicated to change.<p>If writing your code in C would be simple and clear, then you would have to be stupid to write it as complex, obscure C++.  When your C++ code gets complex and you start banging your head against a wall, imagine re-expressing it in C.  If the result would be an improvement, then you screwed up.  If you blame C++ for screwing up, then you're a language feature junkie.  Admit it and check yourself into rehab.<p><i>That is the hidden cost. The mental model for a simple function call became incredibly large and complex, and every function call is potentially as complex. Which makes reasoning about performance a rather hard thing to do....  All that translates ultimately into either worse performance or longer development time. Neither one is something you like to hear about.</i><p>I don't know how it is a ""hidden cost,"" because it's quite well understood that any reasonably expressive language can say more in a single line of code than C.  Anyway, the size of the mental model of your <i>program</i> is what you should be worried about.  C++ doesn't give you worse performance or longer development time.  It gives you more choices for how you express your program.  It means more <i>different</i> problems, because you can write C-style code and have C-style problems, or you can use the possibilities C++ offers and have different problems.  If you already know that the choices forced on you by C are usually the right ones for your domain, then by all means apply that knowledge to how you write C++.

All the type coercions that happen at the API level will show up as separate functions, not attributed to the callee, but the caller.</i><p>If you want them attributed to the callee, it's pretty simple.

Add possible ancestors to find out if a call is virtual.""<p>Put another way, the performance details we so often care about in projects for which we're using C++ are often non-local to the calling site. In order to know the performance characteristics of ""a = foo(b, c)"" I need to know a lot of things about the types of a, b, c, and foo, in addition to knowing what ""foo"" does inside its curly braces.  In contrast, while it's hard to reason about the instructions being executed in Java in the same way we do in C or even to a large degree in C++, the types of a, b, c, and foo don't really matter, since passing in b and c is always a pass by reference or a primitive value copy, and foo is pretty much always going to be dispatched the same way (and constructors are preceded by a ""new"" operator at the call site, so we don't have to worry about that, either).  Now, the only thing I care about is what's inside the foo method.<p>I am of course not disputing that you need to know the language you're using.

Telephone calls are pretty high fidelity, zero latency (if they're answered). Snail mail is for high fidelity, high-latency messages (like phone bills). Nobody would snail-mail a lunch invitation any more - too high a latency. And so on.\nTwitter is lower latency than IM; IM is lower than email. They vary in fidelity (Twitter's 120-char limit).\nThere remain room for a whole menagerie of tools in between, above and below. And these will be eclipsed when higher-fidelity replacements get invented.\nBtw somebody explain to me why its ok to automatically switch a phone call (low-latency, high-fidelity) to voice mail (abysmal latency, half-duplex crap fidelity)? This really bugs me. I don't set up voice mail because its absolutely the wrong choice - send me an email if you can't get me on the phone, or an IM or pretty much ANYTHING but voice mail.",1256054998

It's sans-serif at one end, serif at the other. (Among other things.) Regrettably, this demonstration doesn't seem to be available online. You can find it, e.g., in Hofstadter's ""Metamagical Themas"".",1256054915

The best book I have found on the DNA evidence for evolution written for a popular audience is Sean Carroll's The Making of the Fittest<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=tyRWHQAACAAJ&dq=Sean+B+Carroll&source=an&hl=en&ei=HN_dSvClBIyj8QaR36hv&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=11&ved=0CC4Q6AEwCg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=tyRWHQAACAAJ&dq=Sean+B+...</a><p>Perhaps one could compare changes in opinion after reading Dawkins's book with changes of opinion after reading Carroll's book. On my part, I think the change of opinion from believing young-earth creationism to believing the scientific fact of biological evolution takes assistance in dealing with opinions on religion as well as opinions on science.<p>After edit: I should note that I'm personally acquainted with people who have gone through the change of opinion being talked about in this thread. Such a change does happen, and it's legitimate to ask how it might happen more often, as having correct beliefs about biological evolution helps people have correct beliefs about other scientific issues (for example, safety and efficacy of vaccines).",1256054700

The vast majority are married to what they believe is their origin and trying to convince them otherwise, in my opinion, is a fool's errand. Majority of these conversations aren't based on not having enough facts, or having too many facts.<p>Also, you should frequent HN's IRC channel. You seem to create a lot of mostly off-topic threads that pose a single question in an attempt to create a discussion and I think your goals will be better suited to the channel.",1256054622
