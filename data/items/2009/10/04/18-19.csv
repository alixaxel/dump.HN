Perhaps you get faster action next time, now that you're paying for the premium plan.<p>It is indeed strange, though, that it took them so long to discover what must have been a huge traffic spike on your instance. Their administration panel needs work if it doesn't point out such anomalies at a glance. Also your own monitoring needs work if you didn't notice the spike of inbound traffic.<p>Anyways, good luck for the future and if you decide to switch or extend I'd be curious to read about it.",1254682643

I agree with the sentiment of the post insomuch as I never want to work with Drupal again, but that's a matter of personal taste.<p>The fact is that Drupal is a viable solution for a huge swath of problems that Rails would cost orders of magnitude more to solve.  Namely, boilerplate functionality.  Drupal gets extra points because of all CMSes it provides the most hooks and thought towards extendability by developers... nothing else even comes close.<p>That said, Drupal is not a good design for anything specific.  It imposes a lot of overhead in an attempt to be all things to all people.  The architecture is actually pretty amazing for what it does, but in my opinion it's the wrong level of abstraction to really be useful to be people who are obsessive about usability, design, performance, or maintainability.  That probably describes most people on HN in some regard, but it's far from the majority of people who ""want a website"".<p>In the wider business community there are far more people out in the world who have $5000, think its a lot of money, and want a full-featured blog + forum + e-commerce + brochureware site that they can update themselves.

Asking for technical help in Drupal forums almost guarantees a response from a well-meaning non-technical person who likely can't help you.<p>Asking in a module's issue queue can be hit or miss.  If it's a major project, you'll get a response and it'll be ""this has been asked before, here's the link.""  That's great.<p>More likely you'll never hear a response.<p>#drupal-support can have some very helpful people on it.  But once your question gets beyond general use of the major modules, the odds of getting useful help approach zero.",1254680117

Git works well for the intended use case of the strictly text projects such as the linux kernel etc. but not as good for complex multimedia applications with changes to binary files being common. I guess I could do a repack often but it would be nice for a version control system to handle these files better.

860402,comment,859885,859885,0,0,keefe,,,"I don't believe that this should ever go to zero. I think the heart of this question is : how do you maximize long term productivity? For me, if I work more than 70-77 hours a week for an extended period, my productivity drops. I can flirt with 90 hours in a pinch, but once I break 70 hours I start to make mistakes. I don't know about you, but my experience in writing software is that it is like poker in the sense that a single mistake can end up costing a lot. So, that translates to an optimal 10-11 hours a day with an occasional 12 hour day. This leaves 5-7 hours of free time per day. I also believe that a balanced mind, body and emotions leads to better results than overemphasizing one or the other. So, I focus on exercising to keep a sound body, sleeping 7-8 hours per night and spending an hour or two relaxing every day. Of course, I'm not rich yet, either.",1254679666
