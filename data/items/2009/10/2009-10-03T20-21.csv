Dan reached out to me via e-mail to say thanks for the note.  From that quick e-mail, we developed a great friendship.<p>Dan was another ""business guy"" with a finance background who jumped into a startup because he was angry, physically angry, about a problem he saw and wanted to make it better.  He was the first real kindred spirit I've found on my startup journey.  He was more than a mentor, he was an inspiration.<p>I leaned on him a lot, probably more than was fair, but Dan was always there to help me out, think things through, or just offer a pick-me-up when I was down about user numbers, distraught about my inability to help my startup because I couldn't code, or whatever else was on my mind.  He introduced me to new ideas and new techniques, but most importantly, he introduced me to a world of new friends. Because of him, I have a place to crash and people to hang with when I visit San Francisco.<p>Dan paid it forward and did it because he liked to help people.  He will be missed.",1254603317

Call it the Google Effect. The search giant's model, described by author John Battelle as ""a billion dollars, one nickel at a time,"" is a perfect description of how media companies hope to take tiny sources of local revenue and roll them up into big money.""</i><p>I think the New York times is missing the point of how Google makes money and how their income model works. The reason Google makes obscene amounts of money even though they only make a nickel per customer is twofold: They have <i>lots</i> of customers, and their expenses per customer is less than a nickel.<p>While I agree that local advertising is a great potential untapped revenue stream that can be harnessed through local news I think they have a bad business model. It appears that they try to set up an old-fashioned news outfit complete with editors, journalists et al. This adds substantial cost to the venture, and all of a sudden you need to make more than a nickel per customer to cover your costs.<p>In short it looks like an old media empire misunderstanding online businessmodels, namely create a service that might cost you a lot in initial effort but will scale (almost) effortlessly to millions of users, thus making your cost per customer approach zero. An editor and a few journalists for every community isn't cheap and doesn't scale.",1254603052

The only time you would need to do that is if you wanted to keep an empty directory in the structure of the git repo. If checking out an empty folder with a dot file in it is not desired you could always add a post checkout hook to delete them. Though in that scheme you would lose your empty dirs on checkin I would wager(not sure though).<p>Edit: you could probably do a precommit hook too to inject the dot files into the empty directories.",1254602436

People directly perceive and compare the difficulty of reading and understanding a few consecutive lines or blocks of code.  Understanding 20 lines of Perl is on average more difficult than understanding 20 lines of, say, Java.  The upshot is that you need much more than 20 lines of Java to implement code equivalent to those 20 lines of Perl.
