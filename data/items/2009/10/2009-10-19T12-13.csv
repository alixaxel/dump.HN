Sure, Expose drops frames now and then (dropping frames is the sensible approach, not displaying every frame and introducing stutter), but that's ok. That makes the animation jerky but just as quick and reduces the impression of stutter.<p>I think it is very plausible that seamless and low key animations can increase usability. Sure, user testing would be needed to verify that, but it seems intuitive enough to me. There are technical problems, sure, and stuttering animations should be avoided, but that's no reason to reject morphing out of hand.",1255957007

Far too much Java code that I've seen has relied entirely on what Javadoc can produce automatically from a codebase that does not contain lots of hints and extra documentation. A listing of classes and their methods is not even an adequate reference guide, let alone an adequate explanation of how to use the library and why it was written the way it was.<p>As a counter example, I find that most perldoc documentation on CPAN is pretty good, because the standard practice for Perl module documentation is centered on the documentation sections that should be included _other than the list of methods_. NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, USAGE, AUTHOR, SEE ALSO are all standard sections, and the kind of stuff that javadoc normally generates is just a subset of USAGE.",1255956867

I was surprised to find that my Perl program was running slowly because of things like ""my @result = function"" instead of ""my $result_ref = function"".  Returning a list was hugely expensive.<p>Similarly, Haskell programmers will notice that their app is using too much memory, and then track down the space leaks that lazy evaluation caused and fix them.  But most of these are easy to avoid in the first place.<p>As for monads, the problem is that people think they're hard, so their brain tells them ""THIS IS HARD"" and drowns out any ability to learn them.  Experienced category theorists dislike monads for a few reasons; they are either too generic or not generic enough.  Applicative functors and Arrows provide other options for similar control structures.  Practicing programmers like monads over arrows because the syntax is nicer; they dislike them because complex monad transformer stacks are unwieldy.  This is not something that happens often, though, hence the continued popularity.<p><i>Static typing was not necessarily done wrong.</i><p>It was done wrong.  People think that static typing means ""Class class = new Class"" instead of ""class = new Class"".  It doesn't, but the damage was done, and people switched to dynamic languages.  (Before Java, people hated C because even trivial programs like ""read a file containing numbers and return an array of them"" was non-trivial.  With the ""dynamic languages"" it was simple matter of ""my @numbers = <$file>"", and now you had a list of numbers you could compute with.  Nothing to do with any type system; simply a bad implementation that correlated with static typing.)<p><i>Finally, Haskell, and other functional languages, generally are not hugely amenable to dynamic linking and changing the code executing at runtime.</i><p>Nor is Java, or C without unix.

Otherwise we're just slowing global warming, not stopping it.  And that's not going to happen.  Aside from that, it's completely unrealistic that we'll even be able to slow it, given that it needs to be done in all nations,and that's just not going to happen.<p>What we need are large scale technological solutions.",1255953928

Most of the projects I work on use transitions extensively in their interfaces mainly for the aesthetic value but I hadn't considered the potential usability advantage too.<p>The thing is, personally I prefer interfaces without transitions (or at least those interfaces that have a way of disabling them). I suppose when you become very familiar with a piece of software you know exactly what happens when you perform a particular action so the visual cue becomes redundant. The more I use something that has transitions, no matter how fast or minimal they are, the more they get on my nerves! Disabling transitions where possible is one of the first things I do after installing a new OS, be it Windows or OSX.<p>That's the danger of transitions too, the desire to go overboard for the aesthetic and end up frustrating users as things take too long to happen, even if they delight the first time they are seen. I find Flash websites in particular fall into this trap too often.",1255953677
