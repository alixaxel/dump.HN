For programs I run frequently, I place 1 letter shortcuts in the windows directory. That way, to launch a program I just type Win+R+[char]+Enter. You can also launch shortcuts on the taskbar using Win+[0-9], but if you already have an instance it will just show you the existing one .. which is useless because that's what Alt+Tab is for.<p>Edit: You can also assign shortcuts like Ctrl+Alt+[char], but those are more awkward to use, and also will focus an existing instance instead of creating a new one.",1256154926

895488,comment,894597,895339,0,0,antirez,,,"yes, I think your point is correct but what I don't like the concepts behind the reddit new formula, because I really think that 100 upvotes and 30 downvotes are really different than 10 upvotes and 3 downvotes. Also time should absolutely appear in the equation in my opinion in the kind of discussion site like reddit or HN, since new comments, if as good as old comments, should be able to go up. And in this latest trick there is in my opinion the best way to avoid stagnation leading to the same top comments being voted up and up again. I'll experiment a bit about this issue, since I'm very interested in this issues. I happen to run oknotiize.virgilio.it that's the main social news site in Italy, and while we have voting on comments we currently use a chronological sorting. The votes are just used to colour the background red or green. Now I want to add sorting so I'll try to design an algorithm having the following goals:<p>a) time matters, so good old comments tend to go down, but this only happens in the first 24/48 hours, in the long run everything is much more ordered by score.
b) the score of a comment is roughly up/down but it tends to get better with more votes.
c) still much better a/b ratios tend to win against other comments having a lot of comments. For instance a 100 up and 50 down will win against a 10 up and 5 down in a strong way, but will be more or less the same score as a 15 up and 5 down.<p>I'll post here my final algorithm.",1256154463

895480,comment,895286,895286,0,0,spencerfry,,,"Someone asked why we haven't updated our homepage in 3 years (and the significance of that) and if I could speak to that. The comment got deleted before I could respond, so I'll just create a new thread.<p>It's partially covered in the article. The first year, we were still do consulting work, so we barely spent any time on Carbonmade. And then in the second year, we were working on a second product that never saw the light of day. And now in the third year, we're focused on Carbonmade exclusively and nearly ready to release the new version.<p>Here's what I learned from running a company for three years without any update to the product: Excellent customer service could be the most significant thing you can do. (Granted, you need a pretty solid product.) During the first year we were really bad with emails and responding to our customers around the Net. We practically ignored everyone and everything. We just didn't have the time. Then in year two, I began to take customer support very seriously. I'd respond to peoples emails within minutes (when I could) and within hours 90% of the time. You literally can take a look at our graphs and see a HUGE uptick in signups/paid sign ups/customer retention within a month of responding to emails.<p>I also went back through at least 6 months of old emails that we had simply archived away and responded to everyone explaining how sorry we were for not giving them good support and answering their questions. I wrote everyone individually and got a lot of ""it's no problem, I'm happy that you're spending the time to do so now."" It really impacted our brand a lot and we saw a lot of people begin to respond with emails like: ""Wow, you guys responded faster than I've ever been responded to before. You're so great. Thanks so much for your service. I'm telling all my friends.""<p>Also, around this time I chose to treat all customers equally no matter if they were paying or if they weren't. I figured -- and you'd think this was obvious -- that spending a few extra minutes to treat free customers well will make them more likely to upgrade and actually costs less (in time and money) than going out and finding new customers. This turned out to be very successful. I can point to hundreds of emails from free customers that upgraded after hearing back from a ""real person who was kind and helpful"".<p>Good customer service is king and really turned our product around.<p>(Thanks for reading my rant.)",1256154288

895459,comment,895051,895351,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I installed the Beta version of Win7, and am running the Release Candidate now. The visible improvements are minor evolutionary things that won't sound huge, but lead to a generally faster and better experience.<p>Like Vista, it has the search bar built into the start menu. The taskbar is improved - you can pin icons onto it in a way that makes them easy to click and load into. It speeds things up quite a lot for commonly used things. The Taskbar also uses icons now instead of words, which works surprisingly well.<p>There's a new library feature where anything you save in different folders can be viewable in the same library. So, you can have all your financial spreadsheets organized by month in each folder, and then have a library that shows them all next to each other. For people that do certain kinds of work with lots of files and folders, this is a godsend. For instance, people who take a lot of pictures can have all the pictures feed into one library - makes it much easier to find things instead of hunting for them.<p>There's some added security which is good, and they stripped out their bloat. It loads fast and doesn't lag. Crashes less. There's some other under the hood improvements. It's a solid OS overall, I quite enjoy using it. You get all the benefits that Vista had, new benefits, and performance is comparable to XP. Not sure about the status on drivers - I've had a couple older games not work, so that sucks.

It took Microsoft 5 years to make Vista, and Apple easily cranks out new versions on gorgeous hardware and makes 50% of Vista's profit.
