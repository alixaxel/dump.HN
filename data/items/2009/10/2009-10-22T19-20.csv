The ionization rate for radiation is proportional to (I'll ignore boring constants) Amplitude^N, where N is the least integer such that N omega > - E_0.<p>Here, E_0 is the energy of the bond the radiation breaks, and omega is the frequency of the radiation. Amplitude is small (you'll be thermally cooked long before Amplitude > 1), so the ionization rate is a small number to the power of large N.<p>It's virtually unmeasurable for small amplitude and large N. Typically to measure ionization in the microwave regime, one needs to use a microwave resonating cavity.<p>(I have a paper doing some rigorous math on this topic.

If there was some source of randomness that was uncorrelated with all your other variables besides attending vs not, then that would be an instrumental variable. Say the government decided to take a pool of 10,000 elite college acceptees, gave them each a number from one to 10,000 and then said only the even numbers could actually attend.
