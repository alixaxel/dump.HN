886554,comment,886489,886489,0,0,TheElder,,,"As a white male, I felt pretty good in graduate school (for computer science).  I was often the only white in my graduate classes.  While there were plenty of Chinese, Koreans, and Indians, there weren't any whites.  This made me realize what a great opportunity I had.  The whites were mainly in liberal arts, business, marketing, accounting, and English.  What does that mean for me?  It means that my peers, mainly other whites who I'll be competing against, will probably not have CS graduate degrees.  Good for me, but probably bad for the overall state of the country.<p>I worked the entire time during my school career, and that experience is what employers really care about, but I believe it helps that I have a graduate degree when interviewing and getting through the HR door.",1255748368

You differentiate by doing something totally different. Writing open source software, freelancing, and traveling for four years would lead to much more interesting and better credentials than four years in most universities.",1255747348

Good choice!<p>Now, many other people wisely do the same. The more people have degrees, the more pressure is applied on those who don't to go get one. Awkward, that.<p>So, now we have a huge demand for degrees, plus a lot of degree-seekers who (to be honest) aren't really cut out for college. But that's no big deal! The market hears and obeys, as enrollment goes up, standards go down, and bottom-tier schools admit anyone with a pulse. Hooray, everyone's getting educations, isn't this great? Who cares if they're <i>learning</i> anything.<p>Oh dear, it seems we've stumbled into a Nash equilibrium wherein the competent people are still competent, the incompetent are still incompetent, you can't tell them apart by seeing who has a degree anymore, and now everyone has student loans weighing them down.

It doesn't look like Microsoft won the server to me!<p>That said, I don't know what would have happened without the monopoly abuse.  Open source makes enough sense that it could have done well.  However the meteoric rise in open source happened in large part because the whole industry was willing to do anything to make Microsoft lose.  That is why everyone jumped on open source the second it became clear that Microsoft would be unable to retaliate for a bit.<p>Therefore I suspect that open source would have eventually succeeded, but not as fast, and likely not in webserving.",1255745903

While I don't think that all applications should be constructed using C (I'm a fan of Clojure, JS, Python), clearly Apple'c choice of going with C (or a minor variation of C, Objective-C) has paid off in spades.<p>By innovating on C they have a fairly expressive and extremely performant application language. By adding blocks Apple has added a useful higher level construct as well as an excellent tool when writing concurrent applications without the burden of locks.<p>Considering the fact that the iPhone is largely built on C, I would hardly call it the ""wrong language for entire applications"".",1255744871
