As more people buy from farmers, CSAs, and farmers markets, those suppliers will scale, and prices will come down.<p>The ""boundaries"" promoted by locavorism aren't arbitrary. Local food is seasonal, has a lower environmental impact, and tends to come from smaller farms. It's part of a farm-to-table ethic that makes food traceable and creates a relationship between suppliers and consumers that isn't arbitrated by huge multinational corporations.

Each department has their own section in which non-IT folks can create simple HTML content and can attach documents. It is also relatively simple to share this content with other groups as needed, based on membership in Active Directory groups.<p>More controversially, SP also seems to be replacing MS Access as the non-IT-sanctioned application platform of choice. Instead of creating Access databases on a file share, people use SP ""lists"" to store data. The controversy stems from the fact that these lists often outgrow the practical limits of SP and need to be migrated to ""real"" systems.<p>Many people also seem to want to use SP as a Content Management System or even as the preferred application development platform (in which all application functionality is delivered as SP ""web parts"", which plug in to SP pages). These uses seem to cause as many problems as they solve, but that's just my opinion.",1255577618

Your main option: pay AT&T more to prioritize your packets.<p>-- If Goog deprioritizes you out of their search rankings, again, like losing several states (or countries) worth of traffic. Your option: pay Goog to place you more prominently via AdWords.<p>> People are free to search with Bing, they are not free to ask that their routers avoid AT&T’s network.<p>From the perspective of a packet receiver, you cannot realistically make your customers switch from Goog anymore than you can make them avoid routing packets through AT&T connections.<p>> then anyone whose connection gets passed to AT&T at any point in the routing would be affected, even if neither the provider nor consumer is a customer of AT&T.<p>Also, a second point: when I make a telephone call to a business, I have no idea whether AT&T dropped the connection or what if it doesn't go through. I just give up on that business and call another business.<p>Similarly, if a business isn't in the organic top 10 on Goog, I don't even know about it. I just use another business. Note that in this situation neither I nor the business am paying Goog money.<p>Of course the business can use Adwords, but that's like paying AT&T to prioritize their packets.",1255577554

It's roughly that level of quality - crashes frequently, is difficult to navigate and relies on people begging others to do things that should be easy (""can you upload this document because I can't find the correct place"").<p>As a specific example, one of the primary use-cases for it involves a person uploading a word document, and then other finding it. The problems with uploading are numerous, but we'll ignore them for the moment (sufficient to say that depending on which version of Word you have you may or may not be able to save directly to the Sharepoint repository, and of course it might crash while saving, losing anything you have done). The real problem is the search - by default it only searches on office metadata, so finding ""Template for xxx"" is no problem, but unless everyone correctly sets up their metadata you can never find the documents. Apparently it can be reconfigured to index content as well, but at in the first place I came across it I found it more effective to build my own search index by crawling the webdav directly structure (That was in Java, with NTLM authentication, extracting text from MS office document - so that shows how ""easy"" it was).

So take Drupal, but build it with IIS, ASP.NET, Microsoft SQL Server, XSLT and Search. Make sure you throw in plugins that make it manage Microsoft Office documents very well, with hooks into things like Outlook, and there you have it. It's nice because it has lots of features, but the flip side is it's prone to break down with no way to restore from backup because the restore process is so complicated. It also gets lots and lots of patches every month. Takes up so much memory and CPU that you actually need a <i>farm</i> of them and that's where the complications really start.
