This prohibition is to ensure that the software tested and approved during the qualification process remains unchanged and retains its integrity.

896109,comment,895074,896039,0,0,DougWebb,,,"While that's true, it seems that a function call maps precisely onto request-response: call a function, get back a return value. Statefulness isn't a problem for REST or HTTP either, because it's the communication protocol that's stateless, not the resources. For example, websites are REST services, the pages on the website are the resources, and they certainly exist: that's their state. What's stateless is that it doesn't matter what order you retrieve the pages; you'll always get the same page for a given URL. The only exception is when the request is intended to change the state of some resource, such as this thread changing state when I submit the comment I'm writing.<p>For a RESTful function call service, each function would be a resource, and the functions would be required not to have side-effects (eg: don't change the state of the service). That's often good design for any API, not just RPC-type services. Again, the exception would be function calls whose purpose is to modify the service state in some way.<p>When the service state is intended to be different for each user of the service, HTTP has a solution for that too: a cookie which contains a token identifying the session. Any state changes can be associated with the token.<p>Now you mention bi-directional. If you mean that either side of the interaction can initiate an exchange, then you're right; HTTP is no good for that. Not many RPC services work that way though; it's more complex to design. It's much more common and simpler to have client/server interactions where the client initiates every exchange, and the server listens and responds. You can do a lot with that model.",1256178668
