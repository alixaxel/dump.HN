Included in this survey was a field to collect the user's email address. This field was very clearly marked as optional (it even appeared after the confirmation code that allowed turkers to complete the ""HIT"") and the label included something like ""Your answers to this survey will help us to evolve the website to better meet your needs. If you'd like to be notified when the new site launches, please enter your email address here."" along with an indication that users would receive exactly one email from us due to this form.<p>I was pretty pleased with the results of the survey--I received a lot of actionable information very quickly and cheaply (at about $0.10 per response) and I was pleasantly surprised that a little more than 10% of the respondants entered what looks like a valid email address.<p>I don't expect many of those 10% to convert (and lead generation wasn't the point of the excercise anyway) but I was very happy with the ROI on this survey.<p>Seeing who clicks on ads (and at with what copy) and later ""soft"" converts may be a more realistic test, but the MTurk approach is an order of magnitude less expensive.",1256045915

892324,comment,890795,892248,0,0,philwelch,,,"""Eventually the money becomes worthless.""<p>This is a fundamentally untestable hypothesis: there are many currencies that have suffered hyperinflation, yes, but many others which have gone on for decades without any real harm. You can claim that at some point in the future the currency will fail, and no matter how much time goes by you still won't be proven wrong.<p>As it happens, commodity-backed currencies aren't immune to problems either. The informal use of tobacco as currency in the colonial South led to a vast overproduction of tobacco and what we would today recognize as severe inflation (Friedman, Free to Choose). You need commodities that are inherently difficult to increase the supply of. In the 19th century, the American government had a seemingly perfect solution: a fixed ratio of dollars to silver, as well as a separate fixed ratio of dollars to gold. Long story made short, a silver rush disrupted this system and necessitated a move to the pure gold standard. The gold standard directly caused a lot of deflation though, which was a severe practical problem and a contributing factor to the Great Depression.<p>""Throughout the history of central banking in the united states we've had all of the worst financial crises and extreme loss of value (the dollar has lost 98%) of it's  value since the federal reserve took over.""<p>As it happens, this doesn't cause any real problems. It's ideal of course for neither inflation nor deflation to occur, but the consequences of deflation are so much more dire that, as a practical concern, we err on the side of inflation.<p>The economic consequences of mild inflation are as follows: there is an incentive to invest or spend money rather than bury it in your back yard, and there is a small degree of information loss in the price system as prices rise due to inflation. The economic consequences of deflation (an incentive to bury money in your back yard) have catastrophic consequences. The main advantage of fiat currencies is that it's possible to grow the currency at close to the same rate as the economy itself, so the degree of inflation or deflation can be controlled and minimized, with a bias towards inflation since that is the less harmful of the two. Any natural commodity has its own fluctuations in value, both natural and artificial, i.e. the Fisk/Gould plot to corner the gold market during the Grant administration.<p>Finally, some notes about gold in particular. There are a number of reasons gold is an infeasible currency base in the modern day. One is that, were the entire world monetary supply backed by gold, the price of gold would be so high as to all but eliminate the use of gold for any useful purposes. Of course, the whole world wouldn't switch over at once, but any single country that did would run into a lot of problems. A large country would increase the cost of gold to unreasonable levels--a small country would be at the mercy of any other country with significant gold reserves which could, by selling off gold, tactically devalue that country's currency.<p>""Lastly, if a currency is good it doesn't have to be forced upon you; if people actually believed in fiat currencies they would allow competing systems and abolish legal tender laws.""<p>Legal tender laws predate even the gold standard, and are probably a practical necessity for debt to be enforceable. At the very least, the government has to mandate a specific currency for people to pay their taxes in, and it's probably just as important for the government to mandate a specific currency for legal judgments to be paid in. There is no actual law against you setting up shop and accepting gold as payment, but if someone runs their truck into your shop and you sue them, no court is going to bend over backwards to make the truck driver pay you anything except US dollars. What you're describing is essentially a barter system, where you only accept payment in gold, your neighbor only accepts payment in silver, your friend only accepts payment in chickens, and I only accept payment in portraits of Benjamin Franklin.<p>So, let's say we have a gold standard. Well, as I intimated above, a gold standard is just as much a fiat currency as a ""Ben Franklin portrait"" standard: the government up and tells you that something is money, therefore it's worth more than it should be for any practical purpose. Given the choice, a currency that can be managed to prevent serious financial problems is preferable to a currency that can't.<p>I'd be more than happy to answer any other questions, or clear up any misconceptions about this issue.",1256045513
892323,comment,891813,892303,0,0,unalone,,,"Yes, but we're talking very small screens here, with very little room for design. When you can design any application to run at 800x600, then maybe you don't fill <i>every</i> screen but you have enough space to do what you want. When you're dealing with very small screens, some of which are multitouch and some of which aren't, some of which have physical keyboards and some of which don't, then you have to juggle a lot of variables and the quality of your design suffers.<p>I shouldn't have to point out the level of build in the iPhone apps gallery. Those applications are <i>gorgeous</i>. Better than most PC apps, I'd argue, in their compactness and elegance. Developers have an edge on the iPhone because there's an established design standard, and there's an established screen size. So they can spend as long as they need fiddling to make their app perfect within those confines. On Android, that's not possible.<p>To use an unnecessary metaphor, iPhone apps are haiku and Android apps are open verse.

892314,comment,892124,892124,0,0,unalone,,,"Fuck that shit! We've spent a long time online realizing that in a web environment, it's possible to promote ourselves without spreading the low-level negativity associated with older advertising methods. This is the Internet! Gaining lots of publicity for yourself can be achieved with good, happy, <i>fun</i> things! The advantage of giving everybody a voice is that now you don't <i>have</i> to contact everybody yourself. You can work on making something so good their friends contact them for you.<p>If you think cold calling is the most effective tool you've got when you're sitting in front of a computer, look just a smidge deeper. I think the point of the blog post was dead-on—if you're out to directly establish relationships with people, then establish them without making it a business. You'll find a way to mention the product to them without it deliberately being a sales pitch.<p><i>It was a friken cold call and it worked. You went through the trouble to blog about it.</i><p>I don't see how it worked. He blogged about it <i>without</i> mentioning the name of the product. When I read this, I don't feel any thoughts about the product he was pitched because I don't know what the product was. If the goal was to get promotion, it failed utterly.<p><i>I bet you good money you wont forget the company or its product for the next few years though, and every time you see a similar product you can't help but compare them.</i><p>I hear this a lot on Hacker News and related fori: People who think that just because you have a product in your mind, it's good advertising. I heard it a lot in particular with the weird Microsoft ads. Well, in the advertising world, that's bogus. People knowing your name does <i>not</i> translate to sales unless they know your name in the right context. Apple's 1984 ad is the one they teach for this reason: People discussed it the say after it aired, asking themselves what Macintosh was, what the ad meant, and so they came to the conclusion collectively that Macintosh was something big and new. It's an ad that made a positive spin. But when I see a weird, messed-up ad that I don't understand, or when somebody goes out of their way to mention their product to me, the name sticks around but there's no positive signifier to it. I'm not willing to buy a product just because I recognize their ad. There's got to be something that convinces me it's maybe worth buying.<p>So in this case, perhaps the guy will remember the product name—though I seriously doubt that. You underestimate our ability to block things out that we don't want to hear. I've received a dozen emails from people that wanted me to advertise them on my blog, and I don't remember a single product name. If he <i>does</i> remember it, though, that doesn't necessarily brainwash him. He won't see competing products and say, ""Nope, can't think about this, I have another name in mind."" Rather, he'll ask logical, uninfluenced questions, like ""Do I need this at all? Why would I get <i>this</i> rather than <i>that</i>?"" If there's any bias now, I'd say it's negative—""Well, <i>this</i> guy didn't think a good promotion would be cold calling. Looks like he's not so much a desperate fucker."" (That would be my reaction, though to be fair I'm a mean person so it might be a bit over-the-top.)<p>When business people look at everything as a potential sale, they risk wasting a lot of time making a few sales. That's a bad way to do business. Much smarter to figure out how to do the most with a little effort—and friending somebody on Facebook is usually just a bit too much effort to close a sale, especially if you need a thousand sales a month to break even.",1256045058

The Android guys, who are not stupid, certainly have J2ME to look at as an example of what could go wrong.  And, to tell the truth, even J2ME is certainly painful once you try and taret a wide number of devices, but not impossible.",1256044367

The same's not true for Android, which is why developers are reporting failures with the applications they're designing for it.<p>I've never used Android, unfortunately—can't find people with the phone to irritate/mug—but I'd imagine it's good, and I like that Google's released an OS with some focus on being good, because cell phone companies showed in the last decade that they don't give a damn about good when left to their own devices. Where I don't have faith in it, though, is in its attempt to make a developer haven that the iPhone doesn't offer. It seems that there're integral problems to its developer experience that won't fix themselves easily.",1256044041
