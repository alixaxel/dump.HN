860052,comment,859818,859818,0,0,ax0n,,,"I was thinking about something very similar yesterday. People have goals for what they want to do in life. Maybe it's what they want to become -- their own boss, a missionary or an independently wealthy person. Maybe it's what they want to do -- fish, drive fast cars, or see every continent in person.<p>Regardless, people should come up a plan for how to do -- or become those things. And the goals they set for themselves should be ones that really do get them closer to what they want.<p>Any time spent doing things that don't really help you toward your goal (this includes surviving in order to meet your goal, duh!) is basically a betrayal of one's self. 
As for me? I just want to help people. I do it by learning things well enough to teach them to others, by honing my writing and speaking skills, by writing and speaking about helpful things, and -- of course -- by lending a hand to people whom I know how to help.",1254664726
860051,comment,858717,858783,0,0,a-priori,,,"All the techniques described in this book use rate-based coding. That is, they assume that the important dynamic property is the level of activation or, in biological terms, the neuron's firing rate. Biological evidence shows that correlations in spike <i>timing</i> is also very important for both the network's behaviour and for learning (called ""spike-timing-dependent plasticity"").<p>Some people have started developing computer models of this property, but unfortunately it's not a widely known research topic. One paper I've read is Gerstner et al. (1999) in which they describe a model of unsupervised learning. Gerstner also has a book called <i>Spiking Neuron Models</i>, which is available online, that goes into a lot of detail on the topic. Other people have done supervised learning by evolving network topologies using genetic algorithms.<p>The advantage of spike-based models is that they they also seem to scale better to larger networks, and have greater power for networks of similar complexity.<p>I'm quite optimistic about this field of research. Neural network research has seemed to become stagnant recently for some reason, but I think switching to spike-based models is the way out of that.",1254664663

The use and threat of violence coupled with an insulation from or complete lack of law drives slavery. And that is why I think it is such a pervasive problem. Solutions that work may require carrying a bigger stick -- and using it. That terrifies me. I abhor state military intervention, but I also abhor slavery through violence.

860026,comment,859770,859933,0,0,mr_luc,,,"I'm curious about your reactions because I felt a similar sense of unease while reading this article -- feeling that I was being sold something, instead of learning something. I managed to set it aside because I encountered various vestiges of this industry where I live in S.A., and was spurred to look into it a bit.<p><pre><code>  That presenting the low-cost of purchasing a slave today
  comes across as shock-value to get an emotional response.
  And the response that he seems to be going for is ...
</code></pre>
I'd say that this seems at odds with<p><pre><code>  I feel like I want to see all of the numbers, and when 
  numbers are pushed off to the side, it feels .. deceptive
</code></pre>
Although, as you mention, it'd be nice to see ALL of the numbers. Still, you could probably suss up your own percentage comparison with wikipedia.<p>But here he's just presenting a solid, straightforward bit of data: the retail price.<p>You said that this is (or feels) a bit disingenuous -- giving us data out of context to provoke emotion; NY isn't Haiti; it's hard to get the slaves across borders; slaves were money-making operations in the past and aren't anymore, which is why the price is down.<p>Incidentally, human slaves ARE still money-making machines, albeit less completely than during the days of slavery. Brothels are the most straightforward example -- in the country I live in (most of the time), prostitution itself is essentially legal; it may be illegal, but the enforcement is all of the regulatory type (stay-classy headline: ""Officers Check Douches In Area <i>Prostibulos</i>."")<p>Despite this, human trafficking is a not-insignificant component of the prostitution industry there. Why?<p>The economy is getting better. A pretty young teenage girl has way, way more options than selling her body. So the only way to get and keep 'good talent' is, essentially, slavery that starts really young.<p>Now, in that context, it's clear that the retail price <i>is</i> an important part of the equation. If one of the ways you make money is the sex tourism industry (either globally or regionally), clearly you've figured out how to scale either the movement of your humans or the business of attracting customers to you, and the price of the humans is an important data point; the fact that it's so low, given how much harder smuggling people is than cocaine, is a disheartening problem for those considering where to target disincentives.<p><pre><code>  it's coming across as deceptive (even though the intentions may be good)
</code></pre>
I think that it may be feel that way, but as the facts seem to be solidly behind (essentially) everything he's saying, I'd ascribe that more to the artificiality that comes from other sources.<p>Like being asked, over and over again (speaking engagements, book tours, countless one-off interviews like this one), to try and squeeze the impact of an important message through the needle-eye of interview questions of variable quality.",1254662282

I can even see the border wall from where I sit. I've met a number of illegal immigrants, I even went to school (in America!) with a few of them. The fact of the matter is that you have miles and miles of border that is damn near impossible to secure. Short of militarizing the border with some sort of armed computer-operated sentry, you aren't going to keep people from getting in. Building a wall simply forces people to either go over or under it.<p>If you can't get keep people from getting in, how do you spot them once they're here? I work with a Mexican national (he's legal, though). Without knowing better, I wouldn't be able to tell that he's an immigrant while some other person is not, and I've lived my entire life, save for one year, on the border. You could, of course, try to document the legal people (with, I don't know, some sort of passport) and force every person that <i>looks</i> like they could be illegal to present identification. I know I for one would love to live in a place that unfairly persecutes anyone that isn't white! </sarcasm><p>Get real, the only way to ease the problem with illegal immigration (and with borders the size of the US, you'll never get rid of it) is to make the process of becoming legal a sane experience.
