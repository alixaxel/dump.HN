867510,comment,865412,866757,0,0,catzaa,,,"> Studies get published if they survive peer review, and publications have citations. Citations, please?<p>Not to offend you, but we have had this exact same discussion a few times. If you remember correctly the last time I gave you a bunch of citations which you apparently did not take to heart. We had the discussion 170 and 200 days ago.  The same discussion follows the exact same trend with you quoting a bunch of stuff out of Flynn’s books.<p>Here is the link to the discussion on the same topic that we had 173 days ago with a bunch of citations: 
Discussion 170 days ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=566205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=566205</a><p>Discussion 208 days ago: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=513957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=513957</a><p>> Because Flynn does his homework and makes unassailable research findings that are published in the best journals. Arthur Jensen has written, ""Now and then I am asked . . . who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind.""<p>Yes. And Arthur Jensen also said sarcastically that they have to go all the way to New Zealand to find someone that published papers opposing his with any credibility. Flynn may have noticed some interesting trends in IQ tests – but that doesn’t make him a specialist in psychometrics.<p>> Because I have Pinker's book at hand, I checked his chapter on the issue, and Pinker says, ""The Third Law: A substantial portion of the variation in complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families."" The environment in the world at large does matter, and it matters for a lot. Pinker is forced to acknowledge this because that is what the research shows. It is regrettable that Pinker fails to cite the articles that establish the difference between heritability and mutability (""malleability"") directly in the text of his book, but I will cite those here.<p>I did not refer to Pinker’s book about the whole intelligence debate, but to the debate that certain social scientists wants to warp science because they are scared of the truth (the is instead of the ought to). As for Pinker’s personal views on intelligence – he is not a specialist in the field.<p>> ""Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008).""<p>In all fairness, I don’t think that to measure the difference in height between a first world country and a country with yearly hunger and severe malnutrition is fair. This will be at a huge peak in differences between heights because there was a severe famine in 1995. So, what you are saying is that it is surprising that people who suffered malnutrition and disease as children do not have the same height? Is this really news?<p>I would really love to have this debate again with you (since you are clearly interested in the field). Unfortunately I have a big deadline coming up and I can’t waste 6 hours reading papers.<p>Maybe post the article again in two months and we can have a proper debate? ;)",1254945498

Is it worse than low unit test coverage say 20, 30, 40%? Or off at a tangent TDD makes Java programming feel like Ruby (or vice versa), just something for people to intellectually grab onto in terms of scale.<p>I ask because not unit testing at all seems (to me) to be further from unit testing than TDD is, yet from this current discussion it would appear that unit test fans have more issues with the latter than the former.",1254945411

ActiveX controls are native X86 code packaged as DLLs that run in IE. They're very horrible, but big companies have tens of apps that rely on them.<p>You can think of ActiveX (AX) as the web extensions for Win32 COM, which is the ""advanced"" version of OLE, which is the mechanism that allows you to embed Excel spreadsheets in Word documents (by loading Excel as a DLL and giving it a window context). Ruby has support for OLE and for native Windows calls with Win32OLE.<p>What Chris has done here is build a system whereby he can take any AX DLL, use Ruby to find all the AX interfaces (they're registered, because AX uses COM), and then automatically generate a web server that will generate pathological inputs for each of them. So basically, you drop in the AX binary, and Chris' system automatically builds a torture test for it, without you even knowing what the AX control does.<p>This isn't our idea; I'm pretty sure we stole it from HD Moore.",1254943396
