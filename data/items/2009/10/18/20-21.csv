In other words, most other languages suck as much as C++, they're just not that widely used, or have not been around as much.<p>If you're writing your own game project you can use a sane, minimalistic and syntactically pleasing subset of C++ and gain all the pedal-to-the-metal advantages. Don't discard C++ because other people say it is terrible. Other people are usually wrong. Make up your own mind.<p>For example, the Keyspace code is organized into classes; we use inheritance and polymorphism; we use templates in a few select cases; but we completely avoid exceptions, operator overloading (actually operators) and the STL altogether (we implement our own containers). It doesn't matter what others think about this specific subset - it works for us, we work well in this formalism, make few mistakes and produce good code that runs fast.",1255899129
888810,comment,888643,888782,0,0,thras,,,"Type-inference is needed in C++ (and is already part of the next standard, you can enable the auto keyword with gnu gcc already). But it's needed for entirely different purposes than what scripting languages use it for: it's a feature for writing better templates.<p>It's confusing because there are two types of type-inference (run-time and compile-time). You do lose performance with run-time type-inference, which is what most interpreted languages use. C++ already has compile-time type-inference in the form of templates. They are...complex. But they're also faster than anything similar. There's a reason that C++'s sort is usually faster than C's qsort for complex types.<p>C++ doesn't have run-time type-inference and probably won't. The performance loss is too big to build it into the language everywhere, and unless you do that it's pretty pointless. You can tack it on with boost::any or RTTI, for example, but you'll generally find that it's not the correct decision from an engineering standpoint. Scripting languages have run-time type-inference built in everywhere -- but they do it at the cost of performance.<p>Now, as far as the problems of C++'s dependence on C...well, you're right. It's a feature of C++'s history. If someone could come along and invest the millions of man hours required in making a performance-critical high-level language without the C-baggage (and then market it!), it would be a great thing. But that's a pipe dream. The best we're going to do on that front is Java.",1255899120

888796,comment,888643,888643,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I've been contemplating this, too. C++ was my main language for a long time (~1999-2007) and about 30% of my consulting work is still in C++ (game development). I've found that while C++ code can be very clean and concise, it usually requires a lot of behind the scenes scaffolding, and it's very easy to get wrong even if you know the damn thing inside out. Programming in more expressive languages has certainly improved the quality of my C++ code, but there's only so much you can do.<p>My use of other languages has therefore gradually increased - I currently use Clojure where I can, but I'm pretty flexible (PHP being the only language on my blacklist so far).<p>For projects on which I'm a lone programmer, I'm free to use whatever language I want in theory; sometimes the customer has a preference, usually not, so the main restrictions are technical and legal:<p>I'd like to use Clojure a lot more, but for game dev, it's problematic. Performance is the least of my worries, as I can drop to Java or even JNI for the rough bits. It's also a fantastic choice for server-side programming on multiplayer games. However, the JVM isn't allowed on the iPhone, say, and unrealistic or disallowed on consoles. (the Nintendo DS has 4MB of RAM, for example; licensing/porting is an issue) For pure PC/Mac game dev it's probably fine, although if by any chance you want to port later, good luck.<p>There was a submission on HN a few months back about using Gambit Scheme for iPhone and Mac programming. Googling easily retrieves some useful information on this, but the general idea is that it compiles to C, and you can actually write Scheme functions with inline C/C++/Objective-C code, so you're using a 2-stage compilation process and retain full control while using a very expressive high-level language. I'm going to try this with my next iPhone game, as I'm not all that impressed with Objective-C so far. It looks extremely promising.<p>There are of course other languages which have compilers that generate C; I believe there are some Common Lisp implementations, although especially for game dev I'm not sure if there's any advantage in using CL over Scheme.<p>If using a full-blown Lisp feels too high level, there are some Lispy efforts that are essentially very fancy C preprocessors, e.g. BitC[1] or SC[2]. The latter is literally C with an S-Expression syntax; I'd be interested how compactly all of C++'s features could be expressed in such a language. Not that you'd want the arcane contortions of C++ templates when you have real macros.<p>Moving away from C a bit more, there are of course Forth and other languages in a similar vein.<p>As I've mentioned, I'll be going down the Gambit Scheme route in future projects, as it has a very nice interface to C/C++ (this is critical when dealing with game development oriented libraries - I'd probably make this the top priority in choosing a language for this purpose), it's very stable and mature, and it's a Lisp. I'll try and write a postmortem of some sort when the time comes.<p>My main worry is the behaviour of GC in an environment with hard memory limits (no virtual memory or paging), but if the allocator and GC are well written it should be less risky than explicit memory management.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bitc-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitc-lang.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://super.para.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tasuku/sc/index-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://super.para.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tasuku/sc/index-e.htm...</a>",1255898601

But patchwork programming can be bad advice some of or maybe most of the time.<p>Besides the issues of programming in a language different from what your libraries were written in (and more importantly, designed for), there are serious issues with the patchwork-performance code philosophy. The biggest is that the ""routines"" that you need to make fast often operate on data. You'll have a container of some sort in your ""slow"" language, and you'll want to do something with that container in the ""fast"" language. Do you expose the container's memory to the fast language (hard!)? Do you copy (slow!)? Do you use the more efficient containers in your fast language and expose them to the slow language (insane!)? When exposing complex objects between languages, you'll have similar considerations to make.<p>You can't look at C++/Python or C++/Ruby programming and assume that you'll simply have to make the same sort of engineering considerations as you would for C/Assembly. It's an entirely different kettle of worms.<p>Assembly is concerned with telling a computer directly how to handle memory addresses. C, for all intents and purposes, is just a simple abstraction for doing that. On the other hand, higher level languages present a lot of abstractions for doing a lot of things.

Cleaning up the syntax enough that definitions could be found context-free would eliminate the need for declarations, and in most cases .h/hpp files.<p>The complexity is redundant because they included features of C that they should have deprecated in favor of the C++ equivalents. String literals should be (const) basic_strings, and there should be no way to access stdio's horribly-easy-to-buffer-overflow machinations now that there's iostream. For that matter, boost should be adopted at a much more formal level: the default syntax for pointer variable allocation should allocate smart pointers, and one should have to go out of their way to get a dumb one.

Both the automation and the free aspect were so unusual that it sounded ""too good to be true,"" so people thought it was a scam of some kind.

And why would we give away a multi-thousand dollar service - that the rare client may only need once - for free?<p>We started adding an ""Analysis completed by EXXXampleService.com"" statement to the bottom of the tax/legal documents in this market that we handled in our own business, and to those that we provided for law firm clients on an outsourced basis.  We also added the same statement to the bottom of outgoing emails that dealt with this part of our business.  Importantly, the statement in the email was a hotlink to a <2min video that explained what our service did in the most general terms <i>and</i> why we did it.  Below this, there was another link to a longer-form video that explained the analytic process in more detail and showed the before and after result.<p>The uptake on our service surged after we implemented the document statements and email links.  A large number of potential clients ended up viewing the longer-form video.  We now have about 22% of all clients in the US that need this service performed.  Which is still a very small market.  And we don't make any money on this initial analysis.  <i>But</i> - and this is the viral loop aspect - now that we have these clients, <i>all</i> of their legal and tax documents for the transaction are already in our document management system.  And these documents have to be used by <i>both</i> parties in the transaction.  And we have some enticing features built into our system that can be used for <i>most</i> types of these transactions, including 'normal' transactions.  So <i>everyone</i> involved in the transaction ends up trying our software for ""just this one specialized deal"" because the docs being there will save them  a tiny amount of time...but once 'inside' our collaborative dealroom software they realize that they simply can't live without it for <i>all</i> of their <i>everyday</i> deals because it saves them so much time and money.  The end result is that we end up getting <i>both</i> parties to these commercial transactions as long-term clients.  And we often sign up other third-party professionals that were also involved in the transaction (legal, accounting, environment consultants, etc.) for other related services, as well.",1255897897
