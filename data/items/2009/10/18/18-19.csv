Yes, some aspects of the behavior of a person are in the genetics, but it's more the environment that models it.<p>Eg. in my family we have a strong tendency to identify new business opportunities, but this doesn't mean it's 100% because of the DNA.\nIt's more about about the environment (in my case family) type of culture and education.<p>Thanks for the name of the report.

The temporary crisis of confidence caused by a falling stock price led creditors to start fleeing as well, preventing Bear from rolling over it's daily debt. As they point out in the article, Bear was highly dependent on overnight lending at that point.<p>Also, making money via naked shorting doesn't require the company to die.
