I've got issues opened with OO.o, ubuntu, firefox, f-spot and others that weren't looked at for years. I didn't even get a response from developers to verify most of them... OO.o is the winner with 4 issues opened and 0 closed since 2005 followed with ubuntu with 16 triaged / confirmed (but no fixes).<p>Developers - please take example from memcached.

Programmers have plenty of ways to access data both formally and informally - the informal methods are often closer to the machine, but remove context that would help to automate and verify the process. You can also have data that doesn't say much about its context, and data that is very heavily cross-referenced.<p>NoSQL, to me, seems to be mostly about relaxing the heavy formalization of SQL - to shortcut to simpler or even incomplete descriptions of data, and deal with the resulting fallout later, in the same way that dynamic languages eschew static checking.

897564,comment,896571,896830,0,0,gamble,,,"I've written about this here before, and though it's not a popular position on HN, I don't think that most startups offer a good return for most employees.<p>There are exceptions. One is the topic of this article: people who are able to move up a rung faster than they would at an established company. Leaving a grunt programming job to be a technical VP is a valid reason to pick a startup. Another is to learn how to run your own startup - of course, you'd have to be going to a position where you'll actually get that experience. Heads-down hacking for twelve hours a day doesn't teach you to run a company.<p>It's the rank-and-file employees who usually get the short end of the stick in a startup. There are the obvious drawbacks - low salary/no benefits/long hours - and the possibility the company will fold up. Unfortunately, there's no real upside for the average employee. The average startup is not going to hire on enough staff that early hires are going to have much room for advancement. Assuming the company reaches an exit - almost always selling the company - the employees won't get a big payday, but they usually suffer in the acquisition. I've been through several purchases, and it's usually not a happy process unless you're waiting for a large check. Even if the acquirer wants the startup's staff, the founders and a lot of the staff will probably be gone in a couple of years while whatever was attractive about the startup's culture is systematically disassembled.<p>Of course, many startup employees probably don't see it this way. Startups thrive on young grads looking to preserve the sense of purpose, freedom, and esprit-de-corps of college life. After all, if the last year has shown anything, it's that most people don't make decisions like strictly rational, self-interested economists.",1256242505

897561,comment,897501,897501,0,0,sophacles,,,"So up front: I know this question sounds like a classic flame, however I'm honest about it, and the similarity to flame means I have yet to see an answer that I am satisfied with, as the discussions degenerate quickly. Anyway:<p>What is non-relational data?  I have been under the impression for a long time that datasets all have internal relationships, be they semantic or other, and that relational databases are systems to store and query data based on the relationships.  Even a key value store defines an explicit relationship.<p>When I first learned about databases, the class was about Normal Forms and Relational algebra, with rdbms thrown in as an example. These 2 key concepts are methods of working with data in a subtle and nuanced way -- a way strongly based on set and/or category theory.  SQL it always seemed to me to be a decent extension to this, a DSL specifically designed to work on sets vs individual pieces of data. In that I found it elegant.  Now this doesn't mean SQL is perfect, I get that, in a lot of cases it is clunk or worse. Nor does it mean that the underlying datastore needs to model data to exactly follow the relationships that describe it. And in light of CAP vs ACID views on data, a lot of exploration of this space makes sense.  None of this includes a concept of relational vs non-relational data. In fact I view these systems as potential new building blocks of relational sytems.<p>So this has turned longer than I originally thought, but badk to the main question: what is non-relational data?",1256242335
