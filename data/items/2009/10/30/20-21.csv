912757,comment,912554,912554,0,0,btilly,,,"This would really make sense for students.  A lot of kids go through universities and wind up scared about their college debt.  On average their expected improvement in future returns is more than enough to make up for it.  But individually people are running a scary risk.  If you can solve that and spread risk across many people, it should average out in your favor.<p>If you have enough money to do this and seek to invest, I would highly recommend going after academically successful but poor kids.  They are the ones who are most likely to drop out of university or go to a community college instead because student debt is too scary for them.  That is because their belief about likely future income is based on people they know, which is far out of whack with what educated people can make.  But their life choices are likely to leave them at what they expect.<p>At a practical level this means that you have room to structure the deal so you get better average returns than a loan, they are better off after accepting your deal than they would be if they don't go to university, and they are better off than they would have been if they earn what they think reasonable.

Basically, we sell computer parts as well as pre-configured systems.\n* Procurement System - A way for us to track stock as well as manage Purchase Orders that are out to suppliers, receiving, etc.\n* RMA System - Need a good way to handle customer Rmas that fits in well with normal order processing<p>Those are the MAJOR things I can think of, but we'd also like the frontend site for customers have to good search capabilities, the ability for the customer to configure their own system with compatible parts, cross/upselling, filtering using product attributes, etc. etc.",1256935115

Could the time and effort spent on Java be better spent elsewhere?<p>It may be because I'm still feeling the glow Java had when I learnt it in the late 1990's, but I really like a lot of things about it. It's a very simple, safe and easy to use language, it's C++ without the broken glass, it's C with automatic memory allocation, bounds checking and a nicer package/interface system. API's are separated and enforced. It used to be bemoaned as slow (""knock knock"" ""who's there"" ""................java""), and now it's seen as fast. That's pretty cool (it's partly because it's <i>relatively</i> faster than python... but it also has been made actually faster).<p>Many early adopters left it for python/ruby a few years ago when the small language that Java was became uglier with extensions, esp generics and annotations.

912719,comment,912105,912536,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>My simple view would be that if the restaurant would change their system if you told them what you plan to do, it is immoral.</i><p>Well, that moral principle is not going to generalize well.<p>But let's resist the urge to play moral philosopher and consider the facts: Would the restaurants want to stop you from doing this?<p>I don't think it's obvious. If I pick up half a dozen extra reservations and then try to sell them, I don't really add to the workload of the greeter, unless I pick up substantially more than end up being used. (Obviously, if you try to get 100 reservations, sell five, and return the other 95, the restaurant is going to stop you. So, don't do that!)<p>What you're essentially doing is allowing people to buy a better position in line. That seems perfectly rational: An upcoming reservation, like a stock option, is a commodity, so one can put a price on it, right? And it's worth noting that restaurants do this all the time [1]:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=318827"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=318827</a><p>...it's called ""bribing the maitre'd"", and they don't advertise it, even though -- if it weren't for other considerations -- it's a good thing for the restaurant. A person who is willing to pay cash money to get in to your restaurant faster is probably someone with (a) more money to spend, so they're likely to order wine and dessert and all the good stuff that pads the profit margin, or (b) a big fan of your restaurant, such that they'll pay extra to come to your restaurant instead of the less-busy restaurant down the street, or (c) about to <i>become</i> a big fan of your restaurant, because they can always get a seat there right away; it's just a matter of a few bucks!<p>So the real mystery is why restaurants don't do this themselves. I suspect that the answer is social signaling: A restaurant doesn't want to be the entity that makes the majority of its customers feel poor. For every person whom you allow to <i>publicly</i> buy their way to the front of the line, you send a message to an entire line-full of other people that they're just too cheap or too poor to do the same thing. The point of a restaurant is to allow people to feel <i>rich</i> at a fixed rate, not to force them to feel <i>poor</i> at variable rates. So before long your restaurant will have a reputation as ""that obnoxious place which caters to snooty rich people who want to show off all their money"". Unless that's your business plan, that isn't a good idea.<p>(It is this, not the fear of breaking some non-existent law against overtipping maitre'ds, that keeps the practice of bribing maitre'ds below the radar. It's okay to spend money for better service; it's impolite for either party to call attention to it.)<p>The solution that these entrepreneurs have come up with is to create <i>two queues</i>: The queue run by the restaurant, and a separate queue containing the reservations owned by the entrepreneurs, which they will sell for a fee. The genius of this is that there's a strict limit to how many rich people can buy their way ahead of you: The entrepreneurs only have so many spots ahead of yours. Then the entrepreneurs can <i>fix</i> the fee to enter their queue, which will help prevent unsightly bidding wars from breaking out in front of the restaurant. And, because the whole scheme is run by a third party, the restaurant doesn't have to adjudicate disputes, or explain all this to everyone who shows up, or spoil their reputation as scrupulously fair egalitarians who would be shocked -- shocked! -- by the offering of a bribe.<p>So my guess is that restaurants might be okay with this, if it's done right. (i.e. The right number of ""buyable"" reservations vs the usual ones, the right fixed rate, no intimidation of customers, and of course no counterfeit reservations. I believe it is the latter two problems that have given rise to laws against ticket scalping.)<p>---<p>[1] How great is it that when trying to google this article the first thing I find is the HN link?",1256934704
