I did search and found a 4G one that was selling for thousands of dollars (can't find the link now). They said that it could back up the whole of RAM to SSD in 60 seconds so the data security (with a reliable battery) would be pretty good. Should scale as well with the same amount of time required for more lots of 4G. I can't see any reason why this should have to cost so much though. 4G SSD + 4G RAM + Battery + Controller < thousands of dollars.

Of course, the idea of a government which will do anything at any cost to increase (what it takes to be) the psychological wellbeing of its citizens is fairly alarming, but what the author misses here is that the <i>opposite</i> is just as alarming: a government which is completely unconcerned by the misery of the people it's supposed to represent.

From my point of view it's just Google's ignorance.<p>Let me share my experience as a native Chinese. When young I learned how to using computer and the Internet after the first grade in middle school, the same time computers and Internet both went popular in all China. All things I know about search engines were Yahoo. But it's domain sucks: <a href=""http://cn.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cn.yahoo.com</a>. It's a damn hard and long English URL for average Chinese. It does not even begin with www and <a href=""http://www.yahoo.com.cn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yahoo.com.cn</a> can not be opened? WTF. If you want do Internet business in China at that time, at least you should have a standard domain name like <a href=""http://www.company.com.cn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.company.com.cn</a> and Chinese UI I think? Then there's Google (around 2002 I guess?). People like the idea of 200,000,000 indexed pages, which is much more than Yahoo's number I presume. But Google is even not an ordinary English word. Its pronunciation is stupidly hard. Google even has some encoding problems with Chinese webpages due to too many undeclared encoding during Chinese webpage production. People's last choice? 3721.com or Baidu.com. 3721 is famous because it's CNNIC's company, and there's a old saying in Chinese that 'No matter 3x7=21', and it promotes a nice idea of 'Chinese domain name system' (first as an IE plguin then later join the IDN standard as Punycode, but overall it's adware and malware.). Baidu is and ordinary PinYin word which is easy to remember.<p>Another reason to choose Baidu is because its site is very fast. Chinese Internet connections were very slow in the beginning, and although Google's page is very simple and clean, it still takes tons of time to load compared to Baidu's Yahoo-like homepage<p>(<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20020331055621/http://www.baidu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20020331055621/http://www.baidu.c...</a>)<p>Then after 2002 or later Google.com is blocked, everyone is using something else and people forget Google completely, until Kaifulee went back to China as president of Google of  Greater China in 2005.<p>One wise decision of Kaifulee is to acquire all former 3721's marketing department, AdScene boosts well in Chinese market. So even though Google China's market share is only half of Baidu's, it's keeps nearly the same avenue as Baidu's without doing evil.<p>I see great chances of Baidu's fail, because there's still too much innovation to be done in search engines, especially in Chinese culture, because Chinese is very different language and way of thinking. Baidu's Chinese rivals, Tencent SouSou search, Netease 163's YouDao search, Sohu SoGou search are all very competitive and growing. But I don't see Google China is catching up, because Google as a whole is too busy copy twitter. I heard from a inside source that Google is even simulate twitter in one of their primary productivity products. It's very likely that it will result too much of Google's service chain get blocked in China to make Google useless even in high-end users in Beijing and Shanghai. Since twitter, the primary 'color revolution/peace revolution tool' used in Iran makes Chinese government actively bans anything that has a connection with microblogging, and China has already blocked all SSL connections to *.google.com days ago.",1254407760

Take Python, and consider Python's metaclasses (basically classes of classes (of objects)). Certainly, they allow you to do some things easier, but now imagine some Three-star-programmer abuses those metaclasses to subvert the class creation mechanism in nontrivial ways and bases the entire application on these metaclasses (and, of course, does not document this well). If you are supposed to maintain this, you are in trouble.<p>So, my point is: It certainly is fun to have a very dynamic language which can do a lot of things easily, but this is a great power and requires great responsibility and the larger the project will be, the more responsibility is required, and -- being a careful person -- I don't want to assume that everyone touching that gigantic project is responsible and careful enough to handle this well.

I never really started them in the first place.  I did however help develop the training and certification program for the Ascend/Lucent Certified Technical Expert course.  That was after I already had about 8 years of daily hands-on LAN and WAN design and administration (late 90's timeframe).  I was able to do that because I had been in the bowels of everything from a local travel agent office network to some of the worlds largest datacenters and NAPs (at the time).<p>Don't wish for network classes, instead spend some time with actual equipment, a copy of Wireshark, and some time on network admin forums/groups.  Go work for a local ISP for even 6 months.  You'll learn more about LAN/WAN networking in that time than in most formal network courses.",1254406999
