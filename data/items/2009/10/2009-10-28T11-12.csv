Communications can move in milliseconds now, diagnosing and fixing complex issues is still on the order of hours/years/lifetimes!<p>It doesn't help that your customers often know about issues you are having before you do. So say ~30min to get notified of an issue (Which is not unrealistic for a non obvious issue that isn't something you actively monitor) - Quick 10min investigation to assess what the scale of the issue is, another 3-5min to post a couple notifications, and that is the better part of a hour gone, and you haven't even got around to trying to come up with a fix.",1256730259

Check your contracts carefully.<p>Some places basically just give you a computer and make sure that it always has power and network and that the hard drive is backed up, and everything after that is up to you.

The former obviously costs a lot less than the latter.<p>It's perfectly OK to outsource responsibility, but you've got to pay top dollar for someone to take on that responsibility.

907573,comment,907016,907248,0,0,demallien,,,"Hmmm, there are several very significant differences between the two situations though:<p>- open hardware was critical to the success of the PC platform, allowing functionality such as ethernet, better video, changing disk drive configurations etc. In the mobile phone world, the hardware is locked down for all players.<p>- computer interface devices (screens, keyboards, mice, touchpads) have all been designed to optimise for ease of use.  In the case of mobile phones, the interface devices have been optimised for small size.  Concretely this means that both input and output are difficult - writing useable software that runs on two screens with different aspect ratios is a momentous task on a mobile phone, having to allow for the existance or not of a physical keyboard or multitouch screen, same thing.  What this means is that a diffuse hardware platform, such as Android is offering, is going to be very difficult to develop high quality apps on.  Unless hardware manufacturers can agree on a common platform, this problem is only going to increase.  Of course, such a common hardware platform doesn't seem terribly likely to me, as the example of the PC industry shows that this approach quickly reduces manufacturers to commodity providers, with razor thin margins.  I suspect that the Samsungs and Motarolas of the world are in no hurry to go there..<p>- Apple never had the dominance in the computer market that they currently have in the smartphone market - they never got over about 14% of the market with the Mac (although if it continues it's current trajectory, we may see this level beaten in the not too distant future).  In the smartphone market however, they are well above this level of marketshare already, and still rising.  If you add in iPod Touch sales, the platform is massacring everybody out there.<p>- At the time when Apple lost market share, home computers were only a small part of the market compared to office computers.  Purchasing departments have a strong preference for cheap over quality, provided that a minimum level has been achieved.  Consumers are far more discerning.  In the mobile world, personal sales are more important than business sales, or to say it another way, you are more likely to have a personal mobile phone than a work phone.  All of this acts to reduce one avenue of attack on the iPhone platform - you probably aren't going to be able to win just by doing things cheaper - you're going to have to do things better too.<p>- phones are far more mission-critical than PCs.  If your computer breaks/starts functioning weirdly, you aren't too badly affected.  If your phone goes down these days, it's a disaster. There is going to be a premium on reliability, and it remains to be seen as to whether the Android platform can deliver that reliability when there are numerous hardware manufacturers, and a large uncontrolled application base.<p>There are other differences, but I think these are the important ones.  Globally I find these differences big enough that I'm dubious as to the validity of using the PC experience as a guide to the future of the smartphone market.",1256729364

907565,comment,907268,907436,0,0,netcan,,,"Douglas Adams 1999 on 'The Internet'<p><i>Because the Internet is so new we still don’t really understand what it is. We mistake it for a type of publishing or broadcasting, because that’s what we’re used to. So people complain that there’s a lot of rubbish online, or that it’s dominated by Americans, or that you can’t necessarily trust what you read on the web. Imagine trying to apply any of those criticisms to what you hear on the telephone. Of course you can’t ‘trust’ what people tell you on the web anymore than you can ‘trust’ what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do. For some batty reason we turn off this natural scepticism when we see things in any medium which require a lot of work or resources to work in, or in which we can’t easily answer back – like newspapers, television or granite. Hence ‘carved in stone.’ What should concern us is not that we can’t take what we read on the internet on trust – of course you can’t, it’s just people talking – but that we ever got into the dangerous habit of believing what we read in the newspapers or saw on the TV – a mistake that no one who has met an actual journalist would ever make. One of the most important things you learn from the internet is that there is no ‘them’ out there. It’s just an awful lot of ‘us’.</i><p><a href=""http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/19990901-00-a.html</a>",1256729038
