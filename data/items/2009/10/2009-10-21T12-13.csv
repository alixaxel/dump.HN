894505,comment,894461,894461,0,0,cousin_it,,,"I mostly do client-side Web development - JavaScript and Flash - and prefer to write in the native languages of the platform to leave less space for bugs to hide. (Even MTASC, the very good indie Flash compiler, turned out to contain obscure bugs after I abused it for a couple years.) And my server-side stuff is simple enough that Lisp wouldn't be a big win space-wise over the handful of PHP one-pagers that I tend to write. Lisp also loses to PHP on maturity, documentation and support - whenever I stumble on some exotic webapp-specific problem, chances are it's already covered in detail on php.net. It looks like Perl and Python have ecosystems of similar quality, and some of my friends swear by the Microsoft tech stack, but unfortunately I can't trust Lisp to the same degree.<p>If I ever encounter a problem where cleverness of programming is the limiting factor, I'll probably use some advanced language (yep, I can handle Lisps, ML/Haskell or even APL/K passably well). But such problems just aren't very common. On most projects I spend most of the time figuring out how to solve <i>this</i> user problem on <i>that</i> programming platform as directly as possible, not solving mathy type puzzles.",1256129148

Through this excellent recruitment agent, I got a series of interviews at Lehman Brothers which ultimately culminated in them basically creating a job for me in their Front Office product management team and offering it to me.<p>This was a very good banking job. Front-office based, plenty of exposure to all parts of the bank, creative, intense, and well paid. I hesitated, because on the one hand I had committed into the business I was starting (to the tune of several thousand pounds, and, more importantly, to a close friend...), and on the other hand this was an excellent career opportunity from the ""corporate career"" point of view.<p>I remember discussing this with my girlfriend at the time. Being very pragmatic, she resolved the question: ""Most people,"" she said, ""hope their whole life that they'll be able to start a business. You have the opportunity to do it now, to realise something that for most people remains just a dream. You may never get that opportunity again... but the Lehman job will still be there in a year or two if you decide that start-ups are not for you.""<p>Well, she was wrong about the Lehman job. I'm going to have to accept that I will never get a job there now.",1256129060
