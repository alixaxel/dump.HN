It's really, really easy to have those change on you, and when they do the tests become difficult to debug:  if the button with the id ""Search"" isn't found, is it because something broke to cause the button not to show up, because the id has changed to ""SearchUsers,"" or what?  And if I need to remove the ""Search"" button and replace it with somethine else, how do I figure out which tests to change?  The high-level nature of the tests inherently makes them much harder to debug, because the test could have broken for any of a hundred reasons.<p>In other words, with unit tests the linkage between the code being tested and the test tends to be pretty tight; with UI tests it tends to be very, very loose, and that makes the tests correspondingly more fragile and much harder to debug.<p>We essentially do typesafe metaprogramming on our web UI that generates compile-time-checked constants for all the labels, buttons, etc. so that our tests don't compile if the UI changes, which has gone a long way to keeping the tests stable; it's the best solution we've come up with, but it's a huge investment, and our attempts to do testing of our Swing client have met with less success so far.",1254799552

This partly results from the low time overhead.  But computers and mobile devices are constantly asking for your attention.  A clipboard is just waiting there for you to look stuff up.  Low attention overhead enables better in-person interaction.

But Krugman should be held to a higher standard.<p>Personally, I find him very disappointing. A guy with a Nobel Prize in Economics ought to be making compelling arguments that are a surprise to me, and thus contain information in the information theoretic sense. (That's my favorite way of looking at information in an English context.) Instead, I can predict <i>in advance</i> what Krugman's position on a topic will be now with virtually 100% confidence, which should not be possible if he's actually writing with insight that someone of such stature should be bringing to topics, as I most assuredly hold a Nobel Prize in absolutely nothing. Even if he chooses doctrinaire liberal choices completely reliably, he should be able to defend them with far more interesting arguments than I actually see from him, the kind of interesting that even when you disagree you at least stop to think.",1254798184

Read the krugman piece for some examples of such models and their predictions.<p>One concrete example, when the fed raises or lowers interests rates it's based on a prediction of where they believe the market is going, where they believe it's at, and  a prediction of the effect of the rate change. Otherwise what is the profession doing?",1254798022

We try this and that, something works and gets committed, something else doesn't and gets reverted.<p>My working copy is littered with uncommited files nearly constantly, simply because I work and play on many things in parallel and committing <i>every</i> time I save a file would be a noticable overhead, just as merging between topic branches all day.<p>I'm not complaining, we get along, my working copy and I, but I agree in some situations git could be more helpful than ""xxx needs update"" - and that's really just one symptom of many.<p>I've been playing with mercurial a bit recently (yes, heresy) and can see why the git guys despise it, it's just not as pure. The main thing that stuck with me though, is that even though it's roughly comparable to git in terms of features, it is mindboggingly much more intuitive to use.<p>Git could take a lesson from that and would not even have to give up much of the purity. Yes, ""everything"" should still be possible - but they damn sure could make the beaten paths a bit less spikey.",1254798005
