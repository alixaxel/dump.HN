It is a competitor to Amazon Turk, essentially -- giving me access to a tech-savvy time-rich cash-poor audience and having them do repetitive data entry for stupidly low sums of money.<p>I like this because it is an end-run around micropayments, where marginal costs like transaction costs and approving work munch far too much of the value of the transaction to make it worthwhile.  Nobody here needs to ever do a micropayment: users get virtual currency in their game of choice, transaction cost zero.  I pay the company with my credit card in increments of probably several hundred bucks,  where the transaction cost will be negligible.  They pay the game developer in a macro-transaction once a month, transaction cost negligible.",1256269592

898207,comment,897040,897116,0,0,crux,,,"I disagree. The two apps have wildly different configuration schemes, yes, to wildly different ends, but in this case we're addressing the exact same function in both editors. It's not a question of whether vim's syntax highlighting is better or worse than emacs's ability to run tetris. It's a direct look at which of the two apps makes it easier and more effective to configure the modeline. Now, you might argue that that's not going to be a determining factor for anyone who's choosing between the two—because perhaps they are apples and oranges, but in this case he's simply saying that vim has more vitamin b. So to speak.<p>In general though I find the apples-and-oranges complaint about vim-emacs comparisons to be disingenuous. You may say, 'Oh, but emacs is much more than a text editor, so it's foolish to compare them directly!' but not everybody who's interested in choosing one or the other would necessarily have any interest in the OS-like capabilities of emacs. That is to say: there is still a very good reason to review emacs purely in its function as a text editor, even if that is not the full extent of its capabilities. Many, if not most, people in the market for a text editor aren't really interested in whether, after several years' learning the ropes, they might run a full Turing Machine in it.",1256268427

Something that looks like a good idea in year one might look terrible by year three or four.  I have no idea how that applies to your personal experiences, though.  I haven't yet left my first startup-employee experience (after more than 7 years), so perhaps it's too early for me to say I've learned that much, since I haven't really had to put that knowledge to the test (except when it comes to correcting problems and making forward-looking decisions).  I certainly <i>feel</i> like I've seen a lot of things done well and a lot of things done not so well, and like I've been around long enough to see many of those decisions play out for a fairly long time.  I don't think I would be able to say that if I'd only been here for one or two years.<p>On some level, though, you personally often have to make mistakes in order to learn from them; as much as we all want to learn from the mistakes of others, it's hard.<p>So perhaps I'm being overly optimistic and will be doomed to a future of repeating mistakes that I should theoretically know better than to make . . . ask me again in ten years, I guess . . .",1256267906

Same game played by secretaries and they all co-operate all the time completely defying all of the theories they build up like a house of cards. So in an economy where everyone studies math for decades and has no social skills we have a great tool to predict the economy, but for most of the real world isn't much help.<p>Sure it can work in certain financial markets with no contact between participants outside the market mechanism and most of the players can be assumed reasonably expert, so it has its uses, but a lot of care needs to be used when trying to take it outside that sort of area because the assumptions break down very badly in most situations.",1256267591

In the object world references are uniform.<p>There are a lot more cases where a reasonable relational model exists but it is not supported by the mature SQL databases.  A very large matrix, a highly structured document, source code etc.<p>And there are more cases than that where it will be no longer be worthwhile to create an SQL model if the nosql databases mature.

For example, a collusion deal usually entails higher prices which means that to benefit of cheating one has to lower prices and make money on volume.<p>But sometimes it is not as easy to make money on volume. Often you need time and capital investments to increase volume. But if the other colluding companies see you making the capital investments to get higher volume they will know you are planning to cheat and they will drop their agreement as well. At that point you get no sales advantage of cheating and yet you have spent a lot of money making to create the goods for an expected sales increase.
