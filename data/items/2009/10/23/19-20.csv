Moreover, certain ""why""s like ""why's this here instead of over in this class?"" or ""why is this bit of code repeated?"" can't necessarily be explained by refactoring.<p>And sometimes there's just certain technical limits you just can't get around, and you have to comment those.",1256326698

899473,comment,899374,899374,0,0,tptacek,,,"I think interfaces like this are a step in the right direction, not because they're likely to be correct, but because there's only one implementation to get correct instead of thousands.<p>The AE modes --- CCM, EAX, and GCM being the most popular --- are your safest bet when picking a block cipher mode. But ask yourself: if you're being asked to think about what a block cipher mode is, are you working at the right level of abstraction? For instance: we've beat CCM constructions that couldn't properly generate a nonce at cold start (you combine a flaw like that with a crasher bug and you have a weaponizable attack), and we've seen CCM schemes whether the counter didn't have enough granularity and could be forced to wrap, which can make your scheme vulnerable to pencil-and-paper attacks.<p>Do you know what I'm talking about here? If not, that's kind of my point.<p>I really appreciate anybody who takes the time to point out that encryption is not the same as authentication, and that you have to do both to make a system secure. And I really appreciate anybody who evangelizes for a high-level interface, as opposed to one where you have to know that you're encrypting byte-by-byte (EAX) instead of block-by-block (CBC).<p>I still think the soundest advice you can get is, ""rely on TLS if you're moving data, and rely on PGP/GPG if you're storing it; if you have a problem that doesn't fit these perfectly, refactor your problem"".",1256326668

Sure, they couldn't talk, but their actions and their crying (all infants seem to have different kinds of cry's based on the emotion they are feeling) I can conclude that a lot of personality, and motivation come programmed in your genetics.<p>The way both of our girls' personalities have been since they were infants has been amplified by experiences and learning.  Now that they can communicate better, and we understand them more, our guesses as to how they would ""turn out"" are fairly accurate.  It's almost scary as to how much has not changed with their personalities since birth.<p>Take care,<p>Bruce",1256326613

I definitely spent an entire afternoon on that one the first time I encountered it, and I wanted to throw my machine out the window, but now I know to add display:inline to anything I float that also has a margin. Its inane, but its not a big deal.<p>My point is that after a year or so, you've encountered all the annoying IE6 bugs, and so fixing them is easy. I don't think that's a particularly high bar.<p><i>Honestly, why would web devs just arbitrarily hate IE6 if it only took an hour to fix all the bugs for an entire website?</i><p>Its still an hour we shouldn't have to be spending, and I'm not saying I don't hate IE6.

This is interesting, since, for those of who've read the book, Billy Beane is sort of a distant figure, almost certainly not the motivator of the story. He's sort of a figure that Lewis can hang his hat on as the ostensibly interesting figure in a story that's really about cultural changes in an American sport.<p>The little comments at the end of this article make me think that a true old-school baseball insider is writing the article.<p>So, in 2002 or so, Billy Beane was doing something interesting with statistics that gave him an edge in baseball. Since then, we have baseballprospectus.com, many (most? all?) teams have full-time statisticians (Red Sox being the most famous), and there have been multiple books about baseball analysis from all different angles.<p>I don't even mention Pitch/FX, and the great excitement it has generated among baseball stats folks for how it will help their analysis of the game.<p>All this to say, this article reads like a weird Billy Beane slam from someone who doesn't really get what the hell Michael Lewis was talking about, (market inefficiencies first exploited by cheap teams, and already put in play by rich teams by the time you or I read his book) and, frankly, probably doesn't care.",1256325584

They are using web services for parallel processing ... their frontend servers are sending asynchronous requests to those services, which is a huge win.<p>But in a browser, for an Ajax frontend that happens to periodically request updates, one thing that happens is that the number of requests made from a single client is a lot larger. Surely it doesn't reload all the static files, but those are non-issues even for a reasonable high-traffic website ... just put something like Varnish to serve them and make sure they have expiration headers in the future.<p>My company did consultancy work in matters of scalability for <a href=""http://www.erepublik.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erepublik.com/</a> and after we placed a Varnish in front (that also functions as a load-balancer for Apache servers) it could handle thousands of concurrent requests to static files.
