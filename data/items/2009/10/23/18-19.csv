899401,comment,899168,899205,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Defense is the new one in baseball - it's very hard to quantify and it's been historically neglected. So there's been lots of big money contracts to all offense, no defense players.<p>The Seattle Mariners were an absolutely terrible baseball team in 2008. Their front office had made a lot of bad decisions, so the new regime in 2009 didn't have much in the way of money or other resources to build their team. They focused on getting a lot of defense-first players, and turned in a very respectable season.<p>Also, Oakland was thought to be a contender this year before injuries hit. That's why Beane traded for Matt Holiday before the season started. Then a ton of injuries hit the A's and they went nowhere. But they were definitely in the mix.<p>Finally, the Yankees are always going to look good the year they sign the top three free agents in the market for a combined half-billion dollars. Those contracts are going to look pretty awful in five years though, thus leading to the recurring, ""How the hell are the Yankees not winning with twice the payroll of everyone else?"" in the following years.",1256324293

I do not expect a designer to be doing service calls that is the point. You can write a JavaScript controller that grabs reference to any UI components that it needs, you do not write JavaScript in the HTML, the designer is then working in pure HTML CSS. The JavaScript developer is the one orchestrating the work-flow logic in a code-behind manner. Each person has their domain and once a developer feels comfortable they can graduate to the next domain. Just as I don't expect a HTML designer to have to know Java constructs I don't expect a Objective-C developer to know HTML constructs. It's not about constraining people, it's about re-usability of reusable components and isolating non-reusable components.",1256323770

The book ""Code Complete"" talks about this and has studies to back it up.<p>Here's the quote from the book:<p>From time to time, a complex algorithm will lead to a longer routine, and in those circumstances, the routine should be allowed to grow organically up to 100-200 lines. (A line is a noncomment, nonblank line of source code.) Decades of evidence say that routines of such length are no more error prone than shorter routines. Let issues such as depth of nesting, number of variables, and other complexity-related considerations dictate the length of the routine rather than imposing a length restriction per se.<p>If you want to write routines longer than about 200 lines, be careful. None of the studies that reported decreased cost, decreased error rates, or both with larger routines distinguished among sizes larger than 200 lines, and you’re bound to run into an upper limit of understandability as you pass 200 lines of code.",1256322285

The second-last paragraph, in particular, brilliantly summarizes both what people like about LFMs and what (other) people hate about them. Surprisingly, it's fair to both sides.<p>As for the distinction between LFM and LFSP itself, I believe it's fundamental -- or rather, the distinction between M and SP is fundamental. It explains important facts about the software industry that can't be explained any other way (""if X is so good then how come blah blah blah""). I think M vs. SP is fundamental because of a demographic fact: the population of SP is an order of magnitude smaller (at least) than the population of M. Combine that with the economic fact that the demand for software exceeds the supply of SP, and our world begins to make some sense.<p>The only thing I'd change is that the terms ""smart people"" and ""masses"" are too judgmental. What we mean by ""SP"" is people with a high tolerance for abstraction. There are many individuals in M (i.e. who have a low tolerance for abstraction) who are plenty smart. Still, this is a venial flaw, because capacity for abstraction is such a big part of being a smart <i>programmer</i>.",1256322203
