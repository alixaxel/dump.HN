Surely, with great effort and many years, you can master many languages, and use them masterfully in concert like many do with C and Python. And if you can do that then you can master the many faces of C++. Maybe you just don't need to.",1255874252

I bought the first refurbished laptop that met my specs (cheap, lots of ram) and installed Mandriva (as I'd read that it would enable me to use my Windows Mobile phone as my network connection).<p>I hadn't used Mandriva for many years (although I'd used Fedora, CentOS, Suse, Ubuntu in those years).  I've been very impressed by Mandriva laptop in the last 3 months or so.<p>And to buy an Apple laptop with the same screen size and ram would have cost as much as 6 of these el cheapo laptops.<p>I can't think of anything I've missed from my powerbook in the last few months.  And I could always install OS X inside a VM if I really needed it.<p>Can't see myself ever going back to Apple now (although I've still got 4 macs around the house, it's just that I don't use them any more).",1255873613

How can it not contain a sane range of 'regular' programming capabilities?<p>(Of course in this context, 'regular programming capabilities' does not refer to web apps so let's just avoid that whole argument and take for granted that C is a useful language.)<p>This is a great instance of two (maybe 3) arguments against C++ canceling each other out: On the one hand, C++ sucks because it's wed to C and inherits all it's legacy warts. Anyway, C is a better C++ because it's simpler. And yet, as you claim, C++ offer's no useful core of functionality on which layer all the generic templately goodness.",1255873606

888328,comment,887029,887693,0,0,mr_luc,,,"Great Teams Can Do Anything versus Great Surfers Need Great Waves.<p>I always felt as though the discussion was missing something -- and I think that this is it. <i>Competition</i> is different from most startups' vision of <i>success</i>. Growing to compete with the titans of your industry is always harder, so maybe you do need to ride a wave to do it.<p>I'll be the methods are the same, at least at the start:<p><pre><code>    make something people want
</code></pre>
That's what facebook did, and they've now got some pretty cool infrastructure running in-house.<p>I wouldn't say -- particularly after reading that article, yikes -- that anyone is really in a position to compete directly with google via frontal assault.<p>But if you really want to take on Google instead of be bought by them, the starting point is probably the same as it would be for an upstart in manufacturing back in the day: make something people want, a killer product; become the leader in that product, that thing, and you'll probably be more competitive than when you started, even if you don't have the economies of scale of your competition.<p>Google does move really fast, and their moat is massive.<p>I personally have neither the desire nor the ability to pole-vault that moat. Still, the trend against them is the iron-clad rule that small teams are always more productive than large teams (they manage it incredibly well, still -- somewhere, somehow, this is a drag on them), small organizations can move faster than big ones, etc.<p>Small organizations will be able to make things people want, the first step towards competitiveness. And as for infrastructure advantage the trend is in their favor:<p><pre><code>    cloud-on-demand; or, DIY big storage (backblaze guys)
    crawling-on-demand (8legs et al)
    pbx-on-demand (twilio etc)
    ... lots more ...
</code></pre>
That ecosystem empowers tiny companies to do a lot more before they have to think about in-housing difficult infrastructure -- possibly, enough to fund it!<p>( This is all just a thought exercise; I don't know why someone would want to wade the moat and take down google as opposed to sell to them. There are more pleasant things to do with your life. )",1255873100

GDP in China per person is around $3000, where in Germany (East and West) we are at $44000. They have room to grow.<p>Germany is also a net exporter of electricity. It is great that it is not a large net exporter, otherwise the industry which gets lots of monetary help from the tax payer sells their electricity cheap to foreign countries.<p>Aluminum smelters and comparable industries will move to countries with little environmental protection. Let them go. Btw., just where I live we have a Aluminum smelters and related. In Germany. They are still here.<p>Gas power plants are extremely efficient (twice as coal), cheap to built, have a relatively robust technology and the pollution is much less then from coal (half). Modern gas turbines provide electricity and heat. You can build gas power plants into or very near to cities - this is different from nuclear power plants who need lots of water for cooling and building them near cities is usually not a good idea.<p>Gas runs through pipelines from Russia, arrive by ships, new pipelines are projected and Germany has gas reserves for two months. During the recent shortage in East Europe, Germany was actually giving gas to other countries.<p>Biogas is no pipe dream. Funny how your prejudices collide with technical innovations that have already been developed. In East Germany just a few months ago a new Biogas plant has been opened: it will produce 160 million kWh Electricity an 180 million kWh heat - enough for 50000 families.We will see more of that...<p>I'm getting the impression that you are far behind the technological paradigm shift that people are working on here.",1255871435
