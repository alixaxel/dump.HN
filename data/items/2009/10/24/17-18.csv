Until then, headline hyperbole ftw, or something.<p>I don't know if anyone else noticed, but one of the things they're expecting to make available with their pay model is stuff like HBO's series (Entourage was specifically mentioned, which, while not my cup of tea, implies that more of their catalog will also be available). Hopefully, that would mean Showtime's series, too. This is something I, and a lot of other people, would happily pay for.<p>As others have mentioned, people are moving away from the cable/satellite model, and getting their teevee from the internet in increasing numbers. Hulu is incredibly well-positioned to make a stupid amount of money off that phenomenon, provided they aren't unmitigated idiots about it. (Say, putting all their content behind the pay wall, or charging subscription fees that are a substantial fraction of the typical cable/satellite monthly bill.)",1256407004

To your other point, it's not that there is less pressure for revenue, but less pressure for ""growth"" (ex. hiring, expansion, etc.) at the expense of profitability.  VCs often push for premature growth at the expense of profits (so they can inflate the company and sell it as fast as possible), whereas RBF is more in line with rapid profits at the expense of growth - i.e. more organic growth through profits.  As for Vinny - in RBF if the venture doesn't earn revenue, no payments go back to the VC.  Also, if the venture fails and closes, the VC never gets his/her money back.

Brad Fitzpatrick (of LiveJournal fame, now at Google) has long promoted this idea, e.g. see <a href=""http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bradfitz.com/social-graph-problem/</a> . Unfortunately it's still very much an open problem. OpenID is one piece of the puzzle, but the rest is still missing.<p>I'm kinda sorta looking into writing Facebook apps right now, and can vouch that I'd be much less reluctant to dive in if the platform were open.",1256403721

In fact, the only kinds that might be able to make past your test may be emotionless robotic types.<p>Anyone who is not at least a bit annoyed in those circumstances is not human.",1256403639

But last round.<p><i>You say electromagnetic interactions dissapear at any significant distance, yet they are responsible for holding materials together?</i><p>There is essentially no direct attraction between distant atoms, but nothing stops you from having a line of atoms, each of which attracts the next.<p>Consider the case of a piece of glass.  I am saying that electromagnetic forces hold the glass together.  But those forces only exist between atoms that are in close proximity.  However one atom holds on to the next holds on to the next through the whole glass, and it acts like a single rigid object.<p>However if you take that piece of glass and shatter it, you've separated the atoms along the cracks and they do not attract each other.  In theory you should be able to put the pieces together and the crack will mend.  In practice you simply can't put the pieces of glass closely enough together.  (But <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> explains how sliding a piece of wet glass past a piece of wet glass does result in small portions mending then breaking, resulting in scratches on the glass.  The water is necessary to lift surface impurities to allow pure connections to form.)<p><i>The necessary condition for rigidity (disregarding amorphous solids) is crystalline microstructure.</i><p>And what causes that crystalline microstructure other than the pattern of positive and negative charges on the atoms involved, resulting in adjacent atoms being attracted to each other?<p>Anyways as I've said, I've had enough of your drawing out rounds with asking questions that I am sure you know the answer to.  Therefore if your next response isn't rather extraordinary, I'll be leaving this conversation.",1256403622
