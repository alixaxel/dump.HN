And the cheapest Mac Mini is 1000 USD.<p>A Mac Mini doesn't cut it for me because I travel a lot (not long distances, but enough to keep me from having a stable office). I won't consider the simpler MacBook because I had one that I've taken to the repair shop 4 times in one year. The MacBook is simply not made for high-workloads.<p>And MacBook Pro is just expensive. I've payed 800 USD for my Dell Inspiron and it's been running for two years with no problems. The MacBook Pro is just overpriced. I don't care that they are bundling the latest Intel processor in it. I don't want the latest hardware available. I'm happy with just 2 GB of RAM and a big-enough hard-disk. A colleague of mine had a MacBook Pro and the motherboard fried when he spilled some coffee on the keyboard. I've spilled coffee (with lots of sugar) on mine and besides the keyboard getting sticky, nothing happened.<p>Besides, I always hated Windows because it is too locked down. I also stay away from proprietary technologies because the skills aren't transferable. But having to go all-Apple to develop for the iPhone is just ludicrous.",1254815555

Each one has shown dose-dependent gains from cardio-vascular exercise.  And in each case, you've shrugged off the research and then come back with something like this.<p>From your links:
""<i>Heidbüchel's study included only a small, highly selective population of endurance athletes, predominantly cyclists, who engage in a particular type of strain, with preexisting arrhythmias.</i>""<p>So even when you specifically searched for ""runners die young"", it came back with a paper that states that marathon running is part of a healthy lifestyle and then goes on to talk about possible risks for those who race without sufficient training or who are trying to undo decades of unhealthy living.

The paper does not in any way claim that ""endurance sports can mess up your heart rhythm"" nor is the quotation you took out of context representative.

863722,comment,863284,863565,0,0,revorad,,,"Interesting excerpt on their view of advertising back then:<p><i>Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is ""The Effect of Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention"", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.</i><p>Looks like they solved the problem by turning it on its head.",1254814349

Normally, the messenger is less important than the message, but check this out:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner#Legal_positions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner#Legal_positions</a><p>If you read his positions, he seems to me to take the worst elements of both political parties. He's like everything that's wrong with both views of government wrapped into one person.<p>He's described as generally right wing, but a moral relativist and moral skeptic. That means he believes right and wrong are relative to a situation (which invalidates the rule of law and turns it into rule of man) and moral skepticism (which means perhaps there are no moral truths or natural rights - which is frequently used as an apology for power and control). Helped set Bush Sr's antitrust policy. Opposes the right to privacy. Writes favorably of ""efficient breach of contract"" - that means breaking a contract if the damages are less than the losses of honoring it.<p>He argues that the ends justify the means vis-a-vis torture: ""If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb in Times Square, torture should be used—and will be used—to obtain the information. ... no one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."" (note: I'm a firm believer that ""ends justify the means"" is always the route to totalitarianism and fascism, similar to how ""we need to suppress free speech to protect the country"" does too)<p>Finally, he both doesn't understand technology, and is proud to take a crazy stance on it: ""Posner supported the creation of a law barring hyperlinks or paraphrasing of copyrighted material as a means to prevent what he views as free riding on newspaper journalism""<p>I'm generally somewhat liberal and modern - but the thing I respect most about American conservatives is that they draw strong moral stances and encourage them to be followed uniformly. Hell, they get a lot of their moral stances quite wrong in my opinion, but uniform enforcement leads to rule of law instead of rule of man. A stable, predictable, uniformly and equally enforced legal code is crucial to a healthy society. Moral relativism and moral skepticism are valuable in universities, but disastrous in courtrooms.<p>The author, Richard Posner, seems like an apologist for central power for any reason, and like a reasonably dangerous and bad person. So, the message deserves to be judged in its own right, but a quick understanding of the messenger might shed light on his motives.",1254812994

863696,comment,862228,862465,0,0,yason,,,"It isn't video decoding per se: the .flv videos are merely containers for real video encoding formats, and playback alone shouldn't eat considerably more cpu than with other players. Of course, if you have video decoding hardware you can even offload the heavy number crunching to that unit which kind of gives you ""free"" video except for any memory I/O overhead for video stream and buffering decoded frames.<p>Flash runtime seems to be pretty slow, as for animating and as for executing ActionScript itself. I don't know how much AS3 helps in that, though. Compositing in Flash can be pretty heavy: SWF videoplayers often have a mix of layers for controls, progress bars, advertisements etc. that all have to be composited on top of each other. Even worse, the SWF videoplayer might be set to run at 40 FPS or 60 FPS eventhough the video itself runs only at 25 fps, for example. This means that Flash tries to render much more and more often than is needed for the video alone. This all happily cumulates: even if we can decode video frames fast enough, the frames still have to be synchronized through the choking Flash core and compositing which may be running late, causing delayed or dropped frames, jittering, unresponsiveness etc.<p>If we played H.264 videos via HTML5 and JavaScript/CSS, I suspect that websites could (and would!) still program their videplayers to do too much and eventually choke on scripting and rendering. Similarly, I guess it's possible to create a lean&mean Flash videoplayer that just basically shows the video layer at the video FPS and nothing else.<p>Disclaimer: I work on next-gen smartphones in a closely related field. YouTube chokes my EeePC 901 on Ubuntu; it runs much better on these little next-gen devices where practically anything graphics related is being accelerated.",1254812420
