His struggle to create a connection with his son, his deep sense of caring for him and yet not being able to fully reach him.<p>Pirsig's genius was to get us to identify with its hero Phaedrus, a deeply damaged human being fighting to make sense of his world. Phaedrus is rather clearly an INTP/INTJ personality type, which should only deepen the identification with him by HN readers.<p>His clear explanations of the scientific method in terms of motorcycle maintenance are a big plus as well, especially for me. I worked for several years repairing electronics  and, being a philosophical type, was often struck by how similar  the process was to scientific experimentation and theory formation. Great read.<p>My books:<p>The Fountainhead, Ayn Rand -- A sharp, bitter, and ultimately soaring defense of the individual against the conformity of the compact majority, without the didacticism and moralizing that marred Rand's later novel, Atlas Shrugged.<p>Ecce Homo, Nietzsche (Kaufmann translation).

Reading it I felt like different sections could be put into two categories: (good and somewhat romantic) exposition about something interesting, and observations that seem profound until you think about them and realize that they're stupid (e.g. Hofstadter spends some time discussing how a Bach piece that ends up one semitone higher than it starts [and can therefore be repeated to form an infinite ascension] embodies self-referentiality and that this is the critical component of self-awareness, and that therefore the two are connected; of course, this is all just more-or-less meaningless fluff).<p>So I'd say skip it.",1255332077

This means that the UDP flood reached your host where it got dropped due to the security group rules, but it still had a performance impact, on EBS in your case, just because of the sheer volume of packets.
