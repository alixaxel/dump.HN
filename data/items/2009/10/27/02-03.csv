Not a bad 5 year run.<p>Netscape was also the victim of a monopolist (Microsoft) that was found to be illegally using its monopoly to place it's browsers (Netscape's primary product) on windows systems.  I'm not really sure there is an equivalent party who can do likewise to Facebook (I don't think Microsoft would try again, even if it could)",1256612104

He is building a product that is shipping and the company is profitable.  Not easy to do.<p>But I think if universities taught CS the way that they should, and not many do, in my opinion, the result might not be what he expects.<p>I think that many companies misuse programmer talent--one example is to employ thousands (not exaggerating) in enterprise departments that are reduced to moving one field to the other.  If there were lots of well-trained CS grads with a better orientation, they might be questioning how things are done. Both in large enterprise situations and perhaps in Joel's company.<p>His strongest point is that students are not exposed to longer projects.  I was once in a position to hire compiler people.  Few graduates of programs that taught compilers were well-equipped.  One large state university in Michigan taught a compiler course in a semester.  The graduates that I talked to came away with the notion that compilers were very scary.  Graduates from another midwestern school across the lake did very well.  Their compiler course was a full year as part of their masters program.<p>I think that industry does not really know what to ask for. CICS as part of a CS program? (True). Really?",1256612101

Students come across it in any major project and know it exists in the rest of the course - but spending equal time on boilerplate and on algorithm code would be like teaching an artist a degree course in chemistry before letting him buy his first tube of paint. He'd be a great chemist, but a lousy artist.<p>As to time management, Joel's point was nonexistant there. He spent the entire article berating student's time management skills, suggested Scrum supported by his product could fix the problem, then quickly blurted out that industrial programmers have equally poor time management skills and in fact are solely differentiated from college students by the point that industrial programmers have managers to enforce time management on them, and that neither Joel's product nor Scrum can help that.<p>Leaving aside the point that he's not actually correct about time management skills (long-term time management isn't just down to the programmer, but to how stable project requirements are and other such factors), and leaving aside the query of just how bad the programmers he works with in industry are (because in six years of industry work, I never came across a programmer who both kept their job <i>and</i> had poor time management skills), there's the query of what the hell his post was about at all in the first place if all it did was to create FUD, hawk his product as a solution, then indemnify himself from any failure by saying it probably wouldn't work (in a sufficiently roundabout way that it didn't discourage the sale)?",1256611440

904669,comment,904512,904620,0,0,Mz,,,"I don't honestly know how to define 'moral behavior' anymore.  I know a lot of people do things because they ""care"" about others.  I'm one such person who is wired to care deeply about the welfare of others. I have also raised two ASD sons, one of whom just doesn't have that feeling of caring for others.  Because neither of my sons inherently understands social stuff, I have done a great deal of explaining over the years.  I have had to hone an ability to explain things extremely accurately because anything less just doesn't compute for my sons.<p>Like his father, my oldest son is probably one character trait short of the personality profile that produces serial killers.  Yet he and I get along extremely well.  His lack of caring what other people think is an antidote to me getting too concerned with what others think/feel/want from me.  My ability to explain the social stuff is an antidote to his complete obliviousness to such things.  He is often described by other people as a very nice polite young man.  He has learned to be polite and respectful out of enlightened self-interest (as the saying goes around here ""jail time would seriously interfere with his video game time"").<p>And I have learned to stand up for myself and get the ""doormat -- please wipe your boots here"" tattoo removed from my forehead.  I have come to believe that letting people victimize me is more immoral than ""bitchily"" standing up for myself.  I have come to believe that agreeing to be a victim forces the other person into the role of victimizer when that may not be what they want at all.  I think a lot of people (at leasts in America) see social interaction as limited to victim/victimizer interaction and many people who desire to be ""moral"" choose the victim role as the ""better"" of the two.  But choosing that role denies both parties a humane, equitable interaction.<p>So I no longer really know what ""morality"" means.  But I am generally less tortured by such questions than when I was younger.  I do my best to figure out how to get my own needs met without making other people into victims or forcing them into the role of victimizer.  It's not an easy path to walk.  But it's a lot more pleasant than how I used to live.",1256611293

The fundamentals can - technically - be taught in any language (practically, noone's going to try teaching a course in BrainFuck). But we try to choose a language that gives them, if not industry skills, a platform from which to reach those skills rapidly. For example, teach them C and an OO language of your choice <i>properly</i> - and they can learn C++, ObjectiveC, Java, Python or any of a dozen others <i>very</i> rapidly indeed compared to someone who dove in, learnt Inferno and then graduated into an industry that never heard of it.<p>The thing to remember is this - we teach them the fundamentals <i>for a reason</i>, namely to get jobs in industry. At the back of all this academic teaching is a commercial reality that can't be forgotten. But you have to balance that with a long-term view of the student's entire career.
