905239,comment,903402,904117,0,0,a-priori,,,"Well, if you're looking for a textbook, I suggest <i>Biopsychology</i> by Pinel. It was required reading for two courses I took, and I found it to explain things quite well. 
Something to watch out for though: he tends to over-simplify things in places, which may lead you to develop overly-rigid mental models. There are exceptions to every rule, and some recent papers may contradict what Pinel says about the functions of some areas of the brain, or show that things are actually more nuanced. It's still a good start.<p>Once you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, I suggest reading Nature Reviews Neuroscience. They often have excellent review articles that summarize the state of research in a particular area. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrn/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nrn/index.html</a><p>If I were to suggest one area to focus your attention on, it would be memory. Memory is a central ability of the mammalian brain, and pretty much every area of the brain is involved in memory somehow. Here are some papers that I've found enlightening:<p>Gaffan. Against memory systems. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: … (2002)<p>Martin and Morris. New life in an old idea: The synaptic plasticity and memory hypothesis revisited. Hippocampus (2002)<p>Frankland and Bontempi. The organization of recent and remote memories. NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE (2005) vol. 6 (2) pp. 119-130<p>Ross and Eichenbaum. Dynamics of hippocampal and cortical activation during consolidation of a nonspatial memory. Journal of Neuroscience (2006) vol. 26 (18) pp. 4852<p>Dudai. The Neurobiology of Consolidations, Or, How Stable is the Engram?. Annual Review of Psychology (2004) vol. 55 (1) pp. 51-86<p>Fischer et al. Recovery of learning and memory is associated with chromatin remodelling. Nature (2007) vol. 447 (7141) pp. 178 (but don't worry too much about the parts that are heavy on the biochemistry).<p>Rasch et al. Odor cues during slow-wave sleep prompt declarative memory consolidation. Science (2007) vol. 315 (5817) pp. 1426<p>One thing you may notice is that all of these papers are published in the last decade. That's about the shelf-life of research in this field. Let me know if you can't find these articles online; I have PDF copies of all of them.<p>Hope that gives you some direction :)",1256644276

What you produced is theirs, and they can do what they like with it.  Whether this really does extend to removing your copyright statement or not I don't know, but you're not going to find out cheaply.<p>My advice, for what it's worth, is to chalk it up to experience.  In two weeks you built something you could be proud of.  Looking at it another way, you've lost only two weeks of your time, been paid, and learned a valuable lesson.<p>Don't produce something unless you know who has the rights, who's paying, and how much.<p>The only other advice I can give is to write a letter ""more in sorrow than anger"" expressing your disappointment that they have appropriated your work, removed the credit, and have failed to acknowledge the effort you put into it.  You could include a comment that it's been an eye-opener, and experience that you intend to pass on to others.  See what response that gets.  Be careful not to make threats.  Be ""saddened"" by the incident.<p>Remember, these are comments from someone without a stake in it, and any action you take is your own.  I still suggest you simply walk away, taking the lesson.",1256644103

905203,comment,905129,905172,0,0,robin_reala,,,"South Korea developed an online infrastructure fairly early and wanted encrypted transmissions. At the time the US was restricting the export of decent encryption as 'weapons grade' so South Korea came up with it’s own encryption standard called SEED. Because the browsers of the time didn’t support this natively the South Korean government created plugins to enable the functionality: an ActiveX one for IE and an NSAPI(?) one for Netscape 4.<p>Fast forward and Netscape 4 dies, leaving the plugin unloved and unmaintained. IE achieves market dominance and banks / shops etc start assuming that that’ll be the browser used. Now, when Gecko and Webkit start making inroads outside of South Korea they still don’t have native SEED support which means they can’t be used for secure transactions on the inside. SEED is mandated by the government along with the use of secure transactions for certain operations (online banking for one), so by proxy the use of the ActiveX plugin and therefore Internet Explorer.<p>Work was recently done to provide Firefox with native SEED support ( <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478839"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478839</a> ) and that should make it in for Firefox 3.6.

Of course, the years of a Microsoft monoculture have caused problems with regards to building sites using web standards…",1256641388
