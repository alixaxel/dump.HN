Once the wrist felt better, I got back to the gym and started doing light weights with a sort of stretch bandage on my wrist.

""Forth became very popular in the 1980s because it was well suited to the small microcomputers of that time: very efficient in its use of memory and easily implemented on a new machine. At least one home computer, the British Jupiter ACE, had Forth in its ROM-resident OS. The language is still used in many small computerized devices (called embedded systems) today for three main reasons: efficient memory use, shortened development time, and fast execution speed.<p>Forth is also infamous as being one of the first and simplest extensible languages. That is, programmers can easily extend the language with new commands appropriate to the primary programming problem in the particular application area. Unfortunately, extensibility also helps poor programmers to write incomprehensible code. The language never achieved wide commercial use, perhaps because it acquired a reputation as a ""write-only"" language after several companies had product failures caused when a crucial programmer left. In addition, the ease of implementing Forth on a given processor meant that the barrier to self-development of a Forth system was quite low, so that commercial suppliers were, in effect, competing head-to-head with hobbyists, many of whom supported the idea that software should be free.""",1255912486

It won't hurt and will probably help.<p>However, if you absolutely want to solve your pain you need to work out. Pushups and upper-body workouts are what you need. No body-building crazy shit, just moderate strength training 2-4 times a week for a half an hour at a time.<p>On the broader workout subject, weight lifting is the fun part of the workout for me. The biking/rowing bit are just tedious calorie burners. When you lift the weights, you're immediately releasing endorphins into your system. So after a good session, you actually feel <i>good</i>.",1255910820

After my first big project I had a visible 'bubble' (size of a big coin) beneath my skin at my wrist. As every idiot would do, I ignored it. It did not disappear after some weeks and I went to see the doctor: 'We need to cut that open!' .. so.. as a good coward would do, I assured the doc that I would come back.. and stayed home.<p>Now comes the ugly part: After living with my bubble for several more weeks, I made a certain movement... and this bubble thing cracked inside my wrist and I felt the fluid rushing into my arm. I paniced a bit.. but I am still alive and my wrist is fine. No pain at all, btw.<p>I told a friend about my experience. He took me to my office, asked me to show my 'programming position'. Then he told me the same stuff your doctor told you. (I guess.) And he was right.<p>I would suggest that you pay more attention to your body. I know it from myself, that sometimes you really want to make that last test case pass, before paying attention to the pain in your back. This is not good.<p>I do most programming on a big sofa, where I can easily change position. When forced to work in an office I never use the keyboard sitting on the desk. I find it much more comfortable to let it rest on my lap.<p>General rule: If you do not feel comfortable, change it.<p>More advice:
Never write tec on a german keyboard.
:)<p>Take this serious and try to see another doctor.<p>Hope you get better soon.",1255910769

Don't ignore it like I did!<p>First off, you should see a qualified physical therapist (someone who knows the wrist) immediately.  She will help you change your setup to be more ergonomic and probably give you some light exercises.  Another benefit is that she can measure the problem, allowing you to track your progress and the effectiveness of any treatment.<p>Next, I can recommend a few products that have really helped me out:<p>Number one, make sure your keyboard is big enough if you're using a laptop.  I used to use an IBM Thinkpad X31, the keyboard was way too small and that was the beginning of my serious wrist problems.<p>Next, for mice, I heartily recommend the Evoluent Vertical Mouse.  There is a bit of a price premium, but these are great optical mice for those with wrist issues.  I have two, one for right and left that I switch between if I feel any pain or tingling.<p>For keyboards, I've stuck with the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro.  Once you have it at the right height, and you're using it at the right angle, this makes a fine keyboard.<p>Best of luck.  I got over this completely and so can you.",1255910679
889126,comment,889067,889067,0,0,cperciva,,,"I had symptoms similar to those last year; the most specific symptom I had was numbness and occasionally tingling/pain in the <i>back</i> of my hand.  I:<p>1. Got a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 and used that instead of my laptop's keyboard.<p>2. Got a mouse (Microsoft something, I think?) and used that left-handed instead of my laptop's touchpad.<p>3. Wore wrist splints.<p>4. Refused to lift anything heavier than my (5 lbs) laptop.<p>After about 3 months my wrists were back to normal.<p>I'm not sure which of the above helped, and I don't want to re-injure myself in order to be able to conduct properly scientific trials; but I suspect that the largest factor was keeping my wrists straight (not bending my hand up or down OR left-to-right) with the wrist braces mostly serving just to get in my way and prevent me from unconsciously lifting anything heavy.<p>Hope this helps -- sorry I can't be more specific.",1255910653
