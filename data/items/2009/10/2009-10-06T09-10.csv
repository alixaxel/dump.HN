(See 10ren's post above  for an example of his condescending attitude <i>and</i> an extreme opinion).<p>Someone like Linus Torvalds can pull this off, Bob Martin, not so much. Linus nearly always has good reasons  for his stated beliefs and agree or disagree you can see why he says what he says. Also he is an acknowledged uber hacker. Bob Martin does write code(Fitnesse) unlike most other agile ""guru""/consultant types, but it isn't really anything extraordinary (which is all right, as long as he doesn't presume to then teach other people how to program ""correctly"").<p>It is interesting that a great hacker like Peter Norvig is  modest and unassuming and chooses his words carefully, as does Knuth for example,  while people like Ron Jeffries and ""Uncle"" Bob say outrageous things with nothing to back them up but faith in their ideology .. err.. methodology .",1254822979

Photojournalism is a tough area, with opportunities shrinking, and (if you can afford it) it is best to do the work which genuinely interests you than pick up marginal assignments. Remember, old press is dying, new one is not anywhere in sight :)<p>One thing to distinguish is long-term, documentary work and current events. The latter is basically reportage, the bread and butter of news agencies and newspapers. On the former though, you can choose your ground and take your time.<p>I start a project with pulling all information I can from the web: saves time on the ground. Names, history, maps, prior works in this area. If necessary finding the initial contacts. Over there, it's approaching people, asking questions (not necessarily identifying yourself as a photographer), you can get a lot of context just from casual chit-chat. Good thing is that most people love being heard, so give them all attention you can. Start a neutral conversation, listen, nod, let them pour out: very few people are generous listeners, so your attention will be appreciated and you can ask the questions you want afterward.<p>In case of hot events, various police and security troops are a major challenge and great test of your social skills. There it's best if you can start small, attending fenced but calm events, just to get the gist of unspoken rules, protocols and routines. Obviously you can't generalize this worldwide, but. Be attentive, observe police, observe protesters or other people interacting with law enforcement, see how much can work with them. Read faces, in case of militias face is a good indicator how much problem you are going to have with a given person. If he looks like a scumbag he probably is. There are weak points in most of cordons and often ways to sneak past fences. It is best if you stay calm, neutral, and project confidence; especially confident, you can pull nearly Jedi-like tricks with it. Do not insist on eye contact but do not avoid it either. Don't smile, it shows your weakness and reduces your chances to successfully communicating with people in power dramatically.<p>It may sound hard but the skills build up quickly once you start doing.",1254822844

Taking the clojure example above and its unit tests, nowhere does it make any attempt to show that the few test cases chosen provide a complete coverage of all possible bowling scores.  Without that what have you really shown?  Sure I can look at it and my gut feeling is, yea that should be enough, but I got that from looking at the OCaml code as well<p>In the blog post Brad Fitzpatrick is quoted as saying ""Write a test. Prove it to me.""  Now maybe it's my maths background, but when someone say ""prove it"" a expect proof, and the bowling unit test example proves nothing more than that it works in a few common cases.<p>Yes I realize that proving anything non trivial in programming is Very Hard, but without any sort of reasonable attempt and even talking about this problem TDD seems more or less ad hoc to me.",1254822487

Programmers who say they don’t have time to write tests are living in the stone age.</i><p>This kind of attitude really pisses me off. It's so confident in its condescension and name-calling, I have a little wonder that they might be right. In fact, it's just dogmatic abuse, unencumbered by an objective factual appraisal of the issue at hand. Probably, I should just remember that dogmatism tends to be inversely related to wisdom.<p>For one thing, the purpose of the code makes a tremendous difference: e.g. unit-testing is great for maintainability, but terrible for evolving an API (as in prototyping or exploratory code).<p>And thank goodness for Knuth.",1254822008

863807,comment,863344,863783,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Absolute right and wrong require a frame of reference that is unchanging, but there is no such frame of reference available to us.<p>That's true, and that's why moral relativism/skepticism are useful for expanding your perception, building your personal ethics, and good for discussion. But you don't want two different judges interpreting the same laws very differently based on their philosophical structures. Some is inevitable, but the more random and persona-centric law gets, the worse off we are.<p>>  The most popular is that of a God, but if you're like me, you see God as a human construction too.<p>Another common criteria is the one used for ""natural rights"" - natural rights are basically the list of things that everyone almost universally agrees on. People almost universally want a fair trial, the ability to speak their mind, and associate with the people they want to. If you look at the U.S. Bill of Rights, almost all of them are noncontroversially things people would want.<p>(Tangent: The only two that there might be significant disagreement on now are right to bear arms and rights reserved by state, but you it's easy to understand why they'd be agreed upon near universally back then, before private militias, in a era of lots of global and some tribal warfare, and when ""arms"" were muskets, sidearms, swords, and knives. Also they'd just broken free from an empire, they didn't want to fall under imperial control again)<p>> Laws are made by Man; rule of law is rule of man.<p>From Wikipedia: ""The rule of law, also called supremacy of law, means that the law is above everyone and it applies to everyone. Whether governor or governed, rulers or ruled, no one is above the law, no one is exempted from the law, and no one can grant exemption to the application of the law.""<p>Same article: ""Likewise, Aristotle endorsed the rule of law, writing that ""law should govern"", and those in power should be ""servants of the laws.""""<p>That means that servants of the law enforce the law as uniformly as possible until it is changed, and the interpretation and enforcement of the law is not subject to personal philosophies and relative morals. This is not completely possible, we are human, but it's worth striving for. Relativism in a courtroom is a dangerous thing.<p>I'm with you on the rest of it - I'm probably not universally against torture in the case of emergencies. But if you're not very careful, soon you're torturing anyone that's got a pretty good chance of something positive happening from torturing them.<p>Almost by definition, torture is extralegal (outside of the law). As long as we don't have laws legitimizing torture, then the judge is advocating the authorities act outside on the law on one of the most scarring, brutal things that can be inflicted on a human being. Actually, there are laws regarding torture - it's the Geneva Convention:<p>"" The most serious crimes are termed grave breaches, and provide a legal definition of a war crime. Grave breaches of the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions include the following acts if committed against a person protected by the convention: willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; compelling one to serve in the forces of a hostile power; and willfully depriving one of the right to a fair trial.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions</a><p>So we've got a judge saying publicly that for important cases, we can break international law, break the legal process, and torture (torture!) another human being who might produce a solution to the important case at hand. It would be scary if any influential American was advocating these things - the fact that it's a well-known judge is cause for even greater alarm.",1254821770

Government vs free markets. The belief that some supernatural entity (the invisible hand on the free market) will make us all happy in the end is refuted by all human experience in the last millennia. As Karl Popper once said ""Truth is not manifest"". Humans will have to hack their environment continually in the face of hardship and arbitrarity - and in a democracy, the elected government is given the responsibility to execute that mission. Nature has not evolved to make humans happy, it's our task to make our world (economy) better - one hack at a time ...",1254821113

It would still be quite useful if the sketch narrowed the options to a list.

The driver development kit of Windows is order of magnitude better in terms of documentation and ease of use (as far as kernel development is easy) than the Linux or BSD driver kit (I've worked on all of three).<p>You don't really need the source code of the kernel when you have all the documentation you need and a powerful API.<p>If you really need the source code for what you are doing, Microsoft gives access to this source code. You get a remote access via smartcard and can browse through the whole source code (remember the 2000 source code leak).<p>The source code availability, is really not, I think, the explanation why Windows NT doesn't dominate the server world. You don't need to recompile or tinker the kernel to administrate a Windows machine, this need simply doesn't exist.<p>The reason is that it took a lot of time for Windows to adopt a server philosophy. If you've played with Windows Server 2008, you realize Microsoft is getting there.<p>One of the things I like with Windows Server 2008 is that it doesn't install the whole universe and let you precisely pick what you want to deploy on your machine.<p>The addition of a more powerful shell and a more transparent administration panel helps as well.<p>Another problem is the very rich, but complex, ACL (access control list) system of Windows NT. Although you can deploy extremely fine grained and subtle rights and authorizations with this system, in UNIX you just type ""chmod 0755"" and 99.9% of the cases you're fine with it.<p>Last but not least, Windows carries a bad reputation in terms of reliability and security.<p>In terms of performance or features, NT has got nothing to envy to Linux or BSD.<p>The reason to me is really a ""packaging"" problem, the technology is capable.",1254820339

The most popular is that of a God, but if you're like me, you see God as a human construction too. Laws are made by Man; rule of law <i>is</i> rule of man.<p>I believe natural rights exist within the framework of particular philosophies, and that these philosophies can be useful as tools to analyse various problems and scenarios. But we have no oracle of truth that can anoint the One True Philosophy.<p>I believe torture is as close to an absolute wrong as you can get, and in particular, it's always a wrong when you take humans as they are presently constructed as your relative frame of reference. However, I also believe that in the extremely unlikely scenario of a bomb in Times Square and someone available for torture who can deliver the solution, that person will be tortured and the torturer should be rightly condemned. Part of the heroism of the torturer, to coin a very unpleasant phrase (due to the extreme improbability) should be to suffer the condemnation of committing torture for the rest of their natural lives. Torture should be wrong, condemned, even when it is necessary for the survival of large numbers of people.<p>The real problem with torture, though, is that the ends don't justify the means. The means of torture creates its own ends: it breeds disgust and hatred, causes your allies to leave you, gives succour to your enemies and helps them recruit. The torturer is the enemy whom it is just to fight; the country that condones torture deserves to be defeated.<p>I believe ends and means is a valid moral calculus, and in fact is the only calculus that matters. But it is not a simple calculus, because decisions made using it must be considered for their effect always and everywhere.<p>FWIW, I consider myself modern, liberal (in the classical sense) and in no particular way conservative.",1254819771
