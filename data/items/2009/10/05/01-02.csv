I supplement climbing with two to three 30-45 minute lifting gym sessions. I used to run, but not anymore, something I have to start again.

One problem was that Google dominates Bing for technical searches and searches in Japanese, both of which are sort of important to me.<p>A bigger problem was that my fingers will type www.google.com into my URL bar without me even asking them to any time I have a question about something.  (In browser search box, what's that?  I'm stuck in my ways...)  The only way I could have overcome this habit would have been using my hosts file to redirect google.com to a Bing server, and I was worried that would lock me out of the Google services I need to run my business.",1254707699

I keep telling myself to start going again, but I always put it off.<p>I try to hike and boulder whenever I can find people to go with me. I really wish we had a rock climbing gym here. If we did, I'd probably be there every other day as my current climbing spot is a 30 minute drive followed by a 30 minute hike in. 2 hours transit isn't really worth it for me unless I have a couple buddies with me.<p>I'd definitely suggest yoga to anyone that wants to build some core strength and calm their mind. It's a lot more difficult than it looks.<p>I was a vegetarian for about 5 months, and some of those habits have stuck around (less fast food, more fruits and green stuff). I should probably get back to that, seeing as how I've never felt better than when I wasn't eating meat.",1254707665

If it does something useful and you are getting revenue you can and will rearchitect and rework the solution as it grows. And as a system grows it tends to become heterogeneous, an all php shop will suddenly sprout a java based search engine, an ASP.NET shop will throw a linux box in front of it's app servers to act as a reverse-proxy filter/load balancer, and so on. The really good thing about the current state of the art is that you have a multitude of tools available to solve any given problem. The issue is you need to have people who have experience with more than one toolset to make sensible decisions and be able to pick the right solution for the task at hand.",1254707463

860921,comment,858836,858836,0,0,leertaylor,,,"I find it interesting that the majority of the comments on this post seem to focus on ""how this article got the rule wrong.""  Sure, it may be true that the way the author interprets a version of the 80/20 rule may not be the same as as everyone else, but its just an interpretation so relax a bit and see that he does make a interesting point:<p>Many people go through life putting in ""just what it takes"" to get the job done and be ""good enough"" without failing.  You can certainly choose to live your life that way, but you will probably end up being stuck with mediocrity.  However, if go the extra mile, you may be more likely (but not guaranteed) to achieve greatness in whatever it is that you do.<p>Maybe I'm also interpreting it differently and over-generalizing, but this seems a lot like what what many startups are doing just by the nature of starting up... many companies are started by founders that weren't happy with competing products currently available in their market, and they feel they can do better.  Even though its a lot more effort to do this than just getting by with what is currently available, it can lead to some really exciting new opportunities.",1254706703
