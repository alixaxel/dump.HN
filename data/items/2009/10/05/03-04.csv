Whatever works best <i>for you.</i>  It's totally personal.<p>For me, it's a problem, but for other people, it's not at all, and I'm not mad at that.<p>Diversity can mean lots of different things. For some it can mean people from different countries, different genders, different schools, different parts of the country.<p>For me it mostly means different backgrounds. I basically seriously dig it when the people i discuss tech stuff represent the world i otherwise live in + with.<p>(As Alex hinted at with ""1st world problems..."")\nSome can people stand in a circle at a launch party where everybody talks about their favorite ipod headphones for 45 minutes and totally dig it, and others can walk away from that feeling really out of place. Neither one is wrong or right, but it is quite easy to slip into an intense, concentrated subculture in quite an exceptional way.<p>(the second part of your question: startups vs big tech co's)<p>I go down to SF a lot for conferences. I notice more diversity and different backgrounds at events from large companies (like VMworld) than i do at open source things, i wish that were flipped, as i do more open source stuff than corporate stuff, but it's cool.

You don't necessarily need to use the command line, or a text editor, or -- god help us -- a version control system. Drupal is written in PHP, but you don't necessarily need to know any PHP.<p>Of course, to the extent that you don't know any of these things, you are going to hit the wall someday, perhaps painfully.

Try to eat breakfast; the reason here is two-fold, first is that it's good for your metabolism and the second is that it helps if 5. fails.<p>2. Eat Smart; the brain likes omega-3's but the omega-6's will kill you. 'Healthy' is very different for 'smart', you want foods that help increase your efficiency and concentration, not make you run to the toilet every 5 minutes because you're downing pro-biotic yogurts and bran muffins.<p>3. Weightless exercises; I'm guessing everyone here has a few extra pounds on them, squats and crunches can be done anywhere and at any time, you don't need to lug around a few 20lb weights to get your sweat on. If you do it frequently it can help boost your metabolism.<p>4. Get a good sleep routine, being exhausted can kill an entire day of productivity.<p>5. Avoid alcohol (at least before 5pm), alcoholism seems to be a non-genetic inheritable disease in writers, so try not to have a drink in the morning. Make sure you observe #1, because forgetting #1 and #5 means you're hitting the bed by 11am.<p>6. relax a little, play games, read some HN, but don't slack off. It's good to keep your stress levels down, not only does it help your creativity and productivity, but you also don't have the urge to break #5.<p>7. this follows on from #6, but is much more important in the long run, having a day off helps prevent a burn out, AKA writers (coders?) block.<p>9. Drink tea not coffee. Research shows that coffee can increase stress, decrease work performance and can decrease your confidence in your work. Tea however decreases stress, not only through drinking it but due to the ritual and the time taken to make it (you don't get a tea maker, you get a kettle and have to wait, waiting generally means relaxing).<p>Overall I just try to be productive and hope that in the long run I don't end up an alcoholic like 1/2 of writers.",1254713695

One-step at a time is the right approach.  If you're overweight, focus on calorie restriction.  If you're a healthy weight but want to get fit, pick an activity that you'd enjoy.

If you're not eating healthy, get a book about nutrition and change your diet (Google ""Nancy Clark"").  You'll eventually find that one healthy step leads to another.<p>Lastly, keeping healthy is like having a second job.  Carving out time and prioritizing it is key.  You'll find that friends, employers, bosses, spouses, what-have-you, try to steal this time away from you.  You've got to fight back and remember that you're investing in your future.
