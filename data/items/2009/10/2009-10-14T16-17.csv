Setting the price lower than this will result in shortages.  It doesn't matter whether gas taxes go down.<p>""Price-gouging"" really is a terrible phrase for what you do in a supply-bound market.  The people who raised prices have drives if you want one, and if nobody wants one, they lose their bet - have unsold inventory.  The people who set lower prices sold out their inventory, but now they don't have drives if you want one, which isn't exactly a favor to you either.  There are four methods of allocating resources and the method that our hunter-gatherer brains don't understand is market prices, so people think it is ""unfair"".",1255539547

Your definition would say that someone who buys a franchise or setups up a basic shop is an entrepreneur - I think few people would see it that way.</i><p>I have to disagree here.  This is a VC/Angel-inspired echo-chamber mindset.  I can certainly see a difference between growth businesses and small shops, but it's really a disservice to attempt to devalue the latter by yanking the word entrepreneur out from under it even though:<p><pre><code>  * It took no less courage for those business owners to start
  * They may well have taken much more personal risk in the form of a small 
  business loan
  * Those businesses far outnumber the growth business, especially the successful
  growth businesses
  * Those businesses tend to provide things people really need and have solid 
  revenue whereas a lot of ""growth"" businesses are pursuing the founders 
  fetishistic ideas that turn out to have no value whatsoever
  * Almost any business can be grown and/or extended laterally.  It proves a lot
  more if you can take a business from 0 to $250,000 revenue by yourself than it
  does that you burned $5,000,000 to get a 1,000,000 users and you're still not
  cash flow positive because you can't figure out how to get anybody to pay for
  your brilliant ""invention"" which actually just consists of a semi-novel way of
  shuffling user data around.

  * passion for rock climbing
  * good communication skills

The most important things for each are:<p><i>Customer Evangelists:</i> large network, and either mobility across multiple geographic concentrations of your target market, or high amount of activity within a single large geographic concentration of your target market<p><i>Marketer:</i> knowledge of incentives / motivating people to contribute effort / content, SEO skills, ability to create interesting content for inbound marketing.<p>Failing to find these people within your existing userbase, I'd identify the marketing people at services targeting a similar demographic, and ask them if they could recommend people.<p>Shoot me an e-mail if you'd like further explanation / detail on any of the above.<p>Good luck!",1255536881

Inevitably, some people would start to harm each other. The harmed would then gang up to overthrow those who started the fight. The gang is called government and it's members agree to renounce some of their rights to grant it _powers_. Fearing that the gang itself would turn into another oppressor the members wisely choose to limit the newfound powers to only apply against those who initiate force. Thus the purpose and scope of government is maximize the rights of individuals by delineating the boundaries between my rights and yours. I do not have the right to force you to provide me with broadband because you have your own rights. I agree that I do not have this right because I consent to maintaining some government.<p>Another limitation on the power granted to government is that illegitimate force is defined by the people--not the government. The government is an employee of the people that has to check in every so often. If I don't like that you won't take a shovel, dig up a trench to my house and some copper to fill it; I can't extort it from you by accusing you of stealing my car so that the government will punish you on my say-so. This is where juries come in--part of the eternal vigilance we pay to retain freedom. If we as a people want the government to punish wrong-doing, we have to sign off on it. We agree to do it on a case by case basis because we don't trust the police or judges to not abuse their position in any given case. It's another part of the rights that we delegate to create the powers.",1255536068
