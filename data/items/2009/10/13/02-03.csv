How about we interview people based on their ability to actually perform a task, and then set, oh, I don't know, a 5-10 day limit to the number of allowable personal days in a year? We don't even have to give the women more of those days, despite their children and special times of the month. Hell, if we're worried that they're going to exploit their personal days to take care of sick children, we can just reduce the number of days.<p>Then we never have to talk about this issue in interviews or, god willing, on Hacker News again.

878186,comment,877962,877962,0,0,wdavis,,,"One of the lessons I've learned in the few years I've been in business is this: sometimes you do everybody a favor by charging them.  While I'm not necessarily in favor of this practice for angel investors, I'm not going to condemn it either.  If I was going to ""pay-to-pitch"" I would make sure 1) the concept is marketable (investigate competitors, keep my ear to street, etc) 2) that I had a damn good pitch.  Unfortunately, some startups don't take the time to due these things or even think about the investors time.  The fact is they do feel entitled. By charging a fee you eliminate the half-hearted and at least ensure that the start-ups pitching understand the importance of the situation. The companies named apparently provide a service that these entrepreneurs can not provide for themselves.  They bring in the money. Therefore, they should get paid.   Does anyone know if the angel investors get any of this money?  Look if it's a scam it should be stopped, but if it's bad business it will stop itself.",1255401798

This would negate decades of slow progress in getting the workforce to be reflective of society.<p>So, by definition it is discriminatory to ask these questions, the effect will be discrimination, even if that is not the stated purpose of the question. An employer could, and many do, for instance hide behind arguments like 'trying to maximize productivity' or 'being worries about the children of the employee', but none of that holds water.<p>At the end of the day the employer is simply worried that someone is going to miss a couple of days work.<p>And it's true, there is a real cost to all this, if someone gets pregnant, has to take care of their kids because they're ill or gets called up for the service then the employer will have to find and train a replacement if the absence is long enough, or swallow the loss in productivity for a shorter interruption.<p>But the cost to that business does not trump the cost to society as a whole if we let people pick and choose on those criteria, <i>that</i> is why it is illegal.",1255400596

That's what I meant by evolutionary suicide, and my argument (well, it's not really mine) relies on all six assumptions, more or less.<p>Although:<p>Colonizing space and colonizing space to the point where you don't need to worry about earth's carrying capacity are two quite different things.  Energy and minerals might be obtainable from space somewhat soon.  But we can't eat rocks or sunlight.<p>I don't claim population growth will be sustained into the indefinite future. I claim that it will be sustained until it stops, and that how it will stop is a question of serious concern.<p>As I see it there are several possibilities:\n1.Population growth continues apace and, due to reproductive time lag, there are suddenly far too many people on the earth.  This has a quite catastrophic domino effect and an appalling number of people, maybe 100%, die.\n2.Population slows and then stops, but people's lifestyles get more and more decadent and far too many resources are transformed into far too much waste.  Something, or many things, run out and disaster ensues.\n3.Both population growth and resource consumption naturally find some sustainable level.  Maybe that would be somewhere below where it is now. Maybe someone would invent something fabulous, say a glass elevator like in Charlie and the Great Glass elevator, and there is room for lots more consumption and lots more people.<p>Obviously, I prefer the third option. Maybe it will be that. I'm just sufficiently unsure to be worried about it.",1255399406
