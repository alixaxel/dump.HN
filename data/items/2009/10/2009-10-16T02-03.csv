884698,comment,884412,884671,0,0,qeorge,,,"You raise a good point, and in order for this to work they'll need to ensure a full suite of emulators are available for testing. Android already provides an emulator [1] that can be configured to match the target device, although I can't speak to its quality as I have not used it. Windows Mobile is in a similar position, and its SDK provides emulators for every phone you would want to test on.<p>Phones differ so much in form factor alone that you really need to be testing individually for any phone in your target market anyway. Its a huge time-sink to be sure, but you won't be flying blind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator...</a>",1255661755

884689,comment,883316,884088,0,0,kurtosis,,,"I strongly disagree - I don't think <i>any</i> fields - even perpetual motion machine construction or astrology - are inherently bogus.  We should demand that these fields make falsifiable predictions and then test them to find out which ones aren't false.  Of course we can't conclude that they are <i>inherently</i> bogus when we haven't tested them.  If we have tested them and found that they are false then that's all we need to know.  (I'm all for testing a genuinely <i>new</i> perpetual motion machine, almost all ""new perpetual motion machines"" have already been tried or depend on principles that have already been tested and proven false.<p>Let me reiterate since it seems that my message was a little unclear -  the purpose of the medicine and finance analogy was say that even though there were many bogus financiers making false promises about their products by using simple models where they don't apply - this doesn't mean that there could never be non-bogus financiers that take a more rigorous and transparent approach to their use of models.  We should demand the construction of financial instruments which cannot be ""booby trapped"".  This is a case for more and better financial innovation, not less of it.<p>Of course this takes a broad view of financial innovation to include such things as auction design, election methods, etc.<p>I will also retract my statement that the valuation models were pseudo-science - to the extent that they made real predictions they were scientific.  But they were undoubtedly cynically exploited.",1255661357

When this happens it's likely Windows Mobile will become Microsoft's only licensed handset OS and will be neglected and forgotten in quick succession. Microsoft's handset would probably run a new, non-licensable, OS. The rumors that Microsoft's phone project is in trouble are non-sense. They could slap a dial-pad on the Zune software and ship a product in 6 months or less. It's definitely going to happen.",1255661002

An OS like OS X has the potential to be the kind of <i>seamless</i> environment we've only had in R&D or dreamed about.  OS X already has system-wide facilities that programs can hook into, like Undo/Redo.  Also note that there's a <i>lot</i> of drag & drop.  (For example, you can drag & drop into a Terminal.app window, and that file's path name appears there!)  OS X won't get us all the way there, however.  For that, you need an OS where <i>everything</i> is a 1st class Object that can be scripted against.  Those things have existed in research labs, so we know they're possible.",1255660510

I can even imagine how it might make sense to allow it to be a named function declaration -- if def actually returned a function object, rather than nil as the article notes.  But what the author demonstrates seems to me nothing more than a broken consequence of Ruby's syntax.<p>Finding weird corner cases may indeed be very hacker-ish, but blindly labeling them as good is not, in my opinion.<p>I could be wrong about the value of this construct; someone might come up with something useful you can do with it.  But, until then, I'm not going to view it as anything other than a curiosity, not as an example of ""ZOMG look how cool Ruby is!!11!"".<p>Regarding Symbol#to_proc, I would say that it is only syntactically weird.
