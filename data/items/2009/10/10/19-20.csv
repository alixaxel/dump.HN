Sometimes while working 40 hour weeks I don't write any code at home preferring to do one of the many other thing I enjoy. Other times I'm practically buried in work and come home and poke around on a side project. This just varies depending on my mood and what (if any) interesting stuff has my attention. If you enjoy something, you'll find time. If you don't enjoy it, why is it your career again?<p>If you ask me the whole point of this discussion shouldn't be 'coding at home' but instead 'giving a crap'. Even <i>just a little</i> passion for your field will get you a long way in <i>any</i> profession - and I think that is especially true in creative fields like programming.<p>Here I am on a Saturday afternoon putting some thinking time into my field... have I devoted the day to it?

873746,comment,873408,873408,0,0,swombat,,,"I stopped reading at ""strong typing"". (well, not really... but I started typing this comment roundabout there)<p>First of all, what he describes is not called strong typing, it's called static typing. Ruby, for example, has strong typing (every object is one type and one type only), but not static typing (you don't declare the type of an object when you declare a variable).<p>Secondly, there are many powerful languages that don't have static typing. Is the author implying that those languages are inherently buggy?<p>Thirdly, the author is not advocating what he declares in the title. He proposes methods to catch bugs, not to avoid them. His methods are also flawed in that redundancy does not ensure bug-free code - only that you haven't made any silly mistakes in your coding. Bugs come from all sorts of sources, and ""code typos"" are only one minor source. Other sources include: maintenance changes (which cause unforeseen effects that were not previously covered by tests), design flaws, and changed external circumstances. None of those are covered by the technique he lists.<p>Sorry, but this is just a poor attempt to capitalise on a catchy title. Nothing to see.",1255204409

873740,comment,873408,873527,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I've written a lot of Java, C++, and C#. I currently write a lot of MSBuild (not by choice) and Python. Static vs dynamic typing is neither a mutually exclusive choice, nor a choice which can occur in a vacuum. Use the right tool for the job, or else one of these things will happen:<p>Java/Swing: You will be woefully unequipped for the natural cascading property nature of GUI applications; forcing you to jump through giant hoops to get anything to not look awful.<p>C++/COM: You'll cast IUnknown to ISomethingElse so many times that it will lose meaning.<p>MSBuild: You will make a typo in a parameter name, but won't find out until two hours into your build when you get an error that could have been caught by a compiler.<p>--<p>Static typing works for problems that demand rigor, but may be hard to unit test. That includes most larger projects worked on by companies of overworked and slightly disinterested developers.<p>Dynamic typing works when you can iterate as fast as you can refresh the browser, or when your application is small enough that it is reasonable to full text search the entire thing anytime you refactor anything.<p>You can build dynamic type systems on top of static ones, but it is ugly. Don't be WPF's DependencyObject system <i>cringe</i>. It is safe, however, to layer dynamic code above static code. Feel free to use a dynamic language for scripting a statically build application.<p>You can build static type systems on top of dynamic ones, but they will leak. It is also awkward to layer static code above dynamic code. Odds are your code will be dynamic, but more verbose because of the type system getting in your way.",1255204271

The priest wrote, and his wife said, ‘O Master of my soul, won’t you read to me what you have written?’  Whereupon he read, ‘Amongst the green leaves methinks I see a black hen go with a red bill’.<p>To this day I have not grasped what she meant with this story.<p>Please can you remove the Layman from the title?",1255204245

Exercise to the reader.""<p>followed immediately by:<p>""I find this debate insulting.""<p>This seems to always happen with hiring debates - last time, it was the ""Would you hire someone without a college degree?"" question on Reddit about 8 months ago.  Interestingly, all the degree-less folks I <i>would</i> hire kept their mouth shut in that debate.  They <i>know</i> that they're good enough to hire with or without a degree, so they don't need to prove anything to anybody.  It's the folks who aren't quite sure that need to rant on and on.<p>It doesn't matter if <i>everyone</i> likes you, so long as <i>someone</i> likes you.  Applies as much to jobs as it does to friends, girls, or customers.<p>FWIW, I do code at home.  And I find this debate rather baffling.  I code because I want to, not because I care whether someone will hire me for it.  If it gets me a job, so much the better, but if it doesn't, I can always start a company, compete with them, and kick their asses.  It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive to having a life, either.  I read, too, and play violin, and occasionally go hiking or see a movie with friends, or play Starcraft or board games after work, or any of a number of other activities.",1255204022

873728,comment,873466,873606,0,0,goodside,,,"The brightness values are nowhere near extreme enough, and they're not adjustable beyond a few presets. The intent, which it does okay, is making your computer match the color tone of whatever your indoor lighting is, which makes the display more red than it makes it dark. But what you really <i>want</i> it to do is make the display dark enough that it won't keep you artificially awake late at night when the monitor is the only light source. On the Mac, the best tool I've found for that is Shades (<a href=""http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/shades"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.charcoaldesign.co.uk/shades</a>) which unfortunately doesn't have a timer. But binding to alt-space or whatever is pretty much just as good.<p>As a side note, the effect that monitors and other bright lights have on preventing sleep is the suppression of enzymes in the pineal gland that convert serotonin into melatonin about an hour before bedtime. There's a deletion mutation in the genes that code for one of these enzymes (ASMT) that's very common in autistics and relatives of autistics (which is a non-trivial subset of hackers/coders/geeks), so you might not be benefitting from the darkness anyway. You can solve the problem more directly and reliably by just taking melatonin supplements.",1255203757

And  ANY worthwhile hiring filter will be over-aggressive.  So it's more a distinction between groups that contain close to 100% good coders vs groups that contain a much lower percentage.<p>The point of a hiring filter is to weed out bad coders, and hirers should realize that any filter you set that will weed out most/all bad coders will also weed out a LOT of good ones.  So if someone says, ""I wouldn't hire someone who ______"", they're NOT necessarily saying, ""All people who _____ are bad programmers"".<p>Instead, the smart hirer is actually saying, ""People who _____ are Group A and everyone else is Group B.  Group B contains many great hires, but it's really difficult to distinguish good hires from bad ones, and Group A has almost no bad hires.  Therefore I'm only hiring from Group A.""",1255202872

There are timers that are used for people that bill for their time (e.g., consultants, lawyers, accountants, etc.) They are some pretty expensive ones that are used by top law firms and work very well. And there are a lot of cheaper ones that are aimed at startups and the like and are pretty terrible.<p>I am an attorney that just left one of the top firms in the nation to try to start my own practice.

You have to make it so it supports client- matter billing. Also make sure it can easily interact with standard accounting software. Also make sure it is easy to switch between tasks and create new tasks (this where most existing applications fail epically).<p>Basicly, if you can make a billing timer which is as good as Capre Diem but does not cost an arm and a leg, I think you may be very successful.",1255201399
