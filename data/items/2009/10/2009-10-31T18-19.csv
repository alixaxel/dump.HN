913875,comment,913538,913791,0,0,notauser,,,"I agree with you that there are a lot of people who are extremely valuable to an economy despite not having a degree. However I would suggest that a degree is still a good bar to have in place.<p>- The average quality of the with-degree pool is subject to a lower bound, which helps reduce the number of applicants to a manageable level. This is important because there are a lot of potential applicants out there, too many to humanly sort through in any kind of fair way.<p>- Getting a degree is mostly based on merit and effort. There are exceptions but in a great deal of the world a sufficiently motivated person can scrape together enough money to get a degree. I can't think of another verifiable discriminator that can be used worldwide where that can be said to be true.<p>Certainly in a European country where degrees tend to be highly subsidized (my BEng and MEng cost me less than $25k in total, all of which was covered by government loans) making someone get one before you look at them for immigration or some types of jobs doesn't seem unwarranted.",1257015385

I didn't claim that we should only discuss things about which we have complete information, I was instead suggesting that this community is so information-poor on this subject that we lack the tools to separate right from wrong or reasonable from unreasonable. I was also objecting to the claim of opinion as fact, which I find misleads (usually unintentionally, as often these opinions are believed to be fact).<p>And to be clear, I'm not talking about us not being steeped in theoretical economics, but rather that most of us couldn't answer questions which have factual, discoverable answers, such as how modern banking works, how money is created, what the role and powers of the Federal Reserve are, etc.  These are questions with real, factual answers, but the way these things work is often incredibly complex and counterintuitive, and cannot be gleaned from a couple hours with an introductory book or Wikipedia.<p>And in case I'm coming across as being condescending, I'd just like to say that I don't consider myself to be an economist and I don't think it's reasonable for anyone to be an expert at everything.<p>""I've said it before: I don't think any topics should be off-limits as long as people can reasonably discuss them.""<p>Agreed, and I have seen very few reasonable discussions of economics around here.<p>""Startups are full of people acting under intense pressure with incomplete information.
