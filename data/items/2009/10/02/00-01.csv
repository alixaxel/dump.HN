856194,comment,856029,856029,0,0,pingswept,,,"I think I might be in the minority regarding adblockers. I have no sympathy for someone who runs a web server that serves both interesting content and ads (or indirectly requests ads from another server), but is disappointed when my computer only downloads the interesting content. If you don't want my computer to receive the data you send it, then stop responding to my HTTP requests.<p>I think the typical counter-argument is that somehow I have tacitly agreed to look at ads because other people have historically looked at ads on the internet. But go further back, and there were no ads on the internet. I was there in 1994, and your ads weren't. It's your expectations or the behavior of other people that have misled you, not some activity on my part.<p>It's true that site developers are counting on the ads for revenue-- I understand that. But I'm just not willing to pay. If the site's free, fine. If I have to look at ads, sorry, no deal. Stop responding to my HTTP requests, and I'll be fine.<p>Edit: I guess I do feel a little sympathy for someone who hopes to make a living off an ad-supported site, but only because I generally like people and hope their businesses succeed. I just don't find the ""tacit agreement"" argument compelling. (I'd be open to other, more compelling arguments.)<p>Does anyone know of an adblocker that negotiates with servers? Like ""TCP SYN but only if no ads"", ""TCP SYN ACK No, you must take the ads"", ""TCP FIN""?",1254444613
856193,comment,856029,856029,0,0,netsp,,,"All sorts of things about this are off:<p><i>Market segmentation is the time-honoured technique of asking people how much money they have when they want to buy something rather than telling them what it costs, meaning what it costs is a function of how much money they have.</i><p>What you call segmentation is actually called parallel pricing. In most digital goods and services (high capital cost, low marginal cost), these can get jumbled up.<p>Parallel pricing pisses people off. Segmentation doesn't.<p>If you are not sure exactly which one you are dealing with try to figure out the goal. The goal of parallel pricing is to maximise revenue/profit from a fixed number of sales by charging closer to the maximum people are willing to pay without losing those not willing to pay that much. The goal of segmentation is usually to sell more by giving people options that are worth more to them, or at least are better price/value-wise. Segmentation doesn't require not giving high value customers access to low value goods.<p>People doing A will usually call it B.<p><i>If the Internet has taught us nothing else, it has taught us that:\n   1. Advertising pays for otherwise free services;\n   2. People don’t like advertising; and\n   3. Advertising works.</i><p>Actually, I would argue that we knew that before the internet, now we're not so sure.",1254444611

By all accounts, it was nice. Users rejected it. Retailers took it out of the store. Many retailers refused it altogether because they got too many complaints. Consumer rejection coincided with MS making XP reasonably available and the steep growth part of the netbook market, so it's hard to say exactly what happened. Now linux on netbook is just an extremely low end product or a traditional linux niche market.<p>If there was any kind of demand for linux netbooks, there are (a) OEMs ready to go & (b) more OEMs ready to jump straight on.",1254443732

Everyone in Democratic races uses something called VoteBuilder.<p>It's this big, ugly proprietary thing written in ASP or something like that.  Usually a select few have access to it and they manage everything: building walk lists, cutting turf, call lists, etc.  Precinct captains and other volunteers below that level go to their coordinator to get printouts of all the relevant data.<p>In the CA primary we decided to open it up and give precinct captains access so they could manage it themselves.  VoteBuilder wasn't designed for this, of course. In fact, it frequently crashed due to the ""heavy load"" we placed on it.  20 simultaneous users?  You must be crazy!<p>Anyhow, this meant that we needed new features to control for privacy and such.  The code wasn't available so we wrote GreaseMonkey scripts that helped us do things like create accounts en masse.<p>These are all tech savvy people.  Twenty-something, uses Facebook, Twitter, has an iPhone, etc.  Let me tell you: GreaseMonkey is not easy.  It's hard to get it working right and nobody understands it.<p>If you're an engineer it makes perfect sense: a bit of Javascript that is executed in the context of certain pages, which gives you total control over the underlying website.  For everyone else we just had to explain, step-by-step, how to get everything working.<p>My point is that ""just use GreaseMonkey"" is not a realistic solution.  It's like a Mac vs. Linux.  Under the hood they're very similar, but would you rather manage ethernet cards by modprobing the right kernel driver, or having it ""just work?""<p>Both have the same result, but one has a much, much, much, much (10 more much's) steeper learning curve.",1254443507
