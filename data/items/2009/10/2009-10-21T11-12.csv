Think of the ads, <i>Can I send money to {[India, Mexico, ...]|random} and get free cell phone minutes?</i><p>Incidentally, the point is not that immigration prevented unemployment from rising to 66%, but simply that the number of jobs tends to be proportional to the size of the population.

894439,comment,889055,889981,0,0,araneae,,,"Yes, there are processes that remove CO_2 from the atmosphere.  And these only have enough power to compensate for natural outputs of CO_2, like that produced from respiration.<p>When we burn fossilized fuels, we're taking fossilized carbon and putting it into the atmosphere- billions of years worth of the natural process of fossilization reversed nearly instantaneously.  In order for that to be compensated for naturally, we'd have to increase fossilization rates.  This is impossible.  Only a comparative technological solution to increasing fossilization rate (i.e. figuring out how to bury all that atmospheric carbon) will work.",1256126144

894435,comment,893802,893994,0,0,swombat,,,"This makes the book publishers' dilemna much simpler than the music publishers'. 99.99% of people don't read more than 30 books a month - though people might sample more different books and be more willing to drop books they didn't like, on a flat fee.<p>So what they should do is offer a $30/m for 30 books a month subscription. I'd be perfectly willing to pay that for access to their entire library, with the ability to at most read through 30 books per month. Another way to do it would be per page, so that you can sample many different books... e.g. 10000 pages for $30/m (assuming about 300 pages per book on average).<p>I would buy that in a heartbeat. I'd still buy physical books, but only those I want to own. Meanwhile, whoever's pulled this thing together gets a solid yearly income of $360 from me - much more than they get from all but the heaviest readers today.",1256125917

But the bottom half of the top, those engineers and programmers working on more routine tasks and not actively engaged in developing new ideas or recombining existing technologies or thinking about what new customers want, have done poorly. They’ve been much more exposed to global competitors that make them easily substitutable.'""<p>Does that make sense?
