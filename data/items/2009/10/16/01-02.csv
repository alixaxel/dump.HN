How out of touch with the community can you get.<p>Looking at their visitor stats (<a href=""http://siteanalytics.compete.com/wolframalpha.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteanalytics.compete.com/wolframalpha.com/</a>) I'd guess they have unused capacity for at least 2MM queries a month if back in May each visitor was hitting it twice. I don't get the impression they are using an infrastructure that they only pay for on demand.<p>If they want anyone to use their API (or their service as a whole) they should give away at least 1000 queries a month to the first 2000 developers that sign up.",1255658311

After you pass your initial 10 million request quota, the per request price is higher than during the quota!
