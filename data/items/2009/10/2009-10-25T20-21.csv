No way on earth that an individual piece of rental real estate is less risky than a basket of stocks in my mind.<p>If I were you, I'd stay away from any store of value that is dollar denominated (other than perhaps TIPS), as I believe that the US will have to devalue the dollar to pay its debt. That means oil/metals/commodities, or perhaps easier/safer, profitable companies whose profits are not predominantly made in US dollars. (It's fine or even good if they are repatriated into weakening US dollars.) Ideal would be a company with revenues in foreign currencies and expenses in US dollars.<p>If you were staying put, I'd agree with the buy real estate to live in as a anti-dollar hedge and if you wanted to live in the 2-4 unit type of housing, that would be even better.

The thing I've noticed about San Francisco is the best apartments aren't available in advance.  They go on the market a week or so before they're ready to move in.  The frustrating part here is that you have to put in your 30-day notice at your previous apartment before you have a new place -- super stressful (unless you're willing to pay double-rent for a bit, which is often times economical given the rent break you get in the new place).<p>I've had pretty good luck with Craigslist, subscribing to feed(s) of the various neighborhood/price ranges I'm looking in and <i>hounding</i> that feed.  A lot of places are only up on CL for a few hours before they're taken down or have a waiting list impossibly long.<p>On a related note: it may be <i>much</i> easier if you don't look for studios.  While San Francisco is an older city -- most of the older buildings you'd expect to find lofts/studios in burned/collapsed in previous decades.  The result is most of the housing in the city comes from split up Victorian/Edwardian homes -- one bedroom apartments.",1256501416
