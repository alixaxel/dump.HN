There's nothing wrong with reverting to e-mail, or index cards, or permanent marker on the back of your hand for the next project.  The bug database is huge - literally millions of bugs - but realistically they're all either fixed or won't be fixed.  People only care at the margins, the projects that are actively being worked upon.<p>> But in practice a scrum meeting turns out to be just your average status report you give your manager<p>I don't give status reports to my manager.  The important part is that my <i>peers</i> know what I'm doing, and it's much easier to tell them all at once than individually.  That is, if they care - which is why we don't do them if people don't find them helpful.<p>We're also allowed to say ""I did nothing today"" at the stand-ups, with no questions asked (though I suppose if that became ""I did nothing this week"", some questions might be asked).  It's actually the managers that say this most often, because they waste the most time in meetings.<p>> For an epic example of such a train-wreck, go read ""Dreaming in Code"".<p>Read it.  IMHO their problem was that they never pinned down the goals for the project in a way that was concrete enough that you could say, ""This is what Chandler is, and this is why it's important.""  If you can't do that, you've lost regardless of your process and how many superstars you have on the team.<p>The reason they kept running around in circles concerning coding conventions is that they had nothing else to concern themselves with.  If you know <i>why</i> you're doing something, you're much more inclined to say ""Let's move on and not argue over bikesheds, because we want to get some real work done.""<p>> Teams aren't going to decide anything right by consensus.<p>Every team I've been on here has done just that.  Consensus doesn't mean that there's no decider, or even that everybody agrees.  It means that everybody's been asked, and a solution has been proposed, and everyone is content enough with that solution to move forward.  Oftentimes, that's because they find it more work to argue than to just hold their tongue and do it, but the net effect is that they can do <i>something</i> and at least see whether they were right or wrong.",1254812310

863683,comment,862859,863179,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> If I misunderstood your point, I apologize. Care to correct?<p>You actually made quite good points. The problem that I see, though, is people often feel guilty for being successful just by virtue of being white, and it causes all sorts of other problems.<p>I'll tell you about my own bloodlines real quick - as far back as I can trace my ancestry, we've got no oppressors/thieves/etc. No one in my family has ever owned slaves, for instance, and we went from lower class to middle class only in the last generation. If I make it myself, I'll be self made wealthy, and my children (only half-Caucasian) will be the first in my bloodlines to be born into wealth.<p>> You called the OP out on calling white advantages ""unfortunate"" - I'm saying, it is.<p>I don't think it's unfortunate when white people are doing well, or when anyone is doing well. It's unfortunate when people are doing poorly, but there should be no personal guilt or unease, just a general sense of ""let's fix this"" - the negative emotions are counterproductive on many levels.<p>On a personal level, I've taken very few if any benefits from American society, and learned a great deal of my lessons living in Europe and East Asia, taking friends and lovers of all colors, and just learning a lot at the sometimes-unpleasant school of hard knocks.<p>Personally, I feel no guilt at being white - but I was sort of raised to, like most people born after 1970, and did for a while. You know what really broke it for me? It's when I spent some time in England and saw lots of really multiracial groups of friends - it was common to see a guy from Africa, a guy with Middle Eastern blood, and a couple white guys hanging out. Or a Sri Lankan first generation immigrant, Chinese 0.5 immigrant, Aussie, and a couple Brits. They always ""took the piss"" out of me for being an American, but the groups in London actually are a lot less aware of race. The guilt in America over being white forces people constantly highlights our differences, which actually perpetuates racism.<p>I don't want to ramble on too long, but here's two last thoughts:<p>1. A lot of elitist white people think ""those poor unsophisticated [blacks/Asians/Hispanics], we've got to help them!"" -> This leads to teachers speaking slower to them, cutting them ""breaks"", etc, and there's been a lot of research that when a teacher thinks a child is stupider or slower and teach down to them, the student performs less well. So the, ""Oh my, we white people have exploited, and let's now make it right"" has nasty secondary effects of treating people like they're second class citizens and perpetuating the old race roles.<p>2. I see a lot of pro-minority groups that instead of taking a ""pro-humanity"" stance, they take an adversarial ""us vs. them"" stance. It's understandable to some extent, but it's a damn shame. As an example, look at how the Duke Lacrosse case went down. That was really shameful. I've read a lot of Dr. Martin Luther King's speeches, he was really a tremendous man. He was always stressing that he wanted to see blacks and whites gathering together, doing great things, supporting and working and serving great causes together. A lot of leaders have gotten away from ""let's work together, all races, for a better world"" to, ""those no good people are exploiting us, let's get them back and make sure we get ours"". Maybe it's understandable, but I don't think it's so helpful.<p>Guilt over being white is straight up a bad thing. People of Caucasian descent have done bad things throughout history, as have people of African descent, as have people of Arabic descent, as have people of Asian descent, and so on, and so on. Hell, the things the Spanish, French, and British Empires did to some of their colonies is more horrible than anything that happened in the United States, but the lack of individual guilt among their descendants on racial lines makes the societies closer knit and less racist. We need less ""us vs. them"" - and thinking it's unfortunate that whites are doing well is still, however well meaning, ""us vs. them"". Let's get people who could be doing better up to speed, but let's also never feel guilty about becoming more prosperous.",1254811467

863674,comment,863007,863577,0,0,btilly,,,"Ever heard of regulatory capture?  That's where a regulated group attempts to get control over the regulators, so they can then regulate their own industry for their own benefit.  It is universal that regulated organizations will attempt this, and usually they succeed.<p>After a regulated industry undergoes regulatory capture you will see is a steady growth in the amount of regulation, and a simultaneous decrease in how much the regulation prevents that industry from doing what it wants.  The regulations are added because they benefit the industry in some way, for instance by creating barriers to entry for potential competitors.<p>That is what happened in finance.  Glass-Steagall really kept companies from doing what they wanted to do, and got dropped.  But we got new ""regulations"" like the optional alternative way of calculating net capital ratios introduced in 2004 that allowed the 5 major broker dealers to double their leverage.  The result?  More lines of ""regulation"" that reduced how much actual regulating there was.  Oh right, and a few years later a bunch of failed broker dealers.

And then you're stuck with a substandard solution that makes your life a hell of a lot harder than using plain old emails with naming conventions.<p>Daily meetings are good for some people but bad for others. Scrum meetings are advertised as a way to ""get in the flow"" and to let others know of your problems so they can help you. But in practice a scrum meeting turns out to be just your average status report you give your manager, and it's not going to stop him from interrupting you later anyway. This means that whenever you weren't on your best behavior, you're going to game the system and lie, making the whole meeting pointless and a time-waist.<p>""Conventions for X"" in a team with lots of opinions quickly turn into decision meetings. I had to argue really hard to choose a sane naming-convention for our database, because our tech-lead was a Java programmer ""with years of experience"" and the project manager was incapable of making such decisions and was delegating these choices to the tech-lead. Two years later and the whole project is a mess, because some decisions where made as if we could change them later, and others where pulled out of somebody's ass as a conflict resolution.<p>For an epic example of such a train-wreck, go read ""Dreaming in Code"".<p>Teams aren't going to decide anything right by consensus.

But it will take a while and not all the pieces are visible yet, because you need to support several I/O components beyond fast graphics to have a really credible game platform:<p>-user file system access, low-level networking, swf or jar-style data & code bundles<p>-input devices: keyboard, mouse, gamepad...graceful coordination of input between the rest of the browser and the game is needed.<p>-sound and music, preferably with abilities to do runtime sound generation and processing<p>Missing one of those isn't necessarily a showstopper, with the right kind of game, but together they put severe constraints on what can be built and how easily it can be distributed.

Specifically, Github mentioned slow IO issues on virtual machines as a significant issue.<p>FWIW IO performance on Joyent is abysmal, and they supposedly use Sun's latest virtualization technology.<p>It sounds like the problem is not with the technology but with how it's managed...  It's easy to partition memory and CPU resources, but not as easy to partition IO resources.<p>I'm still waiting for virtual hosts that are paired with their own dedicated solid state storage rather than sharing one hardware IO system or using slow network storage.",1254809461
