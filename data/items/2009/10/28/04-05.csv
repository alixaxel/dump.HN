After that we moved out.<p>They said it had nothing to do with them and we would be credited for the downtime if we stayed for at least another 6 months, but we had by then already signed up elsewhere and restored from backups.

The best applications are the ones that create an entirely separate interface and run in full screen, and even then you don't have very many that are attractive or appealing. I think the only real stand-out I've seen is Google Chrome, which was better-designed when it came out on Windows than any browser on the Mac, and which still holds a slight edge over Safari 4 in terms of pure elegance.

Also, in your resources list you should have the exact machine configuration, there are tools to retrieve that sort of info automatically.<p>Then, when you're done, store it in <a href=""http://inventory.sf.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inventory.sf.net/</a>\nor something like that.<p>It's typical that the people at rackspace would simply drop in the requested hardware, and that you yourself deal with the configuration.<p>The smart money is on running some tests after they've done that to make sure it went ok. Asking for a CPU upgrade and not checking if they're operational is just plain stupid.<p>I figure you literally asked rackspace to upgrade the CPU, and that's what they did.<p>Did you explicitly ask them to install an SMP kernel with a specific version and they didn't do it ? Or did you expect them to do it but you didn't check if they actually did until today ?<p>Two full years of trying to tune a box for performance and not noticing this, then publicly blaming rackspace is simply cheap, an attempt at pinning the blame on rackspace, for something that you should have noticed long ago yourself.<p>Kudos for writing about it but the title should be ""How I messed up"". That's taking responsibility and then make sure it never ever happens again.",1256703432

They don't really mean anything until someone else recognizes it in you. IMHO, it takes a genuine hacker (acknowledged as such by peers) calling someone else a hacker to make it count. I would say the same applies to ""brilliant.""<p>While it might do wonders for one's self-esteem, being called ""brilliant"" by high school teachers doesn't impress me much. In contrast: If Brian Eno says someone is brilliant, I am quite likely to take his word for it.",1256703331

One of Apple's major draws has always been its anal attention to detail, which RIM and Google don't share. Google has one of the worst track records regarding design, period.<p>Neither Android nor the Blackberry has a unified product. When I design for the iPhone I know the exact product dimensions, I know exactly how the user will be interacting with my program, and I know it will be the exact same a year or two from now. I can make one app that any iPhone owner can use and it will be used exactly as I want it used. With Android and Blackberry, that's not the case.<p><i>all apps are 1st class apps</i><p>Pardon my poor French, but what the fuck does that mean?

907125,comment,907027,907039,0,0,gcv,,,"Quite a few ways.<p>1. Start with M-x rgrep, it may do everything you need.<p>2. If not, M-x find-grep lets you run arbitrary grep commands. You may wish to customize grep-find-command to some reasonable default, e.g., mine:<p><pre><code>    (setq grep-find-command\n          (concatenate\n           'string\n           ""find . \\( -path '*.svn' -o -path '*.git' -o -path '*.hg' \\)"" \n           "" ""\n           ""-prune -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -I -i -n -e ""))\n</code></pre>\n3. If you want to just search open buffers, you may find M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers useful. I use this simple wrapper, which you invoke using M-x search-all-buffers:<p><pre><code>    (defun search-all-buffers (regexp)\n      (interactive ""sRegexp: "")\n      (multi-occur-in-matching-buffers ""."" regexp t))\n</code></pre>\n4. You may find filtering files and query-based search replace useful, in which case you should try dired-mode. It does a lot, so try marking files (look in the Mark menu for various options), then operate on them (Operate menu). For example, hit ""% m"" to mark files by name regex, type ""\.[c|h]"" to mark all C and header files, then press ""Q"" to start interactive search-and-replace through all marked files.<p>5. I don't know of a direct equivalent to Nice Find, e.g., basing a search on ""git grep"" output, but if you look through the various Git modes, you may find something useful.",1256702564

Single device/platform, central and easy distribution etc.<p>Today, both Android and BlackBerry have app stores, and Android is a far better platform from a developers perspective (all apps are 1st class apps, immensely powerful SDK, more mainstream language etc, easier distribution etc).<p>So while Apple may have initially attracted developers because of quality, they continue to attract them because they are popular and because their app store focuses on payments more. With the coming onslaught of Android devices its very likely that Android devices will outnumber iPhones, all Apple will have left is a store that is more geared towards payment, and even there Android might catch up.<p>Regardless, 2010 will be an interesting year in the mobile space.
