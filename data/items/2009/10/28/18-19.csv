This dissonance is probably part of why your response is as aggressive as it is.<p>Get off HN and do the customer support. Skip that trip to the bar and get that next bug fixed. I know and am surprised from my own personal experiences at how much time we spend on small unproductive things. Personally, I think they are essential to being happy, but there can be stints where neglecting happiness and relaxation has a greater payoff; where doing the work and getting the customer support done will give you enough cash flow to hire someone to do it for you.<p>There is this little voice in everyone's head, saying that the extra work is too hard, that it'll be better not to stick it through. It's like there is a constant battle with yourself on what level of self-dominion you can achieve; meaning, your ability to actually get yourself to do what you want to do. It's running that 5th mile when you've run 4 and want to call it a day. It's coming home from work and putting in 2-3 hours into your side project when you just want to lay down and watch TV. How hard is it really to dig in and get it done?<p>I say what I do not to be critical of you--I don't know who you are, and I have no conflict with you personally--but because I know how sticky that emotion is. Feeling like that extra work isn't worth my time; I've been there. What it takes is doing small tasks, one at a time, to build momentum. Taking the trash out leads to cleaning your desk, which leads to writing up a short brief about things, and eventually, you're flying through and getting task after task done (not just work-related things) and you are 100% confident in your ability to say, ""okay, so today I'm going to do X, Y, and Z,"" and at the end of the day you will have done those things.",1256755794

Steve Blank's ""Secret History of Silicon Valley"" shows that it'll take more than a few bills passed to create a viable competitor to SV, esp. since this new region would have to compete with the actual SV.<p>How about option C) SV continues to thrive as a worldwide center of innovation no matter how jacked the rest of CA and the US gets?  The only way I see this not happening is if the US completely clamps down on immigration (right now it's a giant pain but still navigable for a large number of immigrants).<p>The only international tech centers that I've ever heard anyone mention seriously were Tel Aviv (but unlikely b/c of security issues), and Singapore.  Not sure how immigrant-friendly the high tech Asian economies (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, S.

All interventions in the market are social engineering, it may not be intentional, but subsidizing/taxing certain behaviors encourages/discourages them.<p>2.  I'm all for getting fiber to every door step.  I'm just disagreeing with the approach.  There is no reason that individuals couldn't form a co-op, or some other nonprofit, or even for profit company together to provide their internet.<p>3. I'm going to disagree with the national defense thing on two points. \n  A. The government's sole purpose is defend your rights, national defense is defending your rights from foreign enemies.\n  B. The government has a monopoly on force (except for certain self-defensive purposes).<p>The community has a vested interest in infrastructure, but if you actually look at what goes  on with it is ridiculous.  The mass pike was supposed to have tolls removed years ago, but through all sorts tricks they manage to keep the tolls.  The big dig, also in boston, cost Billions of dollars for a tiny tunnel.<p>So my final points:\n1. Without competition and voluntary interaction we don't actually know what the value of something is -- high speed is important to some, while for others 56k is enough for them.  \n2. For almost anything people propose the government should do, a private nonprofit could be created to carry out the same task. \n3. Organizations and nonprofits are more driven by results than politicsl they don't want to merely show that they're taking action.\n4. Nonprofits/Foundations deal with many critical issues that most people don't realize/know about.  For example, the Ford Foundation with regards to Russian studies & American foreign policy/defense.\n5.  It is very hard to compete against the government since they don't have to make a profit, can alter rules to their advantage, and lastly they don't pay taxes :)<p>I think I addressed your points above.",1256754915

The analogy someone else made to sports coaches is an apt one; if a team loses a few games, the coach doesn't get his pay docked, but if a team loses for a few seasons, chances are he'll just be out of a job.<p>Plus, in many cases it can be hard to determine whether a CEO's actions led directly to a poor quarter, or if it was just a bad quarter and they handled things appropriately.  And if pay was tied directly to financial metrics, there would be an incentive to play the numbers game.<p>It's important also to remember that the people determining a CEO's salary -- or at least giving it the thumbs-up -- are typically the biggest owners of a company; the CEO's pay comes out of their pockets in greater proportion than it does anyone else's.  If they think that their CEO is doing a ten-million-dollar a year job, who is anyone else to argue?  If they thought they could get someone to do the same job at half the salary, doubtless they'd do it; I doubt they <i>enjoy</i> spending that much, but they think it's necessary.",1256754768

The jobs created are actually going to make an entirely different set of products that the market wasn't creating before due to a flaw in the way the market was designed by the people who set it up.<p>That's also why assigning value to carbon is different than assigning value to restaurants. Because of the way the market was designed we have the roughly the right number of restaurants, but way too much carbon.<p>The important thing to realize is that the market didn't just happen, it was designed by people, and it can be designed differently. In the same way that we don't allow people to, say, dumb garbage in a public park just because they may want to under some idealized market fantasy, we shouldn't allow people to dump unlimited carbon in the atmosphere either.<p>The market is a tool, invented by people, as the most efficient way to distribute resources to those who value them the most. But as a tool, we need to understand how it works, where it breaks down, and how to apply it effectively to create the kind of society we want to live in. We can't just treat it as some kind of religious construct, where it's magically going to write the laws, vaccinate the children, clean up dogshit from the street, etc.<p>That's why cap-and-trade is so good, because it uses the power of the market to create the kind of society we want to live in. (As opposed to those who argue that we should live in the kind of society the market wants to create, whatever this means, frankly I have no idea and I don't think the people who advocate it have thought it through enough to realize that it literally doesn't make any sense, it's just empty words.)",1256753518
