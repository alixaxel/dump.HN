Even if Comcast wanted to buy NBC (why would they?), $35 billion is far too much for the least popular of the four major networks.

I was about to ask (since I was <i>certain</i> I had read the downvote threshold was 100) when I realized I could just check the code.  It turned out to be surprisingly hard to <i>find</i> the code, so I figured there must be some others in the HN community who will enjoy this quick demo.",1254365246

Indeed, Chris Dixon addressed this issue in a recent post here: <a href=""http://www.cdixon.org/?p=702"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdixon.org/?p=702</a>. Moreover, I made a similar comment to your solid interview with Andrew Warner on mixergy.com (<a href=""http://bit.ly/dVkS1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/dVkS1</a>):<p>""Lesson #3: understand the deal terms and run models as to what happens under various scenarios. Fenwick & West puts out a quarterly survey of market deal terms in venture capital financings (see, e.g., <a href=""http://www.fenwick.com/publications/6.12.1.asp?..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fenwick.com/publications/6.12.1.asp?...</a>). At a minimum, the entrepreneur should understand what is ""market"" and how each deal term plays out in a liquidation.
