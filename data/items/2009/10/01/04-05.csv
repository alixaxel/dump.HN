854355,comment,854029,854046,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>As painful as it is, I found dealing with an interrupt-rich environment much easier in assembler than in other languages. The ability to use coroutines significantly reduced our efforts in building interrupt-based programs. Plus the ability to segregate tasks by interrupt level, this helped a bit.</i><p>I'd like to hear more. What you were trying to do? Why did it need coroutines/interrupts? How did you manage the much-lower-levelness of the language? Also, how is it that coroutines are easier in assembler in the first place? Is it because you can save the state of an execution path and jump to it later?<p>I've become interested lately in the idea of building a limited language (i.e. specific to the problem of one application), Lisp style, that expands directly to assembly language, as opposed to the normal way of doing it which is to expand to a high-level language that is then handed off to a general-purpose compiler. The idea is that because the language wouldn't be general-purpose, you could exercise much more control over the assembly language that is generated. What do you think of this?",1254372901

I've never had an intimate view of the student body there, but I do believe the school to be as progressive as any.<p>I'm of the opinion that, aside from a few select areas in the world, you will always have to search diligently for ""someone with an entrepreneurial spirit [you] connect with."" As a student at Bradley University a few hours away in the backwards city of Peoria, Illinois I know how that goes.  The key (as usual) is to be relentlessly persistent.

It goes hand in glove with a meritocratic value.  HN contributors aim for and admire quality over authority, and I think that's a better explanation for the language pedantry we sometimes demonstrate.<p>Of course I'm describing the ideal, which is not always achieved, and HN's idea of ""quality"" in the use of language is subjective.",1254372804

I have done these in Philly in the past, and it has worked as follows. A bunch of people get together for a full day on the weekend, enter with a goal of accomplishing a side project (either a small new project or a piece of a larger project), and we all work from early morning til late night, then get some good food and drink afterwords.  At previous hackathons I've gotten iPhone apps and simple web apps built, and they have been great fun. Sometimes it's just motivating to be around a bunch of people who are working something out of passion for creating, and this is a good way to harness that vibe.

While I wasn't a WashU student (ex-fiance was), I participated in IdeaBounce for a while and eventually networked my way into several other groups in St. Louis that were doing interesting things.<p>Beyond that, I had a similar experience as a student at Iowa State.  Smallish town, a lot of folks focused on getting jobs, and the general creativity of the entrepreneurial groups a bit lacking.  Eventually I made my way through to various programs about start-ups run by the state of Iowa and met a number of angels, early stage investors purely to meet other people doing interesting things (which landed me time doing sales at a photovoltaics company and business planning for a textbook coop idea).  Really my goal was to meet a lot of people and learn a lot of things such that, when I moved out of Iowa (I'm in SF now), I felt like I made the most of the opportunity in the time I spent there.<p>In the end, I think if you try to be open and meet a lot of people, you'll eventually find others that share your interest and match well.  Use STL as a place to hone your skills, toss ideas off people, and prepare yourself for opportunities in the future. Perhaps something will stick between now and graduation but, if it doesn't, you'll have learned a lot.",1254372085
