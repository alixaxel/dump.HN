So it wouldn't be ideal to put a regular USB size connector on all types of gadgets.<p>Ipod's dock connector is wide so it can physically stand the ipod, iphone, or whatever up when plugged in. So the physical design of connectors often serve purposes other than just to  transmit data. And for this reason we'll probably always have proprietary connectors.",1256943517

Google should be encouraging users to invite others for a practical purpose, ie working on a project together. Having a specific purpose in mind when being invited to Wave would greatly help people understand and evaluate the usefulness for collaboration.
Instead, people just clamor for invites to try out the hyped new thing by Google rather than to fulfill any real need they have, and then click around randomly, use Wave like a chat, and get annoyed when ""nobody's online"".
They're setting people up for disillusionment and  disappointment this way.",1256940052
