You can't think of a single situation where correctness is more important than speed?<p>I've spent most of my career working on systems handling money, at jobs where we actually bought and sold things.  When there are bugs in the code, we lose real, quantifiable money.  Sometimes being first-to-market with a product or feature is more valuable than the cost of bugs.  Sometime a buggy feature makes more money than it loses.  But, it's not a given, and it's naive to say that speed is more important than correctness in all (or even most) situations.",1255232639

874266,comment,874266,873319,0,0,vicaya,,,"1000 nodes are nothing if you crawl the entire web and keep a history. I'm sure someone already has a modified version of an OSS bigtable cluster at 1PB+ and close to 1k nodes :)<p>>> they don't support range scan efficiently either\n> Cassandra does.<p>Only if you call order preserving hashing efficient when all the keys can be <i>easily</i> hashed in to one bucket, no matter what hash function you choose :) Cassandra's range query is an occasionally useful hack, which is <i>not</i> comparable to Bigtable like implementations, in terms of efficiency, scalability and robustness.<p>The Bigtable's single-master with standbys is never a problem in practice. The AppEngine outage was a due to a bug in GFS master protocol decoding. If this bug is in every node, all nodes would be crashing instead of one with some service (reads and some writes) still available. The so called ""fully"" distributed model is only better when you assume that you don't have bugs in your code and that node failure is random. I argue that separating different responsibilities/functionalities into different components is good for fault isolation, a sound software engineering practice. Naive fully distributed model is much more brittle in practice due to code bugs.<p>BTW, although Hypertable is inspired by Bigtable in design, the implementation and features set (support a dozen languages via Thrift and full read isolation via MVCC) are different enough that I wouldn't call it a clone :)",1255231012

You almost felt justified paying their higher prices because the atmosphere was welcoming, the 'vibe' was friendly, and it was a Starbucks-like 'third place' better than Starbucks.<p>My 'new' Panera hasn't seen me but twice since I moved to San Gabriel Valley. The manager that's usually there is short and you feel like you're an interruption to...whatever it is they would rather be doing. I stopped going after getting the exact same treatment the second time. I e-mailed their corporate offices with specific compliments / criticisms, and never heard a word. I <i>want</i> to be their customer, because they have a few sandwiches I like. But now I just go to the local Italian deli and get food that's as good with a much better price tag.<p>And, just in case it was the fault of one GM: I've been back to my old Panera, and they're suffering many of the same problems.
