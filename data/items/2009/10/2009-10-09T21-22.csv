That's 2 million requests/hour, 33,333 requests/minute, 555 requests/second.<p>You can easily handle 5-10k requests a second with a few ms response time -- including dynamic templating and hitting a backend database -- on a 2.66 GHz 4 core Xeon 5150 with a couple gigabytes of RAM, using a servlet runtime and a JVM-based language.<p>Basically, you could take that entire solution stack and compress it down to a few items with far fewer moving parts, and spend half as much on engineering and capital expenditures.<p>My hope is that efforts like MacRuby bring this level of free performance to the Ruby world, and that languages like Scala and Clojure make the JVM more attractive, too.",1255123240

Names for mobile games had to be short and very descriptive , even if boring (""NY Shooter"" instead of Max Payne or Halo), because there was no PR channels.

I'd like to say it was a great number or a majority of people, but I don't have a study or link to back this up. This is just from my experience.<p>The accomplishment that Obama did, which for US citizens might seem inconsequential, is that they made us (the international community) look at the US with fondness. Changing people's mind is a powerful accomplishment.<p>Obama's administration made people have faith in US leadership and that once again the international community's voice would be heard by the lone reigning super power in the world.<p>This isn't a ""concrete"" accomplishment like publishing a paper, stopping a war or ending an oppressive regime. But it is nonetheless a relevant and important event in the course of international politics. By positively changing the political climate Obama has achieved something that the US  had failed to do for many years.<p>Honestly, I don't understand all of the hate. Peace itself is an ideal, a goal we should aim for but most likely will never achieve (at least not on a global scale), and Obama's intentions and steps in that direction have spoken louder than many others this year.",1255122604

It took two frantic days before I figured out what the problem is, patched it, and started the emergency release process for all the other customers.<p>But yeah, I initially took responsibility for the mess, since it was most likely my code that did it.  After figuring out precisely what happened, and having to demonstrate to my boss that the old code did not delete stuff out of directories, that responsibility got walked back a bit.  Still... I got ""laid off"" within 5 months of that.<p>Basically, there was blame to go around: the university should have had a comprehensive backup solution in place, particularly given the expense involved in creating the data; I should have been more careful to not needlessly call this directory touch operation while creating cached bits in the data files (the ""data file"" that the user thought of was actually a directory because we were running into fat16 and fat32 file size limits), but at the end of the day, my boss took code that used to work and turned it into code that not only didn't work but was broken in the worst way possible for no other reason than to fuck about with posix idiocy.

It's refreshing to see someone critique that sort of analysis.<p>There is always a new blog post talking about the mathematical impossibility of making money on the app store, dependence on Apple for exposure, unfairness of the App Store rules, etc. Some of these articles even have some credibility. It's fair to say that it is difficult to make money on the App Store (or any other market). It's fair to say you can get a boost from Apple. And it's true that the App Store is not transparent.<p>But before you write that next screed about the App Store being an impossible-to-win game with no real reward for success, remember that you don't understand everything. As this article points out, it could simply be a market misunderstanding, which will doom a product anywhere.<p>Before you complain that the game is fixed, remember a lot of normal people make money on the App Store. Instapaper makes money, I make a living of the App Store, as do two close friends of mine, and none of us has ever been featured by Apple. We make good products, don't have VC capital or money to market, and the sales rise over time. You can make money on any category (not just games). I do well in Navigation, my buddy Ish does well in Social Networking, and another buddy Dave does really well in utilities.<p>If you try and make a product for the App Store and it fails to sell, you have no one to blame but yourself. The App Store is the absolute easiest way for an indie developer to sell software on a mobile phone... heck, to SELL software at all.<p>As a caveat, if you choose to play in the Games category, I suggest you be a good game programmer with a good idea, and not some two-bit hack with a get rich quick scheme.
