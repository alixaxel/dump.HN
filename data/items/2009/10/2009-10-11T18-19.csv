However you have no control of what that is.<p>Therefore if you want to have clean water supplies, universal education, national defense, police, unproductive people not starving in the streets, etc then you need to divert some resources away from capitalism.  This is the justification for taxation and government.<p>The justification for Michael Moore's point of view is that he wants to see those things happen, and capitalism doesn't do that very well.<p><i>However</i> be very careful about using government to try to direct capitalism to meet your goals.  Because well-meaning interventions regularly fail spectacularly due to unintended consequences.  One of which is that any influential group that is regulated by government will try (and eventually usually succeeds) in getting control over their regulators.",1255287216

The question is whether you're learning from your mistakes.<p>Personally I would ask why people keep bailing on you.  You had 2 professors bail on letting you complete a paper you started on.  You had co-founders bail and screw you over.  The people working with you on the web application didn't continue working with you.  (The point being that they didn't just abandon the application, they also didn't invite you to be part of the next thing they did.)<p>This is a bad pattern because generally we can't succeed unless we can get other people to succeed with us.  For example you're unlikely to start a successful startup without the close cooperation of a cofounder.  I'm sure that circumstances are different in each case, but as the poster says, ""The only commonality in all your failed relationships is you.""<p>This strikes me as a pattern that is repeating too much for coincidence.  So you need to ask why.  It may be that you'll get an answer that you can't easily solve.  For instance people may find you not fun to be around.  If that's the case then you're unlikely to be able to change your personality.  In which case you need to find someone who can get along with you as you are.  However it may be something like, ""you've always got 50 other projects going on, and keep on dropping the ball"" in which case you <i>can</i> fix it.

I had actually wondered--is there any way to know who has up- / down-voted a comment?<p>As to the growth issue, I'm not quite sure what you mean by ""evolutionary suicide.""  My first guess would be that this term applies to a species that fails to adapt to a changing environment or, in the case of a sentient species, chooses to consciously direct its evolution in a direction that renders it unfit for its environment.  That doesn't seem like a good fit for your argument though, so I think what you likely meant was that the population will outgrow the available resources, and there will not be enough food /  energy / medicine / etc for everyone.  If I'm wrong, please correct me.<p>Assuming that this is what you meant, I see several implicit assumptions that are worth examining.  They are:<p>1) Humanity does not currently know how to colonize space.<p>2) It will be S years before we colonize spaces, and S is a large number (""a long time"").  This probably means decades, possibly centuries, although you don't specify.<p>3) The current rate of worldwide population growth will be sustained into the indefinite future.<p>4) The resources of the Earth are too limited to support the world population that is projected to exist in X years, where X is a small number of decades.<p>5) X years < S years.<p>6) Our current knowledge of the Earth's resources is complete and correct.<p>If any of these points prove incorrect, I would be hard pressed to agree with your argument.<p>Considering some of the news reports I have seen in the last year or two, I suspect that there might be more resources out there than we think, and that space colonization might be closer than we think:<p>- Yesterday's NY Times carried a major article about a new technique for natural gas recovery from shale.<p>- I am aware of at least one study that shows a space elevator could be built for about the price of Boston's Big Dig (i.e. ~10-20B).  With such a construct in place, the two major hurdles in space development (launch costs and risk of catastrophic launch failure) go out the window. Even if that study was low by an order of magnitude, it's still something that any G8 government could afford, as could a conglomeration of major corporations.<p>- JAXA (the Japanese NASA) is currently working on a solar power station project.  If powersats prove out, they will represent a major incentive to start building up space infrastructure, which will naturally lead to more people staying in space longer, which will naturally lead to colonization.<p>- It is pretty clear that population growth tends to level off and even decline once a nation reaches a certain standard of living and life expectancy.  Europe and Japan are good examples of this: negative population growth and/or aging populations.  More people aren't the problem, they are the solution: we need more minds coming up with ideas, and more hands producing wealth world-wide.",1255285426

When the bullet goes through, most of the energy goes through with it. Therefore, the damage to the object is relatively minimal (just a whole).<p>When it is stopped, however, pretty much all the kinetic energy needs to be dispersed in the object itself. That happens via a number of mechanisms: deformation of the bullet, deformation of the surrounding material, heat, and, if the bullet breaks into pieces, of course, they can each take a chunk of energy with them as they go shooting in every direction.",1255285079

Just throwaway code (from trying to learn a language), and/or notes (from trying to learn a concept). For me, the main issue has always been the thought that I'm not quite ready; that if I just brushed up on X, it would go a long way. Which of course is placing the project on a pedestal. I think the key is to work on small, approachable projects, and see which ones start to grow into something more.<p>Last night I discovered the <i>You and Your Research</i> speech, and found this interesting quote on why Nobel Prize winners often fail to make breakthroughs after they win: ""When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems... The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go."" The quote also reminded me of Feynman's story about the flying plate, and how analyzing something unimportant just for fun (and to escape his ""real"" responsibilities) ultimately started a path to the Nobel Prize.",1255284913

Whenever I'm in doubt, I can easily go to the code. I don't live or die based on documentation.

It doesn't have to be a ginormous ""all things to all people"" framework like Zend or Cake or Symfony. (Those are great frameworks, I'm not knocking them).

I find different authors present ideas and concepts in different ways, and sometimes if a concept isn't clear in one text, it's clear in another.<p>In your specific example, I'd recommend seeking another book or article on neural networks and skim it until you find information on the concept you're stuck with, and see if it can add any pieces to the puzzle.

Since currency values are only relative to each other, any loss of value of the USD has to be matched by a strengthening of other currencies. The Euro is in no fighting shape, and an eccessive strengthening of the Renminbi would have catastrophic domestic effects in China (hence the Chinese government would simply not allow that to happen).<p>But... let's say you live in the US and want to prepare for it anyway? The major effect would be rampant inflation, especially for goods and services that are either imported or are highly reliant on imported goods. We import very little food (although we rely on oil-based fertilizers to make it), so I do not believe that widespread chaos and street violence (""kill your lunch, chop your wood, and carry a gun"" scenario) are very likely.<p>To protect yourself from inflation, don't focus so much on your financial assets as on your personal and professional assets. A financial bet can go wrong (what if the USD strengthens instead?), while your skills and ability to generate income will always benefit you. Develop a freelancing business and related skills - salaries adjust slowly to inflation, so you get squeezed, while as a freelancer you can adjust your rates more quickly. Also develop a lifestyle that relies as little as possible on our major imported commodity, oil - a fuel efficient car, solar panels on the roof, etc.",1255284021
