877202,comment,875686,875741,0,0,cojadate,,,"I would argue that Stephen King's 'It' should also have the status of a great novel.<p>One French critic wrote of 'It':<p>«Ça» fonctionne parce que «Ça» fait peur. Pendant plus de mille pages – Jean-Pierre Dufreigne, L'Express<p>Translation: 'It' works because ""It"" scares. Throughout over one thousand pages.<p>How wrong can a critic be?<p>Yes the horror element is great but it's not why 'It' works at all, not for me anyway. For me 'It' works because of its insights into human nature – it's use of fantasy to look unflinchingly at human nature at it's worst and it's most beautiful, to do justice to a world that is full of both evil and goodness, because every story overlaps with other stories overlapping with other stories, just like real life, because it's a morally uncompromising book which presents no hard and fast rules of morality, because it portrays children and childhood accurately, because it shows us a world where abuse, neglect and apathy are rife, come in many forms, and can be perpetrated by people for all kinds of reasons, sometimes wilfully, sometimes from neediness, sometimes from a self-deluded sense of righteousness, sometimes from lack of knowing anything better. Because it also writes about the power of love and the deep bonds people share without a shred of sentimentality. Because it's a fantasy, and yet it shows our world perhaps more accurately than any story I've ever read, watched or heard.<p>I particularly loved the theme of standing up to oppressors. Many stories have this element, but 'It' is so true to reality that the standing-up is more inspiring and powerful than in other works. Typically however, King has the wisdom to have a side-plot which shows how standing up to oppressors can go wrong, by way of brutal vigilantism and bloody revenge. It's this steadfast refusal to accept clichés and black-and-white worldviews of any kind which I particularly appreciate in King.<p>I don't know, maybe the best thing about it is that makes a giant telepathic space turtle seem like a perfectly plausible part of a novel characterized by gritty realism.<p>My second, not entirely unrelated, nomination is 'Psychology is About People' by HJ Eysenck. This is half a century old so I am sure there are now many better books saying much the same thing. But for me it was the culmination of a train of thought, which started when I came across the quote ""wisest is she who knows she does not know"" in Jostein Gaarder's  Sophie's World  , which made me realize how little I know and how important it is to identify and question my own assumptions.<p>Psychology is About People is an attack on fuzzy thinking in the fields of public policy-making, social science and, above all, psychology (Eysenck was himself a psychologist). He demonstrates that pyschotherapy, at least in his time, was little more than storytelling which, when held up to the hard light of the experimental method, was almost always proven false. Likewise, he attacks governments for basing their social policies on similarly unexamined assumptions. These fields, especially psychology have all come a long way since Eysenck's time but it's still very easy to spot the kind of fuzzy thinking and refusal-to-question-assumptions everywhere you look.<p>I disagree with Eysenk in some of the conclusions he makes from his own research, but I think his general approach to knowledge and truth is fantastic. It certainly changed the way I think and has effected in me a permanent distaste for 'meta-narratives' of all kinds.",1255368330

The reason we have so much CSS is because the site was not originally designed by a web designer.  It was designed page by page by a graphic designer.  We have 125 controllers and over 300 templates, plus several dozen static pages.  Many of these pages have custom layouts and typography.<p>The reason we have 5000 lines of well-organized CSS instead of 10000 lines of poorly-organized CSS is thanks to some heavy refactoring that we have done after most of the pages had been built.  Don't underestimate the cost of building a unique brand.  We can't all get by on 37signals style.",1255367108

877144,comment,876556,877078,0,0,puns,,,"The numbers matter. The issue here is this: everybody isn't equal, we're all unique. Some people work hard, are more intelligent, and contribute more to society. Some people are of higher value, depending on your metrics. So a murderer (who takes from society) has less worth than a scientist whose research creates new technologies that aid society. Everyone should have equal 'rights', but everyone is not equal however.<p>The problem here is that you cannot know the value of this one individual vs the five. People aren't a set of bricks, all manufactured to be the same size and from the same material. Saving five people vs one is a guess -- you can be wrong and save a group of people who contribute nothing and kill the man who does. But the numbers still apply because one man cannot be worth more than thousands for example -- and I think part of this experiment was to find out what your threshold for this was.",1255367035

If your coursework isn't working for you, find different courses or find a faculty member to advise you on independent projects or research (for credit or not).  Audit upper-level or graduate courses.  Talk to professors and grad students outside of class to learn about their research.  Attend talks and conferences.  This is more work for you, but it sounds like it's what you want.<p>College is also a great place to do programming or business projects in your free time, and to find other people to do them with.  You may never have as easy a time meeting new people or spending time on personal projects as you do right now.  It might cut into your partying and fraternity activities, but dropping out to join the workforce would do that too.<p>Opportunities will be hard to find at first, and you have to expect some amount of rejection.  Keep in mind that your coursework will become more self-directed and interesting with each new year of school. Some opportunities that are closed to you now will be open later if you make sure you're aware and ready for them.<p>As long as you're not planning to go to grad school, and not in danger of failing, ignore your grades and instead optimize your learning.  For the first time in your life, GPA might not matter ever again.  Grades can be useful feedback for you, but remember that in ten years no one will care if you got a C- in freshman chemistry.  (Some job applications do ask for your GPA, but in the startup world this is rare.)  Regardless of how it affects your grades, spend more time on the lectures/homework/reading/activities that actually teach you things and less on busywork or stuff you already know.  It's your responsibility to decide whether it's better to skip lecture and learn the material on your own.",1255366990
