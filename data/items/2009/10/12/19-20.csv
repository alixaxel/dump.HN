Garbage collection, while a great addition, is not entirely seamless to use. Blocks, because of the fact that they're a C feature and not an Objective-C feature, are verbose and complicated to define. The ton of boilerplate code required is also a bit painful.<p>All that said, I wouldn't switch to using any other language with Cocoa because the APIs are natural to Objective-C and they feel quite clunky when used in another language. MacRuby, and particularly HotCocoa, are interesting, but again, there's a re-learning curve involved.",1255377475

I got in a bunch of fights with Erin early in our marriage by professing a similar world view.

Microsoft's strengths have long ago shifted towards marketing. They once had a edge in technology - over Lotus, over Borland, over Novell, over IBM and even over Apple (in the OS7~9 days).<p>Sadly, after their market share - and dominance of the OEM channels - exceeded a certain tipping point, they had really no need to excel in technology. From that point on, what differentiated Microsoft was a careful management of the expectations of their core market (VARs, OEMs and CTOs).<p>At Microsoft, technical competency has taken a back-seat since the early 90s.<p>This entire mess up smells like ""Management by numbers"". When a manager cuts costs without considering the implications to data-safety, this is what we get in the end.<p>Seriously: how much data needed to be backed up? 50 terabytes? 500 terabytes? And why the hell the data resides in a SAN and not distributed and replicated in a bunch of front-end servers? The SAN should be the back-up.<p>I love the idea of having all my data on the cloud - It's a major nuisance to switch cellphones and port data from one to the next - and having the data on the cloud could make it easy to access it through a nice web interface not unlike Google's GMail, Calendar, Picasa or Documents.

Far more high-profile cases of deliberate fiction have happened.<p>But it is more likely that the plots are real, that he really did make some high Tc material in his personal lab and do some measurements. It's not rocket surgery, to someone with a bit of training. It's just chemistry, electronic equipment, and liquid nitrogen, none of which is especially expensive.<p>The problem arises in the interpretation. He points at some random squiggles and calls them a Meissner transition. I see squiggles. It would sure be nice to have a control, yes? A curve traced from a piece of boring commercially-available YBCO, plugged into the same apparatus, and showing similar squiggles at the known transition temperature of commercially-available YBCO?<p>Similarly, if you take any data enough times you will get some odd discontinuities now and then. Your chart recorder software will glitch, you'll leave a switch in the wrong position, your sample temperature is changing during the measurement in a way that is being missed by your apparatus, your sample is in the middle of disintegrating, etc. The initial impulse is always to suspect that each glitch is an amazing new discovery, but they almost never are. So it would be nice to know if the results were repeatable. How many samples did he make? Can he <i>show</i> me the data from all the samples?<p>Where did the stoichiometry data and the structural data come from? Mixing up a batch of a compound is one thing, but analyzing it is something else: That actually does require equipment, and money. How was it done? Where was it done, and by whom? What is the margin of error in the results? Has this material really never been made before? If someone else has made it before, why didn't they publish this first?<p>I should stress that, compared to many cranky projects (<i>cough</i> cold fusion <i>cough</i>) this is a highly believable report. It's not as if high-Tc superconductors are unattested in the literature. It's not as if this guy's results require throwing out established theory. It's not as if he <i>couldn't</i> have gotten lucky and built a one-off sample with an amazingly high Tc in his basement -- most good physics is done in <i>someone's</i> basement, and most reproducible results start their lives as <i>barely</i> reproducible results.

They do it by enforcing naming standards and implementing checklists and reviews, but they don't work yet we all know quality when we see it.
