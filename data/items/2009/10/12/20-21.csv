Isn't it quite possible it's concern for their family situation (because work affects family)?

It's certainly a good book for anyone interested in startups, and is refreshingly witty and candid.<p>I noticed an interesting difference in my response to this book from the first time around, though. In the author's descriptions of his frequent battles with VCs, the VCs don't come off nearly as bad as he wants them to.

Some of the best parts of Startup Bootcamp so far:<p>Kyle Vogt (Justin.tv) emphasized being flexible and remaining committed during the hard times. Iterate and morph and never quit until you have a product/service that fits the market. Make something people love, even if that means completely changing your ideas.<p>Dan Theobald (Vecna) gave us some warnings about the dangers of ""other people's money"", which he jokingly referred to as opium (OPM). He advocated bootstrapping it, mentioning that he would show up at companies with nothing but his laptop and say, ""I'm from MIT. How can I help you with your tech needs?"" He advised against ever hiring anyone, but said that if you have to hire then get the smartest people possible: 1 great engineer = 10 good engineers = 100 average engineers.<p>Dan recommended reading a paper called ""On the folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B"" (title self-explanatory). At Vecna, employees are given points to distribute to coworkers they find deserving, and these points control bonuses. People work harder when they know their employees are evaluating them, and coworkers do a better job than managers. He also spoke a lot about helping the community, and being non-self. I came away from the the talk thinking that Dan's a really great guy.<p>Adam Smith (Xobni), who was the first to speak, talked about raising the barrier to entry by doing something <i>hard</i>. He estimated it would take tens of millions of dollars for someone to come into Outlook and do what Xobni has done. Like Vogt, he emphasized being nimble. That is, being able to effectively change your idea and your product to fit the market. He pointed out that external deadlines (ex. demoing at a tech conference), can really work in your favor. He recommended reading Jessica Livingston's <i>Founders at Work</i>, and also <i>High St@kes, No Prisoners.</i> According to him the latter book's out of print, but Adam brought along six copies and set them on the stage for anyone to grab near the end of his talk. Luckily, I sat on the front row, and I move pretty quick if I say so myself :)<p>Angus Davis (Tellme) had a really cool speech. One, he's a great charistmatic speaker.
