No matter how you slice it corporate America works like this...<p>+  Executive Staff gives an assignment to a certain manager.<p>+  Manager divides that assignment up and gives it to his team members<p>+  Team members complete the assignment<p>+  Manager submits the completed assignment back to the Executive Staff<p>Given that scenario there's no way anyone other than the manager can know who accomplished what meaning no matter what system you implement it's always going to come down to the judgment of managers.<p>(which is why hiring good managers that don't try to game the system is so very important)",1254592745

I don't understand why people keep pretending working harder is somehow how inversely related to the quality of your decisions. Your IQ stays the same, you just work harder.<p>Let's take your example. Working harder doesn't mean naively running 10 hours more a week. It means doing research on training systems, consulting with coaches, monitoring your diets, revising workout plans, etc. Having been involved with sports all my life, I can tell you that this stuff matters, you can always do more of it, and it's work.",1254591478

In patent-speak, randomization is the mechanism and rendering is the result.<p>I mention patent-speak because patents are the use of mechanism to accomplish result.<p>Would you object to a patent on certain uses of a lever to close a gate?  (Ignoring novelty issues - closing gates with levers is well known now, while using randomization in rendering was presumably new when Pixar did their thing.)  In patent-speak, the lever is the mechanism while closing the gate is the result.<p>If not, then you're arguing that a lever as a mechanism is somehow different from randomization as a mechanism.  If so, you're pretty much arguing against all patents (using mechanism to accomplish result).",1254591446

He was looking to find work in construction.<p>Now, arguably being a hockey player is not the same as being a judge, but it's a damn sight better from an income perspective than being a labourer.

I doubt letting everyone go who tries to shoplift a book from the library in hopes of them becoming characters more fit for a movie plot will do much good either.<p>That said, you still received my up-vote since it made me think more of zero-tolerance policies and reading books in general. I remember reading a story on the Kindle's popularity with women. A lot of women it interviewed said they enjoyed the literary anonymity the Kindle afforded them in public places, as they generally didn't feel comfortable reading romance and pulp novels in public places like the subway.<p>The article felt to be in similar vein; someone discovers something that catches their eye but feels shame in seeking it out.
