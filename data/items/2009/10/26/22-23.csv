C + no unit tests + opinionated dictator with very little computer science experience = very, very bad.  But it works well enough.  As long as you are on the beaten path, with Intel hardware and Nothing Too Weird, you will be fine.  On OS X, you don't even have the choice to even try anything else.<p>As for the distribution issue, it's true that you are either out of date or slightly unstable.  But on OS X, you can't get any packages at all.  So you manage everything yourself, or rely on a third party to package everything for you.  Then you are out of date or unstable, and the various package managers conflict with each other and with Apple's stuff.  There is no magic fix there, it's the same set of problems.<p>So anyway, I don't care what OS you use... but OS X is not objectively better.  (I have noticed that OS X users prefer no way to do something over a flaky way to do something.  Linux has a lot of flaky ways to do a lot of things; OS X just doesn't do much.  Tradeoffs.)",1256597626

904332,comment,904193,904193,0,0,GavinB,,,"The beauty of twitter isn't that you send messages without specifying recipients. Any billboard does this. HTML webpages, blogs with RSS feeds, etc do this.<p>Twitter allows you to:<p>1. Communicate on equal footing. You're living on someone else's blog, or their social news site, or their subreddit, or their messageboard, or in their chat room. There's no need to shout anyone down with negative karma, because everyone controls their own feed.<p>2. Control your world. If you stop following someone, they basically cease to exist. On the other hand, they can follow you if they want, with no harm to you. This allows celebrities to share directly in a way they never have before.<p>3. Stay engaged with minimal time. Tweets are limited to 140 characters for everyone. Writing a blog post requires a commitment and willpower. A tweet is extremely easy.<p>Despite all of this, Twitter itself is very awkward to use, and making sense of the un-threaded mass is very difficult. It's reaching mass adoption because it can be all things to all people (microblog, chat, rss feed, friend updates, broadcast announcements, etc).<p>There are better ways out there to facilitate good discussions. Google is trying to tackle the office collaboration problem with Wave, and I think there's huge progress to be made in the space of online discussions, separate from the current plethora of news reaction sites (<i>coughhackernewscough</i>) that we have now. The inevitable rise of self-posts on news sites (it's usually resisted or frowned on at first) shows the existence of this need.",1256597535

I know a guy making a few grand per month, but he's got 30-some sites going at any given time, and can spend as much as 15 hours per day, 6-7 days per week developing, ferreting out and posting content.  Like pmichaud, they seem to be niche sites, and if things aren't panning out with some topic, it gets abandoned.<p>While it's difficult to put a metric on thought work, I think, at least for myself, it's easier to put in my 40-something per week, do a little bit of weekend work in maintenance windows and on-call.  And I still make more than he does, plus have insurance for my family. But he's his own boss and loves it.

Yahoo and Facebook don't.<p>PHP is also not tuned to some fitness function; it tunes its users.  In exchange for not having to understand abstraction or OO, you get to learn the wierd quirks of thousands of inconsistently-named functions that live in a shared global environment.  Sure, the number of ""concepts"" you have to know is low (no closures, no MOP, no lexical scope, ...), but the number of inane details you have to know is high.  PHP shows that people would rather understand the exact details of arguments to a function instead of understanding abstraction and metaprogramming.  (Similarly, people like to cram for exams without really understand the subject matter.)<p>That is fine, but unless you are ""people in general"", you are missing out on a lot by ""choosing"" PHP.<p>(Deployment is always a big issue.  Do you really want to market your app to people that can't even run a package manager, ""cpan"" or equivalent, and so on?  I find Perl perfectly easy to deploy.  If I can't ""apt-get install"" the app, I type ""cpan AppName"", wait a while, and my app works.<p>Additionally, users that find deployment too hard unless it's ""untar this and click pictures"" are going to require a lot of support but aren't going to contribute a lot of code back to you.  So maybe this isn't the best optimization to make.<p>Finally, why not JSP for this?  Startup Tomcat, edit code in a web page, and boom, your ""app"" works.  It ain't pretty, but it's better than PHP.  Tomcat is no harder to setup than Apache + mod_php either.)",1256597002
