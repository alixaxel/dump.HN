Now I write them all from the iPhone on the plane.  2 or 3 large paragraphs are not a problem, once you get the hang of it.  That said, I don't think typing on the iPhone is for everyone.  I think UI programmers and programmers and engineers in general will tend to be better at it.  We know how to be ""nice"" to machines.",1254628098
859617,comment,859468,859468,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"It's not the scale, it's the reliability.<p>When I worked at Amazon.com we had a deeply-ingrained hatred for all of the SQL databases in our systems.  Now, we knew perfectly well how to scale them through partitioning and other means.  But making them highly available was another matter.  Replication and failover give you basic reliability, but it's very limited and inflexible compared to a real distributed datastore with master-master replication, partition tolerance, consensus and/or eventual consistency, or other availability-oriented features.<p>I think everyone is missing the boat by evaluating datastores in terms of scalability.  Even at Amazon's size, database scaling is only occasionally a problem.  By the time your site is that big, hopefully you've split your software into independent services, each with its own (relatively) small database.  And for the services that do need a distributed cache or persistence layer, there's now a huge body of literature and software that solves those problems.<p>Reliability is another matter.  Every business can benefit from improved reliability, regardless of size.  And reliability is harder.  Scaling is basically an engineering problem, which can be solved with the right architecture and algorithms.  Reliability is more like security: it's a weakest-link problem and requires constant vigilance in all areas, including engineering, testing, operations, and deployment.  Adding redundant components improves reliability against hardware failures (which are independent between hosts) but not software bugs (which typically are not).  Many of the comments on <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=859058"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=859058</a> are missing this point.<p>Anything that mitigates reliability problems has huge potential for saving costs and increasing value.  CouchDB, for example, doesn't even provide basic scaling features like automatic partitioning, but it does provide reliability features like distribution, replication, snapshots, record-level version history, and MVCC.  <i>That</i> is what makes it interesting and useful in my opinion.  Similarly, although people talk about Erlang as a concurrency-oriented language, it's really a reliability-oriented language.  The concurrency in Erlang/OTP is not designed for high-speed parallel computation.  Rather, it's one part of an overall strategy for reliability, a strategy which also includes the ability to update code in running processes, a standard distributed transactional database, and built-in process supervision trees.  (Steve Vinoski wrote something similar in his blog a while ago:  <a href=""http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2008/05/01/erlang-its-about-reliability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2008/05/01/erlang-its-about-re...</a>)",1254628098

Having a stored credit system which could then be used for Facebook gifts and purchases in apps would cause more than a 10% uptick in sales for app devs like Zynga, so Facebook could charge a relatively high processing fee like that and still be worth using. They don't even need to mandate exclusivity to do it.<p>They're working on it right now, and I've enough experience with ads to tell you they're never going to make Google money off of their self-serve stuff.

Nietzsche said that suicide thoughts are a wonderful comfort - they help us get through a lot of bad nights... and you know, today - right now, actually - it feels good to be such a coward.
It feels good to be incapable of taking my own life... no matter how stupid I am, no matter how fucked up everything and everyone is.

After dealing with OCD and social anxiety issues from 18 to 28, I finally started to open up and talk about these oddities that conflicted me to others.   What I learned is most people I talk to all dealt with something similar.  These were just random people I met at work, friends and family members.  I wish I talked about what conflicted me before I was 28, I would have been able to enjoy that 10 year span of my life more.<p>What I am saying is don't think you are alone, think you are crazy the one dealing with ocd, social anxieties, depression - the majority has been there and when you learn/realize that we are the same a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.  In other words talk talk talk about your problems, oddities (obessesive thoughts or actions), social anxieties and depressive thoughts until you are blue in the face.  If people are going to look down on you for being a depressive screw them, they are hiding behind their own wall of B.S. - no one is perfect and everyone has dealt with something from the above in various degrees before!<p>My condolences to Dan's family and friends.",1254626151
