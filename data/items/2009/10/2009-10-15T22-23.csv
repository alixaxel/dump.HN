884430,comment,883890,883890,0,0,thinksketch,,,"The funny thing about the 5 star rating system is that it's completely the wrong model for many situations in which it's used.  It originated from sites like slashdot where,  because everyone had to read the same front page of content, it made sense to pick the content democratically using a five star system.<p>But, systems like netflix that use the five star rating system have it all backwards!  Their goal should be to establish the niche genres that attract each user.  This goal has nothing to do with brute popularity.  Sure you want to assess how much someone likes a movie in order to steer them into the correct genre, but it doesn't make sense to attach an overall popularity rating to the movie.<p>Given a hugely diverse database such as the netflix movie library, it's ridiculous to assume that individuals will like things in proportion to the average popularity.  That's not how taste works.  And the weird thing is, there is no reason for these databases to constrain themselves to an averaged popularity index - they're just accustomed to the five star model is all.  They should be using a micro-genre mapping scheme that steers you towards clusters of movies that have received attention from users with similar taste.<p>Meanwhile, by constraining your rating to a discrete number of stars (1,2,3,4, or 5) they are killing the quality of their sample. (See the jellybean guessing experiment in the link below..)<p>These algorithms should ditch their discrete-value database of how much users say they like something, and instead use some continuous measure of how much attention is spent on each item.  Hell, some people love to watch crappy movies and write bad reviews for them.  Anyway, for more on this rant, see the link below.. cheers-<p><a href=""http://www.thinksketchdesign.com/2008/05/03/design/algorithm-design/does-the-netflix-challenge-have-it-backwards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinksketchdesign.com/2008/05/03/design/algorithm...</a>",1255647163

The shares had dropped to $0.01, when their true value was negative, given the stapled obligations that they carried.

Once the shares dropped below the value of the remaining obligations (give or take) a fairer price would be negative.

884404,comment,883857,884361,0,0,tjogin,,,"> I have nothing against software stores, but they should be optional not required.<p>I agree completely. My hope is that AppStore will become optional, rather than the exclusive way to get apps on the iPhone.<p>But I do think it was a wise decision to <i>start out</i> with the AppStore as the one exclusive way to get on it, and judging from their phenomenal success in both sales and attracting developers, it was probably a smart choice.<p>Lest not forget, the AppStore makes it extraordinarily easy to buy and download apps. Only by making it the <i>exclusive</i> way to get apps on the iPhone were they able to make sure that users found the experience of buying and downloading apps so effortless that it makes impulse purchases super simple. And, safe! iPhone users do not worry about anything on the AppStore containing viruses or malware.<p>Now, as what they refer to as a ""power user"", I'd like to be able to just download any app from anywhere and take my chances. But I understand that Apple has to take more than just <i>my</i> preferences into consideration. I believe it is actually <i>not</i> in their best interest to do that — even though it would suit <i>me</i> better. If I were Apple, I'd keep the AppStore the exclusive way to get apps on the AppStore. I'd work on continuously improving the experience and interaction with developers, of course, but I'd keep it a walled garden, approval process and all.<p>Pleasing power users such as you and me simply doesn't make sense in the big picture, because it would fracture the developer community. Some apps would be on the app store, some on the web. Users would feel safer getting apps from the AppStore, but as recommendations come from friends using apps from the web, soon enough you'd have regular users downloading apps from the web too. And following that you'd have viruses and malware. While users could still just stick to downloading from the AppStore if they wanted to be safe, Apple would still have to deal with malicious apps, problems and trust issues. This, they just don't need, and pleasing the relatively few power users just doesn't make any sense, considering the sacrifice.<p>Though <i>I'd</i> be just fine with it, I understand very well why Apple does not prioritize <i>my</i> needs in this.",1255645982
