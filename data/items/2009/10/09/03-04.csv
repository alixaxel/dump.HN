It granted them rather incredible rights to second editions with no involvement by the original author, several routes to making future versions of the book worth less or nothing for the original author, and a somewhat disappointing royalty rate and advance payment.  I wasn't finding them very flexible on those terms, either, and frankly, I didn't really want to work with anyone that, by default, considered me a cog in their machine.  Needless to say, I passed on that opportunity.<p>I can recommend No Starch Press, however.  Nice folks all around.
