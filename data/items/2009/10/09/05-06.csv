And of those even fewer are successful.<p>The only redeeming quality to the article is the mentioning of certain research in creative thinking:\n""Theory of Solving Inventor's Problems, the Blue Ocean Strategy, the Theory of Constraints, and in modern works in cognitive psychology.""<p>These may be interesting for people looking to expand their problem solving skills/creativity. But the article claims they are the snake oil to hi-tech startups.",1255067988

He still would have been humiliated and embarrassed if the guy had called BS on him in other ways, I think, which is probably what made the lesson stick.  He got cut down to size, and he knew he was wrong.<p>I think screaming can backfire, too.  I had a guy yelling and pounding his fists in a meeting the other week, and it reduced my opinion of him further.  (He wasn't angry with me nor the 10 or so other people present, who were looking at him like 'what a jerk').<p>If I want to spend time with someone who has temper tantrums, I'd much prefer the company of my daughter, who I don't see enough as it is.",1255067625

An astonishing number of out-of-print books are available used through Abebooks and Amazon. This ""unicorn"" canard is an intelligence-insulting flaw in what is otherwise a pretty good piece. He repeats it in another place too:<p><i>[Out-of-print books] are found only in a vanishing number of libraries and used book stores.</i><p>It's ironic, or rather disingenuous, that Brin would make this argument as if the internet didn't exist. The situation he describes is the one that book-hunters had to deal with <i>pre-web</i>.<p>Nevertheless, I think Google Books is, without any exaggeration, a great contribution to civilization. I was at Stanford when they first started advocating the project. It was widely regarded as a vain extravagance and/or futuristic pipe-dream. That they went ahead and got it done anyway is one of the things I most respect about Google, or more precisely Brin and Page, because as far as I can tell this was all them. It is an outstanding example of what visionary founders can do.",1255067114

Or a golfer who only plays at championships.<p>The key is (more than whether one works at home or not, which I think is a mistaken emphasis) is to be able to see  output so you can judge its quality. You could ask a musician auditioning for an orchestra to play a  few pieces or a juggler to actually juggle 5 clubs.  The problem is that there isn't a coding equivalent.<p>Most developers who code only at work can't show you any of the resultant code.
