882967,comment,882428,882956,0,0,DuncanIdaho,,,"Basically you're saying the same as me...<p>We do have SP in our company, we also have lots of other stuff - we use JIRA for issue tracking for example. I also spent quite some time evaluating Confluence. And what I figured out was that getting to integrate whole of our infrastructure and different existing document repositories (they're all over the place technologically and physically) would be way easier and more flexible using Atlassian suite.<p>That's because we work on so many different platforms (.Net, Domino, Java, Oracle, MSSQL,...). And since SP is very typical of MS software (great integration with anything MS - and other stuff does not exist) - for our situation an principal/technology agnostic system is much much better in the long run.<p>But as far as non-geeks go in monolythic MS stack companies - ofcourse SP is AWESOME :)",1255593434

AFAIK there are some solutions for most of them: MongoHQ, Couch.io and another one for Redis I can't recall.<p>You could also do it yourself. Basically anything that is also on EC2 shouldn't affect performance too bad.",1255593299

But being able to find the stuff you want is fun.<p>To a certain extent, this is somewhere where GUIs out-perform command lines - the hierarchical menu system that shows you the functionality available in a way that's fairly easily searchable.

882961,comment,882480,882701,0,0,whopa,,,"It still boils down to switching costs. If Google pulls shenanigans often enough, some users will notice, and they switch to Bing or some other search engine with very little effort. Google doesn't want to lose those users, so they have incentive to not be evil.<p>On the other hand, AT&T either has a physical monopoly or is part of a duopoly of broadband in many markets. If AT&T pulls shenanigans often enough, even if users do notice, they can't switch to some other provider easily. So AT&T can be evil, and people have to accept it, because there isn't much other choice.<p>If the capital costs of becoming a broadband provider were as low as being a search engine, regulation wouldn't be necessary. But since the landscape isn't competitive due to physical limitations, and AT&T has a history of being evil, regulation seems necessary.",1255592724
882960,comment,882428,882428,0,0,dankjaergaard,,,"I've been an SP user and was also involved in a few projects.<p>From a users perspective I see SP as no more than the ""My Documents"" folder moved to a browser. Sure, documents are now accessible to others, but SP does not solve the problem of explaining what the status of the document is. So you find someone else's doc, but you still may have to call or email to figure out if the doc was sent to customers, accepted, etc. As a document management platform, SP brings nothing new to the table.<p>Company functions like internal IT support, HR, etc. can easily setup simple workflows, and ticketing systems. In my opinion, this is the single best thing of SP and super valuable.<p>As a tech guy, I would never choose SP. First of all I find it too expensive, and second, the lock-in pitfalls of expensive upgrades and hours and hours of consulting to develop simple changes are just too risky (if it was my money).<p>So I agree with others in these comments, SP tries to do too much (and even more in the 2010 version), and the IE only thing just pisses me off.
(you can actually use other browsers, but I found that some of the config stuff can only be done in IE)",1255592702
882959,comment,882428,882428,0,0,snagage,,,"Sharepoint does a reasonable job at being a MS-centric document management system, providing team collaboration spaces and being a traditional intranet.<p>But for everything else that it claims to be is just a huge tease.<p>- It can be a CMS, but it's the worst, most inflexible, non-standard compliant one you can imagine.<p>- It can be a development platform for corporate applications. But unless you're doing something that is ultra-simple and very close to out-of-the-box, it's just not worth your time. Plus the whole development process is one big hack (need Windows server, SharePoint, IDE on the same machine, position every object manually, batch job here, keygen there, restart SP/IIS all over the place, etc)<p>- Business users are able to create small business apps and workflows - but they'll be a complete mess and everyone will become frustrated with the bugs, limitations and idiosyncrasies when using them.<p>- You can do workflows - but the out-of-the-box workflows suck, SPD workflows have way too many limitations and custom workflows are a big pain and alot of work.<p>- It is enterprise-y... but it has lots of non-enterprise ""features"". Deleting your workflow history after 3 months, updating everything single document with the latest datestamp when doing a service pack, broken import/export features.",1255592671

882950,comment,881802,882644,0,0,swombat,,,"Sure.<p>Wave is for solving the key problems with email in a corporate environment:<p>1) It's hard to track (will presumably offer an API or be trackable by widgets)<p>2) It's hard to use it to collaborate on a piece of text to be sent out to someone else or included in a document (which is what it's used for half the time...)<p>3) When adding new people, it's hard to ensure that they have a clear view of the beginning of the conversation - often they get a garbled, over-indented mess in reverse chronological order, that's hard to follow.<p>4) When adding new people, often they get dropped again if someone replies to all from the wrong email.<p>5) It's hard to keep multiple conversation branches going. If you're collaborating with 5 people (hardly extraordinary) on a 2-page document, and they each have 1 distinct comment, and each of these comments requires a brief exchange (back and forth 3 times, let's say) before it's sorted out, you'll end up with a fairly messy conversation once it's all flattened out.<p>6) It's hard to attach files (particularly large or numerous files). And when you add extra people to the conversation, they don't see those files anymore. If there were multiple files sent at different time, sending all of them to the new participant is a pain in the ass.<p>7) When discussing, say, a document, correcting even a small typo requires a full email instead of being able to just dive in and correct the typo.<p>There are no doubt more, but this is what I can come up with fresh out of bed.",1255592251

I guess one could use malloc() and free() if they really want to (since C headers can be imported).<p>The hello world example is confusing though.",1255592241

One by search ranking the other by latency/bandwidth.<p>It is a lot easier to change/create a search provider since there is nothing that has locked you in as such. But remember you are there because you find their walled garden useful.<p>However you don't have a choice if your packets are going to traverse AT&T. Also on some level creating a new search engine is a less costly task that rolling out new internet infrastructure. If AT&T shaping was opt-in and they didn't unfairly discriminate against those who haven't opted in ;) but that means you have to trust them to be benevolent.<p>They can do good with shaping, just like google does good with ranking.

Cool you discovered that xargs can do it - I didn't know that.<p>I have, however, done this before.  I have a ""load_wait"" command which waits for machine load to drop below a certain level before launching the command.  A simple ""sleep 1"" between instances of that then lets me launch thousands of commands without killing the machine.<p><pre><code>    sleep 1 ; load_wait 3 <command1> &
    sleep 1 ; load_wait 3 <command2> &
    sleep 1 ; load_wait 3 <command3> &
