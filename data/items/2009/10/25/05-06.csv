At worst, that's indicative of nothing, not affirmation of the negative hypothesis.<p>Think of it this way: if you are healthy, you are more likely to get the flu vaccine and less likely to die of any reason. If you are unhealthy, you are less likely to get the flu vaccine and more likely to die of any reason. Notice that neither of these statements say the following, ""Patients who receive the flu vaccine are [more/less] likely to die of the flu then they would have been."" Instead, it simply makes the statement that you cannot treat statistics as affirmation of flu effectiveness.",1256449870

901306,comment,901138,901253,0,0,btilly,,,"While it is in the long run interest of every inside trader for all other inside traders to restrain themselves, it is in their very direct personal interest to extract maximum value from their knowledge.  Furthermore it is difficult if not impossible to for anyone else to know that the inside trader was acting on inside information.  Therefore you can't get them to cooperate for their general good.<p>For much more on why groups fail to act in their self-interest I highly recommend <i>The Logic of Collective Action</i> by Mancur Olson.

Most good books on assembly language assume you use Windows or even DOS it seems.\n(3) One of the reviews says, ""you will get a good workout using the gdb debugger.""  Sounds like fun.",1256449166

901299,comment,901138,901255,0,0,btilly,,,"More problematic are the ""C"" traders.  People with access to inside information who therefore believe that they'll get news of things that will shift prices before anyone else.  These people are then able to take risks and time more aggressively, trusting that they'll be able to jump ship at need.  These people therefore avoid revealing inside information until the last possible moment.<p>But the real trouble is the ""D"" traders.  People with no access to inside information who have no interest in providing excess rents to traders A, B or C.  When this group of people gets the impressions that the real gains in stocks go to insiders, and outsiders get the shaft, they stay away in droves.  In fact the desire to encourage this group to invest is one of the primary reasons for the insider trading laws in the first place.",1256448770

His talk acknowledged that right off the bat, stayed true to that philosophy, and still managed to impart lots of wisdom (some implicitly)... while being very engaging. (Humor is underrated.)<p>Thanks Paul, and thanks to all the other speakers as well!

901286,story,,,1,0,dstorrs,"Real Time Web Considered Harmful...Or Not",,"Earlier today, TechCrunch posted (http://tinyurl.com/yh6kzqx) an article about how ""the real time web"" is a bad thing because people are constantly posting photos and tweeting about where they are  / what they're doing instead of actually being in the moment.  Examples:  photo-blogging from a concert (instead of enjoying the show), tweeting at a conference (instead of learning something), or tweeting in the jury box at a trial (no, that's not a joke).<p>Now, the point that the author is making is that this is a transformative phenomenon--this is the early wave of the future, and there is no stopping it. The whole tone is mournful and surprised:  ""oh, look at this horrible thing I've discovered.""  Throughout it, I kept thinking ""why is this a problem?  Just put your phone down.""  It left me with a feeling of cognitive dissonance because I have not the slightest interest in real-time blogging and don't understand the appeal.<p>So here are the scenarios I see:<p>1) I'm an outsider.  This is a real phenomenon, this is the direction that the future is going, but by virtue of age (38), location (NYC), friends group, or whatever, I don't happen to be part of the group that is already inside the shaded area.<p>2) I'm an outlier.  This is a real phenomenon and I <i>am</i> in the shaded-area demographic, but I personally am a statistical abnormality.<p>3) This is NOT a real phenomenon, it's a fad followed mostly by teenagers and a small percentage of compulsively hypertasking adults.  Most of the teenagers who are doing it now will stop doing it as they get older.<p>What does Hacker News think?",1256447306
