What we've seen from events like #iranelection is that twitter is a good (but could be great) tool for detecting news at the onset of events (before big stations pick up on it), but really starts to get bogged down with ""spam"" or RT's once a topic gets picked up.

The super short version:  I have done something that is supposed to be ""impossible"", so I fairly often get personally attacked for trying to share information with other people with the intention of helping them.<p>In some ways, I'm ""sensitive"".  Yes, I'm ""sensitive"" in terms of ""not liking getting attacked"", but I think the other side of it is I am just very aware of even relatively small things that are actually a form of hostility that most people wouldn't notice.  On the one hand, this is often a subjectively very un-fun awareness. On the other hand, it has allowed me to accomplish something most people couldn't accomplish, and that is making it possible to discuss new ideas that most people can't effectively introduce.  This turns me into the lightening rod for such controversies, I think in part because it's clear to a lot of people that if they can shut ME up, they can close the uncomfortable topic altogether.  But I think another part of it is that publicly it gives the appearance that I am the <i>cause</i> of the whole thing rather than that I open the door for latent demand/interest which has been suppressed.<p>This is relevant to my goals as far as websites and such because the only way there will be an audience is if it becomes possible to have such conversations.  Otherwise, I am merely the Lunatic Fringe and all too easy to ignore.<p>Any thoughts?",1256604064

904443,comment,904018,904018,0,0,adriand,,,"When I was first learning Ruby on Rails as a proficient PHP programmer, the company I worked for landed a largish (for us at the time, given there were only two programmers in the place back then) contract for a web application.  Since I was just learning Rails, and I needed to be highly productive on the project, I recommended that we use CakePHP so I could use my PHP skills.  I figured my co-programmer, who loved Rails, would acquiesce due to the presence (at least) of an MVC framework, and I was right.<p>I've regretted that decision many times.  Not all MVC frameworks are created equal, and I can say from painful experience that Rails is far superior to CakePHP.  We got the job done, and I may have been right that I was more productive in PHP back then than I was in Ruby.  But three years later, it is far more difficult to get things done on this web app than if it were built on Rails.<p>I'm not one to engage in language wars, and I still enjoy coding in PHP.  But if you want a great framework, I'm still not sure you can beat Rails, and I really don't think there's anything in the PHP world that can.",1256602224

That comment is almost something I'd expect more readily from Apple than Microsoft these days, given how Apple manages the iPhone/iTunes platform (disclosure, I have an iPhone and can't remember life as worth living before it).<p>What I find fascinating about the carriers clamouring to move to Android is that, yes, they're avoiding licensing fees and the cost of building their own solutions . . . but at the cost of basically eliminating all other mobile revenues other than bandwidth.<p>This revenue destruction will be at the hands of Google themselves and via the open nature of the Android marketplace. Google Voice kills SMS revenues today. It's free. I expect Voice to eventually include Skype-like functionality, but if it doesn't, Skype will do. It's as close to free as it needs to be. No cost for Skype to Skype calls, and 2 cents a minute to most of planet earth's landlines.<p>Throw in all of Google's other services that are enabled out of the box on Android (read: almost all of them) and the carrier is out of the services business altogether and is nothing but a pipe. Which is what they should be.<p>It's almost as if the carriers are collectively waving the white flag here (can't compete on applications and services), and since actually makes sense it leaves me wondering what the hell I'm missing?",1256601626
