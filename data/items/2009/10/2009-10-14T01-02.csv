However, that box will cost much, <i>much</i> more than 16 boxes with 64GB each. Those 16 boxes will also have more CPU, network cards, and aggregate bandwidth to RAM than the terabox. The big honkin' box full of RAM is in most respects an unbalanced system; you can do a lot more with a lot less money if it's acceptable to give up on the single-system image programming model.",1255485531

880495,comment,879705,879705,0,0,grellas,,,"This is very helpful information for entrepreneurs, and I commend the poster for his courage, but I think it is highly risky from a legal standpoint.<p>The use of phrases such as ""bogus forums"" can readily be attacked, and (in my long experience in the law) it is precisely those who are most unscrupulous who are quickest to seize on technical points to try to bludgeon you in the courts. Does ""bogus"" connote fraudulent? Is there nothing at all of value that is being offered? Maybe not. But using this type of phrase puts the one who is otherwise exposing questionable practices in the position of potentially having to prove that the forums are <i>nothing but</i> frauds, which might be hard to prove.<p>Yes, free speech is involved but an attack on someone's manner of making a living sets one up for ""libel per se"" charges, which can be tough to fight. With the web as the forum, the claimant can also shop forums to find the most sympathetic court available.<p>I have fought fights like this before, and I know what they involve. They need to be fought in a way that is <i>effective</i> and not merely righteous. The latter is not bad but can be undermined if you give your opponent gratuitous ammunition with which to attack. It is my belief that the same fight can be waged at a slightly more philosophical level and remain completely effective. Therefore, the risks being taken by naming specific parties and using phrases such as ""bogus forums"" will only serve to weaken an otherwise compelling position being advanced by a strong proponent of a good cause.<p>At this point, whatever has been done has been done and the fight will proceed legally at the level just described. It will take a lot to fend off the vicious attacks to come. I wish the author well in his endeavor. He is on to something and I hope he can handle it effectively. The entrepreneurial community will certainly benefit from his efforts.",1255485476

Ever since I read that soccer (English football) players who are known for 'heading' the ball have a substantially lower IQ than others, I've been uneasy about my football experience.  Weren't my blows to head far harder than heading a soccer ball?  Had I reduced my IQ permanently?  This article, though... it suggests things are much worse than I thought.

880484,comment,880434,880434,0,0,mrshoe,,,"I must say that this article kind of turns me off to iPhone development. They made a <i>huge</i> marketing push for that app. Somehow they got press coverage all over the web. They ran a laptop giveaway for people who retweeted the launch. Their website and blog had great marketing materials. It seemed like everyone clued into the web heard about Convert the day it came out. This all resulted in a big spike that quickly died off after earning them about $100k. Now that the app is about to drop off the Top 100 list and they're going to raise the price, I imagine that sales will plummet even further.<p>People in the comments mostly say things like ""to be honest I don’t use it that much"" and ""I originally purchased convert to support great app design"".<p>It really paints a picture of the App Store being about gimmicks or quick hits that grab a bunch of attention long enough to rake in some cash before they fade into the past and out of our collective memory.<p>I'd like to build something more lasting.

The yui3 and sproutcore frameworks are pretty close to opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of philosophy, but both have very well defined processes for dealing with events. The two frameworks you mention are fine for adding ""ajax"" to a more or less working server based app but they aren't so hot for building a complete app. FWIW, MochiKit's Signal framework is also nice (though the codebase is now fallow) and Dojo's system has a sort of nifty aop feel, but dojo is kind of hairy in that there are a lot more chefs in the kitchen there.",1255484170

880477,comment,880026,880026,0,0,joez,,,"I agree with most of the things that have been said on the thread so far. Especially listening. Here's a little more of classic salesman strategy and something to practice. Give them two choices that work for you.<p>Example: When they say now is not a good time. Instead of asking, ""Would next week be a good time to discuss how we can help?"" Ask, ""What would be a better time to discuss how we can help? Wednesday or Friday?"" This way, instead of a response of ""No, I can't."" You'll get an appointment.<p>I hated being a salesman but that was probably the one rule I learned and actually kept. Always be closing. (someone had to say it)<p>Another thing I think you should try is up-selling your current customers. Contact some customers that you've had interaction with (maybe exceptional customer service) and see if you can get them to sell one of their peers on your service and provide both of them a discount.",1255484047

Likewise, many jobs that actually are offshored end up creating a huge mess that requires more domestic workers to clean up.<p>In short, whether a job is offshoreable depends not so much on the job itself, but on management, the available talent, culture, and a whole slew of so many other dynamic factors that any kind of study pinning the notion down to a few indicators is destined to be meaningless.<p>We'd learn a lot more by studying specific factors that lead to offshoreability rather than just assuming a bunch of them and trying to draw big numeric conclusions.",1255483913

That is called being optimistic.<p>Consider this scenario: ""Lucky"" person A notices a Nigerian 411 scam, and decides to do it, not knowing it was a scam, while ""unlucky"" person B does not know that those are scams as well, but did not notice it anyway because ""unlucky"" people are less perceptive.<p>Who is truly the lucky one now?
