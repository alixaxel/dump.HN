Extract keystream directly if the plaintext is known. Forge any arbitrary MAC. Game over.<p>CBC: Make sure not to leak any information about the difference between padding failure and MAC failure or else you have a padding oracle which can do many magical things, including possibly forge an arbitrary MAC.<p>Building a secure MAC construction in the way you've described is harder than it looks, mainly because symmetric ciphers themselves are unsafe to use without authentication.",1256849682

 a) It's a database.
 b) It's fast.
 c) It forces you to use decent architecture.<p>a) Some types of data are stored only in memcached. For example user http sessions. There are also some other information that are stored only-in-memcached, like statistics. If memcached goes down, nobody will cry.  Is it the same as normal database on HDD? No. It's because records are automatically dropped after a timeout. Can you emulate this behaviour in normal DB? Yes. By periodically going through DB and removing old sessions.<p>b) It's really fast. You can forget about optimizing your SQL queries, you can forget about slow ORM mappings. It takes a lot of pain from you.<p>c) Memcached nodes doesn't grow - you can't just add more ram, you have to kill machine and destroy memcached instance before. So you have to use reasonable architecture - shared nothing on the backend side, and consistent hashing on memcached side. When a programmer understands that data shouldn't be handled on one DB box, but should be partition on many memcached nodes - it changes the way of thinking. It's a big switch, like between desktop applications - with db tied to specific app, and cloud - with db that belongs to other parts of infrastructure.",1256848065

It wasn't just some small incompatible change to HTML syntax.<p>I don't see what it buys us to go back to an HTML specific syntax, but it could have very broad ramifications. XML may have been overused, but if the W3C cannot make it work for marking up web pages then XML is dead.<p>Removing XML from the data integration world and going back to building parsers for every shitty DSL idea that in-house developers come up with is going to cost the world economy dearly.<p>Some of that money is going to end up on my bank account, so I'm seriously ambivalent about lambasting this historical mistake.",1256846879
