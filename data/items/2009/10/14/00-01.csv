Also expect to not get a sale or meeting most of the time on these types of things as people have a different agenda than you and are overly busy.<p>Don't sell features, sell solutions to problems. They will only buy something if they have a problem that your solution fills.<p>Good luck!<p>As an aside, how did the marketing guy get hired? Was it a consensus or a unilateral decision? Either way if the guy is not bringing enough to the table you need to measure the persons performance and hold them accountable. This is not being a bad guy, it is simply holding them to the same standards that you are held to. If you shipped out a product full of bugs or were late on every milestone your partner would hold you accountable so you should not feel bad about doing the reciprocal.",1255481665

880437,comment,879867,879867,0,0,akkartik,,,"It's more nuanced than whether you release early or late. I've noticed a lot of startups that release early because ""well, that's what you're supposed to do,"" but then the feedback comes in and they're ill-equipped to deal with it.<p>Release early when you can release often, but not earlier. Often this requires some meta-thinking about the space your app is in, the alternatives you may need to switch to, and how easily you can turn on a dime. Good design, in other words.<p>Another thing you can benefit from is good infrastructure and processes for listening to users. As an extreme but perhaps strawman example, in some consumer-web spaces there's little point in releasing an app without being able to A/B test. Build that capability in before you launch.<p>""Release early, release often"" helps evoke the right mindset around launching: save your A game for the time after launch, not the weeks before. Don't build up the launch. Don't set a deadline, round up the press, create an embargo, and work unsustainably late hours to meet the deadline. That way you'll be tired when launch happens. You'll have a celebration, folks will ease up for a day or week, some will even take vacation, until eventually someone notices that <i>nothing happened</i>. Instead, focus on the process. Be blase early on: ""This ol' thang, yeah we develop in public, and release all the time."" You aren't done when you launch, you're just getting started. Ramp up the velocity after you start getting noticed, because now you have less room for manoeuvre.<p>Whatever you do, don't focus on the first half of ""Release early, release often,"" and ignore the second.",1255481546

880392,comment,880242,880242,0,0,Perceval,,,"While I'm certain that the software works, it's obvious that it can only work to a limited extent.  It has probably been fed a seed sample of past hits from which a set of general inferences have been inductively extrapolated.  It then applies those inferred rules to score new songs fed into the algorithm.  Nothing especially exciting about that.<p>Where it will always fail is in assessing 'novelty.'  By definition, something that is novel is unexpected, new, innovated, or otherwise disruptive to our established norms.  An algorithm based on norming songs to a generalized set of standards will, by definition, never understand the appeal of something novel.<p>Now, 99% of novel things are probably going to be bad.  This doesn't set them apart from the 99% of derivative things that are also bad.  But the 1% novel hits will be overlooked, missed, denied, or remixed if this algorithm is given actual decision-making weight.  Just like teaching-to-the-test is frowned upon, production-for-the-algorithm will become the new conformity-inducing straightjacket for human creativity.<p>Finally, it's unclear what assumptions the algorithm creators are operating on, given that public tastes change over time.  Are they operating solely in the pop music era created during the 1960s through to the present?  Are they taking an even more restricted data set of pop music since the advent of the synth?  How many genres of music do they include in their seed, and are the inferences drawn from them generalizable across genres?  Across cultures to the pop charts of other countries?<p>Hopefully this type of algorithmic norming is less disastrous to the recording-promotion-distribution industry than it was to finance industry...",1255478835

I've pondered what some sharp hacker type might do given that text and some time to grok on a bot.<p>I think the one result most applicable in this scenario is the section with jam or fold tables based on hand and stacksize.  Basically, they show that there are completely defined hand ranges when you should jam or fold when stacked at a certain number of BB at no-limit.<p>I've pondered doing a neural network, but for limit rather than no-limit.
