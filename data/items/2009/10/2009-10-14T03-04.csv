If I remember it right, he said that the initial dropbox.com owner was just some random dude who was planning on starting some sort of venture related to dropboxes, hadn't done it yet, but didn't want to sell. My impression was that he got the domain some time before Dropbox launched, and at least initially, he wasn't doing anything particularly irritating other than letting a short domain name languish (not that bad, in the big picture).<p>From the PDF in the link, it sounds like the original owner then transferred the domain to a third party, who then ran ads for Dropbox's competitors, leading to the legal wrangling.",1255492484

The author suggests ""You can draw a straight line: The faster they added fees, the more their revenue fell."" While it may be true for the worst performing carriers, this trend doesn't hold with the ""least bad carriers"" (Alaska fell faster than AirTran but added fees later, Southwest fell faster than JetBlue, but doesn't have fees).
While I do see the point the author is trying to make, and it may very well be valid, I'm not prepared to reach the conclusion ""The faster airlines add fees for basic services like checked bags, the faster their total revenue declines."", the data he provided just doesn't show that.

An official spokesman for iRobot attributed the nightmares to high stress and said that the affected researchers were recovering on vacation. Requests to contact the researchers were rebuffed and their current location is unknown. When approached for an interview, the project director gave only the cryptic statement, ""Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!""<p>No firm date has been set for commercial release of products using this technology, a spokesman giving only a figurative release date of ""when the stars are right"". However, he assured us, that it would ""definitely be... soon.""",1255489711

I tend to work on team projects, not open source, and we tend to collaborate quite frequently, making frequent commits. It seems like many of the advantages of DVCS are being able to achieve private branches without using the server. I kind of like having the copy on the server.<p>I like the idea of local history, and the implementation in RubyMine is pretty spectacular.  Just adding that feature into Subversion would probably keep me off of DVCS for a while longer.",1255489682

Open source repos used to be such awful places: most of them seemed like little better than just hitting a directory listing for a web page. Github truly took most of the power of dvcs and made it accessible through the web. I <i>want</i> to fork things and try out a quick change because its just so easy. This is of course thanks to git as its underpinnings -- again, they are inseparable in my mind.<p>Also, we used to use SVK to do the stuff git has built in, for that alone I would never switch back.",1255489661
