There are some but they're in the minority, especially if we're talking about a company that can employ a lot of people.<p>The whole employer-employee relationship has inherent friction due to pay. This affects trust and loyalty. It is an employee's responsibility to ensure they maximise their earnings for the skills they have and it is the company's responsibility to keep outgoings low. Such a scenario will always breed suspicion if the working relationship is not sweet and parties do not spell out their long-term expectations.",1255723154

886057,comment,885656,885752,0,0,gwern,,,"> Thing thing I've come to realize is that it must be an integrated system that is automatically indexed and searchable, tagged by date, time, location as well as having speech recognition and face detection in order to be truly as useful as it should be.<p>Absolutely. But do we need those systems to exist <i>before</i> we start life-logging? As long as the data is available, we can always go back and then index. As it is, it looks like the recording capability will be there long before the software is polished to perfection. If people wait until the software is perfect, then every day they wait is a day they'll never be able to put into the database.<p>> I also think there should be a 30 second rolling frame buffer so that you can hit 'record' and capture five minutes of full-motion video starting 30 second earlier so that you can fully capture important conversations and the like.<p>Short-term optimization. The real goal is just default full-motion video; collect everything. The long-term storage space is essentially here already: you can right now buy 1.5TB for ~100$ (see <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152175"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152...</a> ). The problem is on the collection end - I mean, a fish-eye camera with 1gb for $800? How much is a 16gb flash drive these days, 30$?<p>Instead of hacking around the limits, let's just do the right thing: a small video camera hooked up to a couple dozen gigabytes of Flash.<p>How much? Well, I've heard that a minute of H.264 480 x 272 is about 3.5mb, let's call it 4mb. Recording sleep is useless, so 4 * 60 * 16 = 3840; 3.8 gigs per day means that even a basic flash drive would suffice for multiple days of video, and that we fill up our 100$ 1500mb hard-drive in ~394 days, or more than a year.<p>(I keep wondering: is it really that difficult to have a small video camera, that all these researchers keep using still cameras? Why don't we have easy life-logging <i>now</i>? As you say, all of the tech exists.)",1255723079

I think any attempt to replace elisp with scheme will have to start with a bang to overcome network effects. The hypothetical nonprofit would wait until they had enough money to do so, and then start development.
(They could hold the money and any interest in an escrow account to reassure donors.)<p>Personally, I hate dynamic scoping and having 2 namespaces. Also, whenever I see a piece of emacs is written in C I think it's best to just use the C function as written and not even try to understand it. Having scheme all the way down would dramatically lower the psychological barrier to fiddling with low-level functions like font-rendering. (i.e. I don't think it would have taken till version 23 to get anti-aliased fonts if it was scheme all the way down)<p>What do you all think? Bad idea? Good idea?

Also don't forget that modern C compilers are very good in optimizing for speed AND size, if you see the generated assembly from the compile job there is hardly to none optimizing to be done by assembly specialists.<p>Down side of C is that every little algorithm or pattern needs to be made from scratch as there is almost none functionality in the language itself. What people see as C is most often the nowadays immense library of solutions.
Upside is it's proven flexibility, C can do almost anything and is to be found on every platform out there.<p>Lisp is mainly about a certain functionality, that is list processing, so you are comparing a general purpose language with a specialist one.

I actually curate Burstoid as a side not-for-profit project. I did attribute it to the source swiss-miss.com where I saw it earlier today in my feed reader. Never saw the original site, because she didn't link to it -- it looks as if she was pointed to it via Twitter. Regardless, it's a neat letter and I'm glad someone submitted it to Hacker News for all to see.",1255720734

Yes, real world is more complicated, but what the article gives is a  pertinent explanation to a certain case. When we have enough such ""certain cases"" completely understood we go to combining them, and then we have something useful. If you always work with the real world case you may get quicker results, but it will be statistics, not science.",1255720730

That's exactly the way I do it.  In my C++ career I've only overloaded math operators for math types, * and -> for smart pointers, [] for container-like types, and () for callable objects.  At least in production code... I did some crazy and irresponsible things in college, just like everyone else.<p>If there's one point I've been wanting to make over and over again in this discussion, it's that misuse of language features is a much smaller problem than people think.  (In practice, it is even negligible next to the overhead of reading poor error messages from the STL.)  C++ is a very bad programming language for people who fear their coworkers, but so are C, Ruby, and any Lisp with macros.  Even Java isn't protection against stupidity:  a bad Java programmer on your team can't confuse you, but he can bury you.<p>Just think of defmacro as implicitly adding an infinite number of infinitely complex language features to Lisp.  If you can deal with defmacro in a responsible way, operator overloading shouldn't bother you at all.",1255720184
885979,comment,884199,885400,0,0,jeremymcanally,,,"Well, sure.  You <i>can</i> write code like that, but that doesn't mean you should.  I'm not arguing for so-called ""poetic mode"" code (I hate it actually), but I think languages like Ruby and Python strike a really solid balance between lack of line noise and clarity if you follow what one might call normal coding conventions established by the community.  Of course, these aren't canonized for the most part, so it's hard to know exactly what they mean, but I think everyone can agree that ""x = foo bar, baz"" should be clarified to ""x = foo(bar, baz),"" if nothing else because it will eliminate any parser confusion if you add a predicate conditional or something like that.<p>Anyhow, my point is that I can write C or Java or whatever else that's just as unreadable due to its lack of clarity, but that doesn't mean I will.  It's a skill issue more than a language issue. ;)",1255720163

885971,comment,885482,885907,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Recently, I went from Ruby on Rails web programming to C++ w/Qt GUI programming. Using the C++ features that I choose, C++ is actually pretty fast to develop on... (I did MFC years ago and that was nasty but Rails internal code is also awful, with fifty-million separate classes just for exceptions).<p>Aside from C compatibility, C++ also allows one to create simple structures and procedures when such simple beasts are appropriate.<p>I currently suspect one should have either ""full"" object orientation plus weak typing OR weak object orientation plus strong typing. Strong typing plus full OO = Bondage and Discipline language, where <i>the size of the code itself</i> starts to really drag your development and debugging time down.<p>While Ruby or Python allows compact but slow code, Java and C#, among other excesses, force one to create a full class for every two-field data-structure. Thus C++ is more compact than C# and Java and faster than Python and Ruby, winning for race for a desktop application language (oddly enough, desktop apps need a fast language because they must compensate for desktop windowing systems being more bloated and users expect more from their machine each).<p>I'm sure Haskell or Lisp are excellent for some things but I don't think their paradigm is very compatible with GUI programming - I'd be interested if someone has a counter-example.",1255719657
