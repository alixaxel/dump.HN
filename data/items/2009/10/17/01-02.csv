886513,comment,885918,886494,0,0,jeromec,,,"> Except that if oil is priced in dollars and you have a dollar printing factory then oil is effectively free to you.<p>That's <i>not exactly</i> how it works (although that edge helps keep our oil cheap). The more money that is in circulation (printed) the less value to each person that holds it. Imagine a game of Monopoly where everybody had as much money as the Bank; nobody would have much spending power. When this happens in the real world, such as the 90's in Argentina, in Zimbabwe, and elsewhere throughout history, it's called hyperinflation. The U.S. has uniquely been able to get away with excessive printing because of the dollar hegemony, a good credit rating - ""backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. governement"" - from having a stable government, and dominating the world economy. But we're not invincible... even Rome fell.",1255744655

It's obvious how it saves time - the more you answer emails, the more people reply. So you end up sending three times as much email each day as you would have if you only answered twice a day.

Changing system themes, even on a rooted phone, requires downloading an image specific to the ROM you're running, and flashing that over top of your current ROM.  Changing to another theme, or reverting to the standard theme, requires re-flashing your phone every time.<p>That said, I would love to see installable themes where the user can download/select/apply multiple themes on the fly without flashing/rebooting their phone, but at the moment, I think it's a result of Android taking the simple/efficient route for implementation.",1255744109

I actually feel like an absent-minded professor!<p>I can't really figure out why I've started doing this or quite how to stop it; it feels a bit like those Choose Your Own Adventure books where I used to skip ahead to see if certain choices would end up with death, end up with about ten branching paths (I couldn't mark any more than ten pages with fingers!), then collapse the paths one by one.

Working to no schedule would be <i>brilliant</i> if I could pull it off, but I worry that as a mix of coder and pointy haired suited type, my conflicting need to fit in with the rest of the world's ""let's meet in two weeks' time at 3pm"" and desire to have things just happen will lead to frustration rather than fulfillment.<p>Only doing things that both your head and heart say yes to - yes. Once I started doing this and followed a piece of advice passed down by a fellow entrepreneur - ""You don't <i>have</i> to do anything"" - my load felt so much lighter. Why was I wasting time? God knows.<p>The phone/voicemail checking doesn't really for me, though (whether that's a UK thing or not I don't know). I tend to do this automatically for unknown numbers since I get plenty of calls I don't need to take; I also forget my phone far too often.

Fortunately there's a solution that's complimentary to the ""no background processes"" restriction that I'm <i>sure</i> some cretins at Apple have at least mocked up, if not implemented:<p>They just need to expose specific interfaces to launchd (Apple's clever init/rc/cron/xinet replacement), for doing particular kinds of local notifications. An app could register (with user confirmation) that it wants to have a limited helper run when an event has occurred: cron-style schedules, at-style timers, ""Moved more than X meters"", ""Am near X:Y"", etc. The registrations would be managed just like with the current push notifications.<p>With that, there'd be only a few other APIs needed to absolve the want for background processes. The ability to enqueue HTTP requests would make quite a number of apps friendlier to multitasking, and its already implemented privately in MobileSafari.
