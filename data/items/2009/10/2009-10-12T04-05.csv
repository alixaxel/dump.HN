876050,comment,874902,875699,0,0,evgen,,,"> If you abolished the LAUSD or NY's and made school districts for every area with 10,000 ± x students you could replace the vast majority of the bureaucracy with volunteer labour, otherwise known as busybody parents.<p>This only works when parents have the available free time and resources to replace these administrators with their free time.  The problem with this is that parents with available free time and the motivation to donate to their child's school is very unevenly distributed.  You are also going to end up duplicating a lot of administration bureaucracy across these smaller districts and losing a lot of efficiencies that can be gained from centralization.  Centralization has its own costs, but sometimes these costs are not as large as the cost of a lot of duplicated effort.",1255323530

</code></pre>
And x = false, then y is never evaluated. Not quite the same, but it's a case where you can optimize out the evaluation of something because it's result will be discarded anyway.<p>The last part of your explanation still has me going around about what makes the decision to discard, it can't be the function itself, so it has to be some criterion outside the function causing that. For instance, maybe if work is no longer done, or if some arbitrary precision level has been reached.<p>Interesting stuff this!<p>In 'pure' functional programming you'd not have an 'if' statement to make the decision with, or is that allowed to be used to end recursion ? I just can't see that working using functions alone.",1255323437

876036,comment,875509,875681,0,0,colanderman,,,"I wouldn't think evolution has anything to do with it.  Quite simply, the face with lower contrast is perceived to be <i>flatter</i>.  (The reason is purely geometric -- a curvier surface contains a wider range of angles-of-incidence with respect to the lighting source, thus resulting in a higher-contrast image.)<p>By placing the two images next to each other, our brain assumes that they are illuminated by the same lighting source, immediately tags one as ""round"" and one as ""flat"".  Women, by the very nature of having ""higher cheekbones"" (and typically more facial fat), have rounder cheeks.  Thus, if the brain tries to tag the two images as different sexes, it's much more likely to tag the higher-contrast (rounder-looking) face as female and the lower-contrast (flatter-looking) face as male.<p>Helping (hurting?) the situation is also the fact that the black level of the eyebrows was not kept constant when adjusting the contrast, thus causing them to lighten and look thinner in the higher-contrast image.  Women tend to have thinner eyebrows (at least in modern society, due to the fashion trend of eyebrow plucking), no doubt lending weight to the brain's decision.<p>As to why women have higher cheekbones and more facial fat, well that question I'll have to defer to an evolutionary biologist :)",1255322879

And so on.<p>However, neither call-by-need (lazy) nor call-by-name evaluation strategies require evaluating an argument before applying some operator to it.

If nobody deems your content worth aggregating to HN, maybe it isn't? People who read HN trust it the same way I imagine people who have read the NY Times or National Geographic their whole life trust it.<p>When the web first started appearing as a news and editorial destination, it seems that people were quick to proclaim the death of curated content, because with infinite space and no need for physical resources, the constraints of binding your words together in 80 stapled pages of dead tree were history -- everything can just link to everything else, and when that fails, search! Turns out that the problem was never that a magazine could only be so many pages long, but that people only have so much time to be bothered with content they want to see.<p>Online the content and the editorial dept don't need to share a building -- in some cases its probably still better if they do, and in others its probably better that they're se separate as possible. I don't think there's any less value on content, or on editorial curation of what content gets in front of people. Sites like HN, Digg, Amazon and Hulu are popular destinations because they offer tailored and curated gateways to content people want. The curators have always been the bosses of the content creators, but now that they don't have to live under the same roof -- now that anyone can curate anyone else's content, as long as their curation/editorial skills are deemed good enough by the public to get them enough readers/viewers -- the balance of power has gone a bit wacky.<p>When Hulu's CEO called the TV networks ""content providers"" in that well-linked blog post a little whie back, few people batted an eye, but that was a huge slap in the face to those guys. If you're <i>just</i> the content provider, that means, on the org chart of the consumable content world, that Hulu is your boss -- they're your editor, your publisher, curating your content and choosing what lives and what dies. Hulu is supposed to be their dorky portal for cheapskate college students and bored secretaries! Why are they calling the shots now??<p>It's tiring to see people like Murdoch bellowing at top volume about their content being stolen when the content is the one thing people are still clamoring to consume by any means necessary.

You think China doesn’t run on greed? What is greed? Of course none of us are greedy. It’s only the other fella that’s greedy. The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The greatest achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn’t construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn’t revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty that you are talking about, the only cases in recorded history are where they have had capitalism and largely free trade.

Under normal conditions the windmill would be close to 60% of the power required for the house, the rest was solar.<p>We did just about everything we could to conserve power though, one of the lessons you learn fastest when working with renewables is that it is a lot easier to save a Watt than to generate one.<p>The machine was a 16'er, or about 5 Meters, so a swept surface of 18 square meters or thereabouts, it cost a small fortune to build because I was planning to make it in larger numbers. Designed power was about 2.5 KW, it came out a bit less than that, mostly due to a slightly larger air-gap than what I had planned on (the plasma cutter nozzle used to cut the stator laminates was wearing down, and cutting with a slightly larger diameter jet than planned).<p>The design is far from perfect but for a first try at a variable pitch machine it worked pretty good. It survived several major storms without failure, we only took it down because we emigrated back to Europe. It's laying in pieces on the garage floor waiting for better times.<p>edit: the only way to get 100% of the power for your house from the wind would be if you would consent to being without power every now and then. After all , the wind only blows so much, and when it doesn't you'll need to have either enough power stored up in batteries or you'd have to have an alternative source.<p>What people do to get to the economical equivalent without using batteries is if their grid operator allows it do something called 'net-metering', this allows you to pump your excess power into the grid and back out again when you need it for the same price.<p>The whole uncoupling of network and electricity production is seen by plenty of people in the renewable energy scene as a way of discouraging net-metering, after all, if the 'base' rate per KWh is already quite a bit just for transport then they can afford to give you a crappy price for your excess power, and charge you <i>twice</i> for the storage and retrieval of the power.",1255320513

Well obviously not.  But I can imagine a bureaucracy that is so minuscule that it is practically invisible.  Not only can I imagine it, but I can point out that Catholic schools manage to devote less than 1% of resources to administration, yet have better outcomes than public schools with comparable populations.<p>By contrast the figure I saw quoted a couple of decades ago ago is that New York City had more school administrators than France, and New York State had more than the whole European Union.
