949561,comment,949449,949496,0,0,potatolicious,,,"The main problem here IMHO is that, like other in-text ad providers, there is no separation between real links and ad links. As a content producer this means I really can't use inline text links ever again - it will just cause confusion and frustration for my users. For consumers it's the loss of a valuable and oft-used feature.<p>Have you considered an icon like what Wikipedia uses to mark external links? It would go a <i>long</i> way to establish user trust if ad links were clearly labeled as such (without having to find out after mousing over) - different color, iconography... something.<p><i>""We're okay with Google scanning our personal emails to serve relevant ads on Gmail""</i><p>Because Google doesn't <i>mix</i> ads in with our email text. The ads stay in a limited area of the screen where they are <i>clearly</i> marked as ads, and never stray. There's no chance that I'll get sold flowers or exercise equipment when I read my email.<p>People are against this in the same way they are against product placement in movies - it reeks of dishonesty, and compromises the authenticity and integrity of the content in which it was inserted. To be honest, I do not believe you have done anything (that we can see from this demo) to significantly improve on this. You've made a somewhat less scummy implementation, but you have not fixed the broken model underneath.<p>Sometimes I wonder what's so insufficient about Google's format: well-targeted ads, relevant to the contents of the page, served in a fenced-off ad area. Why is it that we <i>must</i> invade the main body of articles?",1258595424

949558,comment,949449,949449,0,0,coderdude,,,"Based on a quick glance, SeatGeek is far less of an affront to my eyes than Kontera, but Kontera would look just like this if they used the same CSS styles. (Not literally, but you get my gist.)<p>I don't think in-text advertising is leaving us anytime soon. So, I think the best thing you can do is to make the difference between normal links and ad links very noticeable. The little pop-up should not be very large, slow to load, or look like it might be some type of legitimate information source. It should totally say in big letters at the top: ""Advertising by SeatGeek."" Black background, white bold text.<p>I've thought about this a couple times, trying to see if I could come up with something that the established companies haven't. I really can't wait for some clever person to figure out the perfect way to put in-text ads in content.<p>Maybe there should be no ad links at all, but a little icon to the right of the phrase, that upon mouseover will highlight the phrase and display the pop-up.<p>Ultimately though this method of advertising gives site owners the opportunity to deceive their visitors into clicking ad links. Less so than Adsense, I would think.<p>---\nEdits for proof reading",1258595266

We're not using the ""keyword"" approach like a Kontera or Vibrant allows you to link a lot, but creates a lot of crap. In Seat Geek's case we started with a simple database of the remaining NFL games; there's a limit on what can get linked so it doesn't get out of hand. We have another data set of product names that link product names to retailers and create affiliate links for people who do reviews or have users that talk about a certain product category.

949514,comment,949044,949044,0,0,netcan,,,"From the comments:<p><i>Thanks for sharing this. As a writer, I still don’t understand why we receive such a small pay check when the publisher reaps big profits. Yes, they take the chance, put up the money, and promote the book, but they would have nothing to sell if we didn’t write the book. Because of that, I’m self publishing my next book. I figure that I only need to sell 10% of what I would through a publisher to make more money than I would receive from them. With the internet and a modest fan base I think this is possible.</i><p>This is the correct mindset. Currently publishers take 90%+ of the revenue. They also take all the risk & also fund the unsuccessful publications. Authors are trading risk for stability at (what seem like) a high exchange rate. I don't believe that today & into the near future publishers really have such a monopoly over the distribution & promotion of books that no one else stands a chance of succeeding.<p>If the commenter is wrong & can't sell 5%-10% the number of books on his own, then the publishers are adding the value that they are getting paid for.<p>They could try to do what the publishers do. They could promote & sell direct to public online (I imagine >10% of all book sales are online, so if you can keep the number of online sales consistent while writing off brick & mortar entirely, you beat your goal). 1K true fans (or maybe 10k true fans) may be a viable approach. Maybe the author can do the direct to public thing & sell books at a fraction of normal retail price. I'd order a lot of books if they cost $3.<p>The problem with all this is obviously that the author then needs to be good at both writing & ""publishing."" For this to be scalable, there needs to be a wider structure that works for writers that are only good at writing. Then again, maybe that kind of structure exists and costs 90%+ of revenue.",1258592815
