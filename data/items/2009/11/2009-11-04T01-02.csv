Still, sometimes you need more elaborate formats.<p>SQLite is one good example of a portable, open, simple format that is complementary to flat files. JSON and Lua also seem very Unix-y to me.

If this is the case, it's a neat idea, but it was a little frustrating because you want to hear the music, but it's not clear - although I'm not sure on any better suggestion (i.e. elevator music, muzak..lol).<p>brk 23 has a good point about filters, that would definitely make it more usable.<p>Nice work! Haven't seen any other fun web integration of text-speech like this (I definitely don't count dictionary.com pronouncing words for me as fun!)",1257296980

After countless frustrated attempts to connect and establish better communication with Ruby/Rails User Groups in Europe, we came up with the concept of Rubyists.EU ( http://rubyists.eu ).<p>In its gist, the Rubyists.EU ( http://rubyists.eu ) initiative is a free of charge communication platform that aims at promoting awareness, enhancing assistance, and further boosting cooperation and collaboration among individual hackers and User Groups in Europe.<p>We would like to invite all the Rubyists in Europe to join this adventure by registering their User Groups and following us on Twitter ( http://twitter.com/rubyists_eu ), LinkedIn ( http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=2400973 ), Facebook ( http://www.facebook.com/pages/Europe/RubyistsEU/188196555796 ), and Google Groups ( http://groups.google.com/group/rubyists-eu ). You can even fork the source code from our Github account ( http://github.com/rock-n-code/rubyists.eu ).<p>We are looking forward to seeing how your participation in the Rubyists.EU ( http://rubyists.eu ) initiative can shape the vision and influence the development of both Ruby and Rails in Europe!",1257296534
