I compared the time it took to run 100,000 of each of String(fn) and fn + """", and found that the results were more ambiguous and less definitive than your assertion. In fact, fn + """" was 6.6% faster on Firefox 3.5, but 15.8% slower on a recent Chromium build.

Another one that stopped me in my tracks for about an hour is that an app must have a models.py file to run unit tests, even if your application doesn't have any models. If it's not there, instead of just saying 'models.py not found' it says something like 'application <your app name> could not be found'.

That process is not over -- many mortgages will reset their rates over the next few years, creating more foreclosures and prolonging the glut of inventory. Thus, though the market is apparently better than it was last year, and we may even be approaching the point in some markets where the rent-vs-mortgage calculation is approaching parity again, homes are still rather illiquid, which is another way of saying ""your home may make it difficult to change jobs or reduce expenses, because they can be hard to sell when you want to sell them, especially if you can't afford to take a loss.""",1258036065

Firing 2 people in 3 months may be a sign of a toxic environment. Leaving _two_ yelling, swearing voice-mails may be another.  It's OK to be upset about missed deadlines or unmet responsibilities.  It's not really OK to yell and curse at your staff because of it.  Part of being a professional (part of being an adult for that matter) is being able to act in a manner that is different than how you feel.  Verbally abusing the people you work with isn't ""intense"", it's at best rude, and shouldn't be accepted as par for the course.<p>I'm not saying the CTO is necessarily a bad guy because of this. We all lose control of our emotions at times. But let's be clear, this really isn't acceptable workplace behavior, startup or not. If it happens often, I'd take that as a very bad sign.<p>And this is more than a question of a toxic work environment (although frankly that may be reason enough to quit).  It's really a matter of the success of the business.  If the founders/management team aren't able to act professionally with their staff, how will they handle disappointment with investors, clients, partners?  It is likely that if this is a problem it will manifest itself in more places than staff relationships.<p>(BTW, Do you have ""stock"" or ""stock options""? Has your stock vested?  If options, how likely are they to turn into anything real? If you've got a real stake in the business, that's great, but otherwise working 14+ hour days 6 days a week on a regular basis might also be a bad sign.  I've witnessed this more than once with people I know: the founders don't offer early, key employees any significant stake in the business but still expect them to have 18-hours-a-day, 6-days-a-week dedication and drive because, you know, ""it's a startup"".

What we really need is a plugin that makes a quick query to a central service every time you hit a page and checks to see if anyone else has ""reported"" bad links on that page, and if they have it will highlight them or cross them out for you.  Or it could send a list of all of the links on a page to the server and check them against the servers bad links list.  Other than that it will let you do your own thing until you hit a bad link on a page, at which time it will look back at your history and see what page the bad link exists on and ""report"" that bad link/page to the central server so that any other user that hits that page will know before they click that that particular link is bad.

937765,comment,937362,937699,0,0,dkersten,,,"Theres no doubt about them being a great concurrency model, which is why Erlang uses this approach. Shared-nothing message passing is actually my favorite non-dataflow approach to tackling not only concurrency, but also a means to build flat hierarchical software components.<p>However, there are some problems which are not easily modeled in this way. Some people claim that for some problems, this method isn't suitable at all (I'm more inclined to say that its simply more difficult or messy, but IMHO thats reason enough). Sometimes shared memory based concurrency is needed for performance. Whatever the reason, I'm not convinced that channels are enough.<p>This is one reason why I like Clojure's concurrency support: clojure's agents are similar to go's channels, but clojure also supports shared state, using software transactional memory to ease the locking/synchronization pain. Also, since clojure code is, by default, functional, operating on immutable data-structures, a lot of logic is inherently thread-safe at no effort to the programmer.  Yet in some cases even that isn't desirable. So it lets you code however you need, and since Clojure is hosted on the JVM, you can revert to using Javas monitor-based concurrency model when it makes sense.<p>I don't think Clojure solves the worlds concurrency issues, but I'd argue its a lot closer to doing so than Go, even if its just because it gives you the choice to pick the model that suits your particular problem the best.<p>I don't actually mean to be advertising Clojure, its simply the most concurrency-oriented language I've been spending a lot of time using lately, so its easier for me to compare and contrast Go with it.",1258034946

Almost all of them have provided third-party developers with a means of producing software for the platform.  While some were more successful in this regard than others, none of them enjoyed the third-party-developer support that the iPhone now has, whether you measure that by number, quality or market share.<p>What's the difference?  Were these other platforms made from inferior technology, relative to the state-of-the-art at the time?  Did they have inferior marketing?  Was cost-of-entry too high for most developers?<p>The app store approval process is one of the major differences between the iPhone and all preceding platforms.  Is this just a coincidence?<p>If you find Apple's process unacceptable there are many (ie, all) other platforms that offer similar devices on which to distribute your work without oversight by their creators.  If you want to develop for a successful platform then you'll need to learn to appreciate the traits that make it so, and while not perfect, the App Store approval process is a key factor in that success.",1258034496
