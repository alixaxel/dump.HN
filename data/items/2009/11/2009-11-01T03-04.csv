914653,comment,914573,914636,0,0,patio11,,,"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are not guaranteed anywhere in the Constitution.  Those three are a rhetorical flourish in the Declaration of Independence, and do not create enforceable legal rights for Americans.  The Constitution guarantees enforceable negative rights, for example, it forbids the government from killing (or otherwise punishing) you without due process of law.<p>The Constitution, by design, doesn't establish positive rights.  An example of a positive right is ""You have the right to an education.""<p>Positive rights suffer from implementation issues, expanding government creep as pressure groups suffer rights-envy, and the generic problems associated with state-provided services.<p>An example of an implementation issue: the Japanese Constitution guarantees that ""All people shall have the right to receive an equal education correspondent to their ability, as provided for by law.""  This has been interpreted as making it unconstitutional to remove students from mainstream classrooms, regardless of behavioral disability or a distressing propensity to stab teachers in the neck.<p>An example of rights-envy: Once you have one positive right, every pressure group under the sun will want their own mandate.  The argument will sound something like this: ""The constitution guarantees bandwidth, food to eat is a lot more important than bandwidth, the constitution should guarantee food, too.""  Other favorites for expansion are health care, education, and sexual services.  (Oh, Europe, what a continent.)<p>The American political consensus is that positive rights are not desirable at the federal constitutional level.",1257047940
