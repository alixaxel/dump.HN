For example, a car might be stopped for some minor infraction - a broken taillight perhaps - but if the officer sees (say) drugs in the back seat, they can change their priorities. Evidence in plain view is the general scope.<p>The other side is that security checkpoints at airports go far further looking into things than would meet an ""in plain view"" test. The problem with being able to switch investigation priority in this circumstance is that it evades protections against unreasonable search.<p>His suggestion was that officers could do one or the other, but not both. Security screening should be strictly limited to physical security, and not seek evidence of other wrongdoings.<p>There is some evidence in any case that judiciary are starting to push back here, even in cases where actual wrongdoing is discovered by security searches:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204556804574261940842372518.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020455680457426...</a><p>> <i>A federal judge in June threw out seizure of three fake passports from a traveler, saying that TSA screeners violated his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure.</i>",1258576818

949065,comment,948481,949023,0,0,Alex3917,,,"To explain my theory, basically I propose that the brain has two parts: the part that processes thoughts and patterns, and the part that processes incoming sensory data. With depression, information coming from the thought processing part of the brain becomes more salient, and the information coming from the sensory perception part of the brain becomes less salient. And basically the way to fix depression is by stimulating your sensory system with the right amount and type of sensory stimulation at the right time.<p>More specifically, my proposed mechanism is that during a state of depression, outside stimuli don't get processed properly because they are more than the brain can handle, thus you are essentially suffering from the effects of mild sensory deprivation even though you are surrounded by a normal amount of stimuli. And the way to fix this is by starting with less stimulation and then layering more stimuli on top so that you can 'jumpstart' the brain, so that it goes back to being able to normally process the level of incoming stimuli in the outside environment.<p>Note that this doesn't contradict any of the established ideas about serotonin deficiency, and I'm not at all recommending forgoing the traditional treatments.<p>My thinking is that the reason SNRIs and traditional treatments work is because they either involve stimulating the sensory processing part of the brain, or else (with CBT) they help people to avoid triggering excessive rumination.<p>What's the data? Look at both the recommended treatments and also the ways people self-medicate: there is listening to classical music, wearing more cologne, cuddling with someone else, cutting themselves, TMS/ECT, SSRI/SNRIs, acupuncture, exercise, increasing social contact, etc.<p>All of these are activities that increase the activity in the sensory perception part of the brain, so my thinking is that you can purposely increase the activity in this part of the brain by applying the right stimuli at the right time, and thus ultimately fix the problem by bringing your sensory perceptions back to the proper salience.<p>Anyway I was doing a little reading on depression a month ago on behalf of a couple friends, and this is just sort of a pattern I picked up. Not sure what to make of it, but I think it holds and is also very easy to test empirically, although I'm not a scientist so take it cum grano salis. Obviously there are purely biological or nutritional causes as well, but based on the extremely high efficacy of non-drug treatments it seems like there is something similar to what I'm describing going on.",1258576615

If somebody does charges people without their consent, they are bound to get a lot of chargebacks and this is just a headache for the cc companies. Also, it is not in the credit card companies interest to allow the credit cards to be conduits for scams.<p>My parents used to have a business and even though it was a completely legitimate business they were constantly scared of chargebacks. They knew that even a small percentage of chargebacks can cause them trouble with the CC companies and offerred their customers money back whenever possible to avoid chargebacks.

949061,comment,948775,949019,0,0,enjo,,,"I find it interesting that we keep acting like Apple somehow invented the App Store. These are issues we've been dealing with for a LONG time, in a variety of different ways. Handango, for instance, has been functioning as an on-device app store for getting close to a decade.<p>It's interesting, then, to look at their product and see how they never really solved these issues particularly well either.<p>The BIGGEST issue for Apple isn't really touched on in the article. It's about proper discoverability. The problem with app-stores in general is that they have a lot of trouble allowing the best apps to filter to the top. The more apps that clutter the store, the more difficult it becomes to differentiate between them. If there is a password manager that everyone universally loves, then how do you grant exposure to a new password manager that may be better, but doesn't have the user recommendations (yet) to match it.<p>It's that problem that plagues these stores. Handango (and others) tried a number of approaches. The ""what's new category"" isn't enough really. The exposure length is to short. Staff picks are nice, but that becomes an exercise in political maneuvering as opposed to app quality.<p>It's this issue that really mandates a review process. The review process at least serves as a rudimentary filter that keeps the REALLY bad apps from competeing for mindshare with the quality new ones (thus increasing exposure, even if it is for an already to brief period).<p>Ultimately the app store lives and dies with it's ability to put the best applications for a purpose into the hands of customers looking to solve problems. Apple is starting to deal with the problems of scale, and that is where it should be focused.<p>-----------------------<p>Oh, and for the love of god give me some ability to get a refund for an app. Read reviews and count the number of times folks have essentially gotten ripped off by a product that barely functions (or sometimes doesn't function at all). Eventually we all are no longer enamored with the novelty of iPhone applications and we want some accountability behind our purchases.<p>I'm very wary with paid apps at this point for that reason alone.",1258576491

The customer should pay small, reasonable fees for everything. It is highly distortionary and is symptomatic of a dysfunctional market for banking services.<p>In the UK a few years ago the 'public debate' raged over ATM fees. Banks stopped cooperating and started charging about 2 pounds to the customers of other banks. It was pointed out that the amortised cost to them for a withdrawal was 30p. There was outcry and now they charge nothing. Apparently there are but two stable pricing policies - exorbitant and 0.<p>In general all basic banking is free, and they make profits by getting people into debt, or selling daft insurance schemes, or giving terrible rates of interest. Of course for the sensible individual this is not wholly a bad thing, if you can weather the hail of junk mail/promotions this business model entails and are prepared to move your savings account every year to make sure it has a reasonable return.<p>In my mind there is no reason for credit cards to exist at all - if you want a loan or overdraft, then get one - really they are a conflation of services: Visa/mastercard + overdraft + purchase insurance. What is desirable is a debit card that has visa/mastercard (encouragingly these do exist more and more, but are not the norm) and purchase insurance. i.e something functionally equivalent to a credit card, but without the capacity to get the owner into debt.<p>I like some of the other things people have suggested as well.

There is a proven way to use something called digital cash using public key encryption.<p>Digital cash allows you to send a long number which represents a single payment and can only be used for that single payment. Thus if the number represents you paying $100 to priceline.com, it can only be used for a single transfer of 100. If someone else tries the same number again, the bank will say, sorry this one has already been used up. In addition to being secure this system can provide absolute privacy.<p>So theoretically, it is possible but it has not happened.

949034,comment,948963,948963,0,0,vaporstun,,,"One thing that irks me about banks is that checks don't appear on your balance sheet until they are cashed.<p>More and more people these days aren't balancing their checkbooks and simply using the bank website's readout of available money to determine whether or not they have enough money in their account to pay for something. However, this is flawed for checks as they aren't logged until cashed. I've had more than one occasion where I got burned by this thinking I had more money in my account than I actually did because I had sent out a check that my landlord didn't get around to cashing for a few weeks.<p>This seems like the way the world is headed and it still kind of boggles my mind as to why we have both the account ledger at the bank's website and a separate piece of software to balance our books. (Mint.com, Quicken, etc.) The only reason this dichotomy exists as far as I can tell is for things like checks which are outstanding and not debited against your account when you cut them. (Ok, obviously there are other things they do like budgeting, etc. but why can't that all be done with my bank's website?)<p>My ideal Bank 2.0 would incorporate things so if I pay my rent with a check or send a check to someone through the web billpay, it is deducted from my account immediately so I cannot accidentally spend that money which is out there. Obviously it would take user interaction to log the check they wrote to someone in the case of a personal check, but with the web billpay it could be done automatically. By reducing the balance when that check is cut, it should do it throughout the system (aka not simply symbolically) so if I go to the store and make a purchase with my debit card, my balance with the check cut is taken into account and it doesn't allow me to spend the money for the check.<p>In the event of a stop payment on the check or a lapse of a certain period of time, the money would be returned to my account, so a lost check wouldn't screw me over. This would eliminate this huge problem along with the pain of having to maintain an additional piece of software to monitor my account.",1258575708
