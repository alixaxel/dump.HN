Could you comment a little bit about the mix between CDN-hosted JS and locally-hosted JS?<p>From your data, would you be able to speculate on the amount of efficiency gain (in bytes transfered and average latency across the visitors to the top 1000) that could be had if we aggressively re-configured this entire mass of sites to use jQuery/Prototype/etc from a single location rather than on their own sites?<p>Thanks<p>[edit: formatting]",1257515674

I think the concern I have is that the new, exciting features here are the unsafe ones and, obviously, those are the ones that are dangerous.<p>I'd be really interested in seeing how we can make features like this safe again.

925919,comment,924959,925314,0,0,dstorrs,,,"My suggestion would be to join a local college games club.  There is tremendous overlap between techies and people who play non-mainstream games (e.g. Rail Baron, Dominion, RPGs, San Juan, Fluxx, etc).  Playing card / board games with people for a few months, means you will:<p>a) have a lot of fun<p>b) make new friends<p>c) have a chance to get feedback on your idea<p>d) discover who the talented CS / designer / whatever people are, and get a pretty good picture of what they are like.  If you're looking to take someone on as a technical co-founder (which I presume, from your mention of 'free tech talent') you'd better know in advance if you can stand to be around them.<p>General games club meetings are fun and will provide you with contacts and information on those contacts.  If you want an in-depth picture of someone, get into a role-playing game with them.  To use D&D references:  do they play the cleric and heal the party, or the assassin and backstab their teammates?  Do they hog the snacks?  Can they listen to other players' suggestions politely and implement them if they are better than their own ideas?  Do they participate in the group when it isn't their turn to  speak, or do they have their laptop open in order to play WoW && IM && check email?<p>There may or may not be ""right"" answers to any of the above questions, but they will give you a lot of information to make a decision on.<p>You will also find that college games clubs consist of more alumni than current students.  This is a great way to network to experienced people (techies among them).  As an example, at the Columbia games club, we have someone who currently works at Google.  I met my co-founder at CUGC.",1257514107

I just tried compiling the function he provided using gcc's -O1, 2 and 3, and neither produced a tail optimized call. I rewrote it to match what my idea of a tail-recursive call is, and sure enough, under -O2 and -O3, gcc tail-optimized it. It didn't however with no optimization settings or -O1. I rewrote it as follows:<p><pre><code>  long\n  fact(long x, long acc)\n  {\n     if (x <= 0) return acc;\n     return fact(x-1, acc*x);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(edit: the whole slide deck is summarized well on the last slide: ""If you do an optimization, test it on real world data.
