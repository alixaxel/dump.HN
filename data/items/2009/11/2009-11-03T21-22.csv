At the highschool closest to where I live, teachers are <i>NOT ALLOWED</i> to give a midterm grade lower than 60. The student can literally do nothing and get a 60 on the midterm. Then it only takes like a 75 on the second half of the class to pass. So overall, it's something like 37 percent of the points the student actually has to earn to pass. Even if 100% of kids passed that wouldn't be a sign of the kids doing well. It would be a sign of a stupid system.",1257285557

In other words, given a randomly-selected JS applet and a randomly-selected Flash applet from all available to me, the probability is greater that the Flash applet will be correct in an officially-supported Flash VM than that the JS applet will be correct in Mobile Safari.",1257285448

When you have a 1000-mile line through the middle of nowhere, it's probably better to bring the power-plant with the train, instead of having 1000 miles of wire and electrical substations sitting idle most of the time.  (Overhead wires also interfere with tall railcars, like double-stack container trains.)<p>For commuter trains, though, I am not sure why we use diesel.   Lower upfront cost is my guess, which is kind of  a shame.  (The US has big problems with buying proper infrastructure.  Much better to spend $100 million over 10 years and provide mediocre service than to spend $50 million in one year and provide excellent service for 10 years.  Funding anything other than roads is politically unpopular; trains are ""noisy"" and we don't want more of them.  Yeah... some day I will move to Europe or Japan...)",1257284793

That is Albert is reading David's posts because Albert has white listed Carol (at level one) and Carol has white listed David.<p>How does the text of David's post get from David's machine to Albert's machine? We already have routing built into the semantics of the white listing hierarch. Since Carol is reading David's posts, Albert can get them from Carol.<p>I've read that one of the issues with amateur web comics is that good ones become popular and the artist suddenly finds himself with bandwith bills to pay. A peer to peer implementation of Outer Circle could cause this problem if an author becomes popular by millions of fans putting him on their direct lists, but I think that the common case is that  a popular author reaches a large audience because he has been picked up by a hundred influention Circlers who are read at two removes by the Outer Circle. So the tree structure will usually give the system good fan out just because few users will wish to manage a direct list of more than 50 or 100 and will therefore access the system through several layers of hierarchy.",1257284621

920284,comment,918605,919401,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Out here the homeless are just all over downtown. Without being a city planner I'm not really qualified to say why, but I have some pet theories:<p>- Seattle's transit sucks. It's one of the worst in any city I've ever lived in. This plus the lack of any natural borders around the city (mountains, large bodies of water, etc) has resulted in massive suburban sprawl, leaving downtown to rot. Unlike most cities, downtown is not a hub nor a destination.<p>- As a result of this, there's very little in the way of commercial development that you would see in most cities. Where you would see the hip shopping district in most cities, bustling with people day and night, downtown Seattle is mainly office buildings, and thus completely deserted at night. There is no such thing as the restaurant/hangout district that I've seen in just about every other city I've been to.<p>- Lack of social programs and policing have resulted in major arterial streets being taken over by aggressive panhandlers and drug dealers/users at night. People stay home as a result - I know many people who admit to staying home at night because of sketchy characters milling about. This adds to the desertedness, which further harms potential commercial development.<p>Seattle as a city is perhaps 30 years behind in its civic development. Even with the new light rail system there is still no effective way for most people to get downtown - the entire city reeks of crime, poverty, and dirtiness. Walking downtown you don't get the impression of a bustling, growing city - you see a city in slow decay, desperately trying to hold onto the image of better times.",1257282005
