Only facts and interpretation do.</i><p>Of course it matters.  Ulterior motives in science have reliably blinded people from facts for hundreds of years.  Just look at how long it took people to agree that tobacco was harmful--and how much money was being paid by the tobacco companies to try to avoid that conclusion.<p>Even if <i>every single thing</i> that someone says is factual, they may have committed dishonesty by omission of relevant information.

One provision might be ""no playing videos on set top boxes."" Instead of trying to explicitly mark which videos have this restriction and which don't, they could opt to just disallow TV viewing entirely -- and try to drive views to the XL product as a replacement for people who still really want to see YouTube on the TV.<p>That being said, the points made elsewhere in the thread about the line being blurry are valid.

I mean, it's not like any of these conditions are new or somehow they're being made up. There are a series of things -- each of which has to be necessary and sufficient -- in order for the argument to take drastic action to hold water. This has always been the case, and this will always be the case. This is the nature of convincing anybody that drastic action must be taken -- about anything.<p>We just choose to talk about one goalpost or the other. It's not like people are making up extra requirements of proof simply to make it harder on the other side. The only reason folks talk about each of these goalposts one at a time is just to make the conversation easier on everybody.<p>So yes, if you get through the ""man can change the environment"" hoop, which I believe, you have about a dozen other hoops to jump through, some of which I find much less plausible than others, before you get to the ""we must do something now!""

Doe and Moffit (the two main campus libraries) were shut down, students created do not cross lines, and a bunch of idiots pulled the fire alarm in all the big buildings.  Berkeley students with technical majors who were too busy working to protest had to evacuate buildings because protesters kept pulling fire alarms.<p>If you walked through Barrows or Dwinelle (humanities buildings) they were empty. Conversely, if you took a stroll through Soda or Cory (CS and EE respectively) they were packed with students finishing final projects.<p>I once had a professor who stated that no matter what, Californians will always vote for less taxes and more services, which is exactly what is going on now. I don't understand how they can chant ""End Budget Cuts, Don't Raise our Fees!"" in the same sentence without the cognitive dissonance making itself blindingly obvious.<p>I took a stroll to see the actual protest today. It was a bunch of kids who wanted to feel like they were part of something; a large group of people who wanted to scream and cheer as if this was a football game. Students were trying to shout over each other to lead cheers to get their own little slice of revolution. In the end, they presented no solutions besides ""Cut Executive Pay"" and have contributed nothing to either cause they were fighting for.",1258771921

All they are asking for is the same opportunity their parents had.  You know, those people who actually were old to behave like responsible adults, old enough to vote, and actually did vote through all those costly initiatives and tax cuts that led this state to it's current dismal condition.<p>Compared to their parents, UC students today have to pay more, have to go deeper into debt, and to expect fewer services, and that's not their fault.  Just be glad the UC system hasn't instituted the mandatory furloughs that the CSU system has, effectively shortening each semester by more than a week.  College level education in this state is an utter mess.  They have every right to be upset IMO, even if they are doing the silly protest and all that that college students always do.",1258771871

I kind of sympathize with Berkeley students who wonder how there is so much money for this but janitors and security staff are losing their jobs.

Ireland does this, and the proportion of young adults (25-34) with degree is ~30 higher than the EU average, at 41%, plus Irish universities are highly rated.

So they try to get scientists to run around, and do a lot of work to come up with evidence that doesn't yet exist (though the existing evidence is more than adequate).<p>This is in stark contrast to the debate in climatology, where scientists would like data to be publicized so that they may verify the results. The first is Zeno's paradox in evolution (""here's a fossil of an intermediate species between the X and Y species"", ""that's nice, now show me a fossil intermediate between this one and Y"", ad infinitum), the second is just plain science 101 (""we spotted a new supernova in Canopus last night"", ""oh really, can I see the data?"").",1258769605
