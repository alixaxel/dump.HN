922321,comment,916850,921614,0,0,foldr,,,">In theoretical physics there is an absolute authority by which to judge what is good and bad, namely the degree to which it conforms to reality.<p>There might be an absolute authority of this sort if we could just ask God whether or not a given theory conformed to reality, but in practice there is no absolute authority for judging work in science -- and you certainly find plenty of disagreement between scientists once you go beyond textbook material. Personally, I'm not a complete subjectivist about aesthetic and critical judgments, so I think that an ""absolute standard"" exists in principle for a lot of work in the humanities. For example, I think it is a  fact that Jane Austen wrote good novels. However, I'm a little uneasy about your reliance on the correspondence theory of truth (the idea that a true theory is one which is some obscure sense ""conforms"" or ""corresponds"" to reality). Although I am not a skeptic or subjectivist about truth, there are well known problems with conceiving truth in this way.<p>> Also, when that theoretical physics is later applied being wrong about it can be have real negative consequences.<p>Being wrong about the kinds of subjects that the humanities touches on (e.g. relations between human beings) can also have real negative consequences, if you are not a robot.<p>>It is not clear to me that saying something is wrong in literary criticism even has a meaning, and even less clear that it would ever matter if something was wrong.<p>I'm sorry that these things aren't clear to you, but the notion that critical and aesthetic judgments are ""meaningless"" is one that's been thoroughly discredited over the past 50 years. Logical positivism has been dead for quite some time now.<p>>If one were to examine it a priori or from an athiestic viewpoint it is not at all obvious or clear that anything has a value outside of its practical utility to mankind.<p>Again, if you believe that, then you believe that there is something which has intrinsic value -- utility. In any case, it's not clear to me why someone looking at things from an atheistic viewpoint would choose utility as his yardstick for value. I'm an atheist and I value a whole bunch of different things. I do value things for being useful, but I don't give utility any privileged place, or see any reason to do so.",1257360955

922306,comment,920704,921860,0,0,kls,,,">Look, I just don't agree with you that we are inevitably sliding towards tyranny.<p>You may not, but history repeats itself and human history is filled with a lot more tyranny than gilded ages. Hell we are only 200 years out of it now. Rome who we modeled ourselves after slid into it and imploded. So all historical relevance leads one to logically consider that it is a slightly higher than average possibility that we will repeat the cycle of history. Did we do so much better this time?<p>>If you struggled like I do to consider that the Man could organize His way out of a paper bag, let alone subjugate us all with tyranny.<p>It's happening all around the globe as we speak. It does not take much effort to find tyranny everywhere you look. Just because the 1st world has grown comfortable and detached does not mean that the 3rd world does not still experience it. Many times from 1st world people that are propping up the tyrants.<p>>Not every battle is worth fighting to the steps of Capitol Hill<p>Yes it is this is how tyranny works, the slow erosion of rights. One of the greatest quotes ever penned was by Friedrich Gustav Emil Martin Niemöller in which he said:<p>First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out because I was not a communist;\nThen they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist;\nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist;\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew;\nThen they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me.<p>This was in response to the Nazi's tyrannical rule of Germany.<p>The point being, slow erosion of rights and targeting of other groups is the modus operandi of oppression. It has to be checked at every advance or it becomes that much more difficult to resist.<p>Have you ever noticed that not one President has ever repealed any powers gained by the executive branch and many times oversteps the allotted powers they are given. Make no mistake about it absolute power corrupts absolutely.<p>It is human nature, the founding fathers new it and tried to set up a system that would leave it in check. Unfortunately, with the erosion of the state governments and militias as a counterweight and the devastation that Europe felt in 1 and 2 it left the US executive branch with the legislative branch as it's only opposition and much like the senate of Rome we can see how well that counterweight worked.<p>So you can not agree, but you are disagreeing with a lot of historical evidence to the contrary and are pinning your hopes on the fact that this time above all the rest we got it right.<p>Me I will remain a paranoid whack job like the founding fathers where and the Jews of Germany where and like the Taiwanese are today.",1257360724

From scanning the FoF document that I linked to, it appears that the appropriate jargon is ""relevant market"", and it appears that an utter lack of substitutes is not the criterion.   Rather, look at the following from section III:<p>""33.  Microsoft enjoys so much power in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems that if it wished to exercise this power solely in terms of price, it could charge a price for Windows substantially above that which could be charged in a competitive market. Moreover, it could do so for a significant period of time without losing an unacceptable amount of business to competitors.

He did not create this idea, nor does he claim to have, but he's been spending a lot of time and energy pursuing this over the past few months. As usual, a lot of nothing happens at first since nothing is developed, but then over time you start to results.<p>Presumably, on backchannels we're not seeing, he's getting contacted with those ""offers"" that he is complaining about now that he's having some success, all involving the ""proposition"" he describes. The problem is that Dave has been around for decades now, still occasionally talks about how Apple ""locked him in a trunk"" a long time ago, and basically has the wisdom to avoid this problem now, having learned the hard way. He <i>loved</i> the Internet at least in part because he saw it as the platform vendor that could not lock you out. (Sort of a virtual platform vendor.) This is far from the first time he's made this complaint, so at this point it seems he's pretty justified in calling this a pattern.<p>Many people have many different opinions of Dave Winer, and these opinions are frequently not without some justification, but two points should be remembered: He really has been around a long time and has experiences that should be considered (in particular, if he's saying something is a trap I'm inclined to take it seriously), and he is a <i>doer</i>, that is, one who does things, not just talks about doing things. (If he taught me anything, I would say it was ""Stop talking and start doing"", which has served me well.) His implementations aren't always the best technically, but they <i>do</i> things. He didn't invent the idea of XML-based newsfeeds, but he is basically the guy who built the tools to make it happen in an open manner. (Which is why I could claim a couple of days ago that I've been reading RSS feeds for nearly ten years; it will be ten years next January.

However, because there are fewer paths to success than to failure in most cases, you may not get the same breadth of lesson-learning as you do with failures.<p>I believe both are valuable for everyone to experience at some point.",1257357814

The first vulnerability scanners were written to help attackers target vulnerable systems. They were quickly repurposed to help people find and protect vulnerable systems.<p>The whole ""evil hackers"" thing is kind of a joke. Hackers are typically clever and often self-serving. By definition, they fabricate tools for themselves which, like anything we have, can be used for good things and bad alike. Many of those tools come into popular use. It's difficult to know what, actually, the intention was behind the tool's creation.",1257357812

The reason new members think that it's devolving is not that HN is changing, but that they themselves are learning.\n2) No discussion lasts longer than two days, and all discussions are based around other peoples' news--i.e. reactionay.\n3) Thoughtful self-posts are discouraged both by the guidelines and by the unreadable light gray font.",1257357755

Democracy is a machine for serving concentrated interests at the expense of the general well-being<p>Hopefully our champions will stop this. However, there will be no idealistic debate behind the scenes on the topic of what constitutes the public interests.
