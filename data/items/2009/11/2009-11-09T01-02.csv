930221,comment,930125,930192,0,0,kalendae,,,"right, sucker is a bit harsh.  Using it emanated more from him loving the secret more than the story that was told.  But the point I pretty much failed to make was that if he felt the enterprise to be worthy, but the people not to be, it is something within his control to find new partners or continue, nothing that happened prevented that.  But the story dramatizes events to the level of someone having stolen his business dream or some such.  Basically, yes it is a crushing experience to lose your innocence and find out someone you highly respect is just out to exploit you, but there's no reason to get it so mixed up with everything.",1257731925

930212,comment,929963,929963,0,0,apu,,,"I've been building up a javascript library to do this, as visualizizing results/data takes up more than half my research time.<p>Unfortunately, this library is nowhere close to ready to be released, but I can describe roughly the architecture, in case it's useful to you.<p>I take all my data and write a python script which will dump it to a .JSON file. This includes the raw data/results, names of different fields, groups of fields to toggle on/off together, and what kinds of visualizations I want to use with a given set of data (view as numbers, as bar graph, as line graph, as linear time-series data, as color-coded images, etc.)<p>Then I have a standard html + javascript file in which I simply load in this JSON file. Because I've prespecified the format of the JSON file (I.e., what fields it has and how the data is stored), I only need to customize a few functions to display results. Things like filtering data, searching and sorting I get ""for free"", since they're in the library.<p>The main advantages:<p>- Interactive browsing of data in various formats, all in the web browser, with no plugins etc. required.<p>- Can be viewed locally or across the network<p>- No need for a server to be running<p>- Processing done on each local computer, as opposed to on some server<p>- HTML 5 is now good enough (just barely) to offer all the kinds of interaction I require<p>- Most of the code is in my standard library for visualizations, and so the time to create a new visualization for a new set of data is quite small.<p>Drawbacks:<p>- HTML 5 is still slow<p>- Can't do very advanced stuff yet, without writing a lot of custom code. On the otherhand, using jQuery + jQuery UI, it's very easy to make things draggable, for example, to compare various things side-by-side or even on top of each other (with transparancy)<p>- No server, so can't ""save"" complicated settings or parameters (although cookies help).<p>Anyway, in case you end up building something of your own, hopefully some of these ideas might help.",1257731545

<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=925573"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=925573</a><p>Looking at one aspect: The idea of abstracting the verbosity of HTML/XML by just stating the element name once (instead of both  open and close tags) is not new. Many people have implemented this idea, but it doesn't seem to catch on. It could be that that very verbosity is a significant factor in the success of HTML and XML (both have widespread adoption).<p>SGML (the common ancestor of both HTML and XML) allowed a ""</>"" close tag, which goes part-way towards reducing verbosity, but it was deliberately omitted from HTML and XML. Both have been much more successful than SGML. Though it's hard to know what impact that particular omission had, greater abstraction is harder to read for newcomers, and therefore probably decreases adoptability...<p>Perhaps it's the Abstraction vs. Verbosity being played out in another forum e.g. Lisp abstraction being more powerful but Java verbosity being more popular.",1257730275

Neither of us proposed our mockups as comprehensive redesigns or attempted to address anything past the basic visuals. I wanted to buy shoes, and I found it to be a really frustrating experience, so I said something.<p>If the door to a retail store is hard to open and you complain about it, does it make you an arrogant prick for failing to think through all the potential reasons for the problem? Maybe the company handyman only comes every two weeks. Maybe there's a mountain of paperwork required before any repairs can be made. Maybe the staff needs approval from management. Does that make your frustration with the door situation any less relevant? It definitely makes you empathize with the staff, and speaks volumes about the company's ineffective management, but that doesn't change the fact that the door is <i>really</i> hard to open, and this is a problem for you as well as other customers. Understanding the context is important, but it doesn't make our critiques any less relevant.<p>You argue that, ""it’s easy to 'design' when you’re unencumbered by things like metrics, creative direction, business acumen, sales experience, actual functionality"". Of course, but think about all the companies that manage to get it right.  Huge, lumbering corporations like Amazon, JetBlue, and Virgin all manage to pull off great user experience despite facing the same challenges. Why shouldn't Zappos and American Airlines be held to the same standard?<p>I found the Zappos website insanely frustrating to use, so I spent an evening identifying some of the problems I spotted and added a mockup to clarify. Yes, I was a little inflammatory, but the overarching message was a positive one. I wasn't trying to tell them how to sell shoes or reinvent their business - my article was intended to show how a few simple changes overtop of the existing website could help make it easier to use. Blurry images have nothing to do with metrics, business acumen, or sales experience. If this helped push them towards making their website easier to use in any way, then I'm happy.<p>I feel awful for any designer who has to deal with Dilbertian management and bureaucracy, and I agree with the previous commenter - our frustration should have been primarily directed at the management team at either company. That still doesn't change the fact that there are designers responsible for crafting the pixels, and the pixels show a general lack of care. This might be due to the culture of the company, poor direction, or a myriad of other factors, but it doesn't make the work itself any less sloppy.<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a brash 23-year-old, but I'd rather say something and risk looking like an asshole than continue to patronize a company that doesn't care about their customer experience.<p>-Andrew",1257729603

Any evolutionary biologist will tell you that the facts aren't part of the social provinces.<p>They aren't by default, I agree. I don't think we'll ever have a world of fact-checkers and I'm glad we never will.<p>But I think it's likely that we'll see groups of passionate writers who strive for accuracy in their writing, not because it's an organization but because it's their individual style.

930145,comment,929204,929204,0,0,etherael,,,"It often seems to me that emotional evaluation frequently amounts to shallow, parallel processing. For example ""feelings"" based on previous experience which you can't necessarily immediately deeply analyse and explain, but typically encompasses an enormously broad set of circumstances you've experienced in the past. When we hear a line like ""I'll create a gui in visual basic, see if I can track an IP address"" we don't immediately have an impartial, rational response as to why that doesn't make any sense, the shallow emotional response kicks in first and you roll your eyes and groan.<p>If you then needed to explain in detail and in a logical way why that response was provoked, you can, but it's not what's at the immediate cognitive surface of the response. Take a far more complex example that just leaves you feeling kinda vaguely uneasy at first glance (spacetime is quantized) and I think that better illustrates what I'm getting at.<p>Rational, logical evaluation on the other hand is a deep, focused analysis which can't quickly account for every little thing you've ever experienced, and often initially leaves you with the nagging feeling that ""you're missing some little thing"".<p>The constant attempt to link intuition to emotion is probably based around the fact that people don't have deep objective reality based models of the universe as a general rule, so it's very difficult for them to be able to imagine the kind of person who does.<p>On the other hand, it's not that hard to understand that there are intuitive patterns to human emotion, even amongst those that have trouble grasping those intuitive patterns, thus the two become linked in the minds of the majority.",1257729065
