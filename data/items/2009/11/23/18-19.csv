957896,comment,957345,957859,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My elementary school was shaped like an L.  And the path from the cafeteria to the playground followed the edges of the building, with a 90 degree turn at the inside corner of the L.  The hypotenuse between ends of the L went through a hilly, wooded area.<p>Every day, at lunchtime, there were repeated admonishments to stay on the path and do not cut through the woods.  And every day, immediately after lunch, <i>someone</i> (and oftentimes <i>everyone</i>) would run through the woods along the hypotenuse to get to the playground.<p>They tried all sorts of tricks to get us to stay on the path.  They threatened instant detention for anyone caught cutting through the woods.  They stationed one of the teachers aides to physically catch people who were about to stray from the path.  It still didn't work, because there were so many people that broke the rules that they couldn't catch all of them.<p>Finally, when I returned for 3rd grade, I found that a roughly 10-foot-wide swath of the woods had been cut down, and a newly-paved asphalt path ran through it.  And nobody ever took the long way around again.  I think it was removed, long after I left, when the school building was enlarged.<p>Sometimes, it's easier to listen to your users (even if they are 5-10 year olds) than keep fighting them.",1259002644

957840,comment,956167,956167,0,0,lazyant,,,"Hello,<p>I'm the technical co-founder of a IT security start-up.<p>Here are my thoughts for comprehensive server security in the case of a server exposed to the Internet (typically a web server in a data center for example. Many tools etc refer to Linux but the ideas are the same).<p>Sorry about the formatting, some day I'll come around writing a blog article or something.<p>You need to consider many aspects of security.<p>In general measures will fall in one of the three classic Protection, Detection and Response & Recovery categories.<p>1) Protection means hardening your server (system and apps).<p>The three biggest exploits from the outside are: weak passwords, out-of-date or unpatched applications or system and running unneeded services or unsafe versions when other more secure versions exist.<p>There are the three main doors or external ""attack vectors"" in your network. If you protect these three doors then you are 90% or more secure than the average organization. \nThere are other possible doors (for example, you may have a misconfigured server, or a web form that can be exploited with an SQL injection) but these three are almost always present in all exposed networks (in order of importance):<p>a) Weak passwords: login access with poor passwords (passwords that are words in a 'hackers dictionary', like a simple word or combination like 123456) are probably the single most vulnerability exploited in the Internet.<p>Solutions:<p>- Use strong passwords. (most important) Also:<p>- Log access<p>- Filter the login access (in the firewall, based on IP origin for example).<p>- Use a password policy that enforces strong passwords<p>- Carry your own password brute force / dictionary attack.<p>b) Unpatched software. Exposed services (web, mail etc) and applications (like a web-based CRM application etc) that are not updated usually ahve well-known vulnerabilities that mallicious hackers look for and have the tools to exploit.<p>Solutions:<p>- Update system and application software (ideally automatically, periodically)<p>- Subscribe to the software security newsletter (if it exists) or keep track of its development<p>- Run periodically an external vulnerability assessment<p>c) Unnecessary or unsecured services running. Exposed services or applications that are not used or needed are just other ways for intruders to get in. Sometimes the organizations don't even know that they are there; especially in the past some server installations would by default install unneeded services. Another side of this is to run unsecure applications when there's a perfectly similar solution that is more secure. For example an FTP server transmit all information (including passwords) in clear text over the network, so an encrypted solution like SFTP/SCP is preferred.<p>Solutions:<p>- Remove unnecessary software packages.<p>- Run periodically an external port scan (see nmap for example)<p>- Run periodically an external vulnerability assessment (see Nessus, Qualys or have an independent third-party to do it).<p>- Look for safer alternatives to server software.<p>As other protection and hardening measures:<p>- Use firewall to block by defaults all ports that are not in use, implement basic safety measures (for example avoid spoofed addresses; no connections from the outside pretending to be from an internal IP address) and rules to mitigate DoS (limit the maximum number of connections at a given time from a particular IP address). Linux’ netfilter (iptables) can do all this.<p>- Protect management login pages (including ssh) with port-knocking and/or source-based IP filtering.<p>- Web server (apache): take off its signatures, deny / access, explicitly allow access, uninstall unused modules, limit upload/post sizes, check with benchmark tool (ab etc), check vulnerabilities with specialized tools (nikto, others), consider mod_security, optimize web server (this helps in case of high traffic or DoS): enable compression etc (see YSlow).<p>- Security by obscurity: this is fine as long as you know what you're doing. For example, change the ssh port from 22 to something else as other people suggested.<p>Besides the server you also want to protect its availability. Probably the simplest and cheapest thing is to have a backup server and use DNS fail over (the hardest part is synchronizing databases).<p>2) Detection.<p>There are several general tools and ideas for intrusion detection:<p>- Logs. Logs are a sysadmin’s best friend. There are auxiliary tools or whole systems to manage/archive logs etc, from parsers to complex apps like the ones offered by intellitactics for example. Tools like Linux’ logwatch can email periodically status messages.<p>- Monitoring tools. Sudden unexplained big increases in CPU or bandwidth may indicate a security problem. Monitor your server from the inside (there are many tools for Linux: cacti, monit etc) as well as from the outside with an uptime server monitor (pingdom, mon.itor.us, wasitup.com etc) as well as a change monitor (ChangeDetection.com etc).<p>- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). I don’t recommend in general using a network IDS (like snort etc) for a server basically because you’ll get all these alerts and you won’t know what to do with them and at the end you’ll ignore them. Do install a host-based IDS like a checksum application (tripwire or afick for example).<p>- Rootkits (rkhunter etc): they will detect basic exploits.<p>3) Recovery. This is arguably the most important aspect.\nFor a single server it means mostly having a good backup strategy. I like to use VPS’ and have daily and weekly backups of the whole VPS snapshot both in the data center as off-site.
