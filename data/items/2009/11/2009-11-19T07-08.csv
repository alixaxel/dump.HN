If you're not using a service with super fast SMTP processing (i.e. Google) your email might not show up immediately. This would delay the login process while you're waiting for the email to arrive.<p>2. What happens when the email is dropped? (due to some stupid spam IP/Domain blacklist at the server-level)<p>3. What happens when the email ends up in your spam folder?<p>4. In relation to point #1, what happens when your email provider has an outage? You can't log into any other websites? This seems counter to the idea that the internet routes around problems. Your email account becomes a single point of failure.

My least favorite phrase is that they are ""training my kids for jobs that haven't even been invented yet"".  Really? That sounds pretty complicated.<p>The thing is, the mentality has to change.  I want my kids to have homework.  I want them to be required to read more.  I want them trained to go to College, not the work force.  When they go to College, that's when they can decide what field to go after.  If we do this, the kids that don't want to go to College are no worse off.<p>OK, now that being said, I wish my own public high school had been far more demanding on ME to read.  I didn't take the initiative myself, and when I went to College and had to read 100 pages of an anthology in 2 days, I was pretty much screwed.
