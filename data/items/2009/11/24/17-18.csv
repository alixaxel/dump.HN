Software has this, it is just abstract: instead of atoms, it is bits and operations.<p>A 'material' means understanding, and rules, can be formed. Instead of force mechanics, software has algorithmic complexity. Sorting's lower bound of O(n log n) would be an example of basic knowledge. Of course, with only 50 years history, understanding of software's material is immature, and there is much to be discovered. But merely assembling pieces in regular, predictable ways, is  sufficient for a simple kind of engineering status.<p>Engineering seems often conflated with process. But this misses the essentials. Process is only support. It doesn't tell you about the material, or about design. It only helps you be better organised in what you can already do. Buildings don't stand up because the designers rigidly followed a process, they stand up because there is an understanding of how forces work in structures (etc.).<p>In a large, industrial, sense, software engineering lacks in certain ways, in certain areas.

959587,comment,959138,959138,0,0,jazzychad,,,"First, I would like to see an example of a rich iPhone webapp he has created (if any) to show off exactly how ""native-like"" it actually feels to use...<p>As for me, I have written an iPhone webapp which is located at <a href=""http://tweetgrid.com/iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tweetgrid.com/iphone/</a> (it is a twitter search app). I used the <a href=""http://iwebkit.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iwebkit.net/</a> framework (which is brilliant), but overall it was an exercise in frustration.<p>A few points:<p>1. You can create a webapp that will launch as an independent ""app"" if you save the page to your homescreen (i.e. it loads in a one-tab Safari ""full-screen"" mode, so no Safari navigation bars are displayed). As such, I built in some smarts that will actually detect whether the site is loaded from ""normal"" Safari or ""app"" Safari. If it loads in ""normal"" mode it shows some instructions about how to install the app on your home screen. If it loads from ""app"" mode those instructions are gone. I also use this mechanism to determine how many times the app has been ""installed"" onto phones. This is done server-side because I need to see the user-agent to determine this. This is where I ran into a huge issue with the Safari caching mechanism. I am not sure if it is part of the HTML caching spec, or something specific to Safari's implementation, but which ever page you use to specify the cache manifest file <i>also gets cached</i> even if that page is <i>not specified</i> in the manifest. This is idiotic. The only logical place to put the manifest reference is in the ""home"" page where the app loads. This means that any updates to the page won't be seen for a long long time (if ever). This also subverts my normal-mode/app-mode logic because the home page doesn't ping the server when it loads. Ultimately I had to do away with most of the caching in order to regain the other functionality. This means that everything loads very slowly compared to a native app.<p>2. The average user doesn't understand ""webapp.""  When somebody hears ""app"" and ""iPhone"" they immediately go search for it on the AppStore app. There is no realm of understanding about webapps. Finding (and installing) webapps is hard. ""Open Safari, type in this URL, click the plus sign to create a bookmark or add it to your homepage..."" is orders of magnitude harder for Joe Public than ""search for XYZ app, and click Install."" You don't even need to say ""open the AppStore"" because that's already implied. I would get complaints from users saying, ""I can't find TweetGrid in the app store!!!"" Then I had to politely tell them that, ""No, it's not a native app, you need to load it in Safari and save it to your home screen..."" which just caused more confusion.<p>3. PPK speaks of interoperability of webapps, but he also talks about using iPhone specific javascript APIs to access hardware on the iPhone... once you head down this path, you can't really call it interoperable anymore, imho.<p>I didn't even deal with the payment stuff with my webapp because I made it free, but that would be a huge pain.<p>Conclusion: I am learning Objective-C with reckless abandon.",1259084157

This part is true. The next statement is false. He states that UCD practitioners would have chosen differently had the product been a web site instead of a hammer. They would have chosen the paper prototype, he says. That's just not true. UCD advocates the use of paper prototypes, not because they provide more valuable feedback, but because they are much easier to build. This means that you can test more of them in a shorter period of time. That's a <i>very</i> important distinction.<p>His graph of the UCD process essentially depicts it as a waterfall process, where there are several design steps with big Implement and Deploy steps at the end.

Specifically, opinions that are so crazy and <i>unpopular</i> that you'd be branded a heretic for even suggesting them -- opinions that you couldn't even espouse on the craziest talk show on TV.<p>It's not about facts (which are provably right or wrong).  So saying, ""9/11 didn't happen like we were told"" is questioning the facts -- really not a stuff-you-can't-say kind of statement.<p>Reading through the list, I didn't find any of those statements particularly controversial.  I hear people say that stuff all the time, and I suspect that if you were to shout those things on a street corner in a large city, you'd probably attract at least some crowd of people who'd agree with you, or at the very least, grant you an interview.<p>So, let me make an attempt revise your statements and try to turn them into actual ""stuff you can't say"":<p>Old: ""The ambitious greed of Wall Street keeps everyone else from true success...""<p>Better: <i>""Some people will never be successful no matter how much money you invest in them.  Better to just test everyone early on for intelligence and let that determine who gets to be rich.""</i><p>Old: ""Successful public companies are bad for society. They are always bound to delivering the greatest possible profit, and rarely held to any standards of ethical behavior...""<p>Better: <i>""Why do we need personal and professional ethics anymore when we can just legislate everything?  Let's eliminate accountability completely and have professional judges decide right from wrong based on a strict set of codes designed to cover all situations.""</i><p>Old: ""There is no solid evidence that 9/11 happened like we are told...""<p>Better: <i>""9/11 really wasn't a big deal.  As a nation we should accept those few thousand deaths as a rounding error when compared to the many more people die of accidents and preventable illness.""</i><p>Old:  ""People who join the (US) military are making the world a more dangerous place...""<p>Better:  <i>""The world would be better if it were under the rule of a single world government.  The idea of a military would disappear, as it would then be irrelevant.""</i><p>Old: ""Ad sponsored media's primary function is to force you to pay attention. They trend towards accomplishing this with fear and social exploitation (shiny, sexy things) because these play to your un-ignorable biological reflexes...""<p>Better: <i>""Advertising that manipulates people on a subconscious level should be illegal.  We should regulate the advertising industry by requiring every product description to appear in a standard format (black Helvetica text on white background).  We should require government approval before any product can be sold in stores.""</i><p>Old: ""And most amazingly: it is okay to be wrong. To attack someone for not believing that we landed on the moon, or in the Holocaust, is actually selfish..""<p>Better: <i>""From now on we should use the Wikipedia as the final say in what is considered factual and right.  Anyone caught vandalizing or defacing the Wikipedia should be punished by death, as crimes against truth are more serious than crimes against man.""</i>",1259083203

If you say, ""Hey capitalism is great."" but it results in the destruction of our civilization, then is that okay?<p>I just came up with that. Usually people say, ""The ends justify the means."" But I've never known of someone to take it the other way.  Thinking about it that way though, it seems that is precisely what we do with Capitalism.  We know that greed is bad and leads to bad things, but we justify those ends because the alternative means, that is, a bit of loss of individualism and sacrifice of public property is, by capitalists, considered a severe punishment to the self.<p>So we say things like, ""Bankers destroying the economy is okay, because we were more free until it happened.""  We say, ""Environmental destruction is okay, because only a socialist world could prevent it.""  We say, ""Big SUVs and houses and consumerism are good, because the government shouldn't interfere in people's personal decisions.""<p>But the end product of all that is a less habitable planet and less happy place for future generations -- and not only future generations, but <i>these</i> generations <i>in</i> the future.",1259083135

With native apps, users can take advantage of built in UI elements reducing the learning curve and creating richer applications.<p>3.
