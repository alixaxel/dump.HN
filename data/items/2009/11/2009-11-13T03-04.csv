People seem to like using the internet that way, and all their friends are there.<p>Maybe the next generation, who grows up watching their parents using Facebook, will think of it as boring and passe, and there will be room for someone else. What happened when people starting <i>liking</i> Japanese cars, and American cars just started to seem big and ugly and crappy.<p>Unless Facebook screws it all up (still could happen I guess).",1258084762

But, don't get me wrong, I totally understand your problem and am wrestling with it right now.<p>Five years ago, I got imported into the Valley from a distant land, and I jumped at the chance because I thought I'd be doing something significant. As of today, nothing like that has ever materialized at the workplace. I'm not totally embarrassed about the things I've worked on, but I'm not really proud either.<p>Instead I found real satisfaction in side projects and in things which were utterly terrifying for me (building physical objects, also leading a project doing same). It did teach me something about myself and set me on a modified path. But it's still a huge struggle.<p>I have no formula, but I have a partial method.<p>Try to get yourself in a state where you can listen to the little voices in your head which want to do certain things. No matter how impractical. Your frustration is, in part, being caused by your automatic rejection of these ideas before they even become fully conscious. Use long showers, Bach, favorite ingestibles, whatever it takes. This might take years if you do it on your own; maybe someone else can help with this process. Guided meditation or something.<p>Wait for the ideas and visions to present themselves.<p>Consider, without passion, the reasons why you could never, ever do those things.<p>Then figure out the thing you're most terrified of and try to do that. It can be something limited in scope, but you have to hit the essential problem head on.<p>For me it worked like this. I had always defined myself as a geek who could not lead or inspire others. I'm not charismatic at all, quite the opposite. So I naturally shelved any plans which I couldn't do on my own. But I found other ways to lead a project. It turns out that at least some people are willing to get on board with a good idea, as long as you're executing well, even if you aren't Brad Pitt.<p>That was my mental block, fear of social inadequacy.
