Remember, being bold when you recognize a valid opportunity is not the same thing as taking on risk.  Risk comes from the unknown.  As such, you aren't really rewarded in proportion to the risk you take (the amount of unknown territory you dive into)--you're rewarded in proportion to the market opportunity you nail.  Rushing into things headlong is overrated.<p>In that light, it makes sense to me that Facebook can afford to take more risks that twitter.

Policy makers are sooo stupid that they haven't noticed.'<p>While the current policy may be wrong, this issue exists because the problem is hard. Subsidies & assistance for the poor create perverse incentives. That is true. But they are there for a reason. Most people consider it morally important. We have two things we need to do that conflict with each other.<p>How do we subsidise to a minimal level without destroying incentive to work? It's not an easy question to answer.

934544,comment,934375,934392,0,0,thwarted,,,"Agreed, with you and the author of the OP.  I find the worst auto-generated documentation to be class hierarchies, which are problematic from the standpoint of trying to learn how to use a library (often because they lack working example code), and also problematic as a reference because the method lists are cluttered up with private and protected methods that you most likely shouldn't be aware of if you're using the public interface to a library, which is the reason you're reading the documentation to begin with.  The lack of example code means you don't have a canonical idiom to use for reference and to build on, especially with things<p>As the author says, the django documentation is pretty strong.  I've always thought PHP.net was an awesome documentation site/reference also, it's easy to browse and find stuff, even if the example code is sometimes messy and there's a bunch of wrong information in the 5+ year old comments.  On the other hand, PHP decided to take the class hierarchy approach when documenting SPL.

The poor are still helped, but it eliminates the disincentives to do work.  Since it's just shuffling dollars, it also minimizes the amount of money lost in the bureaucracy.

We've had our lawyer generate 10 or so general contracts that we can modify to use in most situations, which I would recommend to any business owner.<p>Most lawyers have these already, and although they'll certainly charge you for the domain knowledge, you shouldn't have to pay hourly. You should be able to get a good, generic NDA for <= $500. NDAs are really simple, and usually pretty short.<p>I've never tried docstoc et. all, because part of the value for me is having a domain expert say ""yes, this will cover your specific business needs.""<p>One other thing: I've seen a number of companies providing their NDA on the contact / quote request page. I've been considering the same, as it might be a good way to head these uncomfortable conversations off at the pass.<p>Edit: this is a great place to barter as well. What you want from the lawyer is their expertise, not their time, and lawyers know the ROI a good website can bring them.

Sure, your average MIT grad may be pretty good, but some of the most talented and impressive people I know come from (decently ranked but not super prestigious) state schools.
