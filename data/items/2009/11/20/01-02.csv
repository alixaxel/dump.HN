And, while this may render the writing obtuse owing to the complexity, this is different from obfuscation. Very frustrating, I know, but this is the nature of the subject.<p>Concerning rhetoric, classical resources are vast, ranging from works by Aristotle to Cicero to many others. An excellent modern resource is Edward P.J. Corbett, Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student (Oxford University Press 1965) (this work was updated later by editors who sought to make it ""relevant"" for the 1970s, and much diminished as a result - get the earlier edition through Abebooks if possible).",1258682325

From an interview with Steve Jobs in the NY Times 1 Nov 2007:<p>“I don’t want people to think of this as a computer,” he said. “I think of it as reinventing the phone.”<p>""We define everything that is on the phone,” he said. “You don’t want your phone to be like a PC. The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesn’t work anymore. These are more like iPods than they are like computers.”<p>The iPhone, he insisted, would not look like the rest of the wireless industry.<p>“These are devices that need to work, and you can’t do that if you load any software on them,” he said. “That doesn’t mean there’s not going to be software to buy that you can load on them coming from us. It doesn’t mean we have to write it all, but it means it has to be more of a controlled environment.”",1258682283

They've open-sourced libdispatch, which is most useful with Blocks, and it's been picked up for FreeBSD. Unfortunately, Blocks conflicts with the C++0x proposal for lambdas, which itself conflicts with the Objective-C message notation. However, it seems likely that there will soon (on the timescale of language standardization) be reconciliation and a standard notation for lambdas and closures for C and friends. Libdispatch will almost certainly be compatible with that notation, and be available on most *nix systems that are likely to adopt things like C++0x relatively quickly.<p>In light of that, one could see Blocks as Apple wanting to ensure that at least one closures-for-C implementation starts getting real-world exposure, much as OpenCL was their way of ensuring that there is at least one vendor-neutral GPGPU API, even if it isn't the best possible. If their methods do end up becoming de facto standards , Apple could gain a lot by being the preferred and most mature implementation. If not, there's no real harm to Apple, because their platform is already ""different"".",1258682182

Designed specifically for a smart-phone, it is (arguably) the most efficient way to network and communicate with the groups and communities that share your interests. It does so by providing every group access to four tools: a group message board, live chat room, GPS-enabled map and member directory.<p>People like to think in terms of analogies so here are a couple: it's like yammer without the exclusivity and shared email domain requirement or a streamlined Facebook groups without the friending, pokes, status updates, etc. Of course there are a dozen other nuances that separate us from them but you get the gist.<p>What problem do we solve?<p>Groupie is the most efficient way communicate with a group of people from your smartphone (yes there are some exceptions). It is also a very practical networking tool. If you attend a conference, meetup, etc. There are a lot of people you meet and even more you dont. Groupie is an easy, practical, and informal way to do it from the device you keep on you considerably more than your laptop.<p>Monetization: we have a model we're very excited and confident in but this I would rather discuss in private.<p>About us:<p>My partner and I are Finance and Marketing guys from NYU.

We've invested $30,000 of our own money and will release a web and Android based version in mid 2010 (god willing).<p>While I would like to say we arent ""winging"" it in terms of marketing the application, to be honest we are. My partner and I are fanatically ambitious and will likely try everything possible to get the word out. That being said, we could use some direction. While we've come a long way in 10 months, we've made so many mistakes (and costly ones) that i can say with confidence that it always helps to hear from someone who walked down our path before.",1258680069

These are the official findings of the United States Senate, page 23: <a href=""http://j.mp/3HIfQi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j.mp/3HIfQi</a><p>This is simply wrong. And the very document you reference proves it wrong. If you see table 5 of the document you provided, the US is well below Saudi Arabia and many other countries in oil and natural gas. It has about 1/10 of the oil reserves of saudi arabia and about 1/6 of the natural gas of Russia. Even if you add oil and natural gas up, the US is not first -- saudi arabia and Russia both have more oil and nat gas than the US.<p>Now if you think the regulations are the problem, just look at Russia. Russia is notorious for having a corrupt government where environmental and other regulations are broken all the time. It also has about three times as much oil and about 6 times as much nat gas as the US. It is also less than half of the populations of the US. So, by your logic, Russia should be much richer than the US, because it has more mineral wealth and does not have the regulations that prevent its exploitation. But that is obviously not the case. The living standard of Russia is still much lower than the US.<p>What might have made you confused is that if you add up coal the US does become first. But of course coal has not made any country rich after the mid 20th century. It is too expensive to transport for export and it is dirt cheap because it is dirty, causes global warming and disease, and nobody wants to use it unless they have no other choice. Good luck basing our economy on coal.<p>The thing about Nevada may be right (I do not have time to check) but in global economic terms gold production is simply not a big deal.<p>Of course you face the more fundamental problem that you think somehow producing raw materials will get us out of a global recession. The problem with global recessions is that demand for everything tanks and that includes raw materials. The so called ""voracious appetite"" of China is only voracious because they use it to feed the voracious appetite of America for consumer goods. If Americans keep getting poorer that appetite of China will no longer be voracious and raw materials prices will keep falling.<p>Raw materials only drive economies when they are relatively small economies that can hitch themselves on larger consumer spending economies that are booming. Thus, for example, Russia was able to improve their economy by selling raw materials to booming US, Europe and China. But a major economy like the US simply cannot rely on raw materials or it will quickly become a minor economy.",1258679244
