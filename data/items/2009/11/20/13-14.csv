This means the investors are motivated to provide advice/connections/decisions that benefit the corporation over the long term, rather than concentrating on short-term solutions.  I think it is a much more positive way of growing a business, but it seems like no one is interested in that anymore, either because they have no actual faith that what they do is valuable/viable long term, or because they are impatient.

Since they have two huge cash cows (Adsense+Adwords), they can basically offer any software service (Gmail, Office, Photo storage, Maps, GPS, webhosting, etc. etc...) for free or very cheap, since their advertising clients can pay for that. More specialized services often cannot compete, since they don't have such ads money.
