Instead we've changed the culture so most of this generation starts their working lives with tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

But it's easy to slip in ""snake oil,"" even in a business context. Let's say you have two contract parties in different states (or one in another country) and each has a local lawyer. How do you use which state--or country's--law will apply. A contract isn't just an agreement, it's an attempt to predict the future. Because U.S. law is forever changing, it's difficult to know what it is likely to be. \nBut I don't think that the ""language that survives"" in contracts is necessarily opaque because of Darwinian principles.
