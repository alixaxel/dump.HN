Using && meant that it removed too greedily. Because updates always went ""remove then add,"" this error went undetected until I hit the case where two or more objects shared an identical reprval. Then it removed all of the shared objects, leaving only one behind when I went to query the partition.

957710,comment,957448,957555,0,0,sophacles,,,"I agree that the ""hard vs. soft delete"" debate is pointless. It seems the article sets up a false dilemma.  The interesting thing is how to deal with archive data. There are a few patterns, but the one presented many times in this article is the ""log it"" pattern (if it has an official name, please let me know).  Basically, this transforms all the data into a series of transactions, each of which is stored. It can occur at the database level (log each changing query, e.g. insert, updated, delete). At the data level (columns for is-filled, is-backordered, and so on, the soft delete in the article).  At the application level (each transaction is in a different row, what it means is away from the data itself).  Really it comes down to how often the data will need to be accessed, and how dynamically it needs to be queried.<p>In the modern age of hadoop clusters everywhere, and clouds being cheap, it may actually be best to keep the database as a maintainer of current state, and the transaction log as the historian (alternative 1 above), shipping off the logs for data-mining on the cluster at the analyst's leisure. The part I find amusing is: depending on which angle you come from, this could be a hard or soft delete :).",1258997112

Even when it is clearly - in my opinion - good, it winds up ignored. Because of the inescapable grant-related propaganda, it's impossible to tell what's good and what's not.
For example, recently some of the same people involved in the PL research I so dislike built a language called Cyclone, which adds some very useful safety features to C. There are still zillions of free-software projects written in C, and probably most of them could benefit from upgrading to Cyclone. But the thing has the academic kiss of death on it, and no one will touch it. The mailing list is virtually empty.
This is not just prejudice. It is rational mistrust. Academics, as we've seen, have no incentive to build software that's actually relevant, and every incentive to build software that appears to be relevant. They have every incentive to overpromote, and no incentive at all to build an actual user base. In fact, an actual user base is an enormous drag for a CS researcher, because it demands actual support, which does not advance the researcher's career at all. Also, because of the nefarious Bayh-Dole act, CS researchers are frequently armwrestled into patenting their work, which of course they have no incentive to disclose. If the rest of these factors didn't give you a reason not to use academic software, this certainly would.
The result is a world of Potemkin software which appears to be enormously useful, even revolutionary. In reality it is unusable. The researchers are some of the smartest people in the world, and surely some of what they're doing has some merit. But it is almost impossible to figure out what's wheat and what's chaff, and most sensible people just don't come near it.""</i><p>- Mencius Moldbug's <i>Unqualified Reservations</i><p>(<a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/whats-wrong-with-cs-research.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/whats-w...</a>)",1258996021
