I'd include the following two options as well:<p>5) Amazon approach - your usage gets added up over the course of each month, and your credit card gets charged at the end of the month.<p>6) Tarsnap approach - you start by making a payment to put money into your account, and this money gets used up as you use the service.  You can add more money whenever you want.  If the money in your account runs out, you lose access to the service.<p>Obviously, I like the Tarsnap approach. :-)",1257278362

Here the emphasis is on money-making activities, such as sports- that have rules that can be easily understood by the large masses, and that are easier to market. In addition,there is much more support for chess there, and chess is highly admired; here there are a lot of mixed opinions and myths about chess - for example, that in order to be a good chess player you have to be intelligent, chess is for nerds, etc. Now that chess is finally entering the US and increasing in popularity, hopefully it will be much better understood and appreciated in the future, but it may take a long time before it becomes really popular here.",1257278250

I think there's a perception that banking execs go abuse the massive resources that their institutions possess to screw over other people, and get a bonus for it at the end of the day.<p>And maybe they do, but I suspect that there's a lot more to their jobs than that.

As presented, his course basically considered each part of an OS, chose the best of alternatives for core system concepts, and built the OS from there. The result was something not grossly unlike a modern <i>nix, but still leaving enough wiggle room for the large number of variants we see today.<p>His comparisons between the way these concepts were instantiated in an </i>nix and in other OSs were particularly good (and scathing).<p>That being said, it is a pity that there aren't still a dozen or so major OSes out there, each coming from a completely different approach, oh the days when an Amiga or a BeBox were interesting consumer choices. You can still find lots of minor OS variants around, but they are very small communities and it's really all boiled down to a very small and ""boring"" handful.<p>Additionally, most new OS approaches suffer from a distinct lack of software.

The original design was targeted as efficient, long distance flying, at the expense of capabilities like aerobatics; according to the article, this guy has stepped up his with a re-designed engine an ignition system.

Planes can achieve substantially better fuel economy than land-based vehicles because of 2 factors:<p>1) More flexibility in body design.  Cars must have 2/3/4 wheels with reasonable clearance to maintain safe balance on the road surface, which usually adds to drag.  Planes can vary from tri-wing to tailless flying wing.<p>2) Low air resistance at high altitude.  Planes, passenger jets especially, capitalize on the reduced drag at high altitude for substantial fuel economy.  Cars are generally stuck at sea level most of the time.",1257277364

920060,comment,919569,919569,0,0,Sidnicious,,,"Two things caused this vulnerability:<p>1. Every iPhone has the same root password by default. Apple never intended for anyone to SSH into their device or see a shell at all.<p>2. Many users install sshd on their jailbroken iPhones without knowing or caring about the implications, and leave it installed and running.<p>There are a few possible solutions to this problem:<p>The maintainer of the sshd package should prompt to change the mobile user's password at install time, disable root SSH access, and install sudo. It would also be a good thing to only allow SSH over WiFi (by default).<p>Maybe a status bar icon to indicate when SSH is enabled should be installed by default, and SSH could not run at startup but require that the user activate it per-boot.<p>(Actually, BigBoss, the developer of the popular dashboard application SBSettings, REMOVED the option to permanently disable SSH access, arguing that SSH is often the only way to fix up an iPhone that won't boot into the GUI and that it should start unless the user disables it for that boot. I disagree with this decision and think that, at the very least, sshd should shut down after the device boots successfully.)<p>The root problem here is that the developer of sshd for the iPhone probably released it to be used as a debugging tool by other developers and hackers.

Since it's low budget, it doesn't need to be a home run hit to be successful (like cuil), and it doesn't need to be better than Google at being Google (like Bing). All it needs to do is be good enough at providing context that some small group of people goes to it when the search term's appropriate.
