You use it on the spot where you happen to want it.<p>If you don't recognize that you want to erase a mistake, you just don't use the erasers.<p><pre><code>  > When I'm speaking, I don't think to myself, ""Ok, this is parenthetical... this is correcting an error... this is vague and all-purpose."" I just speak.\n</code></pre>\nI'm not a native English speaker. When I started learning and speaking in English, I would think to myself, ""Ok, the word ""which"", when used after a slight pause, which corresponds to the comma in writing, it means a non-restrictive relative pronoun, which is what I want now, so I'm going to use it that way"". As I kept practicing the language, I internalized the rule, becoming less and less actively conscious of it. Lojban is no exception. I have already internalized some parts of the grammar to which I used to pay much attention in my earlier period of learning.<p>Also important to note is that, what English expresses with non-verbal properties such as intonation, Lojban can do verbally. When you orally say something in English which you would put in a parenthesis in writing, your speech act are still subject to some phonetic principles such as inserting a pause, changing the rhythm, lowering the pitch, using less breath, and so on. You consciously or unconsciously have to be in command of these properties if you are to successfully deliver your utterance. A particular combination of these non-verbal phonetic properties is what Lojban expresses with <i>to ... toi</i>, the parenthetical markers. Whether or not you are actively conscious of them is a matter of internalization. Just like an experienced English speaker not always actively thinks about each noun's grammatical number in their utterance but still manages to add the plural marker ""s"" where appropriate, an experienced Lojban speaker would be able to correctly start a parenthetical note with ""to"" but without always actively checking whether or not that's what they really want to say.<p>> I realize at this point, I'm getting beyond my own knowledge of Lojban, but I just want to make the general point that being able to be ambiguous does not automatically afford the advantages of the natural ambiguity in ""natlangs.""<p>Could you give me an English example with such advantages?",1257274598

919926,comment,919517,919780,0,0,stingraycharles,,,"Well, I don't have a blog, and I don't want to get into too much detail, but I can give a quick overview of our main usage.<p>Basically, the core problem we needed to solve was to have a reliable datastore which is able to detect race conditions when multiple webservers are handling the same data (in essense, multiple webservers handling a request from the same visitor). To do this, we use a simple compare-and-swap trick: each object has a version number which is transmitted when an object is read, and this version number is transmitted back when the object is updated: only when the ""old"" version numbers match, an update is performed, otherwise an error is thrown, and the webserver re-processes the entire request from the start. I believe a similar trick is used in memcached for CAS operations, and it works great in situations where the chance of a race condition occurring is relatively small.<p>Now, for all this to work, we need to have a datastore that lets us atomically compare and swap these objects: this is where, for us, projects based on Amazon Dynamo start to become suboptimal. I believe it's theoretically possible to detect race conditions with such projects if you set the amount of writers to more than half the amount of replicas, but it just starts to give you a feeling you're using it for an unintended purpose.<p>MongoDB, on the other hand, provides the ability to define stored procedures. Furthermore, they guarantee that this happends atomically: only one client can update a single object at the same time, which is a great guarantee. Because of this, we could write a trivial stored procedure that takes 2 arguments (the old version number and the replacement object), and does the compare-and-swapping. I even believe MongoDB can do ""update if these fields still match these values"" operations nowadays, so it looks like this functionality is even integrated within MongoDB.<p>Of course, in addition to this, we also need the datastore to be highly available and limit the risk of data loss as much as possible: MongoDB has this area covered really well, and automatic failover is implemented within the client drivers.<p>And this is basically all there's to it. Because of the guarantees MongoDB provides, the work we needed to do was reduced to a minimum. Of course, features like ad-hoc querying and their plans to implement map/reduce capabilities help too (we've already invested a lot of time into Hadoop and Map/Reduce applications, so it all fits).<p>All in all, it seems MongoDB just came into existence at exactly the right time for us, and the people developing it seem like a very active, passionate bunch of people.
