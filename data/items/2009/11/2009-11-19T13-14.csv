950222,comment,950117,950117,0,0,tetha,,,"Judging from my very own current problems, I guess I'd start to support small universities and support promising young students, especially if they study some sort of had science like physics, math, computer science and such.<p>Such support should include money (well, students need food, books, other equipment depending on the course), but I think it should also include support with various buerocratic problems, like facing the german bafoeg-institute and other buerocrats.<p>Certainly, it will be hard to actually get a good selection principle going and it also needs a plan to get the money back, but once this is done, I think this is a very valuable thing to invest in. I mean, studying is pretty much a full time job (well, if you study hard to get through the universiy fast, it is), and thus, students usually don't have that much time to work and sometimes they even get to pay for being at the university.<p>Besides that, I would invest a large sum into neurodermatism research, just for pure egoism. I have this problem, and whoever also has this problem knows how bad this status can be whenever it goes active. (To everyone else: Just imagine the urge to scratch your inner elbow, hand or other inappropiate locations until every skin is gone and just a bloody mess is left. After that, one is depressed, cannot move properly and is in pain.) Thus, this would be a second major investment. I guess it also would not be that egoistic, as a lot of people could benefit from results from this research :)",1258638988

And that is a good thing because hardware ought to be designed for the software, not the other way around.<p>But it doesn't mean that what we need is more monolithic entities like apple. The fact that hardware and software is at least somewhat decoupled is a VERY good thing in my opinion.<p>What google is doing with android is interresting in this regard, and i wonder if their strategy with Chrome OS is gonna be similar; they release an OS (open-source, and this is quite important in the end), do the usual strategy of partnership with hardware manufacturers, and in the end , also decides to produce their own smartphone. It's an harder path cause your partners are your opponents at the same time (something apple for example, hasn't to deal with concerning OS X). But for the user it's clearly the best path : You have the freedom of using the software as you want (!= Apple) and you can also buy a proprietary solution that supposedly offers a better synergy between software and hardware",1258638702

The only one who 'could' die are those whose job is only about assembling hardware components together. And even them have a role in the low end market that will be very hard to meet for a company aiming to handle the whole chain of assembly of a computer, software included.<p>It's easy to agree on the fact that software has a much more profound impact on people that hardware. It's why there is an UI in GUI. But to me this point is as moot as saying an engine manufacturer is useless because it doesn't do steering wheels.<p>It seems to be a fact (I dont have enough informations to be sure) that software economy is wealthier than hardware's. But i'd like facts about that first, because i see a whole lot of software companies dying too .
And then even if it is true it doesn't mean we NEED hardware manufacturers to come and release a ton of more or less compatible software and trying to impose that on users the exact same way we are stuck with windows at the moment.<p>Software building is a field of expertise in itself. A company can convert itself, or invest a new field.

950198,comment,949610,949610,0,0,jorleif,,,"I think there is a fundamental difference between the creative acts of programming and producing artwork. The programmer has a requirement of what the program or piece of it should do, and the creative problem, is how to do express this in code. The problem with reading code, is that the original problem is not present in the code, and the purpose of the code is not to express something to a human viewer, but mainly for a machine to execute. In that way the creativity is a lot more like the mathematicians creativity than the artists. The difference to mathematics, is that in programming the resulting code is usually quite long. What one would need is to condense the code in a way similar to how a mathematician does with his formulas, so that only the most essential ideas remain. Some people are very good at that (Peter Norvig comes to mind), but most codebases for actual software are not at all like that.",1258638165

950188,comment,949971,950169,0,0,pohl,,,"The original article makes an excellent point, and expresses it with a great deal of coherency:  the reluctance of computer makers to engage in operating system development is based on an outmoded fear that was established in the days where interoperability was hard because we hadn't yet figured out things like open document formats, open network protocols, portable APIs, portable language runtimes, and virtual machines.   A lot has changed since then, so why are they still so reluctant?<p>This is an excellent question.<p>Your response seems to have a very tenuous grasp on coherency.  I'm trying to pull out what you're trying to say.  It appears to hinge on the transitive verb ""to matter"", and I can find only one introductory paragraph where the author uses this verb, and he doesn't say anything objectionable the two times that he uses it:<p>He says that hardware and software both matter.  I find that hard to refute.  Then he goes on to say that if you asked him to say which matters more, he'd say software.  I'm not surprised that he would say this, since he tends to be a ""user experience"" guy and I'm willing to grand him this premise  for the rest of what he wrote.<p>Honestly I can't tell what counter-argument you're trying to make.  Yes, Google has been successful.  It certainly wasn't because of their hardware.  Regardless, you're only responding to the setup of the thesis, not the thesis itself.",1258637638
950187,comment,949971,950152,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Your safest bet is to simply never use the word ""fanboy"" except to refer to yourself. It's name-calling, and is therefore both rude and a sign of bad rhetoric. (I would say <i>ad hominem</i>, but that's a cliche phrase on HN, so I do so with reluctance. ;)<p>As for the rest of your post, here is Gruber's thesis statement:<p><i>PC makers who want to succeed should create their own OSes</i><p>Your statement that ""Google succeeds without an OS"" does not belong in this argument. First, because Google's success has nothing to do with PC making: That's not their business. Google is an online advertising business. To the extent that the rest of their amorphous, cash-cow-supported business plan has any coherency, it seems to be about using various web and mobile apps to drive advertising traffic, although they also derive a certain amount of revenue from selling software subscriptions and licenses, and of course there's AppEngine. And probably some stuff I've forgotten.<p>Second, because where Google <i>does</i> have a strategy to venture into the hardware market -- with mobile PCs, marketed as ""phones"", and perhaps desktop/laptop PCs as well -- the plan seems to be to start out by building an OS, just as Gruber suggests. Google's phone venture is centered around Android. I'm not sure what Chrome OS is all about, but if Google releases a tablet or a laptop it will presumably run Chrome. To the extent that Android and Chrome are or will be successful, these will be points in <i>favor</i> of Gruber's argument.<p>Finally... Apple's first couple of OS X releases really weren't that successful. Apple survived that, of course, because they still had enough dedicated users of their <i>previously</i> successful OS -- Mac OS 9 -- to tide the business over. And of course that iPod thing didn't hurt -- that bought a lot of time. [1] The success of Mac OS X was a near thing, though. Mac fanboy that I was, I nevertheless abandoned the Mac myself for dual-boot XP/Ubuntu in the early 2000s, and didn't come back until OS X 10.3 or 10.4, and I don't think I was alone.<p>---<p>[1] The iPod, of course, is successful because of iTunes. Which isn't exactly an OS. But is certainly a software ecosystem, common to all Apple hardware, with a circumventable but nonetheless real form of lock-in, built around what was at the time a superior, unified interface for purchasing music, organizing it, and copying it to your devices. The success of the iPod derives mostly from Apple's custom software for the iPod. People have been cloning the hardware forever. Pundits famously didn't see the iPod coming because other companies had beaten Apple to market with apparently equivalent hardware.",1258637626
