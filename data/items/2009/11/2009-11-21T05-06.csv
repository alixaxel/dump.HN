So, I bought an Acer Aspire A150,  I got a spare 9 cell battery and I increased the RAM to 2 GB.  And, it runs Windows 7 Ultimate like a charm.  I have enough battery life to last me a 14 hours of coding movie watching and non-stop music listening.  The whole thing is the size of a hard-cover book.<p>I use Rhapsody for music, which keeps my music libraries synced and Bitbucket for my code.  I use Windows mesh to keep other files synced to the ""cloud"".  I can switch seamlessly from my 3 monitor dev box at home to my netbook by doing an ""hg pull, hg update""<p>How does using a ""cloud centric"" OS help me?  Is it cheaper?  I got Win 7 Ultimate for free through Bizspark and I have $350 invested in hardware.  I don't really see the advantage of hamstringing my OS.  Hardware is cheap.<p>I understand the theoretical advantage to the third world of using less hardware, but when I was in Mexico this spring, netbooks were everywhere.  They weren't running Ubuntu, either, they were running pirated copies of Windows.<p>I'm not trying to troll, but aside from trying to compete with MSFT, how is a cloud centric OS any better than a typical OS?",1258783061

My point was that a tool to catch such uses is pretty pointless, as it can be defeated using other entirely ""legitimate"" API calls.<p>To your second point, even apps that stick to using only documented API methods have known to fail after iPhone OS upgrades. So, let's not delude ourselves (or the users) into thinking we're writing robust (or worse, future proof) software simply by adhering to Apple's guidelines. All I would ask from Apple is that they get out of my way of getting an update to my users as quickly as I can.",1258783048

In ""one"" word, it's an aggregator for sites and blogs as well as podcasts and the feeds are update in nearly realtime, add some social features to it and that's it. A User case could be for a google employee to keep in touch with his company news, it's very easy to do that by checking the google category with all the google blogs listed there, no need to fire up your desktop feedreader all the time, or login somewhere, just go get what you are looking for, and if you miss the news from several days before, click on the ""more"" option and you can catch up with that stuff and share it to twitter with one click.",1258782846

They've always claimed that the most valuable thing they give is advice, so you have to ask what that's worth, too.

954227,story,,,4,4,Xixi,"Ask HN: How to make an Amazon Web Service style billing ?",,"I have to admit that I like pay-per-use style billing, where you pay exactly for what you are using, providing it's cheap. So I would like to use that kind of pricing scheme for my startup (www.assemblive.com, currently in private beta, pretty soon public).<p>I was wondering if some of your startups are using that kind of billing, and, very pragmatically, how did you implement it ? Are there some providers (like Paypal, Amazon, etc.) that offer that kind of payment scheme, where you just bill for actual usage at the end of the month ? I might be a bit naive, but it would seem to me that's it's basically like a subscription, but with a different amount each month...<p>From the end user point of view, I'd like them to be able to allow the payments just once. And then they just use the service as much as they want and don't have to do anything anymore regarding payments.",1258782263

HN discussion here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=843517"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=843517</a><p>Obviously, an article in the National Review isn't worth much as evidence by itself.  But it quotes reputable scientists who have gone on record as saying they believe he is stonewalling their requests to see his raw data.<p>The CRU has acknowledged that the files are genuine.  In one of the emails, Phil Jones brags how he unethically manipulated the presentation of his results (Nate's words, not mine).  And we might not be able to go back and check  his results against his measurements.<p>It seems to me that this would be a good time for an audit of the climate change data.  Our first priority should be maintaining the integrity of the scientific process, and in this case that means getting rid of the appearance of impropriety.  It's wrong to hold back scientific criticism because of the way we feel about whichever group is currently using the scientific consensus to advantage in the infinite clown fight that is partisan politics.<p>EDIT: this post went through several versions, most of which were bad.
