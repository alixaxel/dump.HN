They could have mechanically changed the playing field at certain thresholds, or even looked into using different sorts of balls (heavier, smaller, BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!!!). How about balls with uneven weight distribution? Most of this stuff I envision being unleashed as you advance, so it's similar to other video games where it gets progressively more difficult.<p>It just seems like they could have done something other than just make a static game that was harder than the last version.",1258502351

The point is that you should have a product people want AND be sales oriented.<p>Are there times when it's rational to start a business that's not sales oriented? Absolutely. But you better have a damn good reason.<p>For example, let's say your product is a search engine that returns results structured in the way people learn. And what's more, it's so obvious that your search engine is better that a huge percentage of people who use it instantly switch their default homepage. Now this is a good example of when you might want to start a business without a sales plan.
