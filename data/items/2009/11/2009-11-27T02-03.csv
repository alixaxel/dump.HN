As far as execution, they are releasing a lot more a lot faster than they used to - but is it the right stuff?]",1259290684

Additionally, using words like ""legitimate"" and ""devolved"" illustrate perfectly the concept of high-prestige versus low-prestige language dialects.<p>People don't speak AAVE because they're lazy or dumb.  They speak AAVE because they grew up where everyone else speaks AAVE.<p>If the South had won the Civil War you might not think using double negatives, double modals, etc. were a sign of stupidity -- AAVE and Southern (white) English share many common syntactic and morphological features.",1259290537

If we're still in this situation after ten years despite all the artificial stimulus I think it's just a joke to call it anything less than a depression. I'd argue we've been in a depression since the tech bubble burst and that we've just been papering over the mess for the last ten years. Considering that job growth has been basically zero for that period I'd say we've been kidding ourselves with statistics for awhile now.",1259290141

The understanding has always been that the government would bail out massive losses in these loans. Some of the deregulation made things easier for this to happen but the recession would have been regardless of these factors. Job growth over the last ten years has been almost entirely focused in housing and related industries.",1259290029

and all the joy within you dies.<p>If these e-mails are true this looks like it’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow for a lot of people.<p>Many people have invested a lot of money and time into this issue, from buying new tiny fuel efficient cars to investing a lot of money in green energy businesses. Plus many have their reputations at stake here too.<p>Now that it is starting to look like this whole issue was some kind of hoax, I see two separate groups that may surface here. Those who intended to profit from this politically and financially, and those who are into it for purely environmental reasons.<p>It seems if there is no real causative environmental impact happening, the pure environmentalist should be happy to embrace the truth at this point whereas those who were into it for other reasons may still attempt to spin and re-spin facts and push for further legislation and increased taxes.<p>Another thing to consider is now that it has become a political issue and is at the global center of attention a lot of people are going to look like they were participating in something that was a fraud and a deception. Yet I’m sure many of them had no idea they were being mislead and should not be lumped in with the perpetrators of the deception, if it ultimately proves to be a deception.<p>When the truth is found to be lies,

Most all of these are able to lay out the drivers of the problems and suggest concrete, simple ways to fix things.<p>However when I look at the current proposed solutions, they are neither simple or concrete. Instead (to me) they look byzantine, obtuse, and obfuscated.<p>This leads me to believe that either lots of really smart people have vastly underestimated the complexity of the problem, or that the people currently charged with fixing it are unable or unwilling to work in a direct manner.<p>All three of these are interesting conclusions.",1259289859

Shakespeare, notably, wrote his plays in the vernacular to connect with his audiences. [1]  Chaucer did the same with Canterbury Tales. [2]  Of course we forget that now because we revere those authors as purveyors of great literature.<p><i>To call it a dialect may be technically correct, if you're merely arguing semantics.  However to accept it as a legitimate dialect is another thing.  If your child spoke that way you would constantly correct them, for their own good.</i><p>Matt, I'm a young, intelligent, black male in America: I would never let my kids grow up speaking AAVE exclusively.  Trust me.  But neither I nor the author are arguing the prestige of the dialect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_influence#The_changing_status_of_the_English_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_influence#The_c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_literature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_literature</a>",1259288554

There is no right or wrong language. If you are communicating you're doing it right. 2) Most all societies have a ""high"" language and a ""low"" language. Sometimes there are multiple layers. People who want to move in better circles learn to conform and work fluently in the ""high"" language.<p>The continuum question was especially interesting. Is Old French just bad Latin? Or is it a different language? What about those languages that have one spoken form and two written forms? The same language with different names because of political considerations? Lots of neat history and trivia here. I really enjoyed the series.",1259288520

My elderly father does just fine with the iMac too, though I actually had to turn off the right click to keep him from getting confused.<p>By the way, the ""unintuitive"" things you mention aren't unintuitive, just different from Windows. It's no less ""unintuitive"" than whether or not you set your parking brake with a pedal or a hand lever (so better not get your mum a Toyota if she has a Ford).<p>By the way, OS X is good enough at multitasking and memory allocation you don't have to actually quit your applications.
