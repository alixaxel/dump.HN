941335,comment,940689,940985,0,0,jsz0,,,"The Android store has its own set of problems.<p>People are releasing updates constantly just to get to the top of the list for new releases. Once you install apps you're constantly bombarded with updates that seemingly change or fix nothing. (because they don't, it's a marketing ploy) There's apparently no way to filter different languages out so I have to hunt through a list of apps with titles in languages. Apps have compatibility problems. The Market is littered with non-sense like ""pre-CupCake edition"" ""Eclair edition"" and ""DOES NOT WORK WITH <i>insert handset name here</i>"" Some apps just crash on startup. Some apps don't support virtual keyboards. I downloaded a random system monitor app that said every possible value like RAM/CPU was NULL. Compatibility is a problem. Some apps install services that cause other apps to work differently. For example I installed some random file manager that caused the photo app to take an extremely long time to startup. Removed it and all was well again.<p>There's no real easy way to UNINSTALL apps. You have to go to a list that includes everything including system components like com.something.blah.something. The Market doesn't support screenshots? or developers simply don't upload them? App naming is very inconsistent. One app might be AMAZING APP, another might be Amazing App, another might be Amazing App 1.0 Pre-Cupcake. Makes your program list a bit difficult to navigate. Apps can pollute your application list. I have something called UIServer-something or another in my programs list -- when I run it nothing happens. No clue what it is but it sounds important so I don't really want to remove it either.<p>So yeah... the grass isn't always greener. It's shaping up to be another Mac vs. PC thing where you can probably do more exotic things on the PC (Android in this case) but you pay a price for it with added complexity. The iPhone will offer a more seamless experience but you have to play by Apple's rules.",1258167329

That suggests the strategy: let each developer pick her own work rig. Give them a budget and maybe some suggestions, and let them spec and configure.<p>If the developers you're bringing on board are any good, they'll have a favourite OS / IDE / byzantine .vimrc / etc. By letting them use it, you'll gain in productivity, and - particularly if they've previously worked for BigCos with silly tools restrictions - you'll gain a lot in morale. In my experience the thrill of ""my employer bought me a shiny new Mac"" wears off after a month, whereas ""my employer encourages me to use the tools I'm best with"" provides ongoing job satisfaction.<p>Regarding the work/personal split, it sounds like what you're worried about is people wasting time at work, getting distracted, or otherwise being less productive. IMHO that's a motivation issue, not a hardware issue. Good developers with interesting problems to work on need to be reminded to eat, not trained to work harder.",1258167069

You don't get carte blanche to load forty terabyte files on a desktop app; you realize that your success depends on your ability to deliver a reliable app.<p>- Apple's HIG is actually pretty well-applied on OS X; from a strictly UI point of view I don't think they need to mandate you follow their stringent guidelines. Besides which, after the year or so of the AppStore in play, people have a good idea of what an ""iPhone app"" should look and feel like, which helps reinforce this.<p>- You can load up all kinds of filth, theoretically, on OS X. It happens. But it's not a big deal.<p>That said, I probably agree with your final point.

They're probably not. This argument starts from simple base premises and builds upward to a conclusion. It seems to me that most arguments pertaining to law, start with the conclusion and then circle it, surrounding it with (often disjointed and sometimes even contradictory) arguments until a pile large enough to ensure victory is amassed.

If you actually asked me for informational purposes, I'd have started with the Yellow Pages and then go look for a trade association or something.<p>On the other hand, that's not always practical. Sometimes the facts aren't readily to hand or you have to make some decision that's time sensitive. For example, working in film production it's not so unusual to have to eyeball something and estimate your needs for time or material - you try to anticipate as much of that as possible in advance, but say you come to the set one day and the lead actor has fallen ill, so now you have to rearrange your shooting schedule on the fly...in which case it's not uncommon for a few key crew members to huddle, deliberate, and then split the difference rather than obsess over further optimization.<p>This isn't to say one should rely heavily on gut decisions, since that's likely to be self-defeating; on the other hand,  you don't use a slide rule and protractor to drive.",1258164432

If you construct a rocket on the moon you've got no atmosphere and a fraction of the gravity to deal with.<p>No atmosphere might also make it useful for astronomy, but I'm not so sure of that.<p>EDIT: Wikipedia, of course, has a section on this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_base#Advantages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_base#Advantages</a><p>These points on their list:<p><i>A lunar base would provide an excellent site for any kind of observatory. Particular advantages arise from building observatory facilities on the Moon from lunar materials. As the Moon's rotation is so slow, visible light observatories could perform observations for days at a time. It is possible to maintain near-constant observations on a specific target with a string of such observatories spanning the circumference of the Moon. The fact that the Moon is geologically inactive along with the lack of widespread human activity results in a remarkable lack of mechanical disturbance, making it far easier to set up interferometric telescopes on the lunar surface, even at relatively high frequencies such as visible light.<p>A lunar base could also hold a future site for launching rockets, to distant planets such as Mars. Launching rockets from the Moon would be an easier prospect than on Earth due to the Moon's lower gravity requiring a lower escape velocity.</i>",1258164149

As you say, to really make this happen, you have to stop limiting the progress of HTML, and that means breaking out of the browsers.<p>But ... if you break out of the browsers, you fracture the platform, and that means you lose the incentive to make these apps web apps in the first place. If your HTML/JS/CSS stack isn't as platform and browser-agnostic as it can be, ultimately you end up with a platform-specific way of writing apps that competes with native apps, and that's a losing battle.<p>Putting that aside, I'm not sure there's case that all apps <i>should</i> be HTML/JS, either. We can do cool things with the web stack, but ultimately it's designed and optimised for sending pages and forms back and forth. We put up with that because there are a great many benefits in doing so, but there has to be a reason to write our apps that way -- reasons that things like iTunes and the Safari Web Inspector have, but lots of other desktop apps don't and won't.",1258164085
