He wrote, for example, confusing/obscure attacks on the value of philosophy itself. Not having any philosophical problems one is interested in or finds fruitful is completely understandable.

We had ~1000 machines on a  three year upgrade cycle, i.e., we upgraded 333 machines / year = $333k / year. Lets say I cost the company $200k / year. Several days = perhaps $2k, so I'd only need to get a .6% speedup for it to be worth it, not even including the cost of powering and maintaining our machines.<p>When I worked on it, our simulator was an order of magnitude faster than commercially available simulators (Synopsis VCS and Cadence NC-Verilog), which cost between $1k and $10k per license per year. I worked for a tiny hardware startup; established hardware companies use a few orders of magnitude more compute power than we did, so the equation is probably at least four orders of magnitude further in favor of doing assembly optimization in a commercial simulator.",1257144568

The paranoia is so prevalent they sound like two kids smoking up in a dorm room, they use no explanation and cite no information for the paranoia than 'its the man'. It's pathetic. It's a tech website and there's barely even a passing mention of the technological feasibility of this project, and what examination of the feasibility they have is very weak and based on poor assumptions.<p>The assumption that the NSA will have thousands of HDD permanently running is absurd. Quite literally 1 cubic meter of 50GB blu-ray discs easily stores ~2.75 petabytes of data at an expected lifespan of 10-100 years (this is based on pure physical dimensions alone, and not storage dimensions). A single 100 disk stack of 50GB BR discs should store ~4.8TB of data. This makes the mass storage solely dependent upon write capability rather than size requirements.",1257141615
