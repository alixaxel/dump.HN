962830,story,,,3,5,jbrun,"Ask HN: How to market test for new webapp",,"We are considering developing a webapp for some government reporting that is done by companies in Canada. Typically this reporting is done first in excel, then multiple sheets are compiled and then manually inputted to a government website.<p>The webapp would allow all the work to be done in one place - saving time. While this sounds like a good idea, the market is quite small - probably about 4000 industrial companies at most. We have been sending out emails to potential clients asking if such a product would interest them, but there has been little if any response. We have also placed Google Ads to see if anyone clicks through - few do.<p>Does the HN community have any ideas on how to test a new idea out without building the actual product. The app would only be used once a year and would have to work very well the first time around, so we cannot do a half-development and see if people start using it.<p>Thanks.<p>JB",1259254702
962829,comment,962694,962811,0,0,KirinDave,,,">  I know socialism doesn't work without either one of these articles.<p>You should share this proof with everyone. I certainly would love to see concrete proof for and against any general economic policies. The intricacies of such a proof would be fascinating in and of themselves, I'm sure.<p>And also, who was really critiquing religion here? The author is upset at people who are using incorrect information to reinforce an unsupported bias in their lives. He's clearly not Christian, but I don't think that he's arguing that this is a specific Christian belief or that Christians have a unique defect that makes it susceptible. It's just a matter of fact and coincidence that most people retelling this story are Christian Americans... their news has pushed this story harder and more loudly than any other.<p>My impression from the data you've given me so far: You think capitalism is better and you're not interested in arguments to the contrary. I cannot tell if you are being serious about socialism being obviously wrong or not.",1259254591

A top class restaurant still 'just' serves food, but you can't really compare it to Macdonalds.<p>And to many people, Apple <i>are</i> in a class of their own. If I didn't currently use a macbook, I'm not really sure what else I would use. Some of the Asus laptops look ok enough (At least like cheap copies of Apple design), and maybe Ubuntu is getting mature enough on the desktop to be useful, but there's not an obvious alternative.<p>Regarding ""I don't see the revolutionary part"", you don't have to be revolutionary to be better than everything else. People use Apple stuff because it works and is well thought out. It stays out of their way and lets them achieve what they want to. It's designed to make everything as seamless and useful for the user as is possible.<p>Some people just want a car to get them from A to B. So they buy a standard boring crappy Ford or something that looks like a dog. As long as it gets them from A to B, they're ok. Others actually love the 'driving' bit, and enjoy it, as well as having a thing of beauty. So they buy a better car. Same is true with computers (And most other things).",1259254585

The fact that you mentioned VB makes the story even funnier to me, because my department was frequently the victim of a code-and-run accountant who wrote awful Access apps (it's the worst code and data modeling I ever saw).

962823,comment,962530,962653,0,0,dannywoodz,,,"Agreed.  The system I worked on had scheduled releases every two weeks, with a smattering of emergency releases in between.  In some cases, simply being able to reliably price a given trade put you ahead of the competition, particularly in the exotics space, and could make or break a deal.<p>The big problem with a system like this is that, when faced with the do-it-right/do-it-fast dilemma, do-it-fast is what wins.  Too much of this can yield a brittle system as hacks pile on top of each other, so it helps to be able to slide 'proper' fixes into the trailing dev/test cycles.

962821,comment,962694,962787,0,0,kungfooguru,,,"I'm sorry, but your definition of socialism is entirely false. If anything that is the view of the liberal capitalist. That is, that some ""official"" can solve the problems and redistribution by this leader and his government will solve the problems of the world. They are wrong in this thinking.<p>Socialism means a change in the organization of production NOT the circulation of value. Its not the liberal idea of, well if we just had the right people deciding who to take from and who to give to it would be fine. It's the working class actually running society, which, like the ruling class does now, they would do for the benefit of the their class. And this is why it would ultimately feed everyone and house everyone and destroy racism, homophobia, sexism, etc. Those are products of the organization of production.<p>Marxism is about democracy. Democracy in the workplace. Votes no longer being about how much money you have. And I don't mean that just in the sense of political influence but voting in the capitalist ""supply and demand"" sense. It is hard to have a 'demand' vote if you have no money.<p>I'd lastly like to say that unlike a commune, in the sense of the Pilgrim commune, socialism does not mean if you are able to work and choose not to that you are fed.<p>I'm a member of the revolutionary Marxist organization the International Socialist Organization.

As far as I can see, this renders the station counts totally meaningless. It also means that we cannot say exactly how the gridded data is arrived at from a statistical perspective - since we're using an off-the-shelf product that isn't documented sufficiently to say that. Why this wasn't coded up in Fortran I don't know - time pressures perhaps? Was too much effort expended on homogenisation, that there wasn't enough time to write a gridding procedure? Of course, it's too late for me to fix it too. Meh.[1]</i><p>This is the climate model that is relied upon for public policy decisions in governments across the world. This is the model that will be used as the main arguing point for global warming in next months meeting of world leaders in Copenhagen to address the issue. This is basically the model that is responsible for political decisions that will relocate billions of dollars across the world.<p>And at least one of the programmers thinks it's rubbish and doesn't work.<p><i>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/24/taking_liberties/entry5761180.shtml*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/24/taking_liberties/ent...</a>",1259253802

Intellectual property is very bad. Antitrust laws are stupid. Minimum wage doesn't help the poor. Farmer subsidy in America is hurting comparative advantage and thus prosperity in other countries.<p>Even wars are bad.<p>""The direct use of force is such a poor solution to any problem, it is generally employed only by small children and large nations."" - David Friedman<p>Perhaps, socialism versus capitalism isn't so complicated people like to believe. Maybe it is a matter of ""socialism, bad and capitalism, good!"".<p>In capitalism, communes are allowed. Charity is allowed. There's no pretension that people can be transformed from greedy people to saint or that one government official can fix everything. Capitalism acknowledges failure when bubbles are busted, when the free market doesn't give anyone a job of some type, and when firms doesn't do their job efficiently.<p>However, socialism thinks everything could be fixed with a redistribution scheme of some sort. They think if they can elect the ""right"" official, everything will be alright. They think they know how to distribute resource correctly, and efficiently. They can be ""just"".<p>So, I go for capitalism every time. I am biased, alright, but I think the truth is that socialism versus capitalism are not as complicated as people like to think.",1259251999
