If the human activities at the airport location are causing an increase in temperatures at the airport, then that by definition is an increase in the temperature of the local climate.</i><p>Climate and local weather are not the same. If I build a parking lot the local temperature may increase by several degrees C on average, yet this represents an inconsequential change to the local climate within a radius of, say, 100km. More so, it represents an inconsequential change to the climate of the entire Earth. The significance of the urban heat island effect with relation to temperature records is that the proportion of weather stations which are affected by an increased urban heat island effect (due to increased urbanization) exceeds the percentage of the Earth affected by many orders of magnitude.<p>Yes, urban heat island effects can be accounted for, but I think the criticism is that for the most part they have not been.",1259265426

But this file would be one directory up from the project directory ... which is outside of your Django project. Django puts the directory one level up on your PYTHONPATH to compensate for this, with the assumption that part of your project lives outside of version-control, etc. The solution is to remember to put the directory above the directory that the project lives in version-control and treat it as part of the project.
