I don't want to take the effort to use the proper tool.""<p>The latter group sees themselves as being pretty reasonable. And perhaps they are. But the thing that exasperates the former group is that it is generally <i>not</i> quicker or easier to use regexps -- even for one-off jobs --- than using a nice parser like BS or lxml.<p>Those tools give you a object-view of the document which, as JGC demonstrated, allows you to express what you want to do concisely and easily, even (especially) when you're picking a few tags out of the document.<p>The reason why regex hacking on X/HTML documents remains popular isn't because it's 'easy' but because it doesn't require people knowing how to use the proper tools, nor does it require people to make the conceptual leap from the document as a long string of unstructured text to the document being a tree-structure of objects.<p>It's a classic ""The Wrong Way"" choice made by people who don't have a mechanical or conceptual understanding of the right way.<p>It's like this.

It's <i>much</i> harder, on top of doing a worse job.

Example - joining several items in a list so they're comma-separated. In python you do this:<p><pre><code>    print ', '.join( [1,2,3,4,5] )\n</code></pre>\nThe code doesn't work in the way someone new to the language thinks about the problem. I've trained two colleagues in the basics of python, and both of them gave me the ""what hope did I have of working that out?"" look when I showed them this.<p>In ruby you do this:<p><pre><code>    puts [1,2,3,4,5].join("", "")\n</code></pre>\nRuby avoids the whitespace debate but still manages to produce reasonably pretty code. You have to type 'end' (slightly more verbose), but you save on the colon at the beginning of the scope, and it's probably easier to write non-functional one-liners in ruby as a result. (I wouldn't know, I love my lambda :) )<p>Python's self keyword has the sitting-at-the-plugboard feel to it. So does __init__ - the token is ugly. Then there is the unfortunate 'super' syntax. Experienced python programmers rarely need or use it, but transitioning Java developers think in a way that leans on frequent superclassing. The python __name__ == '__main__' pattern is cryptic. Packaging mechanisms are ugly (again - something Java developers will be itching to use).<p>I suspect Ruby presents less culture clash if you come to it from Java, and is easier to get your head around if you come to it from PHP. Smalltalk isn't in the same domain as tools like perl, python, ruby. I think rails rode on the back of Ruby rather than the other way around - there was nothing revolutionary in rails, it was an enabler for Ruby.",1258395752

We did have a small collection of private beta users, FWIW.  There are some scattered issues, but the release is pretty solid.<p>These new features CAN drive a bill (though most of the users were surveyed who were interested in this feature were NOT billable folks, interestingly enough).  Given that the feature has existed for less than 1 business day, I think the chance of undermining business relationships is pretty darn slim.<p>Did I do something to offend you, Sean?  I can't QUITE tell if your comment is snarky or not.",1258394452

944883,comment,944734,944734,0,0,tsestrich,,,"It's very difficult to critique specifics without handing you back a physical paper with redlines on it. Generally, the grammar needs a lot of work, as does the tense (jumping back and forth between past and present), and the flow from paragraph to paragraph. A lot of sentences are actually sentence fragments, and a lot of times I feel like you're instant messaging me your thoughts rather than writing a story about them.<p>The content itself is entirely vague as well. Sentences such as ""OK if you eliminate the fact that he was a researcher of math at\nthe age of 25, but what do you know, he was actually _the_ math genius."" just confuse me and make it difficult to read. Saying ""OK"" as if I just called you out on something just does not seem right for anything except dialog (OK, maybe not all the time, but pick your places).<p>Saying ""It wasn't just numbers, same was true for logic, innovation,\nability to ask the awkward question, and then solving the hell out of them."" is such an awkward way of introducing someone. You're building this person up so much in such a short amount of time, I have a hard time believing any of it (it's not true, but you need to be able to suspend disbelief). I've always learned that you should never ever ever tell your reader an opinion about something... that's ""meta-story"". Let your reader determine that he is a super genius if that's what he is, but don't tell them all these super-human things he can do... it sounds like a kid describing his action heroes. What you need to do is build up the character's credibility as the story flows, not wind up the character like a toy and let him run through the story.<p>The first few paragraphs of the story really need to pull a reader in to make them want to read more, and what I see in the first few is ""another story about the future"". I don't really see a character at first, and that's a big minus to me. I don't really want to read about a list of things that are true in your future, I want to read about the people in that future, and let the way they interact with their world describe what the world is like.<p>""He used a lisp program for all this stuff.He had read in school that it\nwas one of the most oldest languages around but never belived that,it had the most advanced\nfeatures."" -- This contains detail that is not really pertinent to the story... not sure why it's really in there. In stark contrast to that specific technical detail, it seems odd that among all the other ""future-y"" stuff, it still takes long enough to collate some Google search results into a database that he is able to read a book (about more things that are too technically detailed).<p>Adding to this... ""By this time the database was over with indexing and he was presented with a\nnice command prompt on his DataBaseLinux machine."" is like saying ""he raced to his car and drove to the store. his car was blue. he was sad to discover that the store was closed, however, so he could not buy the Sony 42"" LCD TV with support for Dolby 5.1 surround sound built in that he was looking for"". The key here is not that detail is bad, but you need to be consistent, and it has to be relevant detail. You need to expand on the parts that make the story human, and really cut down on the parts that make it technical.<p>Stylistically, I personally would not go into a story attempting to point out ""this is like this in the future!"" every chance I got. Specifically, it seems irrelevant that DRM is not an issue in the future, and it would confuse the hell out of a reader that was not familiar with the subject.<p>More comments to come likely, as I get some time to dig deeper.<p>EDIT: Sorry... if this is indeed a language barrier issue, that would explain a lot about the style comments I had. I then agree with khafra's comment. Otherwise there is a lot to discuss here. However, sentences such as ""He didn't really\nthought about robots , but he did knew that his secretary robot was a good talk."" makes me think the former is the case.",1258394402
