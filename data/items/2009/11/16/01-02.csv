MegaHAL will do just fine.

943680,comment,943380,943380,0,0,gruseom,,,"I find it interesting that you (implicitly) like Data Munging better than Clever Algorithms. I agree that the former is orders of magnitude more common. I haven't encountered a Clever Algorithms problem very often at all on commercial projects. My current project is an outlier insofar as we've been doing algorithmic work for months. It's fun, in the way any good hacker would expect such a challenge to be, but it's also stressful to work on something for a long time and not know for sure whether you'll end up with a solution. (Especially when the context is a startup and not a research project.) It's much easier when you know for sure you can get there, you just have to figure out how. Thankfully, the Algorithms category gets more and more fun as you knock off significant chunks of the problem. Once you see the light at the end of the tunnel, you're home free. Unless, of course, you got it wrong. :)<p>Edit: by the way, do you actually use APL/J/K in the way you mentioned? I really like that paradigm. I think it deserves a place alongside OO and the others as a fundamentally different approach to programming. However, I haven't used it nearly enough.<p>Edit 2: I would distinguish two different kinds of Data Munging. One is Data Transformation, where you have data in some original context and it needs to go through a series of transformations or passes until you've extracted or computed what's suitable for your problem. That is way fun. The other type, though, sucks rocks. I call it Meat Grinding. That's when you have the <i>exact data you need</i> in a form that you can't use because of some purely technical limitation. A common example is you have data in a database or a DTO when what your code need is a domain object, so you have to copy the properties over like this:<p><pre><code>  myStupidObject.CustomerName = stupidDataObject.CustomerName\n</code></pre>\nThis isn't so much a programming problem as an integration one. (You sort of touch on it at the end.) It's also one of the worst things about programming in less powerful languages where you can't easily write a program to do the gruntwork for you.<p>Edit 3: I'd also argue that your ""API spelunking"" nightmare is at its nastiest in OO systems. In poorly designed pre-OO APIs (like Win32), it might take a long time to figure out how to call a function or what to do next; there might have been some ugly one-off struct you had to populate, etc.; but at least you didn't have to figure out how the hell to make a Bar out of a Foo so you can pass it as the third argument to Baz, when neither Foo nor Bar has anything to do with your problem. But with poorly designed OO APIs, these absurd hurdles seem endless. I used to compensate for this by studying such code archaeologically (if I couldn't avoid it altogether), in order to learn how the absurdities had arisen over time. This was a way to escape Dostoevsky's definition of the easiest way to drive a man insane: make him move a pile of dirt from one end of a prison yard to another <i>and then move it back</i>.",1258334021

I've once fed it 20k+ posts from an online game I was playing, basically the whole usergenerated story and put it online in the game's IRC channel. And as it is, the users indulged in nostalgia every now and then, which triggered the bot to happily tell about old times. :)",1258334009

943672,comment,943356,943633,0,0,pnorvig,,,"I think that when I was in grad school, Lisp was unique in the power it brought for the type of exploratory programming that was necessary for AI.  I think that today Lisp is still a great choice, but there are other choices that are also good---as you say, other languages have incorporated many (but not all) of the good parts of Lisp, so that today the choice of language can be made based on other factors.: for example, what language do you already know, do your friends know, etc.<p>There is a lot of content in an AI course, and I didn't think it made sense for an instructor to take a week or two out of the semester to teach Lisp, so we added Java and Python support.  Java because it is widely-known, and Python because it is fairly widely-known and because, of all the languages I know, it happens to be closest to the pseudocode we invented in the book.<p>I never programmed at a serious level in Prolog, so I'll let other people comment on that.",1258333759

It seems there are 2 diametrically opposed camps, to which to you ascribe to?<p>1) Use customer testing/validation (e.g., A/B, #leanstartup, et.al.) to drive design & feature decisions.  Your job as the developer is to only iterate quickly and have a fast feedback loop incorporating their input.  Prominent example: Google/Marissa.<p>2) Users don't know what they want (especially when it comes to ""new"" product categories that don't fit nicely into a pre-existing frame of reference) and so you must develop your own Design sense and intuition.
