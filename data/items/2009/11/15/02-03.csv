Until that happens, Apple and others will continue developing treats to entice them.<p>Consider the recording industry. Apple had to use DRM that made purchases feel like the familiar single copy sale of the industry. Eventually the music industry got over that and adapted to unlocked sales.<p>The television networks or studios will be happier with ads in their internet distributed product, since it is how they work. Maybe they will get over it with time and accept a model that people prefer, or maybe people will prefer to serve the advertisers instead of paying for the content. Time will tell.",1258253812

However, the act of arguing this point, if seriously engaged in by enough people, would, in fact, make the question (and the answer) notable, and thus the answer to the question would deserve inclusion in Wikipedia.<p>Inductively, you can use this argument to show every subject is notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia.

I'm not sure kids are primed to learn strict definitions of things but maybe we could find a way... it would be difficult though because their parents generally won't know abstract algebra.  Counting is easier to teach because it comes up at home and at school, but the kids would be learning different things at different places.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, lots of kids learn English at school and a different language at home.<p>Edit: The kids difficulty with strict definitions could be a good thing.  Having a feel for whats going on without being restricted to the definitions could lead to new discoveries.<p>Should we do this?<p>I'm not sure this is a good thing though.  I love abstract algebra and think its great fun and is, as far as I know, very useful in parts of science (I believe material science uses group theory).  However, delaying the time when kids learn to add and count and do concrete math means they learn things they need for life later.<p>Edit: I'm reminded of this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=618972"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=618972</a>",1258251392

It's impressive how Apple used to go back and optimize things for G3s, while G4s and G5s were the latest models.  Each model is practically running its own OS.<p>So the last thing Apple needs is for their OS to run on hardware that they've never heard of.  If something goes wrong because of hardware, it tends to manifest itself as a freezing or crashing machine.
