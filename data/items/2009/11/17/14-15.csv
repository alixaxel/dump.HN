The inspiration clearly comes from the movie industry where admittedly, you don't make a movie in small iterations. As it stands now, triple-A titles have to make it to the top ten to be profitable due to extreme development costs which drives up marketing prices which in turn drives up the price of the games to the consumer.

Some of the best wines I've ever had were South American bought as one-offs for $10-15 though much of the enjoyment came from the novelty. Much better than honing your pallet to the taste of expensive wine is to learn to pair wines with food. Learn what varietals you like and then play with foods spicy, sweet, and sour. The most enjoyment from wine comes from learning how the tastes combine and change wildly.<p>Pairing wine is a game of combinatorics. The tricks tend to be to maximize the number of other flavors you can try with your wine. In this way, you can transform a single bottle into 3 or more different flavors. Some tricks:<p>Bread, cheese, and wine is a common thing but don't go overboard on the bread. Much of the time the heavy starch is going to wipe out the flavors. Invest in more variety in the wines and cheeses.<p>Spice comes in many, many varieties (from peppercorn to bright red ground cayenne, to Chinese sichuan pepper) and each one often has a different reaction with wines.<p>Steak and wine is a great combination because well-prepared meats have tons of interesting flavors thanks to the ""maillard reaction"".

If you don't like it, you go to a different store.  With wine, you have to wait until you get home with the bottle.  And even if you find a good wine, you have no idea if it will be the same year to year, or even a few months later.  You have no idea when marketdroids are going to convince the executives to cash in on the name.

It's interesting for novelty value, but that's about it.<p>I'm definitely in the same boat as you: at various times over the past 5 years or so I have scored as INTP, ENTP and ISTP, so in both our cases, test-retest reliability is an issue.
