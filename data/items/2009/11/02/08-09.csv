The humans at Google lose control of their business as automation increasingly leaches more money from any business possible. It becomes harder and harder for the Google humans to unwind each ad transaction to determine whether the ad leads people into scams. Users start to step back from their engagement with Google. Alternatives begin to get traction. Humans at Google start to become alarmed. As a defense against the power of the AI, Google transitions over to a new system and allows the old data to fossilize. The new system allows for a higher degree of human input, though it's still not under human control. At this critical point, competitors move in and take away a lot of the market from Google.",1257151199
916434,comment,916221,916221,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This reminds me a little of how Shaka Zulu broke from rituals to conquer most of sub-Saharan Africa. Shaka was one of the most effective African generals and conquerers in recorded history, because he changed the nature of African warfare very quickly.<p>Basically, pre-Shaka, warfare was a ritualized thing in the area. The tribes would take throwing spears and stand on two hilltops facing each other, and threw spears and shout at each other until one side gave up and fled. The conflicts would create injuries, but not so many fatalities.<p>Shaka moved to a more shock troop charge style of attack. He outfitted his guys with large, wooden shields, and short, heavy spears that could slash or stab. So when the other side lined up to fight ritually, Shaka charged and would have his side massacre the other.<p>Normally you'd see the other sides adapt, but he brutalized and then assimilated his enemies very quickly so they couldn't adjust to his tactics. He swept through Africa conquering very quickly.<p>This has been seen many times throughout history - basically, the side of the war that fights with less rules, wins. But normally, if the other side realizes you're not fighting a gentlemanly ritual any more, they adapt. Yet a few military men in history moved so fast that their opponents couldn't adapt. Shaka, Alexander, and Genghis Khan are the first three examples that come to mind - they fought relatively dirty, breaking rituals and customs of warfare with new equipment, a more brutal focus, and immediately assimilating or executing prisoners of the defeated. Because they moved so fast, and all the survivors became either new recruits or were killed, there was no time for an organized, adapted resistance. That's how those guys were able to take such large amounts of land in short amounts of time.<p>The ironic part is that the kind of personality that'll do that rarely knows restraint, so they overextend themselves and have their empires die after their usually premature death.",1257151170

Maybe it is a common view, but I have never seen it supported.  To begin with, it would be necessary to show precisely what previous philosophy had done to contribute to ""understanding of our world"".  That very phrase, which is being wielded so causally to criticize analytic philosophy, is precisely the sort of idea that analytic philosophy would handle much more carefully...<p>To my mind, Wittgenstein's work is actually incredibly helpful, because it helps clear up deep linguistic confusions... confusions that have inhibited real progress in philosophy.",1257150003
