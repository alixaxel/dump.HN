And if the trend in whatever money you make per 1k of visitors is consistently downward, I will be really worried. While it may not provide actionable insights (that is what bounce rate and conversion rates are for), I don't see why you should not be concerned about LTV at all. What you are saying is that one <i>cannot</i> increase visitor value while increasing total traffic? Hence arent concerned about per visitor value as long as your bottomline is quadrupled. Do you think your bottomline would have swollen even more if $80/k visits didn't drop to $72/k visits. Or you think it wasn't possible because traffic increased and one cannot maintain the visitor value as before?<p>Having an eye at individual conversion rates is better than having an aggregate conversion rates. Definitely I agree with you on this. However, people tend to cling on to aggregate numbers because brain can hold limited information at a time. Better to have a vague idea of what is happening than no idea at all :)",1257148517

916398,comment,916221,916221,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"the escalation of war throughout modern history, culminating in the world wars, is a fascinating subject.  the methodology of total war is so alien to the human psyche that it requires quite a bit of brain washing and careful planning, and even then you constantly have to maintain it via a strict hierarchy, lest you get the sort of unspoken agreements between sides as discussed extensively in the article.  the escalation to total war was caused by at least three things:<p>1. the growth of government as a percentage of GDP (more efficient taxation and indoctrination) allowed ever greater a nation's economic output to be turned to aggression.  see Bertrand de Jouvenal's excellent <i>On Power</i> for a lengthy dissertation on this subject.<p>2. the slow change from a multi-polar to bi-polar power arrangement.  in the animal kingdom you will see ""posture fighting"" between contesting males where little actual damage is done.  This is because a real fight is disastrous, even for the male who wins since he may be weakened so much that he can not now defend himself against a third male who will swoop in on this opportunity.  Likewise with a multi-polar power arrangement.  No one nation will devote tons of resources to a total war with another because doing so will weaken both with regards to other nations.  what we see in pack animals (including primates) is that aggression generally only occurs when one side has overwhelming advantage (5 vs 1) and thus can act without reprisal.  larger fights, while rarer, usually end when one side gets a kill.  why doesn't the winning side press the advantage?  again, the risk is large for an uncertain payoff.<p>3. of course, technology.  this one is harped on by so many history channel shows that I feel no need to go into it.",1257148272

The only simple thing about assembly is that it happens to map to machine code directly, but macros and quasi-instructions even make that iffy.  There are so many idiosyncrasies in every ISA, so many ways in which the code you write has side effects.  Assembly isn't just complex in practice, it's complex in concept.<p>If you want simplicity, you look at lisps; homoiconicity is perhaps the most elegant, simple concept known in computing.

I am sorry and will not repeat these numbers again.<p>Here's my thinking:<p>At a point in the past I made $80 for every 1k visitors to my website.  In October, I made $72 for every 1k visitors to my website.  (Some folks would call these figures eCPMs.)<p>Now we come to the crucial question to ask about any metric: <i>does this provide actionable insights</i>?  Can you say, looking at those numbers, that I was doing better in the past than I did in October?  Well, I suppose you could, but you'd be wrong: I've <i>quadrupled</i> the bottom line since then.  The difference in the two eCPMs is driven largely by the effectiveness of my Halloween promotions, which brought in lots of paying customers mixed in with a larger-than-usual horde of folks who did not happen to pay me money.<p>Incidentally, I totally agree with you with regards to page views and visitor numbers: meaningless.<p>Incidentally: aggregating your statistics over multiple sources of traffic tends to blunt their utility.  I tend to watch conversion rates like a freaking hawk, for example.  However, even these are fairly useless as aggregate numbers.  For example, consider that I have two sources of traffic which convert, a priori, at 10% and 20%.  My traffic mix is 50:50.  This will produce a sitewide conversion rate of 15%.  Now increase the absolute count of visitors from the first source by 20% (maybe I did well at SEO this month), and my sitewide conversion rate falls to 14.54%.  Looking at the conversion metric tells you you're doing something wrong, looking at your wallet tells you you're doing something right.  <i>The wallet wins.</i><p>This isn't just a theoretical issue, it comes up at the Business of Software boards all the time, and causes needless anxiety among software developers who know just enough about optimization to hurt themselves.<p>Edited to continue:<p>So what do I think about tracking LTV?  Well, subject it to the metrics acid test: does it give you actionable insights?<p>I think sitewide LTV does not give you actionable insights.  Sometimes LTV going up is a good thing.  Sometimes LTV going down is a good thing.  (Many startups here will see LTV <i>plummet</i> at a point in their lifecycle.  It is colloquially known as ""crossing the chasm"".)<p>However, with a sufficiently advanced testing system, you could probably use LTV effectively.  For example, if you could split test customers across a cohort and compare LTV for the groups versus the conditions you exposed them to, that might be worthwhile information.  (Example: suppose you're Joe Random Subscription Billing Service.  You could create a cohort out of everyone signed up in the last three days, then randomly apportion them into two groups.  Group A will receive no treatment.  Group B will receive an email right before their next cycle offering them a 50% discount if they upgrade to the next service level.  Six months from now you measure their LTVs.  <i>Those</i> LTVs could, potentially, be meaningful.)",1257147457

916364,comment,916265,916318,0,0,patio11,,,"The problem is not so much with the affiliate marketing channel and more with the fact that you're, fundamentally, trying to extract money -- that is, hard US currency -- out of someone who is unwilling to pay money for your service.  There are no two ways around this for the Facebook game case: at the end of the day, someone has to pay.  It has to be the user, or someone selling something to the user.  But the user can't legitimately buy anything.  So if you're paying to advertise something to that user, you're either a) stupid and going to be exiting the market shortly or b) intent on scamming them.<p>It amazes me how little people who putatively work in businesses on the Internet understand about Internet marketing.  I understand, given that it often resembles Satan's seedy underbelly, but if you are involved in marketing on the Internet (do you sell ad inventory?  Congrats, welcome to the party) you need to understand at least this much: there is no legitimate way to extract $X from users who don't have $X to spend.<p>Everything else in the discussion is, like Jason from Hot or Not said, a smokescreen.<p>Incidentally, affiliate marketing makes the most sense for products which have extraordinarily high margins.  Those are the ones in which the advertiser/vendor has the most amount of money to split with his affiliate, who then has the most amount of money to pay for traffic acquisition (by paying FarmVille or some intermediary service or buying AdWords or whatever).  There are many legitimate products which have high margins associated with them -- software, for example -- but the field also tends to attract scams.<p>Software is actually almost the perfect legitimate affiliate good, because the margin for downloadable software is essentially 100% less transactional costs.  If you don't see software offers, you can be pretty sure that the scams have taken over.  Why don't you see software offers?  Two reasons: you can't outcompete the vendor and affiliates (in this scenario) add essentially no value so as soon as there are two of them they'll bid away all their profits.  (Edit to add: there are scenarios outside the scope of ScamVille in which an affiliate can actually add value.  Ask me some other time.)<p>For example, pretend I offered you $15 to generate sales of my $30 software.  If I had exactly one affiliate, and they paid some World of Dragonfarming Online game to give dragon eggs to people who bought my software, they might be able to pay $5 for dragon eggs to generate the $30 sale ($15 commission) and keep $10.  However, as soon as I have two affiliates, the market collapses instantly, because both players outbid each other: affiliate #2 offers $6 in dragon eggs, affiliate #1 offers $7 ... somebody gets to $15 and the affiliates find themselves disintermediated.  (Note that I could, incidentally, buy the eggs myself if you prove that this concept works, and I will always be able to outbid you because I make ~$29 per sale, not $15.  Affiliates hate this, mostly because it happens so often.)<p>Do you see how the math virtually demands that there is no honest money to be made in this, even selling a good which is the paradigmatic best case for the model?  That, plus the fact that very few Facebookers want to actually fork over $30 for their dragon eggs, is why the dishonest money always wins out.<p>Further note: the best point in the article is the one about mixing different streams of traffic together.  It is like a dishonest factory which cuts their hamburgers with sawdust.  (The Jungle, for the information age.)",1257146014
