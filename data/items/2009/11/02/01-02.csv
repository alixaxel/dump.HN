I can't think of any good reason why this would be the case, he is obviously a smart guy, StackOverflow is brilliant.  Maybe it's the tone of how he writes stuff or maybe it's because he seems to be a Microsoft sympathizer, neither of which are good reasons.<p>It's totally irrational but I get that gut feeling a lot with him.  Am I the only one?  Any other ideas why?",1257127092

Illustrative examples;<p>When dealing with a drug addict, I will not attempt to capitalise on who they are as a person by selling them more drugs, even if this would by definition ""propel them further on towards their own goals, and by their subjective definition, their potential"".<p>From my perspective, doing such a thing may potentially result in commercial advantages for me but I would think the action of exploiting this desire in the target human would be exploitative, so I would not do it. I believe that likely the best thing that I could do for such a person would be to avoid them entirely, as they are entangled in a local maximum from which they do not desire an escape.<p>I have never engaged with anyone with the view to trying to ""better"" them purely from my own perspective, I believe that such a thing would not be fair to the other party, especially when direct deception is involved indicating in which fashion I intend to benefit from my part in the transaction.<p>I am comfortable with not telling all of the truth all of the time, but I am utterly uncomfortable with any degree of fabrication. I want to either interact honestly or disengage entirely.<p>I'm comfortable with assisting people toward goals that I don't feel are utterly counterproductive to their development to a very obvious and damaging degree, even if those are goals that I would find quite neutral.",1257126327

Sure, it's also quite common. The original comment was unkindly short, but however it was meant, it was accurate. You've said yourself: ""growing misanthropy and detachment"". These are psychological problems. Not intellectually, but emotionally and socially. I don't know whether a particular psychologist would actually help, but I agree with your own assessment that they do ""not serve my interests in the long run"". In other words, you are quite clear that they are a <i>problem</i>.<p>Seeing a psychologist is one step towards doing something about it, that might help. Unfortunately, your misanthropy immediately gets in the way: you would have to at least entertain the notion that someone else does have insights that you don't. So, you're in a difficult situation because the nature of your problem prevents you from getting help with it.<p>But unless you take some kind of action (perhaps thinking of it as an experimental trial, or maybe finding an aspect or form of it that you are willing to entertain), things aren't going to improve. They'll get worse.<p><i>EDIT</i> silly me, I meant to reply in the thread with the line ""You lack the capacity to spell sheer, your attempt at philosophical hegemony is quaint. Go see an educator.""

It's not like they are making big profits -- look at the balance sheets of the public universities some time.<p>They can pay less (and in some cases are), but it is hard to attract strong academic talent that way.
