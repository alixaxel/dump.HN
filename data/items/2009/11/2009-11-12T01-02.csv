If we hired you as a new employee, and in the course of cutting your teeth on our Java framework you made those errors, I think Eclipse would have caught exactly one of them.<p>Routes.rb errors 1 and 2: sorry, this is either handled in a configuration file or the database, which is loaded from an XLS file in our framework.  None of this is checked.<p>Linking to non-existent pages: we don't actually have a URL generation helper, but if we did, it would be in the JSP and thus not subject to fast checking.  Since in Java you'd be passing a string as a parameter rather than an automatically generated method, you'd get nothing useful here prior to actually clicking on the link and finding it didn't go anywhere.<p>Misspelling confirm: This would be caught in your JSP compile step prior to deploying the server, although you'd still waste a minute.<p>Mistyped property names: OH GOD do I hate this one.  You'll get as far as any page done by that action without error.  Then the action gets loaded and the fun begins.  Typically you'll get an error telling you that a form is not defined , which is your cue that says ""Check the contents of the annotations for this action, something is borked"", but if you don't know that symptom or (worse) if you borked something in one of the fields where the page can still load, you'd either waste a lot of time or miss the bug entirely.  (For example, in our system, one way of causing this bug would leave ""name"" totally unchecked but let the form submission succeed for good input.  Since many of our outsourcers don't bother testing with bad input...)<p>Misspelled formats: We don't even have this feature.  (P.S. I don't know why Rails books and tutorials always emphasize this so much, since most people <i>don't need it</i>.  I always just delete that code from my own Rails methods.)<p>Botching the key to a parameters access: Since the key is a string and there is no way to tell whether Map#contains(""arbitrary string"") at compile time, you'll get as far as execution before seeing any error here.

The odds are very high that someone new ahead of time.<p>The same thing happens in the options market. The COMS options market is relatively dull. It doesn't trade much, and there are not that many contracts open. Then all of a sudden a player goes out and buys 6,000 calls, half of which expire in 10 days.

A call option to buy the stock for the fixed price of $5 (until it expired next Friday) sold for 80 cents when the market closed.<p>* 3Com is up 2 bucks (35%) in the after market. The value of that call option will increase by around that mount. So the price of the option went up from 0.80 to ~2.80. That is an increase of 250%, which is way higher than 35%. This leverage is one reason people trade options.<p>* The option buyer used a market order (""bought on the ask"") to buy a <i>ton</i> of options, which is executed immediately at current market price. More cautious buyers tend to use a limit order in markets that don't trade a lot (like this one). A limit order will buy at no more, or sell at no less, than a specific price. This will move the market price less.<p>* Given that the acquisition was announced later today, this large order of options is suspicious.

If you type in invalid identifiers, no programming language or web framework is going to be very happy with you.

If you're lucky and using Java, you typed in an invalid identifier in such a way that the project fails to compile, and Eclipse will give you little red squiggles.  (If you're not lucky, you get an undescriptive error message thrown up from a 700 line stack trace and have to guess what caused it then spend 30 seconds redeploying to see if you guessed right.

I won the lottery the day I emerged from the womb by being in the United States instead of in some other country where my chances would have been way different.<p>This isn't true - the odds of Warren Buffet being born in America, given that his parents were American and had him, were 100%. There's no random chance associated with where you're born - it was the result of what your parents and their parents did. They worked hard to get over to the States, or wherever else, and to make a good life for their kids.<p>Actually, that whole viewpoint that's come into fashion these days worries me a little. Before, one of the biggest ethics to live for was ""making life better for your children"" - you'd work hard, and sacrifice, knowing your kids would have a better life than you did. It's what my Great-Grandparents did, what my Grandparents did, what my Parents did. All came up poor, I came up lower middle class, my kids will probably come up reasonably wealthy.<p>But nowadays, a lot of people write that off as the ""birth lottery"", or luck, or chance, and think that happiness in your own life, right now, is the highest virtue. They even <i>almost</i> look at it as a bad thing for parents to work very hard for their kids specifically to have the best life they could, calling it things like a birth lottery or random chance. There's nothing random about why I was born in the States, or why my kids will be - it was a direct result of five or six generations of slogging towards a better life from miserable conditions elsewhere.",1257988668

By their inherited wealth, scions of prominent families can exercise significant power over the rest of the nation, and this power will tend to be exercised to the detriment of meritocracy, since a system that rewards talent and energy runs exactly contrary to the interests of the inherited-wealth class. (Humans care about <i>relative</i> wealth and power socially, even though absolute wealth production is not a zero-sum game)<p>However, it is true that being able to pass on wealth to one's children can be an incentive to produce more, so <i>that</i> on the other hand points to the benefit of a lower estate tax.<p>So, I think the best compromise is somewhere between the pro-meritocracy 100% tax and the pro-short-term-productivity 0% tax; that way there is still a significant incentive to earn for one's offspring, but if 1/x of the money is taxed away in each generation (and the important thing is not where it goes, but that it is taken out of the hands of the rich family), there is an exponential-decay curve for the wealth and power of the family. However, it's important that the tax is high enough to counteract the interest gains that even uninspired investing can bring.
