Ideally I'm looking for high-dollar questions, in either CS or mathematics (fields in which I am knowledgeable), that need answers.  I can sort by cost, (ascending cost is first? wtf?) but I get a lot of ""deadline expired"" questions.  If I sort by ""deadline"", I lose the cost sort, which isn't what I want.  I can filter by one field at a time, but not, say, the union of CS and math.  As an answerer, seeing questions that already have answers or that the deadline has expired is totally worthless to me.  People wanting answers to a specific question will probably come through Google anyway, rather than searching your site directly.<p>3.

942038,comment,941843,941953,0,0,ekiru,,,"> There is value in static checking for some things, but it is also limiting.<p>Other than type-safe heterogenous lists(which is only true if you hold static type systems to a much higher standard of type-safety than dynamic type systems), what sorts of things do a type system with type classes, algebraic data types, and higher order functions prevent doing?<p>> Lisps can and do have powerful type systems - you're confusing dynamic with none at all.<p>Common Lisp has a powerful object system and dispatch scheme, but it isn't as powerful as Haskell's type system. Type classes provide compile-time multi-methods which can be every bit as dynamic as CLOS's when needed, but which are statically checked as much as is possible. In addition, type classes make it possible to dispatch not just on argument type but also on return type. How do you write a Common Lisp function which polymorphicly converts an integer to whatever type you need? This is admittedly a bit of a weak example, but polymorphic conversions like this can probably be useful(for example, you could use it to implement a somewhat inefficient heterogenous list).<p>In Haskell(I'm not very familiar with Haskell, but my testing indicates that this would work):
  class FromInt t where
    fromInt :: Integer -> t<p>Haskell also has parameterized types, which aren't as needed in dynamic type systems, but that relative lack of need is only because a dynamic type systems considers a program that calls a method which doesn't work on an object's type at runtime to be type-safe.<p>In a statically typed language with type classes and sufficiently powerful syntactic macros, it would be possible to conveniently defer to dynamic type checking in way that would type-check statically. The macros are only necessary for the convenience part. Otherwise, you'd have to create a lot of type classes for every type you wanted to use dynamically. With macros, you could just include the creation of the appropriate classes in the form that defines a new type. In fact, it could be built into the language making even macros unnecessary.",1258228352

942014,comment,941843,941891,0,0,jerf,,,"I think Lisp's philosophy, as explained by Paul Graham (perhaps you've heard of him :) ), is to enable the programmer to do anything they put their mind to. When choosing whether to do the powerful thing or the simpler thing, they will choose the thing that gives the programmers more power, and point out (not entirely incorrectly) that they can wrap up simpler versions for simpler cases with macros.<p>As a skilled developer, I certainly prefer this philosophy to the Java philosophy of ""If the feature might be abused, leave it out."" (Obviously, I simplify that, but there's a lot of truth there.) But I don't think it's the right way to think of languages as we go forth, and I don't think it can scale as we go forward.<p>Instead of seeing languages in terms of what they permit, I see them in terms of what they deny. In particular, what invariants do they maintain? Now, that might seem an odd way of looking at it, but what it is is support for the next question: What do languages <i>build</i> on top of this invariant?<p>All the languages that I am currently interested in, and all the ones that I think provide the way forward, maintain invariants that Lisp does not let you maintain, precisely <i>because</i> it gives the Lisp programmer too much power. One obvious example: You can't ""mutable lisp"" your way into a language that has immutable variables <i>all the time</i>. If the language provides for mutation, even if you program in a strictly immutable subset of the language, your libraries, including your very base libraries that make up the ""runtime"", are likely to be mutation-based. (Getting around this might be possible but hardly worth it.) Erlang builds a huge runtime around having such pervasive immutability, and while mutable Lisps can borrow large swathes of Erlang's libraries and capabilities, they are incapable of providing a guarantee at the language level that no function you ever call will mutate a value out from underneath you. Erlang is a great example of building on quite a few invariants (read ""programmer limitations"") and producing things that are harder and/or impossible without them.<p>Another example: Type system. Lisp certainly lets you layer type systems on top of your language, but without enforcement by the language, there's a barrier as to how much you can take advantage of it. What the ML family does with types is not something you can add to a Lisp and end up with the same thing you get with native language support. You can come close, but there's a final level of integration or loop-closing (don't have a clean word for this concept) that you can not get to.<p>Smaller example: Haskell's laziness. You can add laziness constructs to a strict language (see also: Python generators), but you can not macro your way to a fully-lazy language starting with a strict one, at least not in any reasonable manner. (This feature excites me much less, but it's another example of something you have to start with.)<p>When the entire philosophy is about empowerment, you close the doors to a lot of things that can only be obtained by carefully-selected <i>dis</i>empowerment of the programmer, most of which are fringe right now, but which I think will become more important over the future. Truly ultimate power only comes from assembler; languages give you their power by restricting the assembler they can generate.<p>In the single programmer case, especially the mature single programmer case, ""more power"" may be a great thing, but I think it breaks down pretty quickly as you get more people involved, especially as you get less-than-experts involved, and I think a lot of Lisp's failures to take over the world come from this basic issue, and some second-order effects.<p>What I want to close with is something I already said: Certainly, if I had to choose between a conventional Java-style B&D language or Lisp, I'd take Lisp. But the interesting action is occurring in the fields dominated by constraining the programmer: parallel programming developments, STM, immutability and/or banning shared memory, and potentially other interesting things that all involve first taking things from programmers, then building on the resulting invariants that things like Lisp or Perl or Ruby make a big point of <i>not</i> constraining you with. (I'm interested in type-safe string manipulations to ban XSS at the type level, for instance.) There are Lisps doing those things, but notice precisely that they have to be built in at the language level; you can't just macro your way to Clojure's STM. (And if that does happen to be how it is implemented, I'd run screaming; STM isn't very useful unless it is a <i>very</i> strong guarantee. And any connection with other JVM libraries will be very hard, too.)",1258227254

If a topic does not interest you, you will forever remain oblivious to it, except maybe for some tangential news about it that reach you by accident.<p>It's naive to think that just because you're a programmer you know everything there is to know about the software industry. You don't. You know about a small fraction of the <i>mainstream</i> development <i>tools</i>, and even those, at a superficial level. For example, can you name the top software products for running local elections? how about automating a chemistry research lab? packages for oil exploration? vacation property management? real-time spoken Chinese processing? computational archeology? artist talent management? threat modeling for distributed corporate networks?<p>See? :-)<p>""Social"" programmers, the guys you see in chat rooms and ""community"" websites are all mostly generalists, and typically work in well defined roles as grunt programmers.

941976,comment,940382,940382,0,0,NateLawson,,,"I'll identify one problem that the Internet ca. 1997 did not have: excessive discussion site mobility. If I wanted security information, I subscribed to one mailing list, Bugtraq. (Ok, I toyed with Firewalls@GreatCircle and a few others, but they were a waste of time). I read comp.security.unix and sci.crypt. These never migrated. I never had to unsubscribe from Bugtraq and move to ""new cybersecurity"" or any other crap.<p>Contrast that to post-1997. You had a brief blip of SecurityFocus around 1999, and in 2003 it began fragmenting into a myriad of blogs. For tech news, we saw the migration of slashdot/digg/reddit/HN. Each time they grew, lost focus, and people with words worth reading moved on.<p>Bugtraq is around today but I do not read it. Take each minor bug report and multiply it by X-dozen vendor echo bulletins and it becomes unbearable. HN is on the verge of falling into the political trap of digg.<p>Meanwhile, random blogs pop up, have some useful posts for < 1 year and then die off or evolve into navel-gazing and I unsubscribe. An RSS reader is useless to find new blogs. I'll sit out twitter until it turns into a ghost town in a few years, thanks.<p>The BBS was great for locality. You knew most people on it because it was extremely local. Earlier Usenet was the same, just organized by topic instead of location. I contend that the web replacement for these has not yet arrived.<p>Craigslist or random PHPBB message boards may be somewhat local, but the former is too broad for real discussion and the latter tends to be too narrow (say, a neighborhood association focused on pets).<p>Topical discussion is very fragmented and migrates between sites too often. I don't think it's an advance to have to keep changing sites or access methods (NNTP, Web, RSS) without any real change in functionality. It's change due to novelty or running from spammers or dumb commenters.<p>We need less change, not more. This is something that was better in 1997.",1258225380
