933530,comment,933092,933469,0,0,camccann,,,"Trivially true, but not <i>necessarily</i> helpful. No one is suggesting that dwindling oil supply means we'll be going back to pre-industrial technology levels (well, no one sane, at least). The concern is potential economic shocks due to large increases in the relative price of oil and, by extension, oil-derived goods including anything that requires long-distance shipping.<p>It's a legitimate concern, but probably overblown. With a sufficient range of alternatives, the inevitable price increases are likely to be gradual and steady, giving plenty of time to adjust. Anybody heavily dependent on cheap transportation is probably still screwed in the mid-to-long term, but at least they'll have time to fail gracefully rather than crash and burn overnight.",1257875790

As a personal example, my friends are usually significantly shocked to learn I haven't seen the movie ""The Boondock Saints"". Yet they think nothing of the fact that they haven't seen Salvador Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou"", which I have. Our values are informed by our experiences, so we also tend to assume our values are shared by others.<p>Assuming one's values are normative leads to assuming that the fact they aren't reflected in the world must be the result of some external entity, a secret society, or this nebulous ""the system"". Instead, if one assumes that one's views aren't normative, then it is clear why one's views are not reflected in the world in aggregate: it's a simple tautology.
