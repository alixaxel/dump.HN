You can try trunk as well, but we're having some miscompilation issues with the latest improvements, so I wouldn't trust it for production use yet.<p>Another note is to check your settings; a lot of people have all sorts of weird encoding commandlines (you included, given the contents of the string I pasted above) from the days when x264's setting system was baroque and confusing.  Now the defaults are good and there's some nice automatic presets that let you easily pick a tradeoff of time vs. quality (see x264 --help), so you don't have to mess with weird options.",1257882646

- while it uploads, fill in the title, description and tags. The title could be your status update, the other fields are not necessary if all you want is to tweet the video.
- click submit and wait a few minutes (varies depending on their load) until your video becomes available for viewing
- copy the url and compose a tweet including it<p>It would be easy to create a mobile or web app to streamline this process using the Youtube API(e.g. type in your tweet, chose/record a video, submit and forget.

From that default, we build our mental model of the writer, generally by recording deviations.<p>Until a deviation is recorded though, our assumption is that there's agreement.  That's why new information that violates our mental models can seem so surprising, even when we have no good reason to expect otherwise.<p>The common advice to 'never meet your heroes' is direct result of this dissonance.<p>Seeing the reply as an insult required Joel to assume the writer had the same values Joel did: a mistrust of sales and marketing.  Ergo: any congratulations on an effective sales pitch must be a sarcastic insult.<p>And in writing that reply in the first place, the author clearly assumed Joel had the same values <i>he</i> did.

In that way, I think they encourage a lot of people to try who might not otherwise have tried.   People often like to impress their teachers.<p>Two, as angel / early-stage investors go, YC is the closest thing there is to a top-tier firm.  We don't know much about their financials but we do know their first big raise came from Sequoia, itself a top-tier firm.   Top-tier funding comes with perks.  You get YC's participation and connections.  You get to say you got money from YC.  $N from YC is worth a lot more than $N from your uncle.<p>Finally, for many, a YC interview will be their first big pitch and so there is a damaged goods concern:  if YC turns you down, your odds with others are diminished.   (That's not exclusive to YC:  if X turns you down your future odds are diminished, for many values of X.)<p>Being turned down by YC doesn't mean that you are at the bottom of the pit.

Look, both sides can probably agree:<p><i>Rule number 1: My code is crap.</i><p>The worst kind of incompetence is believing you're better than you actually are.  Even the best make mistakes.  Have an accurate idea of where the problem lies.  Often, it is more likely that a bug is the result of your code than ""a compiler bug"" or some such thing.  Every once in a while, you actually do run across that mythical ""compiler bug"", so you gotta keep your mind open.  You don't solve bugs by restricting the search space <i>before</i> you prove the bug's not there.<p><i>Rule number 2: I care about my code.</i><p>I shouldn't have to write this--making something better is hardly arguable.

Your code is not right because you wrote it.  It is very likely that there is an alternate approach.  Sometimes, the alternate approach has enough advantages to recommend it over your approach.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Keep your mind open.<p><i>Rule number 4: My manager doesn't care about my code, and he pays me.</i><p>Again, a bit of hyperbole.

If you are racing to the patent office for fear that someone else will come up with the idea, then your actions demonstrate that you likely shouldn't be granted the patent.<p>For instance take the ""mostly done"" issue.  If you have it mostly done, until that last piece arrives nobody has any idea how many other people had it mostly done as well.  Which means that it is impossible to figure out how innovative your idea is, and therefore we don't have good evidence that you really deserve a patent.  Given that handing out patents causes real economic harm to others, I don't think they should be handed out on such poor evidence and therefore don't want to see those patents handed out so quickly.<p>I am strongly against allowing an exception because it opens up a common form of patent abuse.  The story is that a small company invents a new technology and get a patent on it.  A big company would like the patent, but can't get access.  Instead they get patents on all of the things the small company needs to do to commercialize their invention.  Effectively they build a ""patent wall"" around the existing patent.  And now the small company is forced to come to terms with the big ones.<p>The one issue you raise that I agree with is that often people build on their own ideas.  The better mousetrap is often better in several ways, not all of which you think of at one time.  But in that case I see two possibilities.  One is that the subsequent innovations can be used without your other innovations.  In that case you can get a patent on them.  The other is that the subsequent innovations can't be used without your other innovations.  In that case the patent you can get on your previous innovations will protect your subsequent as well.
