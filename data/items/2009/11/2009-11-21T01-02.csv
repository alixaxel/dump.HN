953947,comment,952511,953187,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"You're missing the point and co-mingling different parts of the debate. There is a scientific debate about whether or not AGW is happening and the degree to which it may be happening. There are secondary debates about the degree to which the effects of AGW may be harmful to Earth's ecosystem and to human civilization and whether or not and to what degree we should take steps toward avoidance or remediation of those effects.<p>It is critically important that the 1st debate not be influenced by the others, yet today that's not the case at all.<p>Climatology is an incredibly young science. It is still struggling with problems of collecting data and its theories are still immature. There is no consensus in climate modelling, there is a cacophony of competing climate models, each with their own assumptions and fudge factors, none of which have proven reliable in predicting past climate with any degree of accuracy. But this is fine, this is how science works, theories and models are tested by data, reformulated, and retested until ultimately a theory that can make predictions which prove to be backed up by data wins the day.<p>And yet, despite this lack of consensus in climate modelling, there is remarkable consensus among the climatology community regarding AGW. Yet neither the quality of the data nor the models backs up such a consensus. And people who express skepticism about AGW (to any degree) are frequently compared to holocaust deniers or anti-evolutionists (those exact comparisons have been made in this very comment thread).<p>This is what is meant by ""politicizing the debate"". When one cannot engage in the legitimate scientific debate without being shouted down as an unbeliever who hates the Earth or the human race.",1258767568

Are you really any better off for it as a society? Where does the extra value go if there's no time to enjoy it?<p>Also: a lot of hungry people chasing each other's tails in increasingly manic circles, does not necessarily make for technological innovation with lasting value to society.

As far as I know, ACRush and Petr have many years of experience of practicing and competing in serious algorithmic contests such as IOI, ACM, etc. They have solved thousands of algorithmic problems and counting. Through that hard working process, they polish their problem solving and coding skill to the very high level as you know. I am not sure hard working is enough to reach the level of Petr's or ACRush's but I believe it can push you further than you think you can be. Here are my concrete suggestions:<p>1) Read relevant chapters in CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms, kind of bible textbook).<p>2) Try to solve as many problems as you can in:<p><a href=""http://acm.uva.es/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acm.uva.es/</a> (mix, some hard)<p><a href=""http://acm.timus.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acm.timus.ru/</a> (mix, some hard)<p><a href=""http://www.spoj.pl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spoj.pl/</a> (mix, many hard)<p><a href=""http://acm.sgu.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acm.sgu.ru/</a> (mix, many hard)<p>Topcoder.com (of course)<p>3) Solve the problems first then read experts' code to learn coding skill from them.

Java is easy to optimize because the machine types of values in the program can be determined at compile-time.  (Of course, with runtime information, you can pick even better machine types, which is what JIT is.)<p>The reason why languages like Perl and Python run so slowly is not because of the syntax, but because of the semantics.

953896,comment,953760,953760,0,0,philwelch,,,"One thing I've found is that reading about people's lives on the internet has widened my conception of what kind of lives are possible. Other than reading the biographies of exceptional people, people's life paths used to be totally dictated by TV and local society, where people's lives were generally restricted to: working for someone else, having traditional heterosexual relationships, getting married, having kids, getting old and dying. If this was unsatisfying to you, the only real option that was advertised was: work for someone else, have a traditional heterosexual relationship, get married, have kids, and spend your free time imagining how much more awesome life would be if you were working for someone else, having a traditional heterosexual relationship, and getting married except as a member of Starfleet in the 24th century. (In recent years, or on premium cable channels, those possibilities were opened somewhat.)<p>The ""open"" internet has taught me all about startups, open relationships, polyamory, child-free living, ""dropping out"", entheogenic spirituality, transhumanism, anarchism, libertarianism, socialism as anything except a caricature drawn by its enemies, progressive metal, Lisp, and tons of other things. None of these are new ideas, and they're not all great ideas either, but where else would a shy, sheltered kid from a hick town learn about them? It's the long tail applied to everyday human experience, and the full consequences of that are going to be indescribably big.",1258765507
