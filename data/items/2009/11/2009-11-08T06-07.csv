Once the government plan has enough customers, it will be able to demand lower prices while still getting the same quality of care for its customers. If doctors refuse to accept it, they'll be turning down a huge chunk of potential customers. The government's even lower prices will draw more customers, thereby intensifying the effect until we get to the point where the government dominates the insurance industry and can set whatever price it wants.<p>In a functioning market with several players, prices stabilize at a level that customers are willing to pay for the goods or services in question. Healthcare costs have been rising so much because we've always valued healthcare greatly, and lower costs of food and other necessities leave more money for us to spend on it. As a result, advances in medicine come fairly quickly. If the government uses its power as the dominant insurer to drive down prices, advances in medicine will come more slowly because less money will be available. Most of the arguments I've seen for the public option seem to assume that cost reductions will come solely from eliminating non-medical expenses, like advertising. If you think that's the case, can you explain how that will happen? When the government tells doctors what its willing to pay for certain services, are they going to pay no less than private insurers are paying? That's not what happens today with Medicare, and that's not what a private insurer would do if it became the dominant insurer. This isn't about hating government; it's about how markets don't function properly when few players rule them. A public option will almost guarantee that outcome.<p>The public option is undoubtedly the best way to lower the cost of healthcare. However, I don't think that should be our goal. Our goal should be to maximize the quality of care for everyone, not minimize the price. We should ensure that everyone can afford healthcare by subsidizing it for those who can't, but trying to create dominant government insurer so we can provide healthcare for everyone isn't necessary. Let's get rid of silly things like preexisting conditions and the antitrust exemption, then pay what it costs to ensure everyone is insured and maintain the progress in healthcare technology that we enjoy today.",1257661335

Here are three of my favorite issues with your position:<p>1. Why is medical care the highest priority? What about food? Shelter? Safety from rape, murder, and other forms of violence? What about electricity, water, and other infrastructure? While most people don't get very sick, pretty much everyone needs the things above. Why should medical care be the highest priority federal expense?<p>2. You think it's barbaric to think about paying for medical care, but guess what: you do pay for it. Everyone does. Your ""right"" to healthcare is not free; someone has to pay for it. And because you think you're entitled to that free of charge, someone else out there is having money taken from them <i>under the threat of force</i> so that you don't have to worry about healthcare. The right to private property far outweighs the right to healthcare, according to the US Constitution, but your system reverses this relationship.<p>3. The decoupling of supply and demand in the type of system we're about to pass is likely to result in dramatically higher costs and lower quality care over the long run, not to mention the fact that we have no way of paying for it. Granted, our current system is screwed up, but this is far from a fix. This is just moving further in a bad direction.<p>EDIT: Added a third item :)",1257660533

But new technology opens up new tactics and new economies of scale that can fundamentally change the rules of battle.<p>What if you didn't care about having your toys fall out of the sky, for example?  Make them so cheap that you can literally blanket the sky with them.  Send up <i>thousands</i> of computer-piloted missile-aircraft.  If they get shot down, who cares?  If they shoot <i>each other</i> down, who cares?  If they get stolen by the enemy and used to shoot down your own missile-craft...well, that's what was happening before anyway.<p>But you could throw up a curtain so dense and so shifting that it's impossible for anything to fly through them.  And that's exactly what a potential adversary of the U.S. wants: nullify American air power so the f#&kers on the ground can knife our guys.  It doesn't matter if they shoot down 10 of their own missile-craft for every one of ours.  If they can put up 100x as many, that still equals no aircraft in the sky for Uncle Sam.<p>There was a recent wargame that followed a strategy much like this, except that instead of computer-controlled aircraft it used human-controlled small boats launching cruise missiles (that <i>other</i> automated-pilot air weapon):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002</a>",1257660234

I have been an unstable user for years, and the one or two time a year things break (I update approximately weekly) and I try to report a bug, the bug has already been reported and resolved. This is what they call <i>un</i>stable, so imagine how well stable works.<p>Debian unstable doesn't have releases, so packages that make major changes have to apply cleanly to a variety of configurations (not just whatever the previous version was).  Since people are testing these packages daily, any problems are resolved way before anything is marked ""stable"".  These changes are also incremental, so instead of a testing team having to work out 100s of major changes with a six-month deadline, they are made and tested as-needed.<p>The end result is a system that is very up-to-date but rarely breaks.  (Debian stable probably ""never"" breaks, but it is not exactly up-to-date either.)",1257660229
