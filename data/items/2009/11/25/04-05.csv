(Its sort of like oil: the more you are willing to spend, the more exists in the world.  I guess if I were an environmentalist I would describe my current state of affairs as Peak Bingo, but with some sustained effort into AdWords I could probably locate more sources of customers between $15 and $30, or alternatively in different mini-verticals.)",1259124866

960649,comment,960547,960589,0,0,netcan,,,"I understand the principle of taking investment to enable growth. It is not just a principle. It has mechanics to it.<p><i>one option</i>\nA common way this works is putting that money to work acquiring more customers. This can mean sales staff. It might mean advertising. It might mean outlets. etc. It works if you have some way of converting money in to customers in a reliable way. Since dropbox appears to be growing virally through referrals, I don't see how this can be the case here. You cannot easily turn cash in to referrals. If it is a case of putting money to work acquiring customers, there is something I don't understand going one.<p>The other option I can see is funding the free accounts while you wait for premium accounts to open. If you are in a fast growth period, you might have a higher ratio of free/paid customers then what you expect the long term average to be. If you are growing very fast or your profit margins are relatively narrow, you might need some funding. IE, you might dip under profitable temporarily while you wait for the many new customers to convert. This kind of a need is short term & marginal. $7.25m is not marginal.",1259124801
