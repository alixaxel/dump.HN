960772,comment,959619,960328,0,0,GHFigs,,,"Affluence masks the fact that the average American's relationship with material posessions is <i>fucked up</i>. I imagine that most of the people who vote up these stories have an inkling of that in themselves.<p>People need frequent reminders that material possessions are not necessary for happiness to counteract the cognitive biases and societal pressures that are perpetually indicating the opposite. To go without such reminders in the face of economic reality is extremely stressful, leading to depression, anxiety, and the growing problem of pathological hoarding. There are even now several television shows on the subject, one in the same format as the show about drug interventions. It really can get that bad for otherwise well-adjusted people trying to cope with the difference between what they need and what they want.<p>The truth is that you can never have enough of what you don't need, and sometimes you need the example (if not the experience) of someone living very close to the edge to illuminate the problem in your own life.<p>Less charitably: There is a widespread meme associating simpler lifestyle with productivity, and many people here have a craving, if not an addiction, to ""tips"" or ""hacks"" to enable them to be more productive, or at least <i>seem</i> more productive. Because they profess to have obtained a desirable state, people with unconventional lifestyles are just as common a subject as famous historical figures or business leaders. The idea being that if you emulate something this woman or Thomas Jefferson or Steve Jobs did, you can achieve great things as they did. The term ""productivity porn"" is apt.<p>In essence, many are just looking for another way to get more of what they want, rather than learning to want less. Two sides of the same coin, so to speak. Both present at HN.",1259131566

And that's me, so I'm not pretending to be anything else.<p>However, the key question, it seems to me, is that introverts eventually lose more energy than they gain while interacting with other people. Then they have to recharge themselves alone. Extroverted people seems to gain energy from social interactions, and eventually lose more of it when they're left alone. Again, they can enjoy solitude but it drains them.<p>Both can do both but an introvert being extroverted or an extrovert being introverted isn't sustainable in the long run.",1259131443

960751,comment,960547,960649,0,0,patio11,,,"I understand what you're saying and think it is plausible given your assumptions.  For example, you think that Dropbox's primary acquisition engine is viral referrals, that the number of referrals it gets over a certain interval is the number of new users times some constant conversion rate, and that you can't just increase that number of referrals by dumping money at it like you could increase the number of new users by dumping money on an effective CPC campaign.<p>I think your assumptions are likely to be contrary to material fact.  In particular, I think that the embedded assumption of ""constant conversion rates"" is false.  For example, I think that inducing a customer to give a referral is a conversion like any other, and that one could spend a non-trivial amount of engineering resources to instrument one's site and then spend engineering/marketing resources to A/B test the ""#$#$& out of it, and this process would predictably result in increased conversion rate.  (Test the call to action.  Test the design of the form.  Test integration directly with Facebook.  Test how much free space you offer for a signup.)<p>Do I have to mention that A/B testing in the context of a viral loop is hypereffective because of compounding?  You get exponential returns to linear improvements.  This is on top of A/B testing tending to give exponential improvements to linear work, because today's improvements compound on yesterday's.<p>The combination of these two factors means...  wow.  That's like a repeatable recipe to... wow.  Crimety.  I think I have to spend some more time thinking about this later, but my snap impression is that you could have Zynga-esque growth in an arbitrary niche (i.e. selling to people who pay money for things) without scamming anyone.",1259130530

The variable enforcement schedule was still there, as there would be times that <i>they</i> were stuck, and, by empathy, I would feel stuck too. I was two levels removed from the game-world, only able to direct my friend to direct the character, but it was still just as fun.<p>I still play these games, already knowing their plots, just because I can immerse myself in the game-world's atmosphere by deviating in any direction from the ""move the plot forward"" one. It's a bit like taking a guided tour through a sandbox game; when someone points out a lion, you can stop the bus and ride it, then get back on toward the next stop.
