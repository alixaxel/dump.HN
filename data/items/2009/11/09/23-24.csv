932054,comment,931554,931554,0,0,anatoly,,,"""These days mathematicians are divided into little cliques of perhaps a dozen people who work on the same stuff. All of the papers you write get peer reviewed by your clique. You then make a point of reading what your clique produces and writing papers that cite theirs. Nobody outside the clique is likely to pay much attention to, or be able to easily understand, work done within the clique. Over time people do move between cliques, but this social structure is ubiquitous. Anyone who can't accept it doesn't remain in mathematics.""<p>I think this is an exaggeration. Sure, much of mathematics and maybe most of mathematics today works like this, but it's the exceptions, in accordance with Sturgeon's Law, that are most interesting. The really good specialists tend to transcend little cliques, and sometimes entire fields. There are plenty of people who are respected outside the circle of their immediate coauthors, everybody (for some definition of ""everybody"" that is anyhow wider than a little clique) wants to read their papers, etc.<p>You could say that these are rare exceptions and >90% of working mathematicians are producing highly specialized papers that are interesting to maybe a dozen other people, that don't know much outside their narrow focus and don't really care, and so on. And you'd be right. But in programming, isn't it the case that >90% of programmers are chugging along in their Java or C# shops, writing some enterprisey horror or an internal corporate monstrosity, never caring enough to read Joel, nevermind Hacker News, or to improve their knowledge of the language they're using everyday, nevermind learn Haskell. The talented hackers are rare outliers. So what's different?<p>I do agree with some other thoughts in the article. Someone who wants to dabble in many things has their work cut out in the academic math culture. I left grad school because I couldn't hack a bloody-minded focus on working on my thesis and doing nothing else. I had other reasons to suspect I won't be staying around in academia. For one thing, I despise internal politics and petty squabbling, and what I saw when I looked at the power structure and battles more closely, being a graduate student, shocked and disgusted me. Even more importantly, I had grave doubts about ever being able to do really meaningful work rather than end up writing up small results in a little clique. I doubted I had it in me to become an exception I talked about above. I still regret not testing this more thoroughly by mustering the will-power to shut down everything else, finish the damn thesis and get the damn degree, even if I probably wouldn't end up in academia anyway.",1257810889

I can't imagine my life would be any different if I couldn't search the WSJ on Google. But then I'm not the sort of person for whom WSJ pages as search results factor highly.<p>Jason's proposed deal certainly does provide a rescue option for Murdoch's terrible statement about taking all his content off Google - but it just opens up a need for someone to register bingle.com and simply aggregate both sets of search results together.

931989,comment,930752,930752,0,0,samlittlewood,,,"I have been looking at this for my 7 yr old son. Beyond school, his time is spent getting muddy on a soccer field, swimming, building dens, and generally racketing around with friends.<p>However, along with every other 7 year old, he want to know how things work. I am finding that many of my explanations get from A to B via ""and at this point there is a computer that does ..."". - Things: Microwave, car, alarm clock, phone, camera etc.  and broader systems: exams, shops, banks etc.<p>I could explain things in terms of the model that is embodied in the computer, but that seems wrong - at least as the only explanation. If you pull it apart, you don't find the coresponding physical embodiment.<p>If he does want to dig further into this and explore how to make computers do things, I want to have a good set of resources to draw on - My current short list w/ comments:<p>- Lego Mindstorms NXT<p>Start with the provided graphical environment, move on to one of the several text based development environments, eg: NQC, leJOS. He loves Lego, and I have already set up a mindstorms controller+psx joystick to give him a drive+steering component he can use in his own constructions. I find the graphical a bit cumbersome.<p>- Nodebox (<a href=""http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home</a>)<p>I think it is great - python & easy graphics. I have already been showing off some simple drawing animations and fielding requests to: ""Make it go the other way, go red, faster, jump etc."" - Cool, but I am well aware the he'll get frustrated with syntax errors.<p>- Processing (<a href=""http://processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processing.org/</a>)<p>Also, cool - not used it so much myself, and I am not sure I want to start explaing curly parens & semis, but it does lead into Wiring and Arduino. One thing I would really love for him to experience is making things w/ embedded cpus - even if it just simple things to spin motors and flash leds.<p>- Scratch (<a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>)<p>Only recently found this. For me, the visual programming was way easier than Lego NXT. Going to have more of a play.<p>- Nintendo DS homebrew<p>- C64 - in the form of a C64DTV (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C64_Direct-to-TV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C64_Direct-to-TV</a>)<p>- Usebox (<a href=""http://belogic.com/uzebox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://belogic.com/uzebox/</a>)<p>When I was mucking around w/ NDS homebrew I had him draw some characters, then we scanned them and displayed them as sprites bouncing around (one was under joypad control - no collisions or gameplay, maybe 20 lines of code)<p>My own experience was that making games was a very powerful motivation - and all these 3 provide a way into that - C64 & Uzebox would provide a similar experence to mine (well, I was a BBC fanboy, but anyway). Nintendo DS would be a bit more up to date, and would have some currency with his mates. Some way of targetting NDS from processing would be a cool halfway house.<p>Assuming he is at all interested, it will be interesting to see if any of this is appropriate. If not, well, there is another son - and maybe I'll just get stuck in myself.",1257809044
