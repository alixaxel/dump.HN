(I use git because it is industrial strength, but that may not be the best for biz2hack.)<p>What version control does:  It keeps a record of all the little changes you make as you create your code.  If you blow something up, no problem, just revert the latest change.  If you want to try a wacky experiment, you can put it in its own little sandbox and ditch it if it doesn't work out.  If a bug shows up, you can work back through earlier changes until it disappears: the next change is the one that introduced the bug.",1258426392

My performance isn't that good because I can't access the processor directly.<p>Does anyone here know of a SDK that I can get my hands on (I'm an MIT PhD) that would allow me to run code directly on the hardware? (I'm hoping to use a mixture of C and direct assembly.) Due to the nature of my research, I need a secure platform, like the smart-card chips.<p>I'm asking this on HN because I've ran out of places to try. Big companies like Atmel don't want to work with me because I do research, or maybe I wasn't very good at pitching my project.<p>If you want more information about my project -- I'm researching the design of a secure chip resembling the TPM in that it works in conjunction with an untrusted computer. My design is better than the TPM in that it supports arbitrary computation on the chip, and doesn't require a secure binding to the computer. My design is better than existing smart-cards (e.g. JavaCard, MultOS) because it can run untrusted code, and the code doesn't have to be embedded in the chip when it's issued.<p>My first paper on the topic: http://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/pubs/cardis08tem.pdf<p>OSS code (MIT license): http://rubyforge.org/projects/tem<p>Thank you so much for reading!",1258425233

945842,comment,944290,945719,0,0,limist,,,"But Eco's perspective is more nuanced than ""Internet untrustworthy, books good"" or the like.  On the second page of the interview is where he gives a little gem on how to train a discerning mind, a modern version of classical rhetoric exercises:<p>Eco: Yes, in the case of Google, both things do converge. Google makes a list, but the minute I look at my Google-generated list, it has already changed. These lists can be dangerous -- not for old people like me, who have acquired their knowledge in another way, but for young people, for whom Google is a tragedy. Schools ought to teach the high art of how to be discriminating.<p>SPIEGEL: Are you saying that teachers should instruct students on the difference between good and bad? If so, how should they do that?<p>Eco: Education should return to the way it was in the workshops of the Renaissance. There, the masters may not necessarily have been able to explain to their students why a painting was good in theoretical terms, but they did so in more practical ways. Look, this is what your finger can look like, and this is what it has to look like. Look, this is a good mixing of colors. The same approach should be used in school when dealing with the Internet. The teacher should say: ""Choose any old subject, whether it be German history or the life of ants. Search 25 different Web pages and, by comparing them, try to figure out which one has good information."" If 10 pages describe the same thing, it can be a sign that the information printed there is correct. But it can also be a sign that some sites merely copied the others' mistakes.<p>Notice he seems quite familiar with Google and its limitations.  As for his educational suggestion, it's excellent in teaching a multitude of high-level skills (research, referencing, comparison, synthesis, re-explanation, skepticism, etc.) but this level of education needs a teacher willing and capable of engaging in dialectic or Socratic dialog with a student.<p>I agree with you that the Internet has made information and knowledge far more accessible than ever before - for those who know where and how to look for it.  For many/most other people, it can be even worse than previous propaganda channels of print, radio, or TV.  The sheer variety of the Internet guarantees that if you don't want other perspectives and prefer company that thinks like you, you can readily limit yourself.",1258425184
