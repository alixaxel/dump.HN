Even more fun, the system didn't have a BIOS at all (it was hard wired to just jump into a location in flash, were we placed the Linux second stage boot loader to uncompress the kernel image to RAM, which then executed the shell immediately. Even the shell was really mostly there to aid debugging - in production use it'd immediately spawn the main app for the system.<p>As long as the kernel has whatever drivers you need compiled in instead of as modules, and as long as your app either doesn't directly or indirectly spawn lots of child processes or if it does it takes care of wait()'ing for them, and as long as you don't need any getty's (without spawning them yourself) there's no problems tearing out everything and replacing it with a self contained static app.",1259582393
967683,comment,967488,967676,0,0,Quarrelsome,,,"The problem is idiots, managed idiots.<p>C devs read way, way, way too much into performance issues with managed environments. I'm currently running a large system on an embedded device using a managed environment and its FINE. However we have been careful about our implementation.<p>The problem is when less ""able"" teams are able to use managed code to create software on an embedded device. They can be utterly careless with the resources on the device as they are commonly used to playing with desktop where you can get away with a lot.
They then create something that doesn't work very well and the C hackers point and laugh and state that managed software and embedded devices is a no-no.<p>If anything managed teams just need to appreciate the limitations of the device and be more careful when assessing what toys to use. Do that and the managed world is full of win.<p>Update: ""Idiot"" is probably a bit harsh. ""Naive"" is probably a more apt description.",1259582378

Dalvik might be the best Java VM ever in the history of personal computing, but it's still just a VM. It cannot beat native code, especially on a mobile device like the Droid. I think GCC is smart enough at producing fast, tight machine code. And then there's LLVM. Why choose Java?<p><BEGIN RANT><p>I'm sick of people going on about how programmer productivity is more important than performance. I seriously don't give a fuck about programmer productivity. I only care about the end product. You have a 600MHz processor with about 128megs of RAM on your mobile device, and you <i>still</i> can't make it perform well? There was a time when <i>desktop computers</i> were slower than that, and programmers optimized the hell out of their software to make it perform acceptably on the limited hardware. I can't believe that a company like Google can't make Android perform at least acceptably, if not blazing, fast.<p><END RANT><p>I consider performance a feature. If it's not fast, I'm not using it. This is how I choose my desktop software, and this is how I choose my mobile devices. Currently, I'm looking at some Symbian devices. Symbian might not be the best mobile OS, but it's extremely responsive even on my mum's ancient Nokia 6600.<p>EDIT: removed offending ""bring on the downvotes"" comment.",1259581905
967675,comment,967216,967567,0,0,barrkel,,,"To take your example, a restaurant, the most important factor in success is how well the kitchen works. That requires a solid head chef. How well will that chef run a business when he or she's also running a kitchen? That requires them to specialize in <i>two</i> domains, rather than one.<p>There's a reason why corporations are more efficient than coalitions of self-employed singletons operating in a free market. The transaction costs kill you. In order to specialize with sufficient depth to compete in pretty much any non-local market, you necessarily must either work for someone else, or hire many other people to work for you - and thereby make your specialism planning, coordination and managing, rather than anything else.",1259581557

You can't really argue against those. Anyone who thinks we should continue burning coal/oil/etc forever isn't thinking straight.<p>But what is the aim of climate research? Just say it reported ""We'll all explode in 10 years"". What are the chances we'd be able to all group together and change the climate ourselves? What if it went wrong? Doesn't seem wise to me.<p>Obviously I can see some uses - eg if it's expected to be a lot hotter for the next 10 years, then we can plan for that etc. But the amount of money being poured into the research seems a bit over the top for the likely return.",1259581450

It couldn't have come from the correct version that appeared in the magazine or its PDF version.

No sane program would do that, least of all an HTML editor. It couldn't have been an autospell error either because ""igon value"" isn't in any spellcheck list.<p>No, it remains likely that ""igon value"" was there in the article as Gladwell wrote it, got fixed by the New Yorker's famously punctual fact-checkers, and the fix was ignored by Gladwell as the original text version was posted to the site and later made it to the book.",1259579611

This means you would get $0.55 refund for 4 hours of downtime. I'm sorry, but to me that sounds like ""we guarantee this amount of uptime, and we back it up by absolutely nothing!"".<p>Not that I expect my damages to be repaid, not at all, but a webhost's availability guarantees are only as good as the money they put in to back it up. If they would, for example, promise to pay back a month of service fees, it would not recover my damages, but at least shows they're a lot more serious about the guarantees they're giving.<p>Anyway, I do not have anything against Linode, not at all: it's just that I'm wary whenever a webhost is this unclear about availability guarantees.
