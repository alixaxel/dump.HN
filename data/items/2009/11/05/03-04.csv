Even if you think the plumber is stone wrong, a bit of business sense should tell you to politely acquiesce and move on.<p>Instead, they demonize this guy and selectively address his complaints.   It seems they really can't grasp they idea that not everyone agrees with their sense of what's good and right. And that makes me think issues of ethics never crossed their minds; it looks as though they cannot imagine themselves as being wrong.",1257393501

Isn't the rationale for roaming charges that it costs more for them to set up (or rent) infrastructure overseas, so you have to pay to make up for it?

If you get the kennel wrong, the dog will continue to sleep on your couch/bed, get the skyscraper wrong and ...<p>If you don't have a passion for biology, then you might not enjoy it as a career.

923264,comment,922802,923087,0,0,amadiver,,,"Not to besmirch your AS coding abilities, nor to reopen old wounds, but the dev in me is begging some questions and debugging your comment. Your first issue seems like it was likely caused by using an incorrect ratio of viewable content to viewport height. I can't say I've ever seen the Flash player give erroneous info as to where the mouse was positioned, and Flash's Number type is accurate enough for this type of operation.<p>The second issue seems more likely to have been an issue with processor load rather than a memory, I'm guessing? I usually solve the issue with using TextField's cacheAsBitmap property. It uses more memory, at the expense of greater processor load. I develop on a low-powered Mac, and have never been disappointed by the tradeoff, but YMMV. Sometimes, playing with the AntiAliasMode of the TextField has unexpectedly good results (processor-wise), but I admit it's very fiddly :)<p>Completely agree on the framework front; Abobe's attempts to solve UI issues in Flash have lead to an even more fractured dev response. Cappuccino's UI looks extremely clean, and seem to function remarkably well, without sacrificing so much on the filesize/response vectors.<p>Again, just geeking out; I've been (and continue to be) in that position more times than I'd like to count in developing for Flash. Thanks for the great comment :)",1257393220

For example, you'd have some functionality advertised as being in the system libraries (like, oh, certain important pthread functions) so they'd pass the configure checks, but they would be in reality just stub functions that mean nothing. So your program would subtly fail.<p>That particular problem was fixed in 10.1, but it seems like every release has a few things like that: something from UNIX that looks like it's there, but actually amounts to no-ops.

You can see a lot of successors who flush the estate down to the drain just in one century. For Byzantine Emperors who were capable of maintaining those assets for almost 10 centuries despite competitions from Muslims and Crusaders is a pretty good achievement.",1257391887

They never did try to recruit the Ottomans and mostly played with the bordering nations between them and the Ottomans.  Once the Ottomans expanded and took over those buffer states, their indirect strategy was less successful.  Had support from Western Europe actually materialized, things may have turned out a bit differently.  Oh well, that's the way history goes.",1257391776

923242,comment,923229,923229,0,0,makecheck,,,"At least a BSc. is a very good idea (I have computer engineering), but I would definitely back it up with experience, too.  For example, try to make some open-source thing in your spare time, or write a web site, or tinker with electronics in your garage, while you go to school.  Definitely do internships, every summer at someplace new.  <i>Do not</i> mow lawns, talk to companies and get a 4-month commitment to do something cool.  Failing that, talk to professors and see if you can help with their projects over the summer.<p>Engineering degrees open you up to jobs across the spectrum: software architecture, CAD tools, embedded systems, circuit design, logic design, power, and so forth.  What's more, even if these better jobs aren't available in a bad economy, you are <i>also</i> qualified to do jobs that are ""just"" programming, which is a nice safety net.<p>Sometimes, ""any"" engineering degree is enough, it shows you have discipline and can handle responsibility.  For instance, I've seen civil, mechanical and chemical engineers in places I wouldn't expect.  So pursue what most interests you.<p>The degree programs cover topics that are favorites for interview questions.  For example, many people ask about algorithms, and while you could buy a book on them or examine existing software projects, the computer science courses will really teach them to you well.",1257391370
