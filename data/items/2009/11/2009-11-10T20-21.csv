933880,comment,933273,933819,0,0,btilly,,,"I accept your correction that there is a difference between ""promoting progress"" and ""coming up with ideas"".  (By coincidence I just reread <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9404236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9404236</a> which argues, among other things, that progress in mathematics can be helped by <i>not</i> proving facts too quickly.)<p>I agree with you on the intent of the design of the patent system.  However in a world filled with overbroad junk patents, where accidental infringement is much better than willful infringement, there are real incentives for innovative people to _not_ read patents.  Because reading them opens you up to liability without teaching you anything you couldn't have thought of on your own.<p>As for the cost of waiting, you are right that the incentive to wait is an inefficiency in my proposal.  However the aim here is to achieve a good trade-off.  Obviously more detailed analysis is required to find whether it achieves as good a trade-off as I think it does.<p>However for many years we blindly accepted very large increases in how easy it was to get a patent without substantive debate, and there is now substantial evidence that this has been a bad thing.  So it seems to me that it shouldn't be hard to improve on the current state, and I think my proposal would be an improvement.<p>Finally I have to say that I don't understand what you mean by ""presumption of validity"".  The way things work now is that if IBM wants me to enter into a cross-licensing arrangements, we both know that they can threaten me with a large stack of patents.  We both know that most of those patents won't stand up in court, but fighting it will impose serious costs on me and they are likely to get me on something.  So even though we both presume the patents are invalid, the threat is still good.<p>How would you change that dynamic?  If your idea is that they spend their money to validate their patent before I spend a dime, how will we know it has been validated to my satisfaction?  In theory that kind of validation is the job of the patent office.  However regulatory capture has made that review a joke, and would eventually eventually ruin any other level of review you could add.  But if I have to spend money in the process of getting the patent validated, then IBM still can threaten me as they would today.",1257885754

I thought about her way too often, missed her way more than a normal person ought to, and was pretty much in a constant state of love-induced sugar shock. I didn't want to seem overzealous or desperate, so I tried to play it cool -- and yet, the impulse to post embarrassing, saccharine love quotes to Facebook was overwhelming (I am but only a dork, after all).<p>So I did what any self-respecting geek would do in my position: I computed a SHA-2 hash of her name and put it in that weird little box thingy on the left hand side of my Facebook profile. It provided just the right balance of self expression and social tact.

The idea of tiny ""cupidcode"" links spreading across facebook and the twitters -- each rooted in my nerdy affection for this particular young lady -- seemed like a terribly powerful way to say ""I really think you're great"". And because I suck at music and writing, it was pretty much my only option.<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and cupidco.de is done. It's probably not well suited for the sorts of folks that read YC so I hope you don't mind me sharing my link with you. My hope is that this post will kick-start the spread of a few cupidcodes 'cross the nets so that my crush (who I've been seeing now for about two weeks!) may casually stumble upon one while checking her facebook or reading a blog and discover just how special she is to me.<p>tl;dr -- fell in love with a chick, wanted to do something special for her, suck at everything else, so I built her a webapp.",1257884862

How best can I do that? Is there somewhere I can post such an idea?<p>The idea is a clock that is waterproof, talking, which automatically turns on when the shower starts. The usage scenario would be:<p><pre><code>  user starts shower
  clocks turns itself on, says 'hi'   
  5 minutes after turn-on the clock says ""that's 5 minutes""
  at some times clock announces the time e.g. ""the time is 8.45am""
  10 minutes after turn-on the clock says ""that's 10 minutes"", etc....
  user turns off the shower, clocks stops talking.
  I'd pay around 20 bucks for such a thing.

If they didn't keep an eye on this stuff, those factors of 2-10x would eat them alive.<p>For some value of M and N, having N million users around for M months means that development costs are actually cheaper than compute costs, and I'd assume that they've now reached a point where most new products expect to see more than that magic number of users.  A few engineers for a few extra months is only ~100k, and I have no trouble believing that many Google products cost them at least that much over their lifetimes due to resource consumption.<p>The rest of us can safely ignore all this because our products actually need to grow before we pass that threshold, at which point we deal with the issues; Google is in an enviable position where no optimization is premature.<p>Even for the rest of us, though, given the performance differences in Python vs. Java (best case 2-4x, worst case more like 40x) relative to the productivity differences (I can't believe this is more than 10x, even for someone very comfortable in Python and merely competent at Java), I'd suspect that many high use software projects even outside of behemoths like Google are actually cheaper in the long run if they're done in Java than they would be in Python.<p>Prototypes are another issue altogether, but I haven't seen anything that says Google is discouraging people to do those in whatever language they want; AFAIK it's production code that we're talking about here.",1257884415
