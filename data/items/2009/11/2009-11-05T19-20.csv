If you're feeling buzziness from reading inverted type, there is also a good chance your screen is at an unhealthy brightness. Great for picking out contrast, but painful on the eyes. One trick my friend taught me was to place a light source off in the distance to the side, to break up the focused source of light from the screen. It cured his computer-induced headaches immediately, along with lowering his brightness.",1257451167

One stumble in the relationship, and you're telling the world how awful they are. You even went so far as to publically mock the appearance of your Dell sales rep. This type of public bullying might not produce the desired outcome. That is, if your desired outcome is to get a good price on your server and maintain a relationship with your vendor.<p>Sales reps are human beings, fallible and fraught with human problems. Perhaps your rep came down with a certain flu and forgot to tell his/her customers who their secondary is. As a customer of Dell, I keep all of my ""sales team""'s contacts in a text file, for this very reason. (For the record, I hate dealing with Dell, and choose HP or Sun whenever I have the option.)<p>If you feel Dell is untrustworthy, consider moving on.  HP and Sun are superior alternatives who are willing to match Dell's price. You just need to know how to work the channels (for HP call up CDW, for Sun look for Tim Van Loan). Also, Supermicro resellers like Silicon Mechanics, PogoLinux, or Penguin Computers sell servers comparable to Dell's crappy  
commodity hardware, and will likely beat Dell's server offerings.<p>From an infrastructure management point of view, your model is broken if you cannot afford a few extra days in provisioning.

I don't see a reason the system couldn't be set up to normalize the schools based on what the metrics turn out to be.<p>I guess each school would get a performance index that would act as a coefficient for the teachers there. E.g., the metric is a test score, and one school consistently scores near the national average, while another is 10 points lower. The teachers at the lower school would have their evaluation bumped 10 points because of the index. That way we'd be comparing apples to applies.<p>It could actually incentivize teachers to move into more difficult schools if the index were a little over done so that they were rewarded slightly more for the same effort.

But then there are people out there who are actively preventing me from making them, and thus having the things I want. Not only is Apple saying ""We don't care about X"" but they're saying ""we hate X and will prevent it from coming into being."" It's being needlessly antagonistic.</i><p>Two points here I've been mulling over for the past few days:<p>1) If Apple did nothing to prevent it (if there was no EULA restriction or DSMOS[1]), running a Hackintosh system would still mostly be about finding supported hardware or getting some unsupported hardware to ""mostly work"", and there would still be no promises that a point release wouldn't inadvertently hose your system.  Honestly, aside from feeling better about breaking the EULA I don't see how it would be that much different.<p>2) Mostly speaking in regards to the Palm syncing with iTunes, but also in regards to Hackintosh systems, if Apple does nothing then they will be in a position will they will have to support these systems on some level.  Taking the Pre as an example, who is the consumer going to blame when a future iTunes update breaks syncing?  Who will they call for support?<p>Consider, if the Pre syncing went on without interference with Apple and worked fairly well it would certainly be included in future devices from Palm, and a similar tactic would likely be employed by other device makers.  All it would take would be a change in the iPhone OS or iTunes to piss off millions of consumers.  You'd get PC World running ""Apple update breaks millions of consumer devices"" (or worse yet, something resulting in data loss), with single sentence somewhere at the end about how these features aren't actually supported by Apple anyway.  Why would Apple allow this? They are already the target of some absurd outrage as it is.<p>Not speaking to you specifically, drewcrawford, but it seems like most people don't want Hackintosh systems to be quietly accepted, they want them to be supported and tested.<p>[1] While I run a few Hackintosh systems, I'm not sure what other intentional barriers are in place other than the DSMOS an the EULA.",1257448852

Like if you take two components that are 90 percent reliable and use them in a design, the outcome is 90 percent of 90 percent - 81 percent. Keep adding 90 percent reliable components and you’ll have something that explodes before you get it out of the factory.<p>""Maybe people are like that. If you’re 90 percent non-bogus and ten percent bogus, and you work with someone else who’s 90 percent non-bogus, you end up with a team that’s 81 percent non-bogus.""<p>""I like that model. It makes intuitive sense. But it’s depressing. It says that all we do is magnify each others’ flaws.""<p>""Well, maybe that’s the case. Maybe flaws are multiplicative.""<p>""So what are virtues?""<p>""Additive, maybe. A shallower curve.""",1257447829

So apps that used to be in the top 100 are no longer in that list. Most of the apps that are now in the top 100 look like they got in there because of an app store bug.<p>I don't know if this is related to the app store app count exceeding 100,000, but it does seem like a bug and the rankings don't seem correct",1257447616
