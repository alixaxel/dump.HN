I don't really care if the extra funding goes toward projects, etc.  I just want to see people have to optimize less to get up the next level in the pyramid, so that they can push their work in better alignment with 'pure science' rather than maximizing chances of publication within 2-3 years (especially strong pressure on the postdocs).

We need fewer journal articles (maybe), but deeper contributions.<p>Yet: so far, it's what we've got.  It works pretty well.  Yeah, it sucks to be a PhD going through the grind, watching the 4th-years in the lab slowly deflate as they realize they're going to have to get real jobs.  But perhaps we were all crazy to believe we could really make a career out of trying out crazy ideas and telling other people about them.",1257214062

Other animals can't learn everything that the one ""high IQ"" animal can.<p>So when that animal dies the experiment cannot be repeated and the research is pretty much over until they find another smart animal to work with.<p>So many of these animal experiments are very non-repeatable both in theory and in practice.",1257213899

The chance that you will be good if you don't care is vanishingly small (because you are competing against people who do care). If you care, you can find tools that will help you.<p>That said, I've seen people who care less but are still excellent developers. Talent can compensate to some degree.",1257213817

Then, you'll allow folks arbitrary access to other people's data, silently.  I have seen a lot of Rails code that guards against this by checking access before critical actions -- again, this will work fine until you forget to do it.  Instead, establish the convention that you <i>only</i> instantiate the model objects through something which guarantees authorization, and then the existence of the model object is proof that access to it is authorized.  (Adjust as required if you work in banking or state secrets.  I write bingo cards for a living.)",1257213759
