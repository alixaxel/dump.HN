It is an excellent general purpose programming/scripting language with libraries for every imaginable task, object-oriented programming patterns, and some basic functional programming features.<p>The separation of application code from web server is also a nice feature of Python based web applications.

A strong example of this is swear words.<p>Your priming passage includes warm, life-affirming terms and fragments (as distinct from their denotation): ""genuine"", ""compliment"",\n""really are good"", ""I'm impressed with your"". I'm suggesting it's not just that you were priming the reader with that logical interpretation, but that you were directly influencing their emotional state with your word choice.<p>I really do think the first-quoted commenter in the article was being sarcastic. Although he later claimed he wasn't, I find that hard to believe. I don't think it's just the words that are used; but that those words naturally emerge from a person's attitude. If they have a kindly approach to others (or even if they are just feeling happy and optimistic at the moment), it will be reflected in their word choice.<p>Unfortunately, optimistic, cheerful people tend not to make good engineers, given Murphy's Law, so there's sometimes a relative absence of good-will and affirmation online - including here, on HH.",1257918543

I can read something much faster by scrolling (although I greatly prefer reading on paper). It also makes it so that if part of the ""page"" is obscured, that's ok, because you can just scroll around it. You may be sitting comfortably at an angle that makes it difficult to see the bottom of the screen, but with scrolling this is no problem. I'd much rather read near the top of my screen than the bottom. I put insane amounts of bottom padding on all local HTML pages I create for documentation for precisely this reason.<p>I'd be interested to see a book on a spool so you could scroll it.

I'd love to see more up to date numbers.<p>However even if you assume that the difference is much smaller, say a factor of 1.2, then you can afford an extra 2.3 computers for every developer.  Oddly enough in the various companies I know well with small teams of experienced scripting programmers I've never seen that high a ratio of webservers to developers, so even so switching to Java doesn't make sense.<p>On the question how many people can work together, needing to talk about data types is such a small portion of what people talk about that I would be shocked if it changes where the cutoff is between where small teams break down, or where large teams become as productive as that peak.  That said I fully agree that Java is designed to let large teams cooperate, and that's likely to matter when you have teams of 50+ programmers.  However if the productivity difference really is a factor of 2.4, and we assume linear growth in productivity for large teams, then you'll actually <i>need</i> a team of 50 or so programmers in Java to match the team of 5-7 programmers working in a modern scripting language.

I've spent too much of my time in life studying politics.  I've worked in multiple levels of government ( U.S. Congress, city government, state senate), worked in non-profits trying to help the homeless, tutoring inner city kids, etc.  I used to browse my college's social library for fun to read journal articles, and on almost every single issue I've read the top books and articles.<p>My conclusion is that, actually, yes, there is almost always a much, much better, solution, that would make most people much better off, that the political system has simply overlooked.<p>Note, I do not feel this way about things outside of politics and government.  At the company I work at, I think the management generally makes the very reasonable decisions given the trade offs involved.  But when I worked in government, I thought the process was insane.<p>For a few examples:<p>On the healthcare issue, see my blog post: <a href=""http://intellectual-detox.com/2009/09/10/the-perfect-healthcare-plan-and-why-well-never-get-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intellectual-detox.com/2009/09/10/the-perfect-healthc...</a><p>Or consider Iraq/Afghanistan.  If you believe that the U.S. should just get out, then you probably already believe that our current policy is insane.  If you believe that the U.S. should stay in and build a workable government/economy, our policy is also insane.  For comparison, Britain once ruled Egypt, which at the time had 1/3rd of Iraq's population, with a mere 5,000 soldiers, ruled it so well that Cairo was a notable international destination, and actually turned a profit.  The tactics the British used are well documented, and in the end resulted in far, far less bloodshed and collateral damage than our current tactics.  Yet we ignore them, and everyone loses.  Iraq and Afghanistan remain in chaos and both the Iraqi civilians and the American taxpayer bleed red.  Again, insanity.<p>Or consider education: <a href=""http://steve-olson.com/how-the-public-school-system-crushes-souls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-olson.com/how-the-public-school-system-crushes-...</a> and <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a>   Again sheer insanity.  And again, if you actually study the history and politics of the educational system, you'll find that the system is not the result of balancing hard tradeoffs.  It's the result of an insanely dysfunctional political system.<p>And don't even get me started on economics and the financial crisis.<p>Again, I spent a lot of time in the political world and it only slowly grew on me just how insane the system was.  I basically went from believing the mainstream academia/NYTimes view ( ie. the American system is flaws, but generally arrives at a workable solution given the constraints) to being legitimately scared at how badly everything is being run.<p><i>First, the same criticism of perverse incentives applies. It takes more compensation to motivate a person take a job if he already has $10k + $6h/hr.</i><p>There is still a bit of a disincentive, but it's much, much, much better than a <i>110% marginal tax rate</i>.<p><i>Second, you'd have a lot of people in guaranteed 'make work jobs' that are probably more expensive to run then just giving away money.</i><p>$6 an hour is still a lower wage than ~98% of the jobs out there, so people would still have the incentive to switch to a higher paying, not-make work job.",1257916686

934640,comment,930073,930073,0,0,jackfoxy,,,"My apologies for not first reading your link before my curt response. Both the article and website are interesting in their own way.<p>First a primer on websites reporting military/intelligence affairs: two sites that occupy the ends of the credibility spectrum, <a href=""http://smallwarsjournal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallwarsjournal.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.debka.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debka.com</a>.<p>The first is a forum for junior military officers and professional analysts for discussing tactics and strategy. The articles all have by-lines, mostly by Captains and Majors (i.e. recently promoted Captains). The editorial board is made up of professionals. You will never read any classified information here. You may read some good war stories, but mostly you will read professional treatments of modern tactics by professionals for professionals.<p>On the other extreme many consider debka a conduit for the Mossad. Good luck separating the information from the disinformation on this site, but the articles can be a good read, if you can deal with the wilderness of mirrors.<p>In between these extremes keep in mind that intelligence analysis is about connecting the dots. Even the professionals seldom know anything for sure, and sources and means of gathering information are usually more important than any individual datum. If it makes it to print (or html), there’s probably a reason.<p>So where does this leave <a href=""http://www.strategypage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strategypage.com</a> ? Let’s look at the staff bios on the about us page.  Of the four ""staff"" exactly one has any military/intelligence background at all. ""...author (over 20 books), wargame designer (over 100 designed and publisher of over 500), defense advisor (since the 1970s), pundit (since the 1970s) and general troublemaker. Served in the US Army artillery (1961-64) as a Spec/4."" His website, <a href=""http://www.jimdunnigan.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jimdunnigan.com</a> , lists some of his books, and more bio info including ""Various Department of Defense and State Department agencies called on me to give lectures or just have a chat."" I guess that was his ""defense advisor"" gig. He’s certainly a dedicated amateur. If luck had broken his way a little better, perhaps he could have been Tom Clancy. There’s also a handy ""write for us"" page. If you write well enough and don’t make any flaming technical errors, you can make some coin.<p>In short, I don’t think this site would even attract placing any real disinformation. So how about the article itself?<p>First, no by-line.<p>Secondly the protagonist’s name, ""Zoltan"". Sure sounds made up to me, but that’s just my opinion.<p>The way the piece is put together has the feel of a composite, somebody who did some research and threw this story together. If a real reporter got the real story from a real Colonel (and covered up his identity with a pseudonym) he could have written for a more prestigious publication or wire service and made better money. Still...not entirely implausible.<p>For now I’m sticking to my theory of the shoot-down only because accounts I read right after the incident described the wreckage of the aircraft landing largely intact (a little hard to believe since the fuselage is composite) with bullet holes and, if I recall correctly, the pilot ejected and survived (a little less likely after a missile strike). Hence my belief in heavy machine gun fire from a pursuit aircraft. Also the Russians really wanted to get their hands on one of these babies, even a crashed specimen. So it’s easy to imagine their risking an agent inside NATO to pull this off.<p>Reading this stuff on the web is not like reading hacking tips. The background is more important than the foreground, and you can never be sure.",1257915711
