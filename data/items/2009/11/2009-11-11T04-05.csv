934634,comment,932527,933832,0,0,roundsquare,,,"No, not at all.  I'd love for this not to be a concern, but unfortunately it turns out that it is.  The administrators are responsible for ensuring that the students at the school are safe.  Given the existence of bullies and the inability of the school to hire enough administrators to be everywhere at once, they need some other method for keeping students safe.  Here are a few options:<p>1) Find some way to convince bullies to stop bullying and realize how stupid they are.<p>2) Cameras everywhere and punish people for beating up other kids.<p>3) Find out what provokes bullies and prevent that from happening.<p>4) Do nothing.<p>#1 probably can't be done quickly.<p>#2 might be reasonable but would be an invasion of privacy in some ways.  this is another solution that deserves debate.<p>#3 is what the schools are doing.<p>#4 is unacceptable to many parents<p>So, if you are going to suggest that the school's policy is bad, you must either pick one of the 4 above or suggest a new option.  There might well be a better option!  If you have one, please please please put it up here.<p>So, I ask you, what should the schools do?",1257915552

934623,comment,934385,934385,0,0,hyperbovine,,,"I had the exact same experience recently while writing a dynamic programming simulation in Python. The naive (and elegant) solution to the problem consists of a 20-line recursive function which took me about an hour to write. Unfortunately function calls are very expensive in Python, and I my sim required a couple billion of them, so I started searching for ways to eliminate the recursion. 3 weeks and a deep foray into Numpy later and I had it.<p>The second implementation is about the same length and replaces all of the simplicity of the recursive solution with a bunch of five-dimensional arrays. Never before did I have to think as deeply about vectorized functions, array broadcasting, dimension matching, etc. The non-recursive version is about an order of magnitude faster, and what's better, using the numpy operators means nearly all of the processing is offloaded into low-level C routines, so the Python overhead is effectively nil. On the downside the code is extremely difficult to follow now... trying to visualize what's going on in 5 dimensions is a real pain.",1257914979

But there is some design going on, it is not complete chaos. It's not like neither of these goals has ever had any sort of influence on policy.

Don't you think these sort of blog posts could easily criticise it's consequences too? First, the same criticism of perverse incentives applies. It takes more compensation to motivate a person take a job if he already has $10k + $6h/hr. Second, you'd have a lot of people in guaranteed 'make work jobs' that are probably more expensive to run then just giving away money.<p>I'm not yours is a bad idea, but only because the problem is hard. Pretty much every proposed solution is messy & ugly with lots of loose ends & perverse incentives.<p>The elegant solutions can be found on either extreme of the political spectrum where you don't have to worry about one of the conflicting goals.

The main problem is that government work programs would (by necessity) have to involve jobs that almost anyone is capable of performing, with minimal oversight required. This would be very susceptible to gradually becoming pointless busy-work, variations on the ""one person digs a hole, next person fills it back in"" pattern.<p>The net result would likely be money spent wasting people's time to do work that creates no value. The ideal goal is to get people into jobs where they're actually creating value, and spending time doing a useless ""job"" is actually <i>counterproductive</i> because it's time they can't be spending to gain skills or look for other work.<p>We'd be better off paying people $6/hr to get training in a marketable skill, or to search for work matching skills they already have.",1257913708

The movie theater agrees to let them place a stand on the outside to promote product ""X"".<p>When you are about to go in, they tell you if you would like a free sample or something like that. If you agree all you have to do is give out your name and your mobile number and your home phone number. They make the process seem very standard.<p>Once you go inside the movie theater you are constantly reminded to either turn of your cell phone or to put it in silence or vibrator mode for the movie, most people do.<p>After the movie starts, the criminals, start calling to your house and tell anyone that picks up the phone, that they have kidnapped you (they know your name, what you look like, what you were wearing, who you were with, etc) and that the family has one hour to deliver an small amount of cash if they want the person to be released. Most of the time, the families call the ""victim"" but since they are in the movies, generally people don't pick up the phone. So the family immediately assumes the call is for real.<p>You would not believe the amount of people that have been scammed like that. Is truly amazing.",1257912418

It has amazing properties, he says. Tropical rain doesn't leach nutrients from terra preta fields; instead the soil, so to speak, fights back. Not far from Painted Rock Cave is a 300-acre area with a two-foot layer of terra preta quarried by locals for potting soil. The bottom third of the layer is never removed, workers there explain, because over time it will re-create the original soil layer in its initial thickness. The reason, scientists suspect, is that terra preta is generated by a special suite of microorganisms that resists depletion. ""Apparently,"" Woods and the Wisconsin geographer Joseph M. McCann argued in a presentation last summer, ""at some threshold level ... dark earth attains the capacity to perpetuate—even regenerate itself—thus behaving more like a living 'super'-organism than an inert material.""</i><p><i>[...] Not all Xingu cultures left behind this living earth, they discovered. But the ones that did generated it rapidly—suggesting to Woods that terra preta was created deliberately. In a process reminiscent of dropping microorganism-rich starter into plain dough to create sourdough bread, Amazonian peoples, he believes, inoculated bad soil with a transforming bacterial charge. [...]</i><p>Wikipedia has, of course, an article on terra preta: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta</a><p>Most interesting is modern attempts by scientists to effectively reverse-engineer the soil; using a combination of crude charcoal, organic compost, and microorganism cultures to convert poor soils into something approximating the robust, fertile terra preta.",1257912085
