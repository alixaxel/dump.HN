968796,comment,968502,968502,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"JRuby has been invaluable at scaling out our web scraping.  Specifically, we've managed to leverage its concurrency support very effectively.<p>We're scraping many millions of pages, so a single-threaded scraper wouldn't be practical.  Since most of the time, a given thread is waiting on IO, we get our highest throughput with a few dozen scraper threads running at once.<p>Trying to use multiple threads in MRI is pretty much a big mess.  For whatever reason, it starts falling down after three or four.  Ruby 1.9's fibers might be a good solution but it wasn't out of beta when we started this project.<p>Using EventMachine with MRI might get us the same effect, but changing a relatively large synchronous codebase to work asynchronously is a big task for an uncertain benefit.  With JRuby, we simply pointed our (synchronous) Ruby code to a event-driven HTTP client which uses futures to block each thread.  Threads are certainly heavier-weight than some concurrency primitives, but with only a few dozen the JVM is great at holding all the relevant state.<p>We've also been able to leverage tools in java.util.concurrent and use Scala actors with pretty great effect.  JRuby (and the JVM) isn't without its faults but when it comes to concurrency it's the Ruby implementation to beat.",1259618374

The power and beauty of Ruby is its flexibility, ""fluidity"",  and ability to glue services provided by an operating system and a million OS-native modules. Just look into your /usr/lib.<p>JRuby lacks that: it only ""glues"" JARs together and it introduces a shockingly huge startup lag which makes your development feel like you're compiling C++ code between test runs. And even gluing JARs is kind of pointless: Java itself, with its plethora of autocompleting IDEs, is a much better environment to learn and experiment with APIs like Batik or Apache POI.",1259618072

968785,comment,968376,968640,0,0,astine,,,"I'm sorry, I'm not a statistician (or any kind of mathematician) so I don't know the proper terminology. I'm just noting that the only way your previous example seems work from my perspective is if you take one over infinity to be zero.<p>I'll explain: The set of all of the points between two points is an infinite set, and the probability of selecting any single member of a set is approximately one over the size of the set, so it would seem that the probability of selecting any individual member of an infinite set would be one over 'infinity' that is, an undefined value.<p>Granted, the limit of one over x as x approaches infinity is zero, but the probability of selecting any single member of an infinite set isn't zero in the same sense that the probability of selecting a member outside the set is zero. That is, if I pick a point between 0 and 1, and I select point x, there was obviously not <i>impossible</i> to select point x. So while it may be 'mathematically convenient'* to say that the probability of selecting any given point is zero I think that it might be better to say that it might be better to say that the chance is infinitesimally small, rather than zero per se.<p>So while I may certainly be wrong, I think that you are univocating when you say that a range is an example of an infinite number of zeros being non-zero. When I was talking about the chance of a individual monkey typing out Shakespeare was zero, I meant that, if it was impossible for any monkey to type (imagine that we are using exclusively dead monkeys) no monkey could ever type out anything, much less Shakespeare.",1259618021

You're the one who sounds out of touch.<p>I want to put this down in a way to further the conversation. ""But after reading that article, I just don't believe..."" - that statement. You read a news article - I've read many too - and you feel educated enough to make a judgment on my personal experiences including very upper class people, Western skilled workers, and some poor people who were maids, sanitation people, etc. After reading a news article, you feel confident to make a judgment that someone else's firsthand experiences are not indicative of how things actually are, and that the person is out of touch.<p>> There's so much in this article you seem to dismiss with a wave of the hand by saying other countries have their problems too.<p>No. That's not it at all.<p>I don't think people realize how bad poverty is. So when you read that someone worked 12 hours in terrible conditions for $800/month, that sounds incredibly horrible. But people don't realize that when a meal at a cafe costs 22 cents, a bus ride costs 11 cents, a giant bag of rice costs less than a dollar - well, then $800 goes a long way. I've spent time in third world countries. Most people who get righteous when a story likes this comes out, haven't. $800 goes a long way in the third world.<p>Some people pulled themselves out of poverty by working in Dubai. I'm not talking about the up and up people. Some poor people pulled themselves out of poverty in Dubai. Bad things also happened there, but good things happened too. That doesn't dismiss some terrible things, but the article ignores some people who literally turned their lives around there.",1259617778
