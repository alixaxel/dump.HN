955665,comment,955628,955628,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Im always suspicious of stuff like this about musical instruments (mostly inherited from my brother who is a successful musician and says a lot of it is bunk).<p>There is another famous one with Violins (I read it in a magazine so no online link, sorry) where they put various old and well respected violins up against a couple of cheap new ones (and a fancy new one that supposedly uses fungus to get an amazing sound) and asked some experts to pick them out in a double blind test - with the results coming out pretty randomly.<p>My brother's main area is brass instruments (though he has picked up the violin in the past) and there is all sorts of similar ideas there: I think the main one is that the brass ""adapts"" to the player and no one else can lay an instrument as well as it's owner. My brother is convinced this is a bit of psychology mixed with the fact that the player is used to their instrument (which of course varies slightly from the next).<p>He says when you meet trumpet players at the top of their game who can pick up a brand new instrument and play it just as well after a few minutes practice it throws things into perspective :)",1258890899

955661,comment,953134,954779,0,0,cabalamat,,,"> I have quite a bit of faith the Conservative government will undo a fair bit of the damage Labour have done.<p>Actually the Conservatives broadly support this particular bit of damage. In fact they want disconnection of filesharers to happen sooner: <a href=""http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2009-11-09c.6.8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2009-11-09c.6.8</a><p>Furthermore, the Tories are also in with Rupert Murdoch -- they're widely suspected of having done a secret deal with him -- so they'd be likely to go along with any new restrictions on fair use etc that Murdoch wants in order to turn the net into a locked-down pay-per-view digital newspaper. (Murdoch's plans won't work, of course, but that won't stop the Tories pushing through harmful laws).<p>So while the Tories will be better than Labour in some ways, they're sure to be worse in other ways: meet the new boss, same as the old boss.",1258890639

I don't think that page is specifically talking about UK law (e.g. <i>""The actual specifics of what is acceptable will be governed by national laws, and although broadly similar, actual provision will vary from country to country.""</i>) and I believe the 2004 date is just when they updated that page.<p>I coincidentally just attended a briefing on copyright given by our lawyers on Thursday and the basic message was that the exemptions are complex and incredibly tight and have gotten much tighter recently (particularly ""non-commercial"" is a shadow of its former self).<p>From Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing</a><p><i>""Fair dealing is an enumerated set of possible defenses against an action for infringement of an exclusive right of copyright. Unlike the related United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing cannot apply to any act which does not fall within one of these categories. In practice, common law courts might rule that actions with a commercial character, which might be naïvely assumed to fall into one of these categories, were in fact infringements of copyright as fair dealing is not as flexible a concept as the American concept of fair use.""</i><p>The fact that ""fair dealing"" is a list of narrow exemptions in the legislation, rather than a general concept is why we're still waiting for new legislation that will allow us to legally rip CDs to put on our iPods while in the US a judge can decide that it is ""fair use"".",1258889912

955655,comment,955427,955427,0,0,ErrantX,,,"It'd be interesting to see how much money Spotify earned for those million plays.<p>I know that's probably a tough number to come up with but if it is $200 or $2000 then we can start to consider things in perspective.<p>I think everyone here will agree that it is complete FUD the amount of damages the record industry claim from illegal downloads - and that it is apparent some (though again I suspect not as many as people tend to claim) publicity and additional sales is created from illegal downloads.<p>In this sense perhaps Spotify is almost a loss leader; barely scraping a living on the idea that it's users are more likely to go out and buy an album or go to a concert. If that's the case they need to be more up front about it; otherwise fall outs like this will happen.<p>Of course it could well be that they are just ripping off artists. who knows.",1258889713
955654,comment,955427,955605,0,0,tumult,,,"It's strange to me that some people seem to believe that artists would stop making art without economic incentive. As if somehow, the prospect of being financially rewarded is the differentiator between creating art and not. As long as you are making enough money to be comfortable (or maybe not, for some artists!) there's no amount of money you can offer someone to make them a better artist.<p>Yet another similarity between artists and programmers: you cannot get someone to create something that otherwise would not have been able to by offering money.",1258889638

955651,comment,955239,955354,0,0,Dove,,,"<i>sick in what way?</i><p>I think the primary characteristic of Card's writings is that he likes to explore the nasty, and a lot of the time he's apologizing for it.  Ender's Game is about murder writ small and large, and the provocative question it asks is whether you can blame Ender for what he did.  Hart's Hope does that with adultury; Pastwatch with slavery and cultural imperialism.  Even when he's not that provocative, the world just tends to be nasty and not always in a very redeeming way.  Kingsmeat and Unaccompanied Sonata may be the worst offenders.<p>Asimov's stories are about reason triumphing over puzzles, and Heinlein's are about facing tough decisions with a bold face.  But Card's are about characters who wrestle with the guilt and psychological problems they inherit from living through twisted circumstances in a twisted world and <i>can you really blame them for what they did?</i><p>As a teenager, I thought that was interesting.  I thought it was deep and morally provocative and philosophically enlightening, I thought the characters were even admirable.  As an adult, I mostly find it tragic and morally hasty.  I'd rather read about heroes and courage and reason and responsibility than guilt and pain and evasion.",1258889484
955650,comment,955427,955610,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"I guess it would depend (like the advertising) on what kind of demographics the population consists of. Pop music, because it is specifically designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of people, would have terribly nonspecific demographics. The weirder the genera, the more specific the audiance (usually), and thus higher ""CPM"".<p>Where's the sweet spot? Serving music has got to cost much more than serving a jpg ad, but maybe less than or equal to a flash ad (depending on the song and ad of course). I could very well be wrong about that though.",1258889417
