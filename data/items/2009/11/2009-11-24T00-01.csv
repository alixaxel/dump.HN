The implication Sid is the bad guy because he is deflating many careers.<p>It does really suck when you work the hardest you can, fail, and you find out there is someone who is <i>just so much better</i> than you who consistently beats you. It often does create a caustic culture and a risky business environment where the company is overly reliant on one person and has no one else on the bench when the Truck Number gets called in.<p>But, one could easily argue that holding stellar performers back from expressing their talents is worse since they are <i>just so much better</i>. Could you imagine a world without Civilation because it made some people feel inadequate?",1259024185

This can lead to a lot of work, especially if more employees are in a similar situation.

This way the employer can, once granted, pay out a tax free allowance of (roughly said) 30% of the salary of the employee.

Large corporations are probably better organized so you can do work from home, but the coffee is usually free and commuting distances are rarely more than an hours drive (50km).<p>Wages for webdevelopment is between 2500 and 3500 euro per month for mid-career.<p>Look out for housing: it's extremely difficult to find a affordable and decent apartment - especially in the bigger cities.

The article explicitly mentions ""rich"", and you should feel comfortable assuming that ""rich"" does not mean ""middle-class"".
