That includes leaving them money after I die. I might be gone, but the money is a product of my labors. It was still mine to spend.<p>Furthermore, I have never found Buffet's malinvestment in lucky scions argument convincing. Yes, they were born lucky, but you shouldn't handicap them for that reason. Morover, clearly some very wealthy people do chose to give most of their money away as opposed to giving it all to their heirs. Buffet and Gates have both pledged to do so with most of their money.<p>Merging the two ideas: if the government is collecting assets to prevent malinvestment in unworthy heirs after the proven patriarch dies, why shouldn't the government chose to confiscate the wealth of those who they deem to be making bad investments while they are alive?",1257987503

My father instituted a rule that we could have any cereal with <= 10 grams of sugar per serving, and so my sister and I became acutely aware of said levels.

Each time I hit an endpoint, I would travel back to a folded page and then make a new decision to see where it would take me.<p>Funny how memory works.

936772,comment,936544,936544,0,0,btilly,,,"I'm interested in the independent opinions.  I hope to see more of them going forward.<p>Here is my relatively uninformed opinion based on having read through their examples and some of the recent discussion.<p>Having looked at the language a little, I think I understand why they don't have exceptions yet (if ever).  The problem is that they envision using this to write servers, and the servers will essentially use a microkernel design with message passing through channels.  But when one of your little miniservers goes down, who is it supposed to report the error to and how will that be dealt with?  If there is no good answer, then what sense does it make to let a miniserver go down without warning?<p>To be concrete, take this example from the documentation:<p><pre><code>  func startServer(op binOp) (service chan *request, quit chan bool) {
      service = make(chan *request);
      quit = make(chan bool);
      go server(op, service, quit);
      return service, quit;
  }
</code></pre>
If an exception is thrown within the server function, who catches it?  What can startServer do?  Someone who talked to chan?  The last process who tried to talk to chan?  Everyone who tries to talk to chan?  Do we shut down the whole program?  Concurrency gives you tangled flow of controls, and you don't have a simple stack where it is clear who has responsibility for a given error.  In some ways it really <i>does</i> make sense for the server to pass back an error object somewhere and let someone else figure out what to do about it.<p>Moving on, I think a better mental model for ""interface"" is ""implicitly matched mixin"".  Like a Ruby mixin and unlike a Java interface, once you've matched the set of methods in the interface you can now call the methods that are appropriate for that interface.  That's very powerful, and potentially very dangerous.  When you write a larger system I could definitely see method name collisions becoming a big deal.<p>Moving on, the lack of generics is huge, and I hope they solve it.  They have first class functions and closures, but when asked on the mailing list whether they support standard functional goodness like map and reduce, the response was that the type system made that really hard.  When I think about it, I can understand why they are fighting the type system.  But if they can add generics then they can solve that problem.  The challenge is doing it efficiently.<p>And my final thought is that anyone thinking of building a real server out of this should read up on capability systems before figuring out their security/permissions model.  I say this because having a channel to a service IS a capability, but most programmers don't realize how powerful that organizational concept can be.

The preprocessor for each file is run (i.e., gcc -E), and it's inserted into a hashtable (key: the checksum of the preprocessor output and the .cpp or .c file, value: the .o file). If the preprocessor output and the .c or .cpp haven't changed (checksums match), instead of recompiling the .o file, the stored .o file (usually in ~/.ccache) is just copied.<p>It's actually really hard to make a compiler that's faster than that (amortized cost of nothing). And it's not the same as precompiled headers. In fact, it's about as similar to precompiled headers as Windows is to Linux. I.e., one is based on small parts of the pipeline that are precise and always work if you know what you're doing, but are poorly documented -- '5 to 10 times as fast' as mentioned on the website is just incorrect).<p>Anyway, Go looks awesome.
