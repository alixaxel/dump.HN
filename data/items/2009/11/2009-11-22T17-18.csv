My mom is a piano teacher, so I've heard a lot of pianos and a lot of piano players over the years. A ""poor"" piano can sound quite good in the hands of a musical player, and a Steinway can sound ""off"" in the hands of a mechanical or out of practice musician.<p>If an instrument hasn't been played in months, odds are the person who owns the instrument hasn't played on it in months either.",1258912709

First, I want to offer an anecdote about the extent to which brains can be wired differently.<p>For awhile I was in a business partnership where I wrote code and I worked with a designer. One day a friend told us that she had started a new yoga studio and she wanted to show us her new business card, which was done in the shape of a bookmark - long and narrow. At the top was a photo, at the bottom was a quote from Hinduism. The quote was about acceptance and suffering.<p>The next day myself and my partner were at restaurant. The service was terrible. I jokingly repeated the quote about acceptance and suffering. My partner gave me a blank look.<p>""I'm quoting from that business card that we saw yesterday,"" I said.<p>""What quote?"" she asked.<p>""The text at the bottom.""<p>""I don't remember it.""<p>""It was under the photo.""<p>She then began describing the photo. She remembered in astonishing detail - camera angle, lighting, pose, shadows. I hardly remembered it at all.<p>It struck me that I had a good memory for text, whereas my partner had a good visual memory. And I've noticed that is  fairly common division among programmers and designers.<p>The point of this story is that programmers and designers have brains that are wired in very different ways. I assume some of that difference in wiring is essential for any of us to be good at what we do.<p>Having said all that, I'd say the best designer I've worked with, and who is currently open to accepting free-lance work, is Darren Hoyt: <a href=""http://www.darrenhoyt.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.darrenhoyt.com/</a>",1258912649

Time and again throughout the history of the digital age, data has ceased to exist precisely because it was in a digital form. Consider this remark from the US National Archives: ""By the mid 1970s, when computer tapes for the 1960 census came to the attention of archivists, there remained only two machines capable of reading them. One was already in the Smithsonian. The other was in Japan!"" An entire task force now exists at the National Archives (<a href=""http://www.archives.gov/era/papers/preservation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archives.gov/era/papers/preservation.html</a>) to address the problem of expiring data formats (old cassettes, magnetic tape, etc).<p>Take the following hypothetical: if Google goes under sometime in the next decade, and takes all of its data with it, the thousands of volumes that have been archived by the Google Books project will persevere <i>only</i> because university libraries around the world have copies of them on their shelves. Data continue to exist even when they're not immediately available to us at our terminals.<p>[And this is most certainly not the forum for this, but if I'm reading between the lines correctly you seem to be speciously implicating that Judaism was surpassed by Christianity as the predominant western religion because of its failure to embrace the printing press, but I would point out to you that a.) I own a lovely bound copy of the Tanakh, published by the JPS and available from Amazon for the low low price of $23.10, b.) the total number of adherents of Christianity had leapfrogged Judaism by at the latest the 4th century--a full millennium before Gutenberg--and would only continue to skyrocket seeing as it was the de facto faith of a sprawling political empire, and c.)

955939,comment,955635,955886,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>Good point, I didn't think about retrieving the answer. Is that something can be done with gates or is there another method?</i><p>My (simplistic) understanding is this: you need to think of the ""registers"" in a qc as not storing one value but essentially a probability distribution, so your operations are really convolutions of those distributions. ""reading"" from the register is a measurement, which collapses the wavefunction into a set of states which happen to share the value for the attribute you are measuring. The outcome of the measurement is random but governed by the probability distribution that the system has for that attribute at that point. You need to make the desired answer stand out in that distribution (i.e. more likely to come up), otherwise you won't have gained anything vs a classical computer.<p><i>Seems like you might be right in the short term, but I wonder if it will be true in the long term.</i><p>I'm having a hard time understanding this stuff at the micro level, whereas assembly language of a classical computer is trivial in comparison. I made the FPGA and concurrency analogy because you have to account for global state, not just the state of registers touched by one instruction. Except the ""global state"" in a qc is a different beast entirely. I guess I don't have a clue what these abstractions might look like so I'm going to accept that you may well be right.",1258911858

I find those forms annoying - the US and Canada sit at the top of the list, but then to find the UK I have to go down and look near the United Arab Emirates or Uruguay or some such place.<p>But then, some forms have ""Great Britain"", others just ""Britain"" and some split us into England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It can take minutes just to find my country and I do wonder how many people just give up and never sign up or finish the check-out.",1258910097

I think it makes sense to look at where users come from and list them accordingly.  Maybe there's a bit of bias here but I find the ones that list the US, Canada first to be more useful (though one of the problems is that it is perceived as arrogant by foreigners but then again I'm Canadian).<p>Another alternative is to default to the country from which the IP address originates - but I'm not a programmer and don't know how difficult that is.",1258909860

I can imagine Apple adding something to FrontRow that acts as a ""Virtual Bookshelf.""  Heck, it doesn't even have to be Apple.  Microsoft with that ""Project Natal"" tech would be able to make an awesome version of this!  Just have that up all the time as a sort of screen-saver.
