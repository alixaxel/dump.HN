By only targeting GSM, they drastically simplified the engineering required for the device. The recent comments from an anonymous engineer on the Pink project made it clear that targeting both GSM and CDMA was a huge mistake for them. My understanding is that the two radios are not simply interchangeable. Building an iPhone for both would have required coming up with two radically different internal designs. This would have required engineering hours which would likely have delayed the phone. (or the 3g, or the 3gs) And that delay would naturally have cost market share.<p>So, it is pretty hard to say what would be different if Apple had a phone that ran on other carriers.

Is it the per user cost of fi that is too much or just the overall cost?  What if the $3600 included as many users/repos as you wanted (given your hd space) and 1 year of free upgrades.<p>How about $999.99 (same as Adobe Photoshop so it should only require middle management approval)?  What if you got a box like the yellow google search box (it could be called that the ""premium version"")?<p>An unknown factor in all this is how many companies would be even interested in buying a github server in the first place.  If it isn't that many the costs might be too low to sustain development.  I am betting that for the GitHub guys it makes a ton of sense for them to sell the private small accounts on github (and only manage/fix 1 github version). and for the big guys sell them a big package.",1257999612

You can't choose your parents, you can't choose your DNA.  You can't choose the country you're born in, the ideology you're raised with, the opportunities you'll have, the events in your life that shape your psyche, the friends and enemies that taught you who to be.<p>Even when you make decisions, take action, seize opportunities, the grit and courage and insight and endurance that enables you to do so originally came from somewhere else.  Someone taught you that.  Something made you that way.<p>I am the sum of the curses and blessings and happenstances of history.  You cannot factor them out of my identity.  There would be nothing left.  Asking who I would be had I been born in Bangledesh is like asking what a square would be if it had been a circle.  The question is wrong-headed.  I would be someone else.<p>And asking whether the son of Sam Walton deserves wealth is like asking whether Audrey Hepburn deserves to be beautiful.  It's the wrong question.  Gifts--from parents or forefathers or strangers or the universe--are never a matter of deserving.  They are not to be worked for or worked off.  They are to be embraced with gratitude, and cherished with an earnest effort to make the most of them.<p>The idea that gifts should be received with guilt, that jealousy on the part of those who don't receive them justfies taxing or destroying them to make things a little more fair, is the attitude I find repugnant.<p>Perhaps Albert Einstein does not deserve to be so intellectually creative, but that does not mean half of his intellectual energies belong to the state.  Perhaps you or I do not think the son of Sam Walton deserves wealth.  It is irrelevant; it only matters that Sam thinks he does.  What he does with the wealth is his responsibility, as what you do with your gifts is yours.  The fact that these things are <i>gifts</i> does not in any way change the fact that they are <i>ours</i>.",1257999593

Buying a six month ticket is making a $1,000 investment in being in that situation for six months.<p>Maybe they'll lose the job in question, move, or need the $1,000 in cash for some emergency. Depending on how likely those possibilities are, the buyer is going to have a lesser or greater preference towards a more liquid place to put their money.",1257998791

My issue with the analysis is that purchasing a CD is, to some degree, a mechanism to store your money - and hopefully get it back at the end of some period of time.  Buying tickets one month at a time also gives you the flexibility of finding alternative transport or moving.",1257998756
