Perhaps someone who writes for public consumption,especially when talking to peers, should control the tone of his writing?<p>Your writing  <i>comes across</i> as that of an immature teenager who can't control his thoughts or emotions.( I am not saying you <i>are</i> immature, just making a subjective comment  on the tone of your writing).

She comes to stage in drag dressed as a man, but no facial hair; a weird, over aggressive super-macho man. Throughout the performance, she removes one clothing item at a time, and by the time she has stripped there was just a naked, aggressive douche-bag staring back at me. It was one of the profoundest acts of human performance I have ever seen. She is a very attractive women outside character; in-character, it was just another dude at the gym, I now remember that I don't even recall looking at her genitals, I wasn't looking for clues or confirmation, just annoyed there is a naked guy on front of my girlfriend.",1249790027

And the more tech is piled on us, the more inconvenient it gets.<p>Textbooks have one advantage that the internet will never have: centralized information. If I'm doing a physics problem and need to look up information about electromagnetic waves, I'll flip to the index, look it up, read the passage, then make margin notes or perhaps bookmark it. This is way too difficult to reproduce with a Kindle or something similar. Even if there was a device that had all of those features, I doubt they could do better than the tried and true method.<p>However, what I see is what I reluctantly think of as textbooks 2.0. No more way too expensive textbooks for a high school history class. Instead, teachers will hopefully take more time to figure out exactly what they will teach and textbook makers will size down their resources to accommodate. Did I really need to buy a $90 ancient history textbook when we only read 50 pages of it? Did I really need to buy a $200 Organic Chemistry textbook if we only did the example problems out of them?<p>Let's not kill the textbook but fix the textbook.",1249790007
