I was on a cross-country team in high school.  That took me from slightly chubby to rail-thin.  Every single person on the team who started out over-weight made great progress.  One fat kid lost at least 30 pounds in just three months.  Nobody I knew who kept running stayed fat.<p>Still, I have to say that my experience fits with the results of the experiment mentioned in the article.  At one point after spending a few years doing little but sitting in front of the computer, I decided to lose about 25 kilos.  I went out and did about the amount the ""high exercise"" group mentioned in the article did, and I just ate more as a result.  However, <i>after going over about 50km/week, I found my appetite suppressed</i>.  It was kind of like my body had found its equilibrium and my hunger was based upon how much I actually needed.  I lost weight really quickly after that.",1249840761

751038,comment,750866,750925,0,0,dbz,,,"I disagree, if not a visual design, then a design for the <i>code</i> itself is needed- well, it's needed for big enough projects. If one were to skip planning out the project and how to code it, one could easily mess up whatever protocol system there is an just code the entire system poorly. Sadly I did this once! I coded the entire thing, and it worked. No plans, no designs, no nothing- one bug, and the entire project was ruined because I didn't plan ahead and design my code to be flexible in the least. Basically what I am saying is that if I had taken a minute to plan it- I would never have had to rewrite LOTS of code. It's always a good idea to design something before coding, a visual of the project helps and the actual code structure outline helps.<p>Moral of the story:\nAlways have a design up front. I didn't have a design so the structure of my code was incorrect for the ""visual"" the other person had <i>in mind</i>, so it broke. If that visual is solid, especially when working with/for another person, then fewer mistakes will be made down the road.",1249840610

It was late, and I tend to refine long posts through iteration.<p>To answer your question, I <i>did</i> search for the authors' other research, and found a long list of publications on the relationship of calcium supplementation to cancer.  So I knew that was their general focus of research.  But my answer was based solely on the content of the abstract:<p><i>""CONCLUSIONS: Improving calcium and vitamin D nutritional status substantially reduces all-cancer risk in postmenopausal women.""</i><p>That's a limited statement.  Regardless of the title of the press release, what they showed was that there's evidence that Vitamin D supplementation -- when combined with supplemental calcium up to the US RDA -- significantly reduces cancer in post-menopausal women.<p>The study was limited to post-menopausal women because they were trying to research osteoporosis (again, see abstract), and that's probably what they got funding to do.  But because the mechanism is general, and since they weren't doing anything extraordinary with the calcium supplementation, there's no <i>a priori</i> reason to believe that the results are <i>specific</i> to older women.  That's the only additional assumption I'm making.",1249840337

What kind of computer program converts a program specified in formal language into an executable program? Oh, right--a compiler.<p>The most generous I can get here is to suppose he's advocating a declarative high-level programming language. But that wouldn't be nearly as interesting to write an essay about, so let's pretend that your declarative, high-level ""specification"" language means ""no more writing code"". Either that, or he honestly believes you can write a compiler for English. But given how most specs are written, I would be even more fearful of the output of an English compiler.

And don't get me wrong, that's just as much a danger for designers to go off into visual polish mode and get the interface looking like lickable candy rather than making the bare minimum interface they need to test with real users, whether with usability testing or metrics or what have you. I'm definitely an advocate for both designers and programmers to implement the smallest possible feature set they need to test their app or site in the real world.<p>Speaking of which, I'm not sure the original blog author limited the scope of their app either - they didn't explain how they define ""success"".

751011,comment,750916,750916,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"> As science writer Gary Taubes noted in his 2007 book Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health, ""The obese tend to expend more energy than lean people of comparable height, sex, and bone structure, which means their metabolism is typically burning off more calories rather than less.""<p>Bizarre irrelevant quote from that book. I think it was made while blasting the eat-less-exercise-more crowd which does not work.  Taubes argues that the wrong theory comes from a misunderstanding of the conservation of energy principle, i.e., for anyone who gains weight it <i>has</i> to be true but it does not explain the cause. Growing teens eat more than they expend in energy and the reason is growth hormone. Same applies to gaining weight, the cause is insulin which is elevated when we eat carbs. Cut the carbs and lose weight and possibly a raft of other modern diseases. The science is  very clear and the medical field is ignoring it because they owe us a huge mea culpa.<p>Read the book but here is more data.\n <a href=""http://thras.blogspot.com/2009/08/diet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thras.blogspot.com/2009/08/diet.html</a>",1249839384

It's a big difference between design and programming - you can and probably should slice off pieces of functionality to implement but doing that with design leads to one of the biggest criticisms of designers within an agile/xp/scrum programming setup: a frankenstein-looking interface.<p>There's a reason why ""agile design"" and ""agile ux"" is gaining steam as topics amongst designers (especially startup-focused ones like me) and it's because yes designing everything upfront is old school waterfall and clearly bad but designing on the go with super fast iterations can lead to an ill-considered spray-and-pray approach to the visuals. So we're trying to figure out a middle ground where the designer isn't just following behind and applying polish. That diminishes a designer's role just as much as it does to make a programmer always come later in the process and treat them like someone that simply implements what the designers make.<p>I'm not advocating an approach, just pointing out that there's definitely positives to having design go first, especially if you do user-focused research like running usability tests on mockups or paper prototypes. It'd be great if you could flip flop back and forth from having design or engineering drive the discussion and that's exactly the setup promoted in Bill Buxton's Sketching The User Experience.",1249838716

Would you pay someone with a jack hammer who can get the job done in an hour the same rate you'd pay someone with a sledgehammer, which will take 8 hours?  The task is the same.  The value of the completed project is the same.<p>But if the jack hammer owner charges a fix bid billed for half the hourly rate of the sledge hammer owner, he spends an hour and gets paid for four.<p>In a fixed bid contract, the jack hammer could charge 50% more than he would estimate the demolition (originally billed at half the hourly rate of the sledge of 4 hours) at 6 hours and still make more money and spend less time: 6x as much money and spend 1/8th as much time completing the job.  If his estimate was <i>way</i> under actuals and it ends up taking him <i>twice</i> as long (2 hours) as he originally thought it would take, which was 1 hour, he still makes triple the hourly rate for two hours of work (6 hour billed estimate, 2 hours of work) than the guy with the sledge hammer!<p>The use of tools that accelerate task completion, in this case an 8x improvement (jack over sledge) enables the jackhammer operator to underestimate the labor times and still make more money at lower times to completion.  Plus, the driveway owner gets his demolished driveway in 25% of the time that it would have taken with a sledgehammer and that is <i>still</i> at a project overrun of 100%!<p>But the world doesn't understand equations like this or really accept the value of advanced technologies.  I use technology to build custom software products that are way more advanced than what typical developers use, so I can build them 10x faster and charge half the rate and still make more money!<p>I know a local case where a company is paying a guy to use Perl to build a data driven website using files -- instead of an SQL Database.  he's been working on the website for over 5 months and it still isn't finished and it has already reached the maximum of its flexibility. It's already going to have to be re-architected to enable the features the client wants now.  If the local company had gone with <i>our</i> company, which uses a flexible sql based infrastructure, then the project would have been completed in about 2 weeks and still have lots of flexibility to go!
