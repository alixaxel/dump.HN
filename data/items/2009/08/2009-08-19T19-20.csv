773616,comment,773046,773062,0,0,unalone,,,"Here's why I disagree with you (I upvoted you because you make a valid point worth debating and weren't an asshole):<p>There's an instinct in us all to assume that because people are good/talented/interesting in some ways, they must be good/talented/interesting in every way. On Hacker News and in the YCombinator sphere, there is a blunt attitude that if you're at work and not starting something up, you're not being as productive as you could be/are wasting your life. This gets reinforced by everybody here, not because people are assholes about it (most of them are not), but because everybody here is so well-spoken - and most everybody here is wise and talented to boot - that it's easy to look at this crowd and say, ""These people are people I like, and they do startups, and because I don't want to do startups there is something wrong with me.""<p>Paul's essays reinforce this. Because he constantly writes from the assumption that yes, building a start-up is good, his essays have slowly taken on the attitude that the Paul Graham way is the <i>right</i> way, no shades of gray. The thing is, from his perspective I'm certain it <i>is</i> the right way. He doesn't bother writing essays for people who don't have his same mentality, and he shouldn't have to frame himself in that way. But the Hacker News mentality is so wholly wrapped around ""PG""'s that very often it seems his essays define what's good people and what's bad people here. So if you're not a start-up person, there's something vaguely hostile in that set-up.<p>Sometimes, thinking about what advice you're giving should <i>not</i> be followed is the most productive thing you can do.<p>To the OP: My advice is to look for that knowledge somewhere outside of Hacker News. As bright as this community is, it's a very one-sided one and it's that way for a reason. If you want to round out your opinions, look for other communities that aren't so focused on the start-up mentality, and stay there until you build up confidence and realize that in the end, you get to decide what matters to you rather than other people.",1250711526
773615,comment,773106,773483,0,0,astine,,,"I'm going to agree with sho on this matter. If you provide something and give the impression that you will continue to provide it, you are partly responsible when people become dependent. You are certainly not required to continue to provide it, but you should at least give warning that those who were dependent have a chance to adapt.<p>When you quit a job or end a contract you ordinarily give notice. It's the same principle, and a matter of courtesy.

I can't see complaining about Django being poorly decoupled, only to then go on to describe how little of it you're still using. How tightly-coupled can it be if you're only using small pieces?<p>Also, it seems like a lot of the complaints are about contributed apps like authentication and the admin. It seems to me that he never really tried to learn the admin, or was using a very old version. And you don't have to use authentication at all, you can completely write your own, or fork the one that comes with it and make it work for you.<p>But the main thing that bugs me is that he obviously doesn't get opensource either.

I respect individual free will greatly and never expound my philosophies unless someone asks :)<p>I would agree, in the end it is ultimately about happiness and joy. However, if you are inherently seeking personal evolution (which is what joy IS), 9 to 5 will do a lot to suppress that.<p>Unless you happen to be paid for research or bleeding edge development on some cool project, building webapps for other people day in and day out; or doing maintenance work day in and day out isn't a terribly creative expression IMHO. (Creativity IS spirit, it is an aspect of the intellect - there is regurgitation and then there is creativity)<p>I resigned from my 9 to 5 (as a systems engineer and web application developer) to pursue my self-education and a startup idea. While I <i>almost</i> did not hand in that letter of resignation, I did, and I am loving my life.<p>Mind you, I am 22, have 0 debts, 0 dependents, and am willing to live out of a tent and work from the library till my projects begin to generate an income (yes I am a lone wolf).<p>If you feel fear, that is an excellent indicator that you are staring right at <i>your</i> 'edge'. Edge being that boundary in which you, as a man (I'm assuming you're a man), find your present state of consciousness expanding into; pushing that edge pops the bubble and you begin expanding into that new boundary. The phallus is an excellent symbol, as men (speaking for myself and many that I know, I apologize for the sweeping generalization) we feel purposeless and mediocre when we are not constantly PUSHING, SPEARING, HUNTING, PENETRATING.<p>Find your edge and lean into it (don't jump off the edge), push push push. Use the masculine aspect of your psyche (intellect, hunter, etc...) to challenge yourself and your edge; you can even do this within the context of a 9 to 5 job, however, you will find at some point the typical 9 to 5 structure of serving <i>your</i> time to someone else is far less appealing than serving it to the greater self that is your <i>life</i>.",1250710821

This is not an argument to not use Django.<p>I think a lot of us have come to the same conclusion as this author: the abstractions frameworks provide are often too high level. Very quickly the needs of your project cannot be served by their generalizations. Especially in a language like Python, it's often easier just to roll your own systems.<p>However, starting off with a framework is a great way to get off the ground quickly. If you were to write everything from scratch from the beginning, you might burn out before you even produce anything usable.<p>Personally, I think CherryPy is the way to go.

This was debunked in articles in Muscle & Fitness, for one; I don't have the issues anymore, but on the flip side, the fact that NOBODY has a reference for ""stunted growth"" should be rather telling.<p>In fact, there is not even a proposed mechanism whereby muscular loads would close bone growth plates.  Even female gymnasts, who come pretty close to the textbook definition of being malnourished and overworked, <i>usually grow too big</i> to continue.  For the most part only the genetically teensy stay small enough long enough to make it.<p>Muscular workloads do not close growth plates.  It doesn't matter if you are lifting ""heavy"" or ""light"".  The key is whether you have adequate nutrition BEFORE the window closes on your longitudinal growth, so that during your ""growth spurts"" there is enough material there to incorporate into new growth.<p>In fact, strenuous exercise spikes HGH, and combined with the increase in appetite, would likely produce MORE growth (assuming plenty of food) than seen in sedentary children.",1250709996
