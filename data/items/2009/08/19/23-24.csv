There may be opportunities to monetize by promoting products from similar bands as well (ie: if you like Megadeth you might also like this album from.... ummm.... Britney Spears). Otherwise there may be advertisers looking to get their message out to the kind of people that like a certain band (if the band has a tight demographic following).<p>Ultimately though - some topics are hard going.

774096,comment,772808,774000,0,0,physio,,,"Agreed; this is fairly useless on its own.  However, the TC blurb says:<p><i>""In the future, the company plans to offer a list of alternative flights so you can quickly rebook once you learn of a delay.""</i><p>I think the real application of this is going to be purchasing fully-refundable tickets, then switching an 85%-likely-delayed flight for an 85%-likely-on-time flight, for a 72% chance of making the right call.<p>If enough people do this, airlines are going to end up cancelling entire flights when everyone switches their tickets.  This will mean they either A) offer cheaper flights on the cancelled-then-rebooked ""new"" flight for anyone who might need it, B) offer discounts if you DON'T cancel, or C) raise the prices of refundable tickets so high that you will go to another carrier at the outset.<p>Better information for customers inevitably leads to more competition and lower prices.<p>Of course airlines are barely surviving as it is, so this kind of thing would (eventually) kill off some number of stragglers.<p>On an editorial note, I say <i>good riddance</i>.  As far as I'm concerned, the entire airline industry can go out of business for not standing up for their customers.  I don't want to be physically molested or scanned naked, deal with ""freedom baggies"", a lack of water, taking off my shoes (note in other public venues you MUST wear shoes due to health codes), power-tripping morons, people rifling through my luggage, stuff stolen out of my luggage, late luggage, damaged luggage, ""lost"" luggage, showing my ID, showing my ID to 3 different people, mission creep leading to arrests for NON-safety-related issues, ""behavior detection"" specialists looking to harass nervous and/or agitated individuals, ""no fly lists"", quasi-police-powers bestowed upon flight attendants so ""interfering with a flight crew"", e.g. arguing with a stewardess, is now a federal crime; a hundred other things, all capped off by <i>secret laws</i> which heretofore had always been held to be <i>unconstitutional</i>, but now we aren't allowed to know what the laws are, pertaining to aviation security.<p>Finally, if you want to know if a given flight will be late, the answer ""yes"" also works about 85% of the time.",1250725541

The Pre when announced had a huge advantage over the iPhone which has largely faded away in a matter of months. Apple have the development team, the advertising money, the branding, the fashion, the R&D department, and the connections with suppliers to get hardware features before a small-player can. You're doomed to be forever playing catch-up.<p>What's eventually going to happen is that most people will want a product that's almost as good for a lower price, on a different network, or want something in particular that's different to what Apple are offering. In the long-run, that's Android's differentiator, as Apple aren't going to want to cut features in order to compete on price, or offer a variety of specialist features such as a physical keyboard.<p>Finally, I hardly think telling people to wait for the 2nd generation means that people will be ""waiting forever"". So far, only a single manufacturer, HTC, have released Android handsets, and both the G1 (HTC Dream) and G2 (HTC Magic) were undoubtedly rush-released and flawed. The trickle of much superior second generation handsets has already begun - the HTC Hero was released last week, and the Samsung Galaxy i7500 is supposedly out next week in the UK.",1250725196
