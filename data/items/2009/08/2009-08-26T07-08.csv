But it's the exceptions that make the whole enterprise worthwhile -- one Google makes up for the money wasted by literally 10,000 startups. And one Ted Kennedy makes up for several hundred leech politicians. It's why both professions, if you intend to do them well, are among the most important in our society.",1251273535

786786,comment,785205,785984,0,0,jsrn,,,"I think this is the logical flaw in your argument:<p>> But if they got paid less, they would do less. So whoever pays them is the one responsible for their energy usage.<p>Production (and thus energy usage) is not independent of cost (in this you are right), but not identical / interchangable in the sense that if cost goes to zero, nothing is produced and no energy is used. People produced things before there <i>was</i> money - as do animals.
You can't seriously say that a pre-money society didn't use energy (or a bird that builds a nest doesn't use energy because no one pays for the bird).<p>> On a previous post you excluded materials and wages. I can sort of understand wages, but why exclude energy cost of materials?<p>ok, that was inprecise. Energy cost of materials should be included, but the rest of the material cost excluded (I know, you say, all cost of materials is energy...).<p>> Let me shift a question to you: Which energy costs of manufacturing will you include, and which will you exclude?<p>All measurable energy to produce something is included - except that I measure the energy in Joule which is more practical to analyze a wind turbine in terms of energy yield.<p>Why do I think it is more practical?
Let me also rephrase my questions to you.<p>1. Let's look at two identical wind turbines T1 and T2, identical environment conditions over 20 years (wind, ...). Over the 20 year span, they produce the same amount of energy.
Do you agree?<p>2. Let's say wind turbine T1 is built in a world where average energy prices remain more or less equal over the 20 years. Wind turbine T2 is built in a world where the energy price is the same at first, but doubles one month after installation for some reason (invent your own) and stays the same afterwards. Now return on investment of T2 is nearly twice as high as the ROI of T1. Do you agree?<p>But in your model (ROI = energy yield) you would say that T2 produces twice as much energy. Do you understand why I think this doesn't make much sense?<p>I mean, I understand you, yes, but in your model you cannot predict the energy yield of a wind turbine without assuming a certain future price for energy - which makes this model impractical. It's good to be able to say ""this wind turbine will have an expected energy output of x joules - independent of future energy cost fluctuations"".",1251273394

786771,comment,785601,786458,0,0,azanar,,,"I may seem thick-headed for saying this, but if I were building a system to solve a problem related to the management of customers, having something representing the customers themselves would <i>seem</i> integral to the solution. How would I represent the customer data? Is it just stashed in some generic key-value mapped data structure? I would assume it would have to be in the system somewhere.<p>Maybe I'm just misinterpreting what distinction is drawn between a solution and problem domain. So far, my interpretation is as follows:<p>* You build objects to represent the machinery involved in the computation (databases, processors, interpreters, etc). These represent your solution domain.<p>* Anything that explicitly represents the data being computed, rather than just being a container for data collections, is kicked to the weeds as unnecessary and wrong-headed. These would represent your problem domain.<p>Do I have this interpretation correct? If so, I worry.<p>I have seen data processors objects become near unmanageable hedges of thorns because the entire conversion from input data to output data is rolled into a GiganticBlobProcessor object. That object containing hundreds, or even thousands of lines of code that means absolutely nothing on their own. This seems prone to its own pitfalls and need for revolutionary changes.<p>How is this extra scaffolding a net-win? Why can't I take all this processing code, and move it into the definition of the data being translated, which is probably split amongst multiple classes to model relationships?<p>For instance, I have something representing a sphere within a graphical rendering system, which is capable of responding to requests for its radius, area, volume, intersection with other shapes, etc. Have I already done it wrong? Should I have just a radius primative and then have a SphereDimensionalEvaluator which does the task, being passed the radius?.<p>I understand the point made by the LtU commenter that TaxReport itself is probably little more than a container, since reports don't really <i>do</i> much in a metaphorical sense. But a customer <i>does</i>: it can request actions and computations from other things, and other things can ask the customer things and tell the customer to do some action. Is my thinking about things this way leading me down a very dark alley?<p>I am now really confused.",1251272724

The level of friction in development (and the lines of code) just fell away at a ridiculous rate, and I finished the long overdue project within a few hours of the switch to SQLite.

But the fact remains  Ted Kennedy left a woman for dead after driving his car into a body of water.  He didn't contact the authorities when it happened, he instead went back to his hotel.   When at his hotel (and I take this quote from the Wikipedia entry) he...<p>""According to his own testimony, Kennedy swam across the 500-foot channel, back to Edgartown and returned to his hotel room, where he removed his clothes and collapsed on his bed. Hearing noises, he later put on dry clothes and asked someone what the time was: it was something like 2:30 a.m., the senator recalled. He testified that, as the night went on, ""I almost tossed and turned and walked around that room ... I had not given up hope all night long that, by some miracle, Mary Jo would have escaped from the car.""
Back at his hotel, Kennedy complained at 2:55 am to the hotel owner that he had been awoken by a noisy party""<p>So he's complaining about the noise keeping him up while this woman's still at the bottom of the sea.  The next morning (again from Wikipedia)...<p>""By 7:30 am the next morning he was talking ""casually"" to the winner of the previous day's sailing race, with no indication that anything was amiss.[2] At 8 a.m., Gargan and Markham joined Kennedy at his hotel where they had a ""heated conversation."" According to Kennedy's testimony, the two men asked why he hadn't reported the accident. Kennedy responded by telling them ""about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel ... that somehow when they arrived in the morning that they were going to say that Mary Jo was still alive""<p>And the final kicker, he didn't contact the authorities until the body was found and the woman probably survived the crash.  One last quote...<p>""Earlier that morning, two amateur fishermen had seen the overturned car in the water and notified the inhabitants of the nearest cottage to the pond, who called the authorities at around 8:20 am.[14] A diver was sent down and discovered Kopechne's body at around 8:45 am.[15] The diver, John Farrar, later testified at the inquest that Kopechne's body was pressed up in the car in the spot where an air bubble would have formed. He interpreted this to mean that Kopechne had survived for a while after the initial accident in the air bubble, and concluded that<p>""Had I received a call within five to ten minutes of the accident occurring, and was able, as I was the following morning, to be at the victim's side within twenty-five minutes of receiving the call, in such event there is a strong possibility that she would have been alive on removal from the submerged car.""<p>So had he contacted the authorities she could have lived.  And for all that he got a suspended sentence because he's rich and has a powerful family.  I won't demonize the dead but I'm not going to sit by and let people lionize him either.<p>How is it that people can bash Michael Jackson after unproven accusations but let Kennedy off even though he admits to everything laid out above?",1251270489
