743412,comment,743170,743399,0,0,Retric,,,"<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC</a><p><i>The ENIAC was a modular computer, composed of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators, which could not only add and subtract but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across a number of general-purpose buses, or trays, as they were called. In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer, and trigger the next operation — all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could trigger different operations that depended on the sign of a computed result.</i><p>It really has little to do with the design and evolution of the modern desktop.  But, it's still a cool design IMO.<p><i>ENIAC used ten-position ring counters to store digits; each digit used 36 vacuum tubes, 10 of which were the dual triodes making up the flip-flops of the ring counter. Arithmetic was performed by ""counting"" pulses with the ring counters and generating carry pulses if the counter ""wrapped around"", the idea being to emulate in electronics the operation of the digit wheels of a mechanical adding machine. ENIAC had twenty ten-digit signed accumulators which used ten's complement representation and could perform 5,000 simple addition or subtraction operations between any of them and a source (e.g., another accumulator, or a constant transmitter) every second.</i>",1249480655

It's more CPU friendly than H.264 while providing better quality.  Wow.  Maybe it's a little far-fetched to think that Google would spend $106M to open-source something, but when you think about it many companies have paid more to do the same (or for things that were already open source).  Novell paid $210M for SUSE.  Sun paid $1B for MySQL.  And having the best video codec as a free codec does fit with Google's open strategy.<p>And it might even be cheaper over the long run.  Remember, while H.264 is free to broadcast right now, there are fees coming in a year or two just for pushing H.264 over the web.  If nothing else, Google's ownership of On2 provides a hedge against getting hit too hard by royalties.",1249480446

743398,comment,742723,743254,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"On the other hand, it also means that if you want the database to check any structural constraints on your data, such as that any comments posted must be associated with a valid user, you're stuck writing it in PHP, Ruby, etc., rather than using functionality in a database that has likely already had man-centuries of optimization and debugging. Oh, and every check means sending the entire record (or table!) over the network, unpacking, probably instantiating objects, and iterating over it in PHP/Ruby/Python/etc., repacking it (with stored statements, if you're lucky), and then sending it back. That's a <i>lot</i> of extra processing that RDBMSs are already designed to handle internally.<p>Static typing is a good analogy, but the main purpose of static typing is expressing the semantics of data structures in a way that the system itself can reason with them. (OCaml or Haskell's type systems are much better examples of static typing's utility than Java's or C's, FWIW.) If you're still prototyping and/or the data structures are still in flux, then something completely dynamic will avoid a lot of extra work, but once things settle down, having the database itself be smarter about processing the data is worth consideration. (Of course, if your entire data set fits in a Python dictionary, then using a real database is overkill anyway.)",1249480291

CISC architectures are meant to make life easier for assembly language programmers, letting you do things like load, multiply and store in a single command.  In practice that hasn't been all that valuable, because programmers just use higher level languages like C when they need that much expressive power.  From a compiler perspective, it's easier (or at worst about the same) to generate code for RISC than CISC, and RISC has much more flexibility with regards to automatic optimization, pipelining, etc.",1249477594
