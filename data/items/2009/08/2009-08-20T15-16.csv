But if that's so why has Apple been fighting to keep the Pre off iTunes if they plan to implement a similar feature in the near future?  Also the report mentions the Samsung YH-J70 but the supported formats for that player don't include AAC.  Is Apple going to convert music files just to support other players?  And what about DRM?  Many earlier tracks still have DRM on them and Apple's making a decent amount of money selling ""upgrades"" that get rid of that DRM.  So are they really going to strip it off for a rival player (which would allow the user to just copy them back onto the computer to get DRM free tracks)?<p>As for the DVD import I have to ask one question: Who is driving that decision?  For Apple it represents fewer iTunes sales (since people can rip their existing DVDs) and the Studios will be worried about piracy so they aren't going to want the feature either.  I mean, as a user it sounds great but I can't see anyone ""in the room"" who would want that feature implemented.",1250783177

I understand that it's considered a ""big thing"" by people who spend a considerable amount of energy cultivating an online persona, but I have trouble believing this is actually as big of a deal as it is being made out to be.  I can think of two reasons for such an action:<p>1) Generally being ""done"" with that particular identity or community, and having lost interest to the point where the effort required to maintain it was disproportionate with the enjoyment or self-aggrandisement derived from it.  If this is the case, then eulogising and lamenting and celebrating is misplaced:  Perhaps introspection would be a better reaction - asking, ""what is wrong with the community such that a high-profile member no longer wants to be a part of it?""; or<p>2) Some kind of personal or mental problems that have precipitated this, in which case, the value of maintaining an online profile is probably just less than the perceived value from removing all traces of an online presence.<p>Or alternatively, any number of explanations to do with hackers or vandalism could be in play too.<p>I just think the response has been totally disproportional to the event, at least until more information is available.",1250783152

775285,comment,774999,774999,0,0,Tichy,,,"It seems to me that health care for the rich only is inevitable: under the assumption that there will always be arbitrarily expensive medical treatments, it seems clear that it can't be feasible to guarantee any kind of medical treatment to anyone. The only ways to prevent rich people have access to medical treatments that poor people don't have access to would be to either make sure there are no rich people (communism?) or to make expensive treatments illegal. The first is probably not a good idea or very difficult to pull off successfully, the second seems silly. Deny some people good health care just because other people can not afford it?<p>So I take it for granted there will always be expensive treatments (in the extreme case, assume an illness for which no cure is known. Researching a cure might cost billions, that only a billionaire could afford).<p>It remains to discuss what is the basic level of health care that should be available to everyone. Judging from the article, the Whole Foods guy seems to think the basic level should be good food for everyone, others might want a little bit more. But that is just nitpicking about the details.<p>Given the crap the medical system feeds us these days, personally I am scared of the ""you are only allowed the treatments the state has made you eligible for"" route. I want to be allowed a say in the health care I receive, even if it means I'll have to try to earn more money to afford it.<p>Also not sure what is more unethical: paying for an expensive treatment a poor person can not afford, or consuming useless treatments at the cost of my co-insurers.",1250782981

Suppose the cost of the machine declines over time as a series over 5 months: 9,8,7,6,5. They could charge you those numbers each month, or they could charge you $7 each months on upfront commitment. Either way they recoup the cost and you are paying the same.<p>However, with monthly plan you have try to predict hardware price declines in your business plan and you bear the consequences of getting it wrong. With commitment plan, you can lock in the expected savings immediately and put it into your business plan.
