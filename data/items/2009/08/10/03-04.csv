751910,comment,750916,751830,0,0,kingnothing,,,"Pasta isn't a high GI food.<p>""Q: Why does pasta have a low GI?<p>A: Pasta has a low GI because of the physical entrapment of ungelatinised starch granules in a sponge-like network of protein (gluten) molecules in the pasta dough. Pasta is unique in this regard. As a result, pastas of any shape and size have a fairly low GI (30 to 60). Asian noodles such as hokkein, udon and rice vermicelli also have low to intermediate GI values.""<p>from <a href=""http://www.glycemicindex.com/faqprint.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.glycemicindex.com/faqprint.htm</a><p>As a reference for anyone unfamiliar with the glycemic index, a piece of white bread is typically set to be at 100, and lower is better.",1249876773

Flash (and any other VM platform) would bypass those controls.<p>I think that within 2 years, maybe 18 months, we'll look back at this time with amusement, as mobile platforms (MacTablets, descendants of the iPhone, Android) become feature/Power compatible with products like todays NetBooks, and the though of the OS/Cell Provider telling you what application you can or cannot run on your system will seem silly.<p>And that's because it is.",1249876661

One thing is for certain: if they can't make it fast on desktop OSX they'll not likely deliver on mobile OSX. If I were Apple I'd make Adobe fix their desktop version before I'd let them near my phone.<p>About giving users enough rope to hang themselves: for every one user like you that could make a conscious tradeoff there are thousands who would never connect the dots between Adobe and battery life.<p>That's not a business risk I would take if I were Apple.

751904,comment,751039,751065,0,0,URSpider94,,,"One good case for paying a fair salary to yourself as a founder is when all of the founders are not participants in the day-to-day operation of the business.  If one of the founders is a ""silent partner,"" for example someone who helped hatch the original concept but only comes in a few days a month to help out, then the operating partners can effectively increase their ownership share of the company over time by paying themselves for their management work.<p>If cash flow is a problem, then all or part of the salary could be deferred.  In the event that the company becomes profitable, or is sold, then those IOU's become payable before the shareholders get dividends or a payout.<p>This is perhaps not the most efficient path for the company as a whole, and if all founders are working side-by-side, then it all comes out in the wash.",1249876612
751903,comment,751075,751241,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that'd actually be slower if it means you have to do the drawing on JavaScript (vs. the browser's native rendering engine).  As a rule of thumb, anything on an interpreted JS engine (not Chrome or FF3.5) runs about 1000 times slower than the equivalent C.<p>The way I'd do it is create a bunch of large tiles (like the size of Google Maps) and pre-draw all the sprites onto a single tile.  Put those tiles into a single container div that is bigger than <i>its</i> container, positioned absolutely, and clipped with overflow:hidden.  When the world scrolls, simply change the positioning of the container.  If it scrolls far enough that you need to render another tile, drop the one off-screen and pre-render its replacement on the other side, so if the user scrolls even more, the images are waiting for them.  Much like how G!Maps does it.<p>This offloads the graphics work onto the C++ rendering engine, which has been tuned for this sort of stuff.  Doing it in JS is just asking for trouble.",1249876560

Ever since I started working out and playing squash (for the last 2 months) I have significantly reduced my daily calorie intake (from ~3500 calories to between 1200 - 1500 calories). I tried this in the past but could never keep it going beyond a couple of weeks.<p>I think the reason working out has helped me is 'cause in the back of my head, I'm thinking about all the work I'd have to put in at the gym to make up for those 1000 extra calories I had.

Less, actually, since you can re-use your terrain sprites.<p>You should then be preloading the other sprites as the game goes on.

The temptation to play startup roulette is high. But at the end of the day I can't shake the feeling that spending the healthy & free years of my life working 90hrs a week on something that no one will even remember in ten years is a fool's errand. Yes, there is a small chance that I could get rich and never have to work again. But the far greater likelihood is I'll just wind up in my mid-30s doing the same thing and wondering what happened to the last decade.<p>So I work 20hrs a week consulting and spend the rest of my day reading, studying (I'm getting a masters in my spare time), cooking or playing music. There are definitely days when I am envious at my friends who work in tech, what with their fat 401ks and rockin health care and 4x income. But usually not. I'm in way better shape, have read 10x as many books in the past year, traveled more, etc. Most importantly, every time we hang out I just sense that they are unhappy and bored.<p>I realize most of the people reading this are going to be a lot more like aforementioned friends than like me so I hope this doesn't come off as insulting.

Which is all that anyone really needs.  $4 million for $100k/year, etc.  These are the standard ""I'm set for life"" numbers, as long as you don't do silly things with your money.  Which many many people do (trust fund kids, professional athletes).<p>2. Just because you can retire doesn't mean that you're going to retire.  One of the ways I like to think about it is that an extra $50k/year from my investments can turn a $20k/year job into a $70k/year job.  So now all of the sudden I can take all kinds of jobs that I wouldn't have considered doing in the past due to low salary.  Plus you don't <i>need</i> the job, so you can walk away from stressful or unpleasant situations much more easily.<p>3.

I'm saying you can get there in a month or two of reasonable effort.</i><p>I'm not an expert, but I read what they say.  This is way, way out of line with what any experienced running trainer would tell a beginner.  Not even a beginner who was, say, an extremely fit swimmer.  Definitely not a sedentary beginner.  You have to give your connective tissue time to adapt to the peculiar stresses of running.  (Plus, beginners are going to have crappy form and inflict more punishment on themselves than necessary.)  By the numbers most people use, it would be very aggressive, but <i>possibly</i> reasonable for some people, to ramp up to 42 miles per week in one month from a base of ~29 miles per week or in two months from a base of ~20 miles per week.  And that's pretty aggressive.  Trying to get to 42 miles per week in two months from a sedentary state would leave basically everybody injured except genetic freaks or people with a previous adaptation to high-mileage running.<p>If you're starting from a sedentary state with no weight problem or existing injuries, you might start with eight miles per week and ramp up to 42 miles per week over nine months.  That's a 10% increase in mileage every other week, and it assumes you don't screw up and get hurt, which many beginners do.<p><i>And, if you'd prefer, get on a bike for an hour instead. It's lower impact, and you'll burn at least as many calories as running.</i><p>That might be more reasonable (if you can find someplace nearby where you can ride in a fast, sustained way without blowing through stoplights or terrorizing pedestrians.)  I don't have personal experience with ramping up bike training (I just ride to work once in a while) but from what I hear it doesn't require as much care as running.",1249873282
