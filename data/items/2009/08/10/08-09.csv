You should start off with something you can hope to actually accomplish if you want to move forward.<p>Building a Civ clone is not like building a Twitter clone.  Especially with the terrible architecture decisions this guy has chosen.  The project will most certainly fail, and he probably won't get far enough along to even learn anything.<p>I'd suggest he starts by building something small.  Something that fits entirely in the browser, so that he can learn the basics of DHTML, Javascript and Canvas.  Something small in scope so that he can learn the basics of video game programming.  Something that doesn't overload his brain to the point where he's asking whether he should implement Comet to handle a turn-based game.<p>So no, I'm not saying he should quit programming, or even quit game development.  I'm just saying he should abandon this particular project until he has at least <i>some</i> of the skills he'll need to pull it off.",1249894529

Doubling is exponential growth and if you change nothing it will significantly slow at some point - how far away is that point in your predictions?<p>How long have you put time and effort into the company? A year? Ten? Optimistically, what would you have earned in this time otherwise and how does the sale amount compare?<p>Would you personally be tied up in the sale - e.g. you have to work for the purchaser for 2 years? Does that matter to you?<p>If it's been doubling every year for three years, imagine yourself asking this question on HN last year, having doubled for two years, considering selling for half the price. Looking back, would you advise yourself to have sold or held?<p>Do you have anything else pressingly interesting or important to work on, or other plans for what to do with yourself post sale?",1249894298

Tim advocates writing down all the things you want to do (cars, holidays, house(s), travel, etc),working out how much all these will cost per month; then mulltiplying that figure by 1.3 to give yourself a nice 'cushion'. According to him, there's no point in 'a million' or 'two million' or any other arbitary figure in the bank, most people don't actually want to be millionaires per se, it's the 5-star lifestyle that is attractive to them.<p>The monthly expense calculator is at:<p><a href=""http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/expense-calculator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/expense-calculator/</a><p>Obviously you need to work out what you want from your life fist, more info on that if you read the first link.

752244,comment,751624,752025,0,0,dkersten,,,"Agreed. I'm currently working for a salary lower than what I'd normally accept for two reasons:<p>1. I like the people I work with and the work environment.<p>2. More importantly for me at the moment: I'm learning things which would be difficult for me to learn elsewhere. For example, in a few weeks, I'll be going to the middle-east to install some hardware and train the customer (as a software developer, I wouldn't normally get hands-on experience with the customers, hardware, support and trouble shooting - all of which I think will be useful if I do decide to go the startup route); I was also put in charge of implementing a new interface for our system (and the accompanying test-suite), so I got free reign to design and program it however I want, communication with the hardware vendor and time to learn technologies which I never knew anything about - all of which, I think, will be useful to me.<p>Having said that, I don't intend on staying here forever. Before I hit my 30's, I want to have taken two or maybe even three years off to travel, meet people from around the world and do what I love to do (which incidentally is software, but slightly different than what I do in my work - I might very well go startup for this, because it would be something I enjoy, even if its never profitable).",1249894232
