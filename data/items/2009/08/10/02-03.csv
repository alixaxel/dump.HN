I'm 99% sure that the inevitable culture shock and myriad other issues that come with living in a new country cancel out any benefit you get in terms of cost of living.<p>If you move out of the bay area and live like a college student, that should be more than enough to bring your expenses to a bare minimum.<p>I know its not hard to find a room in my local college town for under $400 a month. And thats right by the university. I assume that somewhere further out in the boondocks you can get a place for even cheaper.",1249873194

You seem like a smart guy otherwise, so I don't know why you persist in making this assertion.  The difference is simple:  url shorteners introduce a middle man, another point of failure or abuse, and one that can't be fixed by the person who made the link (because they may forget the original target and not know who to contact) or the person who manages the target (because they can't set up a redirect from the old url).",1249873088

It is a wonderful experience.  There are much, muuuuuuuuuuch easier ways of reducing your burn rate, if that is what matters to you.  One simple one is taking your fluent command of the English language, American passport, and familiarity with all the local systems and relocating to anywhere in the US where the living is cheap.  In St. Louis, for example, I know there are plenty of livable apartments near Washington University for about $450 or so.  (When I was there it was $800 a month for a very capacious 2 bedroom apartment.)  Add on another $200 for food, and we'll round it up to $1,000 so that you can take the bus to see a movie once a week and deal with life's little expenses.

At least, I can't think of a downside. Scarcity is scary, though, and fear leads to alternate behavior. What I mean is that a user might think--I don't want this to expire! What if my friends come back in two weeks and can't click the link I send them?<p>I guess creative uses could be releasing a url for a limited number of beta testers, or a limited offer. In both cases, however, you want website smarts, too. In the first example, you want the website to also be checking the number of beta testers who sign up in case the real url gets leaked. In the second, you still want to have a landing page that moves visitors to the new offer or something.<p>I'd love to learn better uses for this.

Computers may be mostly about appliance functionality but the real value of one lies in its customizable parts, and some things are not, in the opinion of a lot of people, negotiable.<p>Take iTunes. There was absolutely nothing that prevented Apple from implementing USB syncing, which practically every other music player has gotten right and there's no way in which anyone would claim it's Apple's fault if it doesn't work with a player. I don't see how that dilutes Apple's ability to control its own environment. Oh wait, that means I wouldn't need a crappy iPod and I could instead manage with any one of thousands of USB mass media-based  players.<p>Which goes back to the iPod. Wow, was that an inferior product. Apple did not make a single iPod that was actually a superior player on technical terms until 2004. Before that a huge number of players from iRiver, Cowon, and many other smaller players swept the iPod in terms of capability. Hell, my old iRiver iHP-120 is the only portable DAP I know of that had a digital audio output, and until the appearance of the iPod Shuffle no other Apple player came anywhere close in terms of sound quality.<p>It's not even about the fact that there are better choices of music players; it's about the fact that a vendor is precluding me from using a component of my own because their proprietary implementation competes with it, even if I might not think that badly of Macs, and it costs them absolutely nothing on their part (save trying to strongarm me into buying their DAP).<p>By the same token one of the things many people want a phone with the power of an iPhone is to have a replacement to lugging a portable computer. That demands an open platform, and as we have seen, Apple has no intention of letting that happen.<p>What really surprises me here is the fanboys who can clearly hold the doublethink that is believing Apple control is better when they have shown they have no problem with inhibiting users from getting better software than what they have (Opera, Google Voice, Gutemberg Project, etc.).<p>I guess Apple is a fine company if you're the sort of complacent, couch-potato consumer who does what he is told even if it's not for his benefit.

That the hardware is proprietary isn't nearly as big of a deal here. Its all embedded, can't really be upgraded anyway.<p>Using a different OS isn't that big of a deal either. PreOS won't run on it, Android won't fully support iPhone's features, and why should Apple waste resources making their OS run on hardware they don't support?<p>Now, if you wanted to complain about the App Store policies being bad, thats a valid complaint.
