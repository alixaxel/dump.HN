754268,comment,750916,751809,0,0,xiaoma,,,"Nearly every high school cross-country runner goes from zero to five days a week of running instantly.  I built up to over 62 miles and six days of training a week in the first season and I know plenty of others who have done the same.  Not only that, but I did the same thing again 15 years later and 60 pounds heavier.<p>The human body really is designed to run.  Most injuries are due to pushing to go too fast.  If you keep your heart rate at about 60-70% of max, you'd be surprised how quickly you can ramp up mileage without hurting yourself.  The key is to never push yourself so hard that you feel like you couldn't do a workout the next day.<p>Cycling works almost as well from a cardio-vascular standpoint, too.  It's not weight-bearing, though, so it won't help improve your bone density or strengthen your joints like running will.  You could probably compensate by doing a bit of weight training.  In the end, it comes down to getting off your butt and moving.",1249944889

Thanks to This Week in Google podcast for telling me.<p>The Google purchase of On2 last week really makes me think Google plans to round out the HTML 5 spec for video by open sourcing all the codecs and patents they now own.<p>If they do that, the only OS I'd need would be eerily similar to what Chrome OS is rumoured to become.<p>What fascinates me is how quickly this is all coming together. Linux has been around for years, but it's growth accelerated with the Internet exposing more and more people to the platform.<p>But what's happening around HTML 5 will do far more good for me as a netizen than the total of what the open source movement has brought about so far.<p>The HTML 5 demos of audio and video and gaming are very expensive from a processing point of view today. My newest Mac breaks a bit of a sweat when running some of these demos. But processors will get better and browser performance will improve.<p>I'll be interested to see if/when Apple launches its tablet whether it contains a 3G chip. If they're prepared to sell those things without a voice contract to go along with the data contract, it means they see what Google sees too.<p>If they don't, my next phone may run Android (2.3 years left on existing contract). HTML 5 with a robust specification for audio and video means I will no longer need iTunes. I will simply stream to the browser from my cloud at home or on someone else's farm. The only time I would need stored content is when I'm off the grid, and Google's figuring that out too with Gears and parts of HTML 5.<p>It's suddenly a Web world, and we all live in it. If I'm Apple or Microsoft, I'm scared to DEATH of Google, at least in the consumer market. And the ironic thing is Google's not actually competing directly with either of them. Their deaths will simply be byproducts of doing the right thing.",1249944505

I found it far more efficient to trim what you read instead of trying to read faster.<p>At first, filtering at a paragraph level is something I found myself to do. Usually, I just read the first few words of the sentences in the paragraph (most of the time even just some sentences in the paragraph) until I mostly see what the purpose of the paragraph is about (""Ah, he is telling me about injective"", for example). Once I know this, I either skip the entire paragraph or read it slower and deeper.<p>Second, it is sometimes a good idea to rather start in the middle of something and read to the end, just backpatching from the first chapters whatever you still need. This works well if you are reading papers about things you are familiar with. You usually just don't need those 12 definitions again, and again, and again.

I have two thoughts about why embedded developers choose C.<p>One reason for this choice that I've observed is the very conservative mindset in those developing safety critical software. I think this is understandable given potentially fatal consequences for errors.  The approach to safety is somewhat brute-force, write the code to strict guidelines, then test, test, and test.  Changing a language or compiler would require extensive re-testing, introduce unknown risks, and the development of new guidelines.<p>The other big driver for embedded software is unit cost.   The logic goes this way.  Saving a dollar on a part used in 2 million unit saves $2M in costs.  A cheaper part is selected if the part cost savings is less than the extra engineering costs needed to squeeze the functions into a smaller memory and slower chip.  C, and C++ can be quite lean, while perhaps taking longer to develop than another language.",1249942897

A way of sharing items with family members (so only one spouse has to enter the number of the plumber)<p>3. Decent offline clients (ideally sync, at least read-only) for the usual suspects - iPhone, linux (akonadi?), whatever Mac/Windows worlds use.<p>4. Web based import - eg. my electrican's website exporting their vcard/hcard so I would just click on an icon when browsing their website (like the RSS feed monitor) to import their data in my address book. Hell, maybe when they move their new address would automatically push out.<p>None of this stuff is rocket science these days, so where is it? At least is there a good solution for 1-3?

754173,comment,750911,751250,0,0,nuweborder,,,"Programmers are definately creative and very skilled.  What I mean is that there is often something lost in translation anytime you take a creative idea from one person to another, just as happens when a story is told.  In my opinion, programming language needs itself, can hinder the creative ideas of many whom do not know programming, and do not have time to learn it all.  By the time they take valuable years to learn, their idea is lost in translation and is now old.  If that person could have developed their idea without code, we'd have much greater choice in creative sites and software because the process of creation is easier.  Its the same as how YouTube has allowed millions to upload their own videos and choose whats important and interesting, or how Digg has allowed users to choose what news is of relevance.  In this case, am I saying that mainstream media professionals are not cretive?  No.  But that's exactly what these two companies have done.  They have cut newpaper companies and mainstream broadcasters out, and allowed the user to be creative and broadcast and post directly to other users.  Thats what having a program that would allow non programmers to create would offer.  Because of YouTube and Digg, we as individual online users, are able to see and experience a much greate variety of entertainment and relevant information chosen upon by our peers and not those that control media, and allows many creative people that are not typical movie stars, music artists or celebrities, to become well known, famous and express themselves and their ideas directly to the masses, without the mainstream media controllers (or programmers), and with absolutely nothing lost in translation.  We should treat programming the same as we are not treating web 2.0.  How can we push a true web 2.0, with the main aspect of the building of these sites still functioning as web 0.0?  Programmers are great and creative.  And presently, without them, there would be not web, and my companywould not exist, and nor would google, digg, youtube, or any other site.  I work directly with my programmer for my startup daily.  But if this was in place, it would help to harbor much creater creativity because everyone could get involved directly.",1249941740
