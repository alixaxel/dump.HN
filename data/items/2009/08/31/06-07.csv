Which is good.<p>Court system totally willing to issue subpoenas which would reveal identities over what I'm assuming to be a civil suit filed by corrupt property developers after they were exposed (please correct me if I'm wrong.)<p>Google not instantly turning over the data, and asking the account holders to provide an objection.<p>Still less evil™<p>p.s. edit:\nI would also like to add that the Wikileaks editorial says:<p><i>According to the notifying letter from Google to the journal, Google intends to hand over the requested records without defense and suggests that the Journal file a counter-motion with the Santa-Clara court itself.</i><p>which I think is actually false, according to my reading of the notice Google gave the account holders above. This would also indicate the headline is inflammatory/linkbait..",1251701967

I prefer sql and most of the time I don't export data from excel to a DB, I just grind my teeth and do some filtering and formulas in excel.\nsome remarks:<p>1. Perhaps you can let define the tables in the FROM clause like: FROM workbook1.xls~sheet2~A1:D4 AS table1<p>2. Add an option to autohide the not selected rows instead of coloring the selected rows, this will give a condensed result set that the user can maybe copy and paste to another sheet.<p>3.

Otherwise they couldn't claim to be supporting JSON objects as parameters.<p>Of course, anyone could just do a REST request using a wrapper object with the name of the procedure and an id. Then you'd have implemented a JSON-based RPC mechanism yourself! So it's pretty trivial. This mainly exists to get the idea out and implementations in various scripting languages, methinks.<p>One thing that might be cool: Perhaps an URL could map to an object, and making an rpc call on that URL could call a function on that object.",1251700631

Can you hope to describe these things fully, attribute it to humanism? Perhaps the human achievement is in becoming an antenna for the inspiration of our chaotic world?<p>I mean, no. I don't advocate intentional blindness to problems in our world. I would even go so far as to actually advocate a greater awareness of the weight of our impact in the world. We can learn something from knowing more what the impact of a dollar is.<p>But humans are nothing if not machines for selective attention. If every time I bought my lunch I thought about the fertilizers dripping into the ocean causing immense algal blooms full of asphyxiated fish and oh the smell! I'd probably starve.<p>If your life, the thing that puts you closest to your own understanding of divinity, is being creative; if you honestly have to face the idea of never being able to communicate like you did that one time not so long ago; if you have to keep going in face of that, well, I know what I'm <i>not</i> going to expend my attention toward.<p>But even so, the speech wasn't about finding ways to ignore some nasty personal tragedy. <i>It's about finding an interpretation on the charity and capriciousness of the creative process.</i> What really is the best way to contextualize the immense amount of discipline and work and training that goes into creation that can all amount to precisely nothing without something widely considered to be external to us?<p>Genius is 99% perspiration, 1% inspiration. Even when we can assume the sweat, we're still might end up short one spark. What gives?<p>(I apologize for the waxing here, but god this is such a fascinating philosophical question.)",1251699692

795506,comment,795358,795444,0,0,haberman,,,"> The table of contents doesn't seem to mention LL(* ) grammars, which are used by ANTLR.<p>It's true, this book mentions LL(* ) only in passing.  There is a short section (8.3.3), which concludes by saying:<p>""LL-regular is probably of theoretical interest only; if a parser writer goes through that much trouble, the effort is more wisely spent on LR-regular.  Still, it offers many interesting insights, and the parser landscape would be incomplete without it.""<p>Notice that they call it ""LL-regular"" instead of LL(* ); after reading the somewhat scant literature about LL-regular, I have become convinced that LL(* ) is one in the same as LL-regular, which saw some research in the late seventies.  I have been in contact with Terence Parr (author of ANTLR) to see if he comes to the same conclusion.  I sent him the LL-regular papers (some of which he had not seen before), and have not heard back from him since.<p>I'm also working on a parsing project that uses LL(* )/LL-regular (<a href=""http://www.gazelle-parser.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gazelle-parser.org</a>).  It's too bad the technique has not received more attention, because it can be quite powerful.<p>> I think this is the same thing as a ""pack rat"" parser (which from memory has a very straightforward implementation, but isn't an academic concept).<p>No, packrat parsers are not the same as LL(* )/LL-regular.  They are both top-down methods, but LL(* )/LL-regular is deterministic, meaning you build a table ahead of time that tells you what decision to make when you're faced with a choice.  Packrat parsing, on the other hand, is based on memoized search.<p>Packrat parsing is linear time, linear space.  LL(* )/LL-regular is linear time, constant space [0].  While both are linear time, LL(* )/LL-regular is faster.  On the other hand, packrat parsers can handle all non-left-recursive grammars, while LL(* )/LL-regular can only handle a subset of such grammars.<p>[0] Technically the time could degrade to n^2, but no real language would trigger this.  Also, the space is technically proportional to the nesting depth, but this is typically omitted.<p>> I've been writing parsers for a few years now, but I have found the academic work on it to be actively misleading - at least, for the specific things that I want to do.<p>Really?  What do you find misleading?  I've been reading more and more parsing literature, and while it can tend toward the impenetrable and mathematical, I've never found it misleading.  And I quite like the book mentioned in this article -- if you don't own it already you should definitely get a copy if you're active in the field.<p>> Or it could just be that I'm doing something quite strange and weird (i.e. novel and non-obvious).<p>Out of curiosity, what are you doing?  And is your PhD focused on parsing?  I'm always looking to meet people who are active in the field.",1251698756
