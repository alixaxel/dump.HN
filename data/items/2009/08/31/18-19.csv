In some ways they really are very similar to computer protocols.  They are there to help people communicate effectively without distraction.  Many computer protocols seems overly verbose, and they often deal with the potential for things that can no longer happen.<p>So it is with social protocols.  At least with computer protocols and royal protocols they are pretty explicit.  Often when in a social context your really don't know how you're expected to behave, and hence become anxious, and there is the potential for huge gaffes.<p>Again, don't underestimate the cruft that collects over thousands of years.

First, unless I'm missing something, endowments aren't showing ""spectacular gains"" as of late. Additionally, Ivy League schools are doling out financial aid to at-need students.

As a hypothetical example, parents who make $50k per year are expected to contribute $5000 per year. The student is expected to contribute $2000 and have a work-study paying $1800 per year.

Or slavery in the Arab world? Or genital mutilation in Africa?<p>When you start dealing with modern morals, you find that it gets tricky very quickly: to make a difference you have to navigate all of this stuff between you and effective action. Yet to deal with some historical injustice it's very easy: find the good guy, find the bad guy, and make some kind of symbolic statement.<p>Odd that you can't see that the very difficulties you face today in being moral were also faced by those in the past.<p>No matter how right or wrong you are about things, unless you're actually changing something it's all so much whining. Turing is a good example of somebody we can rally around and feel good about supporting -- he had a great mind and was treated terribly. But our reaction is all just so much fluff. It's modern morals: change your lightbulbs to CFI, write a check to a charity and leave the heavy-lifting to somebody else.<p>Just not my cup of tea.<p>I think if they want to Knight the guy that's a completely different thing, and it sounds like a great idea.

I suspect that's going to be the case for a lot of degrees where you don't need to an ivy league school and can get the same level of education elsewhere.<p>Of course, the question is at what point can kids and their parents be convinced that an ivy league degree just isn't worth it anymore (since like film industry investors, the returns tend to be more about glamour/sexiness than simple financial returns)",1251743060
