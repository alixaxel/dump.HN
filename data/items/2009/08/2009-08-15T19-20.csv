765127,comment,764768,765005,0,0,tmikew,,,"I agree it is tough. Coming from java land it always seems like one is either mixing java in the html or html in java. I have also never been totally convinced about the separate people argument. Not that it won't work, but that company's that I am familiar with don't hire both people very often the developers build both the UI and the business logic, which of course further complicates the issue, because the developers are always taking shortcuts. Everything I have ever worked on is mixed up to some extent, and it works, and we manage to maintain it. Still the arguments in the paper are compelling.<p>It is possible to use ajax and Javascript without getting things to mixed up, but again the discipline by the developers I am involved with is sadly lacking.

But in all seriousness, I think she's right. You can achieve this so called <i>nirvana</i> without resorting to religion, which is an invention by us to satisfy our spiritual needs. Also I think the stroke damaged her left side enough to <i>open her mind</i> to this point. So I <i>do not</i> think she is delusional, just more open minded. Too much logic and reasoning results in more narrow minded thinking, but too little results in more unrealistic thinking. She happened to hit the perfect balance after the stroke.",1250366258

  Scatterbrained mystics make unscientific claims about the right brain.
  Taylor makes positive reports of improved mental state, following a temporary, documented inhibition of her left hemisphere.
  Therefore, Taylor is a scatterbrained mystic whose claims are unscientific.<p>I don't see Taylor making any claims about immaterial causes or phenomena, either in this article or on her website, any more than the literature of Zen does, or any of the serious research into psychotropic drugs.",1250366109

The crux - what do you do when you need to depend on non-Ruby libraries?  Include the binaries of these?  What if they depend on glibc (which they probably will) - do you stick that in vendor too?
You'd be better off shipping whole virtual machine images as your 'application' if that's the route you want to take.<p>All modern Linux distributions - RHEL, SuSE, Ubuntu and yes Debian too have packaging formats to handle dependencies.  It's up to the distributions to package the apps, as a software developer I think you should be shipping just a plain tarball, which lists its dependencies but doesn't include them.<p>My main point was the idea that Django apps shouldn't have dependencies is wrong.  Django is awesome mainly because of the ability to easily build on other apps.  Doing this creates dependencies, and there's nothing wrong with that.",1250366091

Today you can probably choose from literally hundreds of languages.<p>Here's what I'd recommend: start off with an interpreted language, maybe Python, and work through a couple of tutorials.  If you want to be a little different maybe look at Lua.  Then try to build something.  Tutorials are good but not as motivating as your own project.  I would avoid IDEs like Visual Studio at first, they have a lot of power but for a beginner they might be distracting and keep too much under the covers that you really need to understand.<p>Then start exploring other stuff.  At some point you should try a functional language.  Work through a book like the Little LISPer until you ""get"" recursion, currying, how the Y-combinator works (no not this site).  Definitely take the time to learn C and pointers.  Even assembly.  Learn about object-oriented programming.

Starbucks by virtue of being a well-known international chain of coffee shops (and therefore a coffee shop where you <i>know</i> there is some sort of known baseline of drink quality, the menu is more or less the same, and you probably have some sort of drink you order frequently in the right words, etc.) has such an easier time of bringing in customers that indie shops do not have. That same name doesn't just appeal to customers, it also appeals to <i>everyone</i> from lenders to management companies when first opening a business and then to suppliers when continuing to run the business. Starbucks has the resources needed, if the name alone isn't enough, to negotiate better leases and spaces, prices for supplies needed bought in massive bulk quantities...you get the idea.<p>So it's nice Starbucks is reaching out to people like this during this time where many people are struggling, but so are many smaller independent coffee shops, and they don't have all those benefits Starbucks does - and just letting people do whatever they want on the wifi is not (usually) the answer. It's also one thing to restrict wifi to 60 minutes for all customers, and it's another to feel entitled to use free wifi and lots of power for hours on end after buying a small coffee. Both are frustrating. I don't know. I guess it's really up to the owner to figure out what works. As a laptop owner, it never makes me happy to see those types of restrictions, but as someone who has run these businesses before, I'm not happy to see the small but annoying percentage of laptop users who have entitlement issues.",1250363603

If, for example, you want to write a web app and need to choose between Ruby, Python or Perl pick the one you know best and go with it.<p>One factor that can make the language choice important is the speed of the program: if you need to make a computationally heavy application, you'd better choose a fast language. This would rule out interpreted languages. In such a case, you should choose Common Lisp/C/C++/Java/C# rather than Perl/Python/Ruby.<p>Another important factor is the platform where your app will be running.

765063,story,,,2,1,blintson,"Ask HN: Hardware business; preventing a competitor from using your driver",,"I want to start a company selling a piece of hardware I designed. The hardware needs a driver, and I'd like to give people who buy my thing the source code to the driver to let them modify stuff if they want to. The problem is that I'd be a small business, and as I see it, if I open source the driver to my product there's nothing preventing a larger electronics manufacturing company from building and selling something that uses the driver I wrote. So, to protect myself from that contingency, (obviously) I'd include something preventing the sale of hardware that uses that driver in the license to the code. So, I've got two questions:<p>1. Legalese; anybody law-knowledgeable here who can say how much protection provisions in the license to the code of the driver would offer?<p>2. Partial-drm solution: To reiterate, I'd really like to give customers the code, but I don't want to inadvertently help a competitor undercut me, anybody heard of a partially-proprietary driver created by a hardware company to solve the problem I'm describing?<p>Obviously, I don't mean to claim ownership to ideas, only their implementation; but if my thing gets popular I'd prefer it if the company that eventually undercuts me has to through the expense of designing their own stuff.",1250363107

Large chain stores do things even when they're a pain from the employees' perspective, but small, independent shops tend to have the owners as workers in the shop, and so they make decisions which sometimes look like the decisions employees would make, rather than those that maximize profit and goodwill.<p>I've found this to be so for specific examples of grocery stores, bookstores, coffee shops, and hobby shops, at least. Sometimes the product is enough better to make up for this, though (especially with coffee).",1250362955

The software business has always been my sideline even when luck was not on my side (running a couple of web projects now).<p>The Contracting Business found a glorious end when the Zulus were marching in central Johannesburg some years back and the Construction Industry just faded away. The Computer School ran out of capital when Windows came out and I had to replace 200 computers and I sold it to someone else (I hated mice for quite a few years after that). The Plastics factory was a big thing for me until they banned plastic bags and I cashed in!
