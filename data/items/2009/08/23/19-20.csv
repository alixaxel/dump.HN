780914,comment,780688,780688,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think this is a great way to deal with the problem, it also provides a nice insight into the market economics that get screwed up by these people.<p>I noticed when playing EVE that the unrefined ore was more expensive than refined ore, because there simply wasn't the supply. It makes no sense that iron ore should cost more by weight than iron, despite iron being purer and requiring energy for the production. It was bizarre and made the experience at the beginning quite unfavourable.<p>There was no benefit in training for ore refining, because unless you had the highest rank imaginable, you couldn't make money off of it.<p>I'd love it if the EVE developers allowed these RMT's to be hunted down in game. Cost them too much ISK through people hunting them instead of simply banning their accounts and them getting another. Turning the whole RMT into a much less profitable alternative would remove some of the incentive.<p>I'm sure bank robbers would be less likely to rob a bank if they were allowed to keep the cash but everyone in public could club them and take their wallet and smash their car up for fun. It'd be a much more social form of justice, which is what justice is supposed to be in EVE; it's legal to rob a bank, but you've got to be prepared to be a target. Equally a RMT should be treated like a counterfitter, banning the accounts is just a temporary punishment and should be used against people purchasing money, but you have to make it less profitable to the RMT's to actually remove them from the game.<p>It's like drug production. Catching every guy with a gram of coke is insane and impractical. However, if it becomes cheaper to do things legally than illegally you won't have a single gram of coke on the face of the planet. Look at some of the Asian countries, some farmers have dropped marijuana and poppies for palm trees, because palm oil pays more than drugs.",1251057569

780912,comment,780818,780861,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"I suspect that Apple will settle a lot of these out of court, like they have settled the recent ones out of court.  And then quietly add more stringent requirements to the App approval process.  After all, they already screen for content.  Consider that you cannot get an App containing pornographic content through the App approval process.  Somehow, the App in question got through because a reviewer did not recognize the image.  What it probably means is that, in the future, Apple will probably ask for some proof of copyright for things like image content bundled with your app.  That along with subtle changes to the TOS to include stronger indemnity clauses.  Basically, Apple will be making the money, and the developer will be assuming more and more of the legal risk.  Not good news.<p>That would be my guess anyway.  That said, hey, here's to hoping!",1251057443

780824,comment,780619,780797,0,0,fjabre,,,"Yeah I can testify to that.<p>We tried on-device speech rec. The unfortunate barrier to entry for this technology is something called Acoustic Models which are basically normals data collected from voice sampling. The bigger and better your AM, the more accurate your speech rec. A good sized AM could be gigabytes worth of data and we're just talking about US English.<p>Not only that but the actual recognition itself is pretty intensive CPU/memory wise. Sure you can have local speech rec as Apple does on the 3GS but that speech rec is pretty constrained: only having to recognize several hundred contact names or song titles and even then has a hard time. Try loading up thousands of contacts or songs on your device and see how well or consistent it is.<p>At any rate, AMs are like gold and pretty much all of them are proprietary. Ever think why Google offers a free 411 service..?? They want to build out their proprietary AMs.<p>So you either have to make your own AM - very hard to do - or roll with an existing solution, most of which are server based. I used Lumenvox (lumenvox.com) since they seemed to be the most developer friendly and were a pleasure to work with. The Dragon guys would sooner compete with you then sell you a product.",1251054301
