I can get reasonable work done in imperative functional/OO languages like Perl, C, Java, etc. and took the time to learn Erlang to get a look at functional programming and I can drop the SQL bomb like nothing else (so I can do declarative too) but every time I've sat down to learn LISP because people say it will make me a better programmer, I've gotten distracted and haven't finished.<p>I don't think this makes me stupid, or a bad programmer.  I think it means I have different tastes and limited time.  Learning LISP feels like learning assembly: a great exercise, but there are other things I'm more interested in doing - like building things I enjoy with my limited free time.<p>That being said, maybe I am stupid, or a bad programmer.  I don't think not being into LISP means this is the case.  I like building things people use, more than I like writing elegant code for code's sake.",1249617537

In the Valley, people from MIT don't have a good reputation as great programmers.  For some reason, their education is a lot of 'theory' and less practice.<p>Apart from Standford\Caltech, Some of the best schools that produce great programmers are your average state school.<p>I have a theory behind this, which may be correct.  Learning to be a great programmer takes years, and school is just the start.  People that do well enough go to something like MIT, think they are already very smart, and don't try hard when they come out.<p>But if you are hungry, and smart, and just happen to go to your average state school, you probably will do better, as you probably are humbler to begin with.<p>It seems when the rubber meets the street, in startups, building products, that's where the great programmers are made, and lisp is not a requirement to know to be a great programmer, or actually build great products. Having an idea of what functional languages are is a must,  knowing them is not.",1249617437

746938,comment,746807,746807,0,0,arjunnarayan,,,"The real difference is that you can take a unix program (which obeys the dont blabber rule, is a command line program with lots of options, etc.) and with a good amount of effort put a GUI on top of it to make it look pretty. Case in point: Ubuntu. It attempts to do this to most tools, and succeeds in many ways. My computer illiterate father was soon able to wrap his head around Synaptic package manager (which is just a wrapper around APT).<p>But you can't take a Windows-culture program and make it easily programmer accessible. This is a one way street. I think that the Unix-style dual access is far more powerful. Apple doesn't open source its work, but it is BSD based and I get the feeling that internally, Apple follows this ""unix culture"" (I hesitate to use the article's terminology, but bear with me here) and thus comes out with powerful programs that are command line accessible but have wrappers (albeit beautiful ones) around them. This is what enables them to refactor internal parts like in Snow Leopard that cut out gigabytes of cruft - it starts to sound like this ""unix culture"" is simply best-practice engineering in terms of modularity and flexibility of individual packages.\nIf Microsoft even attempted to refactor some parts of the OS, they'd break something terrible.<p>I disagree with Joel where he says Apple follows the Windows culture. It seems that OS X is factored ""the unix way"" up to a point - where a beautiful API is exposed, and another team (the Steve Jobs insane perfectionist team) takes that and puts a usable beautiful front-end on it, which may, in Joel's mind fit the ""Windows-culture"", but is thin enough that the unix-culture layers beneath hold the meat of the OS, and thus can be modularly modified rapidly.<p>Linux lacks this final layer, which leaves it looking so broken and hacked together at the top. It still is an open question if the front end can be created without the dictatorships of a large company like Apple or Microsoft at the helm - but if anyone's got a shot, I think Canonical would come closest.",1249615609

For example, the stuff listed under ""Inability to determine the order of program execution"" is something that many people will get jammed on eary on as they try to take their brains (which is honed on the syntax of school level maths) into the programing world (where equals is an instruction rather than an assumptions).

746928,comment,745948,746848,0,0,abalashov,,,"Yeah, I think so.<p>I'm one of those people that really doesn't make a very good employee.  Although I was considered talented and was prized for my technical abilities and interdisciplinary knowledge (and I say that not out of immodesty, but simply because I was told so in no uncertain terms numerous times), and was cut some slack in situations where a less able person might've been sent packing because they just can't get their shit together, I had - and have - the problem of it being damn near impossible to get me to do something I'm not interested in.  Just impossible.  I'll do it, somehow, but in a time frame and workflow that emits kicking and screaming in all the nonauditory ways.<p>It's not really a conscious protestation.  I'm just mentally spoiled because I grew up developing whimsically, and for fun.  Put me in situations where getting it done and accomplishing the objective is a thousand times more important than what it actually is and how it works, and I just don't thrive.  I'll do well enough to not be fired, but nothing stellar.  I have enormous productivity potential when I apply myself in enormous marathon spurts toward something I am motivated to do for one reason or another, but whereas some people have a consistent base line of performance even in things they don't care about, mine is pretty disappointingly low.<p>I want to emphasise how unconscious this sabotage of the task is;  it's not because I'm whining inside my head.  I'll just unconsciously structure my priorities in such a way that something I don't care much for will be extremely starved for timeslices, and that's that.<p>I think a lot of ""creative"" folks are that way.<p>Anyway, point is, I think there's a corollary to this tendency that expresses itself in the more general fact of unconscious sabotage.  As I progressed through the employment world, it came to be more and more the case that if I just didn't want to be somewhere, I'd mentally sabotage it so as to get closer and closer to being fired or, at the very least, given a very stern talking-to.  The last two jobs before the ultimate one weren't very pretty, either, it's just that the employers were a lot more progressive and tolerant of my work habits and lack of punctuality in exchange for getting what they considered to be a very high caliber of output.  If they were as demanding as my last employer, I would've been fired even sooner.",1249614769
