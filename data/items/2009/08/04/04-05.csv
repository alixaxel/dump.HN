(Wikipedia is your friend)<p>I realize that these things can be very real threats, but the media leeching off of the mass fear surrounding possibilities with such far-reaching consequences really desensitizes people. Such reporting makes it hard to sort out which are real threats and which are not. Not only that, it makes it hard to figure out what the <i>real</i> consequences are if these threats are realized.<p>Questions like, ""How does this affect wheat-related grains such as spelt?"" are not presented to the reader. So what happens if wheat production takes a major hit? Will we be able to deal with it? Will other crops pick up the slack? Will grains such as oats, kamut, spelt be unaffected? Are there practical considerations related to growing such alternative grains in different localities (the article <i>does</i> mention that there are many varieties of wheat bred to local conditions)?",1249361149

I don't understand why people would put up money for investments in such cases.
