Gruber does not write like most bloggers; he does an excellent job of finding interesting articles and piquing interest in them without using a large amount of their content.  When his posts are long, you can bet that they are full of original ideas and material.<p>In the Gawker example, the blog post is eight paragraphs long, four of which are lifted directly from the source and the rest summarized from the most interesting parts of the source.<p>I think that if everyone blogged like Gruber did, we wouldn't be having this discussion at all.",1249387146

741027,comment,740968,740997,0,0,maccman,,,"Certainly, I think your point about performance is a very valid one. Adobe Air lacks performance, especially combined with Flex - but I think that's more of an issue with Flash on OSX than anything else.<p>In my experience, Titanium (which Bowline is built on) has good performance. Certainly they're using all the native APIs on each platform.<p>Personally, I find coding native trickier than html/js/ruby - but that may just be lack of practice. However, I'm sure you'll agree with me when I say developing and maintaining one codebase, instead of three, is easier.<p>So, it comes down to developer laziness ;), and here I agree too. However, you could apply the same argument to use of Rails to build a website over C.\nIt's certainly an argument that's been around for a while. I personally prefer to think of it in terms of efficiency, if being lazy (writing less code) will help me build something faster, I'm all for it. I certainly couldn't code up 3 native apps in the same time as it took me to write that Twitter client.",1249387031
741026,comment,740643,740851,0,0,greyman,,,">> So why are newspapers so taken aback that we are discussing the stories they write?<p>I think because sites like Gawker use the newspaper work for their own profit.<p>I think the following analogy could be used: Let's imagine that as a professional photographer, you shooted a photo gallery, spending quite a lot of time and money while working on it, and then you published it on your website with ads to attract readers or potential buyer. And then, I as a blogger will take several of your best photos, publish it on my blog with a few lines on comments and a link back to your website. Since I will repeat this with other photographers as well, my blog will be quite attractive so I will earn money with ads, and since my costs are minimal, I will survive a lot easier than you. This seems to happen with the newspaper in this era, with the only exception that republishing photos would be stealing and considered illegal, while republishing words is just ""quoting"".",1249386973

And yet in the USA, I remember one guy I used to know who drove <i>6 hours</i>, two ways, every weekend to see his girlfriend, seemed to think nothing of it. Trust me, that is never going to happen in Australia.<p>Americans just love driving, it seems. They seem to like being in their cars more, almost seems like a second home. I don't know why.<p>Another thing I've noticed about Americans is that they equate their cars with freedom, whereas in many other countries cars are a necessary evil which, far from making you more free, is actually a millstone around your neck. If I drag a car somewhere I have to worry about it, pay for parking, can't drink, etc etc. Give me a train anytime! But Americans seem to see it the exact opposite .. go figure.",1249386796

Either it's too slow, too obtuse, inconsistent user experience from the rest of my OS, etc.  I find even the much flaunted Balsamiq to be inexcusably slow, so slow in fact I still prefer booting up XP in a VM and using Axure (which is better software anyways, but that's another topic for another day).<p>And I really wonder if these guys think they can do what Sun, Microsoft and - to a lesser extent - Adobe, have failed to do: build a cross platform UI toolkit without the aforementioned deficits.  And then the filesystem abstractions and socket abstractions and the list goes on and on.<p>And, really, coding native isn't that hard on either platforms (I don't know much about Linux desktop dev, but I know plenty about Windows and just enough to shoot my mouth off with OSX).  And it's not likely you're building anything of any serious complexity with AIR, Titanium, etc. anyways.  I can almost guarantee you that I could build their example twitter client in Cocoa in roughly the same time and with roughly the same LoC metrics.  I'm not saying that because I have a big penis, I'm just wondering what the true value of these cross platform tools are when they only deliver on a small percentage of what my particular OS has to offer.<p>It almost feels like you are sacrificing usability for a developer's laziness.  For example, I built this in ~10 hours: <a href=""http://videos.massify.com/prototype/shave.demo.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videos.massify.com/prototype/shave.demo.mov</a> - including the custom UI widget to visually create a video clip.<p>Anyways, cool work, nice demo, good luck!",1249385089
