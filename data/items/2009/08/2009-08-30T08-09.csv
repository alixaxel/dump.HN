It's part of a larger push by the BBC to get more kids into engineering, and while it's too early to say for definite, there are signs that it's working.<p>Yes, giving surplus lego to a kid down the street is a good thing, but every now and again it's worth supporting larger projects with greater reach.<p>I don't know if you've read <i>Good Omens,</i> but there's a bit in that where each demon is reporting on what they've done recently.  Several talk about the individuals they've tempted, and the near certainty of a soul each.  Then Crowley says he managed to tie up the mobile phone network in all London for about 30 minutes around lunchtime.  The others can't see what that has to do with anything, and Crowley is at a loss to explain how the frustration and anger will cause tens of thousands of souls to be one step closer to Hell.<p>Sometimes the big picture is hard to see.  Maybe this isn't an example, maybe this is a worthless stunt, maybe this has no long term effect.<p>But then again, maybe it has.",1251621969

In a follow-up story, Dagbladet interviewed a local man, born in Pakistan but resident in Norway for ten years, who argues that ""Grønland is a multicultural environment where there are many people who don't like homosexuals, so they shouldn't hold hands.""  He says such things are OK in west Oslo, where there are few Muslims, ""but here in Grønland they shouldn't do it.

If a cost-benefit analysis showed that investing in technology to increase extraction efficiencies would pay off (given the volatitlty of future prices, etc.), then it should have been done regardless of his urgings. If it didn't, he should never have pushed the idea. In the first case, StatOil would need new managers.

794231,comment,793948,794128,0,0,cturner,,,"On putty: I'm surprised to hear all the bad vibes for putty - what's wrong with its terminal emulation? I adore putty - you can configure it so that it toggles full-screen with alt+enter and can load sessions with windows+r, 'putty -load {session name}'. It's easy to configure different colours for different profiles so it's easy to always have my production consoles in red. I haven't found such a straightforward way of getting that going in a linux desktop setting (other than using putty for linux which is unrefined). The default font isn't all that nice but I think I use terminal size 10 and that looks nice. Putty supports all the stuff you criticise - 'text selection, copy-paste, window resizing, fonts' - what's the downside? I tend to use it in gnu-screen and don't have problems with this.<p>On cmd: Funnily enough that cmd environment has become less powerful over the evolution of Windows. For instance, it used to be possible in win2k era to bundle a complete application as a batch file by having code stored as text and written out when it ran - through a couple of mechanisms using minor features. Those features which were subsequently removed, presumably to stop just this sort of hack. The latest versions of Windows don't have telnet as standard - I'm at a complete loss to know how I'm meant to do connectivity testing with clients who don't have it and don't have permission to install it - the telnet mechanism in Windows was bad enough as it was but now they've made things worse. I've found Windows scripting host to be very poor for doing networking. It's also very crippled.<p>(When I'm in OSX I use iTerm because it's the only way I've found to get a nice full-screen console under the current release of OSX)",1251619282
