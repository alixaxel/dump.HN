If two decimal expansions differ only after the 10th decimal place they are quite close to one another, and if they differ only after the 20th decimal place they are even closer.""<p>""10-adic numbers use a similar non-terminating expansion, but with a different concept of ""closeness"" (which mathematicians call a metric). Whereas two decimal expansions are close to one another if they differ by a large negative power of 10, two 10-adic expansions are close if they differ by a large positive power of 10. Thus 3333 and 4333 are close in the 10-adic metric, and 33333333 and 43333333 are even closer.""",1249190475

In real life, having classes and namespaces with the same names would not be good.  Nobody is going to do it, so why support it?  Can you think of an example where it makes sense to have a class and namespace with the same name?<p><i>And spin it however you'd like, having a namespace conflict with a classname is far more confusing</i><p>Really?

Why not hide them?<p>If papers and essays are all you will be using the site for, you might consider just installing Wordpress and using it to manage everything. It will keep unfinished works hidden until you're ready to publish them, and Wordpress has a datestamp that can be applied to posts to give some simple protection. Of course the datestamp could be altered and there's nothing keeping me from copying everything and putting an earlier date on it.",1249189361
