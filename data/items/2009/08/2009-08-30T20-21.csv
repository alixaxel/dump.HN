After like a month of training to focus fast and hard, I am able to dive into a problem and ignore everything around me within minutes, allowing me to work more efficiently faster, resulting in more getting done in less time.<p>The second thing, closely related to the first (and an item on my list of mental improvements) is improving focus stability, but I know several people with a very, very stable focus. Interrupting them is pretty much like being an IO-Interrupt in a modern processor. It takes a few seconds, but then everything they need right now is swapped out and they can answer simple things or do something easy for a few minutes until the interruption is over and they go back to their focus and continue doing what they were doing.<p>Going a bit further, this is a certain experiment me and several people are performing on a fun base: Is it more efficient to sleep less and thus get more done due to having more time, or is it more efficient to improve ones focus and get done more in the same time, by being better? :)<p>The third thing which works very well for me is dynamic, hierarichal task structuring. Whenever I have a task and I consider if I am very confident if I can finish this particular task in the time I usually have (I don't start working seriously if I have less then half an hour to an hour). If I can, I finish it, if I cannot, I split it into more subtasks (or sometimes decide that this is not possible and somehow mark this task). Doing this, I always have a set of tasks which fit nicely into a short time and tasks which need to be refined further.",1251665519

Today in Western Europe you can find construction workers who were doctors in the Ukraine SSR or Moldova in the 1980s, These people are a huge source of qualified work, but to the best of my knowledge only one country (Portugal) has shown any interest in re-training them as doctors to meet the severe lack of qualified medical personnel. It's interesting to note that in the former Soviet republics, being a doctor did not have the same status (let alone financial compensation) as in the West.<p>I know that Canada has been trying to lure medical doctors from abroad (Eastern Europe and elsewhere) in recent years, but they're after the young graduates, not the old veterans who were disowned by the fall of Communism.<p>Unfortunately, the doctors' lobby in the U.S. is too powerful.

I'm sorry if that is not very constructive, but if I had to choose between having the horror show developer he describes on staff for 10 years taking up a cubicle and a paycheck, or the author on staff for 10 years hiring retards, I would take the horror show developer, as he would do far less damage in the long run.<p>Probably the author just has a positive view of people, and tends to see the best in people, or believes people when they tell him things.  This would be fine for many jobs, but interviewing candidates requires a willingness to ruin someone's week.  It is never the goal, but if a totally unqualified candidate shows up you must be willing to push them to answer questions so that you know that they are unqualified.<p>In any developer interview, you really only need to cover the following things:<p>- The person knows what they should know, based on their resume.  
   - If they say they were a linux administrator for 2 years, they should know all about linux basics and shell basics, they should be able to run a machine remotely without breaking it, they should not be dependent on any gui tools, they should know the common server software people run, and so on.
   - If they were a web developer for 2 years, they should know about the stuff they supposedly doing, if it was backend code they should know about cache control headers and how ajax requests are or are not cached by the big browsers, they should know POST and GET and when to use them, and so on.<p>Anyone who doesn't know the things they 'should' know cannot be considered further, either they are lying on their resume or they are just turds who don't learn anything.<p>- They should be able to demonstrate an ability to code on the spot right in front of you.  Some people claim they cannot code in front of someone else.  Other than someone with an anxiety disorder, if a person can't code in front of another person it is just because they can't code at all.  If their code is incorrect or suboptimal the main thing is that when you go over it they smack themselves on the forhead and seem annoyed that they would make such a mistake, and that they see right away how what they coded is wrong.  If they can't get some challenging thing exactly right isn't such a problem as not 'being with it'.<p>- They should be sane and law abiding, not a drug user (and here I mean drug use which you can notice or that they *brag about), and that they have an ability to conform to some baseline social norms, such as bathing every third day or better, washing their hair and clothes occasionally, use and empty their trashcan, being able to talk to people without freaking out, and not going off on people or constantly insisting on doing things however they want to do it without strong rational each time.<p>This is basically 'smart, gets things done, can do things (vs coercing others to pick up their slack), makes a point to learn about what they are supposed to be doing, and isn't filthy or crazy.'",1251663579

I like your approach of contrasting threads that are over- or under-moderated with threads that maintain an 'appropriate' moderation/reply ratio.  But as noodle wrote above (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=794856"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=794856</a>), it may not be able to distinguish between certain types of commenting.<p>My current instinct is that moderation tells us more about the moderator than it does about the comment being moderated.  I'm just not sure how to to operationalize that insight.",1251663496
