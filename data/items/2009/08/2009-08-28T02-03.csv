It is possible to address this problem by using more aggressive optimization techniques (e.g., whole-program optimization as is used in the MLton Standard ML compiler (MLton, 2007)). Unfortunately, it does not seem likely that such optimization will be available any time soon for OCaml.""<p>Then why OCaml over Standard ML using the MLton implementation?",1251428347

More interesting to me are the number of people (211) making $0<$5,000, reported mostly as unemployed or student. I wonder what the breakdown is among unemployed. How many are discouraged, actively seeking, or even retired?",1251425123

That's not something I'm particularly proud of, and I kind of miss cooking, but its just not economically viable for how little time I have right now.  I get in from work past 10 PM most nights, and would rather spend my hour or two of leisure working on my business rather than shopping, cooking, and cleaning.<p>That said, my bosses are of the opinion that providing food for their engineers is a waste of money, so we have to pay 100 yen a cup for coffee, and the tea is free but the cups were eliminated to save on expenses.
