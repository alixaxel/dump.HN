790560,comment,789870,789870,0,0,ismarc,,,"I saddened that the intent of copyright has been forgotten so much.  As has been pointed out, copyright is a ""contract"" between the people and the creator.  The creator is given a limited time in which they can exclusively profit fro m a work IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE CREATION OF FURTHER WORKS.  Copyright does not exist for the creator.  It exists for the people.  By allowing an avenue for the creator to exclusively profit from a creation for a time, the people can then expect further works from the creator, resulting in a much richer society with great works of art.  The perversion of this system by perpetually extending copyrights stifles the creation of further works due to the maintained state of the original copyright.  I am a musician, and am overjoyed that I have exclusive control over my original works for a time period.  I am a software developer, and I am overjoyed that for a period of time I can be the sole distributor of the works.  I am a consumer, and I am disappointed by the lack of progress in created works due to the maintenance of copyrights.",1251424633

790533,comment,789671,790140,0,0,mbreese,,,"<i>But to say that Rimuhosting broke into their own machine is ridiculous.</i><p>I'm not sure about that.  Since the VM is virtual, you could say that they don't own the VM, they own the machine the VM runs on.  They can control and manipulate the VM via the container for running them (Xen in this case).  But since the VM doesn't physically exist, it could be argued that they don't actually own it, they only rent server capacity to run the VM.<p>Now, I know that you could similarly argue that they were only reading/modifying a disk image that existed on their server, but that isn't as much fun to argue.<p>I think that everyone here can agree that this was a dumb move by Rimuhosting.  And I'm not sure what the contractual arrangement is when you buy a VPS from them... but what they have posted online doesn't make this very clear.<p>The question of ownership is interesting in this era of cloud computing (and not at all clear).  I think it's clear that they own the bare metal.  I think it's also clear that you own your data.  However, where those mix is an interesting question.  At what point is their (uninvited) intervention in a customer's VM warranted outside of their normal management options in the VM container (Xen)?  At what point is the intervention too much?<p>Does the company matter?  I can imagine everyone being up in arms if Amazon tried the same thing with an EC2 instance.<p>Of course this could all be alleviated by using a dedicated server... but even then, if the hosting company owns the hardware, would it be okay for them to pull a hard drive, and add themselves as root?  Never. Ever.  But this is effectively what we're talking about.  The only difference is that with a dedicated server your actions don't affect others.  In a VPS environment, your actions can affect others.  But I think that there are far better methods for controlling this than ""breaking in"" to a customer's VM.",1251423288

790516,comment,789573,789886,0,0,ewanmcteagle,,,"This was not actually Kasparov's complaint.  He thought there was intervention during the game.  He replayed a particular position through a PC and when given an extremely long time to think the PC did not find Deep Blue's move in the same situation.  This along with his feeling that the computer 'just wouldn't' find the move made him believe that someone had essentially told Deep Blue to pick an alternate move from the tree creating a man-machine combination.  This was not substantiated and seems unlikely considering the Kasparov - Deep Blue matches generated so much publicity even with Kasparov winning.  In either case his accusations reflect badly on him since he doesn't have any real evidence.  If he hadn't failed to find a draw in one of the games he probably would not have lost the match.  Also the blunder in the last game could have been avoided but it seems human fallibility and some point would have done him in no matter what.",1251422436
