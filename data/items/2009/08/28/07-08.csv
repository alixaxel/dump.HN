Unfortunately I couldn't afford one (got lots of other expenses that have a priority).<p>iPhone bothers me because you need to have a Mac to develop software for it, and I don't. And iTunes is awful and you're bound to it (I have an iPod Touch, and it's the worst experience I've had with any player ... the codecs are limited, the battery can't be replaced, you can't use it as a storage device, and you can't install third-party apps that aren't on the iTunes store unless you crack it). I've also heard of horror stories related to getting your application approved in iTunes Store.<p>Android seems interesting, but there's only one device from HTC with Android on sale and it's not that great. I'm waiting for other brands to release Android phones (like Samsung). Also their choice of developing their own VM with incompatible byte-codes seems awkward. Surely it's optimized, but it would have been better if they slimmed and extended the current JVM ... that way libraries depending on byte-code manipulation wouldn't have to be rewritten for Dalvik. And in 3 years from now those optimizations won't matter anyway, and we'll be stuck with an incompatible VM.<p>There are a couple of interesting devices with Windows Mobile, but the OS is awkward to use ... you need to have a stylus, and the responsiveness is just bad. Maybe that will change with 6.5 / 7.0.<p>Nokia N900 seems really interesting. It has Flash integrated and Maemo kicks ass when it comes to developer support (GTK+, Qt, multitasking, and you can even install Mono on it). Nokia phones are also solid and I've always been under the impression that it's the only company able to compete with Apple.<p>I'm waiting to see if N900 delivers.",1251446256

Terminology is really not worth fighting over."" There's a difference between the two.<p><i>> There is no conceivable way this company did that much damage to Verizon. In fact, it's unlikely they damaged Verizon at all, especially when we know that most users find pages through Google and that Google would certainly return Verizon's real site first. If anyone was damaged, it was the people who thought they were at Verizon's site but weren't, and the number of those people is probably 3 at best.</i><p>OnlineNIC claims that it made ~$1500 in profits from it. That's just their claim and already far more than 3 visitors. Some of those visitors may have gotten lost and never ended up on Verizon's website. They may have been able to make more from their visitors than OnlineNIC. Their brand is lessened by the experience. They had to find OnlineNIC. They had legal expenses. And there's probably more.<p><i>> Look at the other story they link to about file-sharing.</i><p>I have no interest in comparing anything to file sharing/piracy.

790975,comment,790800,790914,0,0,MattCutts,,,"There is a support channel for appeals, and it sounds like hizook.com submitted an appeal via that channel earlier this week. My guess is that the Google team is already looking into it; I just wanted to let people know that I'd ask the relevant team from my side as well.<p>Given the hundreds of millions of users, tens of millions of webmasters, and many advertisers and publishers that Google interacts with, it would be difficult to have one-on-one conversations with all of them even if everyone at Google did nothing but try to provide that support. Historically, we try to tackle that challenge by reducing the need to talk to a person at all (e.g. our webmaster tools let people diagnose lots of issues without talking to a webmaster expert at Google). We try to pursue scalable communication methods such as forums and keeping an eye on the blogosphere too. I wouldn't claim that we're perfect--I'd be curious to hear more about the AdWords issue that you had--but our first instinct is to look for ways so that people don't need to telephone Google in the first place. I think a lot of companies do that; I can't remember the last time I needed to talk to Amazon or Facebook or Netflix on the phone, for example.<p>But I take your point, and while we do have support channels, I think it's good to keep an eye out for blog posts because that feedback can help us improve so that future people interacting with Google don't get as frustrated.",1251445629
