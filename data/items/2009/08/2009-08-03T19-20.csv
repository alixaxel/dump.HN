739974,comment,739730,739834,0,0,Confusion,,,"I call bullshit. As you already point out, timezones are only relevant if you have to deal with times from multiple timezones. In practice, most applications and most people do <i>not</i> have to deal with that and it's a pure waste of time to add timezone handling. Dealing with dates and times is enough of a headache <i>without</i> taking care of timezones and daylight saving times. I'll be damned if I make my code harder to understand and more complex than strictly necessary to do it's job and the jobs it may reasonably be expected to do in the future.

739971,comment,739735,739735,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Maybe multiple founders are necessary when you're spending lots of cash on a founding team, but I don't think they're necessary when you're bootstrapping.<p>The main argument being made is that founders share pressure. But how much of this pressure is self-inflicted by the need to support a large team or chase aggressive growth strategies that will justify getting funding? So much pressure disappears once you start making money, and if going alone means you've avoided the need to define compensation schemes then you can breathe easily.<p>I can see why larger teams are more attractive to investors. But I don't think this is good advice to younger technically-minded founders who can do the heavy lifting in creating products themselves and often just lack confidence in themselves or their markets to figure out the rest.",1249329406

I have 24 apps on the appstore and the ones that were rejected and later accepted were consistent with the policies aggregated here: <a href=""http://appreview.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appreview.tumblr.com/</a><p>I am upset because apple rejected google voice but so far I haven't seen anything which was rejected and was not on the list in the link.<p>Moreover, apple does have an appeal process. Once the app gets rejected they ask you to make changes, and resubmit the app.<p>There are definitely things that apple can do to improve the process for example, they should definitely get rid of changing the availability date with updates because a lot of developers just keep on posting updates with no real updates to be on the new release list. Check McPhun for example and they are actually able to keep themselves in top 10 for the past 6 months just because they have an update every week. But other than these minor issues which I am pretty sure apple will solve, there are a lot of good things going with it, which people tend to ignore.",1249329349

What I've noticed is that there seem to be a growing number of light-dark-light-dark-light threads. That is, a comment voted down, followed by a response voted up, followed by a riposte voted down, etc.<p>Perhaps it's not my place to say, but I've always been under the impression that comment votes are there to evaluate whether the comment adds to the discussion or not. Votes should not be a measure of whether you agree with the point. When I see long threads of alternating up-down voting in comments, I think one of two things is happening:<p>1. Individuals are voting based on alignment of views.<p>2. People are responding to comments that don't add to the conversation.<p>If there is a long chain of follow-up comments, it seems self-evident that the comment added to the discussion, and probably shouldn't be voted down. If you feel that a comment doesn't add to the discussion, vote it down and move along; no need to reply.<p>So the question: when was the last time you up-voted a comment you disagreed with, but which added to the conversation nonetheless?",1249329281

739964,comment,739741,739907,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"I agree to a point, but I don't think this is much different than developing accessories for someone else's product(s) that need to be approved by the owner of the target product. (Example: Official iPod accessories.) Those companies seem to get on just fine risking some money in R&D while trying to get official approval for an item. You can bet they don't just develop in a vacuum, either, but that's what a lot of the very loudly complaining app store devs seem to be doing.<p>It doesn't have to be such a huge gamble developing for the iPhone. There are Apple representatives that developers can talk to, meet in person at events like WWDC, and even send development builds to. They give feedback and can warn of potential issues with approval, etc. These resources are there, but somewhat scarce. Apple obviously cannot guarantee everyone who pays their $99 access to significant face time with an insider without the dev putting in some effort. As a developer who's aiming to be serious about this, you have to be proactive in elbowing your way into the system - but once you're in, the ""risk"" is greatly reduced. The big iPhone and OSX studios all know this and work behind the scenes within the system to the benefit of both parties (usually).",1249329191

That's a recipe for software worse than your paper notebook, because it tries to wake you up at 2:32 am localtime for your meeting. Oops.<p>But in general... computers and ambiguity don't get along. Dealing with that by writing sloppy programs is a recipe for disaster. Sounds like you're not writing down dates anyhow, just chunks of text that you don't <i>expect</i> a computer to interpret. If you do expect it to interpret your date you better have a specific time in mind or it's not going to do the computer any good anyhow.",1249329145

By that, I mean that things only seem to get done if I personally push for them to happen. I'm not interested in having founding employees, if I'm going to go the route of having co-founders then I'd like everyone to have equal input and as equal contribution as we can manage.<p>However, it doesn't seem to be as easy as just saying ""we're all in this together as founders, let's get on with it"" (I've tried this tact and it just hasn't worked).<p>I guess the distilled question is: how do you find co-founders that are as driven as you are?<p>And as a follow-on, how important is geographic relativity to your co-founders?

739937,comment,738703,739814,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"It's stupid to make categorical statement such as 'The only time eating beef makes sense…' because you're making an absolute out of something with so many nuances. However, you seem to be talking about energy efficiency of the production of the food, while I'm talking about the efficiency of eating it.<p>I don't disagree that cattle may be less efficient to produce than vegetables and grains. However, there's still many reasons to produce cattle, as I pointed out. The by-products and higher energy density of the food for one, and many others, such as variety in your diet. There is a reason people do the things that they do. If we were optimizing everything on one axis, if we were solely concerned with the efficiency of production, we'd live pretty sorry, unfulfilling, colorless and utterly boring lives. We would not take the time to weave patterns into our fabrics, we would not put decorative architectural touches on our houses, and we would not style our hair.<p>I do not want to live in a world where people are made to feel guilty about eating meat because it's less efficient to produce. I do not want to be an efficiency-bot automaton. I really feel like the deafening push to induce guilt for not reducing your carbon footprint is the new puritanism, in a bad way. If we're going to feel bad about flying on airplanes to go on vacation, we all might as well take the idea to its logical conclusion and deny ourselves every modern convenience of the last 500 years: return to subsistence farming in self-built huts with no electricity. Short of doing that, no token self-denial is going to realistically make an impact.<p><i>FYI: people in the rest of the world do eat the way in you describe. i.e., a vegetable-and-grain based diet with a little bit of meat now and again.</i><p>The simple fact of the matter is that most of the rest of the world is poor, and we are rich. They eat that way because they have no choice, not because there's something inherently better about it. Not to say, though, that there isn't something better about it — like I pointed out, I eat mostly vegetables and beans. But simply the fact that everyone does it doesn't make it good a good idea in and of itself.<p><i>Btw, 1 lb of beef takes 7 lb of corn to produce (cows in America are primarily fed corn). Are you seriously claiming that eating the cow instead of the corn is more efficient?</i><p>I made no such claim at all in my post. I simply pointed out that the disparity is not so great as people like to claim. However, now that you've brought it up, I would indeed argue that eating beef instead of corn is more efficient. It all depends on what you define as 'efficient'.<p>Do you know how long it takes to shovel a dinner plate full of vegetables down your throat four times a day? Like, two hours a day. Think about the fact that beef has <i>twenty times</i> the calories of tomatoes — you have to eat twenty times the number of tomatoes to get the same number of calories. That is a lot! A significant chunk of your day becomes devoted to eating. That's not efficient. That's time I could be spending doing other more important and useful things — like writing software to automate other mindless tasks, making us <i>even more</i> efficient. Of course, I eat that way for other reasons, but I would never argue that it's efficient.<p>Meat is kind of like the food equivalent of fossil fuels. Oil is the super-concentrated end product of millions of years of sunlight shining down on plants and algae. We can then burn that concentrated end product to power a loom to weave fabric really fast, rather than doing it slow by hand. Similarly, meat is the end product of months of a cow sitting in a field chewing grass and in a barn eating corn. We don't need to sit around eating massive amounts of vegetables because the cow already did that for us.<p>Simply put, the 7 pounds of corn may not be efficient when you look at it with tunnel vision from the perspective of a single variable (land use), but it very certainly may be efficient when you look at it from others. So don't pretend it's so simple.<p>I'm not arguing against vegetarianism or eating vegetables, I'm simply saying there are also valid reasons to produce meat. I like everything in moderation.",1249328106

739911,comment,738958,739818,0,0,stcredzero,,,"We'd only have to write parsers for the hypertext, not N different parsers for the various languages.<p>Think about what happens.  Your IDE parses your source code so that it can do things like highlighting, identifying senders, code folding, etc.  It does this so that you as a programmer can use those tools to more easily parse it in your head to understand it.  Eventually, your code is interpreted or compiled, which involves another parsing.<p>Why not just have a direct representation of the program and its interrelationships?  Languages where the compiler/interpreter make the AST available go a part of the way there.  But too many of the interrelationships are implicit, requiring a program to do some sort of searching/indexing/parsing to make available.  Why not just represent those directly, and have source code be a representation?<p>If we could make such a representation, we might even be able to transcend the tyranny of particular languages.  (Multi language VMs are somehow related here.)",1249327211

Dijkstra would distribute photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues; as many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copy, the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. More than 1300 EWDs have since been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.<p>[ from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#EWDs_and_writing_by_hand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra#EWDs_and_wri...</a> ]",1249327002
