Here in San Francisco, for example, the main newspaper (the moderate-liberal <i>Chronicle</i>) is awash in conservative reader commentary, but this vocal contingent's influence on election results seems to be marginal. So perhaps all the above tells us is that (for example) drivers are more likely to read newspapers as well as owning valuable vehicles, which cyclists are more likely to chat on blogs, in keeping with their lower economic outlay.<p>I know I'm being pedantic here.
