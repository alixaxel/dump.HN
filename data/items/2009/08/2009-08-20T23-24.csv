A local variable getting corrupted to strange values, but there was no memory corruption visible at all, just the register was incorrect, when it was only ever assigned to once.<p>No matter what test cases I tried to cut the code down into, it didn't crash. Inspecting the disassembly everything seemed fine.<p>Finally, I noticed something strange. The suspect variable was in r19, which thanks to the allocation strategy was very unusual, it was most often unused. That gave me enough of a clue to create a cut-down test case that included all the function arguments and local variables without the code, to make sure I got the same register allocation.<p>I was able to write a single main.c that set the variable once and sat in an infinite loop waiting until it changed. Bingo! _Something_ crept in and changed that value, and it sure wasn't our code. There wasn't much of an OS on the Gamecube, but there must have been some interrupt that wasn't cleaning up its changes to r19 like it should.<p>I sent off the minimal code to a Nintendo developer support engineer, and monkeyed with our code to avoid having so many local variables in that one function, which fixed our problem. The Nintendo engineer fessed up that it must be their issue, but then the report vanished into the Nintendo bunker, never to be seen again...<p>Despite being a nightmare I'm glad I escaped, there were some sheer moments of coding joy in the game industry.",1250812618

Multics eventually reached a useful state and was in use in various places (by such customers as the US DoD) until around 2000, when the last Multics system was taken offline. However, Multics ran on an extremely small set of expensive Honeywell computers, which is why it did not reach great prominence.<p>Plan 9 lacks adoption for an entirely different reason. It is very portable, and in the earlier days (~1995) ran on Suns, SGIs, Alphas, some 68k machines, and the PC. As non-PC hardware has become less widely-used, the other ports were not kept updated. However, compilers exist for the MIPS, 68k, ARM, AMD64, Alpha, x86, SPARC, and PowerPC architectures, and it is not particularly difficult to port to a new machine. Unfortunately, Plan 9 was only available via closed license until 2000. Had it been given freely from the earliest days, it very likely could have taken what is now Linux's place as the primary free OS.<p>The reason UNIX is so widespread is because it was the right solution at the right time. It was freely available to universities and, like Plan 9, pretty easy to port. The interface was simple yet powerful, and the introduction of pipes meant you could write stupid programs, then chain them together for powerful functionality. It really served to end the days of ""One OS per Computer"" and the kind of monolithic programs one found on such systems as VMS, where every program was an island.<p>The original Unix was put together in a thoughtful fashion with an eye to both hardware efficiency and powerful features. However, it was unfortunately written before networks and graphical interfaces became widespread--those portions were ""hacked on"" later, giving us network sockets and X, two systems often considered the worst parts of Unix.",1250811007

Erlang uses pattern matching rather than assignment, so the statements in the if are Guards.<p>From Pragmatic Programming in Erlang:<p>At least one of the guards in the if expression must evaluate to true; otherwise, an exception will be raised.<p>Often the ﬁnal guard in an if expression is the atom true, which guarantees that the last for m in the expression will be evaluated if all other guards have failed.",1250809625

These together probably make up about 40%-50% of the Hacker News audience.  The other pieces of the whole are probably perfectly normal people who just like a good mix of news and code.<p>The neckbeards hate stuff like Mixergy or TC because they're not into the whole startup scene.  The CEO's hate things like _why because they don't understand why he would spend more than 10 minutes a day doing something that doesn't make money (these guys poop while they're promoting synergy).  As a result, when something like this happens and gets a lot of stories/attention, the neckbeards take the chance to submit that super 1337 Haskell tutorial they found 2 weeks ago which is subsequently voted up by the CEO's who just want this hobo, non-TechCrunched trash off the front page.<p>Then again, I have no data on this.
