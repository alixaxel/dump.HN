I did too.  When you ran into some limitations you didn't like, you jailbroke it and loaded some things Apple and/or AT&T didn't want you to load.<p>If you don't like this whole paradigm, why get an iPhone?  Why not get an Android or something else?  For that matter, why does Google bother releasing an iPhone app;  why not build the Android into a handset that is tightly coupled/integrated with Google Voice?  Seems like that would be a fine marketing coup for the former.<p>I'm just not sure what there is to whine about here.  Of <i>course</i> enhanced voice application services aren't going to be allowed on the phone because they are perceived as encroaching on possible or actual carrier revenue streams.  Of <i>course</i> you can't put applications on it that make a ""dumb pipe"" of the carrier's data network in order to deliver voice.  If you don't like this set of circumstances, pursue a solution by competitive means, not legislating it;  vote with your feet and quit buying iPhones until the exclusive distribution contract with AT&T expires, and thusly encourage Apple to diversify its retail blend to include other network operators with more liberal approaches.<p>Really - what, do you expect that a de facto contractually sanctioned monopoly (AT&T) is going to act in the spirit of the public welfare or consumer choice when it perceives a conflict of interest?  Seriously?<p>Neither the courts nor the FCC should be looking at this.  Consumers just need to take their wallet elsewhere.<p>EDIT: I very much concur with the poster above who speculated that AT&T's 3G network doesn't have the bandwidth to handle a large amount of relatively constant (at a certain baseline) voice traffic generated by something as popular as GV.  Anybody who deals with mobile issues routinely can tell you that AT&T's 3G network is positively the worst in the land, and oversubscription in many MSAs is unbearably high.

But in economic parlance, if (let's say) a power company came to be a dominant monopoly in a given area without government support, that would be a natural monopoly.  If the government then stepped in to regulate the power company as a utility and simultaneously excluded competitors by government force, the power company becomes a coercive monopoly.  Is it still a natural monopoly?  It's hard to say, because conditions change, but the government grant of exclusivity remains constant.  Maybe a new technological innovation would have let a competitor emerge, breaking the natural monopoly.

The defense budget for the US for FY2009 was $515.4 BILLION (from Wikipedia) compared to NASA's FY2010 REQUEST for $18.686 BILLION (Official Press Release).  To add a little more perspective, you can take just a couple of projects that the DoD works on and make it == NASA's ENTIRE budget!<p><i>Missile Defense - $8.8 Bil.</i><p><i>F-22 Raptor - $4.6 Bil.</i><p><i>V-22 Osprey - $2.6 Bil.</i><p><i>DDG 1000 Destroyer - $3.5 Bil.</i><p>This comes out to $19.5 BILLION!

I feel this way not because I think it would be cool, or even that me might learn some new things (we would), but mainly because it would be a stepping stone to Mars.  We could use the Moon to build and launch our manned ships to Mars and other planets and their moons.  We could also more safely store nuclear reactors and materials on the moon, allowing us to build advanced nuclear engines just like the 'mad scientists' dreamed up back in the olden days.
