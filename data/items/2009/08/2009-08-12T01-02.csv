757074,comment,756846,756868,0,0,locopati,,,"That's all well and good. There are a lot of internal corporate applications that were developed on IE6. Knowing that IE6 required workarounds that would break in IE7/IE8/FF3/etc, it would be irresponsible of Microsoft to force upgrades to IE7 or IE8. Meanwhile, corporations are not likely to revisit working apps and upgrade them to IE7 or IE8 - there are better things to do with people's time. So, the sad truth is that IE6 is going to live on as a legacy application, but not one that necessarily must be supported by present and future applications. There are plenty of alternative browsers that can play alongside IE6 in corporate environments and allow web development to progress.<p>This reply is a bit blunt, but if you're outside a big corporation, it's easy to say 'bad developers, get with the program', which is an overly simple answer that ignores the reality of most big businesses. They want to get things done, and that doesn't always mean doing things 'correctly'.",1250042287

Need a data structure?  Use an associative array, it is the Gawk Way.  Need code reuse?  Cheaper to delete and start over.  He was brilliant, I learned a lot from him, and I would not let him near my code if my life depended on it.<p>Lisp has always struck me as a ""nutty professor"" sort of language.  I hear it is wonderful and pure and that if you truly grok it you see the Hand of God Himself in its awesome majesty staring out from within your code.  But while Lisp seems to be long on awe, it seems to be short on software I'd actually want to use.<p>No one has ever claimed to have had a religious experience from reading PHP code (and if they did, I would suggest dousing them with holy water from a safe distance).  But PHP has Wordpress.  ""Lisp can do a blogging platform too!  Better!  Stronger!  Faster!  We can do it, we have the technology!""  Yes, Lisp can... but Lisp doesn't.  (And if it did, I have a disturbing premonition that the steps to build a piece of blogging software would start with ""#1: You need a webserver.  None of the existing ones are exactly right, but that is no problem, since making a web server is easy in Lisp.  First we define a few simple macros..."")<p>Now, if I were a Lisp developer POed at ignorant savages on the Internet suggesting my language was perhaps a bit ivory-towery, I'd probably spend my time writing software which was so good they'd be unable to ignore me.",1250041563

The principle (stated more precisely) is, ""if you have an accurate mathematical model, you can do engineering.""<p>In the case of cancer, we don't have an accurate model. All we managed to do is use a large statistical sample to average out over the non-radiation variables.<p>In the case of climate modeling, we have a sample size of 1. All our conclusions come from a family of models which are claimed to be very accurate.

I don't think MRI images of modern day teens is really enough to base a conclusion on. It may be true that teens today show less development but the reason for that is not a foregone conclusion.<p>I think what the author is trying to say in his article is that teens are capable of much more than they are allowed to do. And that very fact may be what causes the results in the research you linked above.",1250039338

Doctors blamed my condition on my genes.  I figured there had to be more to it than that.<p>How: I have a small website that attempts to answer that question:  <a href=""http://www.healthgazelle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthgazelle.com</a><p>To sum up my point of view:  White people are more vulnerable to sunburn than darker-skinned people but ""pale skin disorder"" does not doom you to be chronically sunburned to the point of peeling and does not doom you to die at an early age of skin cancer.  Similarly, cystic fibrosis makes one more vulnerable to infection, but one does not have to accept being sick all the time as their only fate. It takes both pale skin and sunlight to cause sunburn.  It takes both CF and germs to make one deathly ill.  The environmental and lifestyle part is what we can control.  So far, so good.",1250039143

But after Thorp demonstrated it was beatable there was a surge in demand for blackjack. Turns out, nearly all those new blackjack players weren't really very good at counting and lost money hand over fist. Thorp's work (among others) led to increased casino profits and lent an air of legitimacy to gambling; it wasn't just luck anymore, if you ""worked"" at it you could profit.
