(Except that moving to the right-most non-merging lane will help you avoid waves and move faster.)  My prioritized rules of the road are:<p><pre><code>  1) go whatever speed you like\n  2) empty lane to your right? move right\n  3) no car in front of you and a car behind you? move right as soon as possible\n  4) slower car in front? move left if you can\n</code></pre>\nThese simple rules cover most situations in a way that benefits everyone involved.

I'm just getting back into music as my next ""career"" move (touring musician/technomad starting 2010 :). This year has been spent getting the small stuff in place and slowly building a listener-base online and around town. Blogging, twittering, posting songs for feedback, playing open mic nights, joining song circles, networking. Mostly the type of stuff any real business person has to do to make their business succeed, and for artists it's no different.<p>I've been self-employed for 8 years now (time flies!), and I know over-night successes are fiction. It's a constant struggle to maintain or improve where you're at. Things are made to appear over-night when they took years getting to the point where the forward motion reached that level. I'm hoping to take the same approach to slowly building a music career, and I don't expect it to take just a few years. It will take as long as it takes, doing what it takes, but it's the only approach that works. It's great to hear of others doing the same thing too, right on! That's the main reason why I love HN as a community.<p>One story that stuck with me, cheesy as it was, was from a speaker I saw back in high school. He was talking about how you see a basketball star, or the math wiz in class, or your favourite band, and how it's easy to say ""wow, that's magic!"" as if they were just born with the natural aptitude and were instantly where they are today. He said that what's magic is what you don't see, Michael Jordan practicing every day for hours, the band rehearsing and playing small gigs for 10 years, the math wiz actually <i>doing</i> his homework. I always took that to mean we make our own magic happen when people aren't looking :)",1251229986

The compound effect of this is tha we are all running like hamsters on wheels for very little money.<p>Between 16 and 21, I made 5 to 10 HTML-only websites for between $2,000 and $5,000.

He was actively opining (which spell check assures me is a word) that we shouldn't have a public health care system.<p>Why should advertisers not advertise on Glen Beck's show?  For those who don't know, Beck opined on his show that President Obama has ""a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture. . . I'm not saying he doesn't like white people. I'm saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a racist.""  That's an opinion as well.<p>Beck's opinion is, to most, more inflammatory than Mackey's, but that can make Mackey's all the more dangerous (if you're someone who would like to see public healthcare).  The fact is that Mackey seems to be a liberal of sorts (in fact, Whole Foods offers health insurance to their employees) and an at least somewhat successful business person (I don't actually know enough about Whole Foods, but they don't seem to be going bankrupt).<p>So, his words are quite a threat to the agenda of those who would like to see a public health plan.  And his words have that much more power because they're coming from someone who seems to have liberal leanings and is running a business that <i>does</i> provide health care to their employees.  If someone is advocating for the opposite of what you would like, should you not take that into consideration?  We vote with our feet every day.  He took action against public health care in trying to change people's opinions through his piece.  I know many who stopped buying CDs because of the RIAA's positions.<p>I will grant that his piece was a lot more thoughtful and measured than many have passed on, but this is an issue that is very contentious and many people feel (I'm not making any judgement here) that his words contribute to a negative impact on the possibility of a public health plan and that the lack of such a plan will have a negative impact on their life.

785584,comment,785259,785498,0,0,apotheon,,,"That's not ""zen"" -- it's artificial regularity.  Zen would be driving at what feels like a natural speed, only adjusting that when circumstances dictate, and ""letting go"" of your attachment to forward progress when something stands in your way.  Instead, you're driving at an artificially limited speed to try to regularize your driving experience.  You're tricking yourself into feeling less frustrated by consciously eliminating frustration triggers from the driving experience; a zen approach would involve simply choosing to feel less frustrated by ""realizing"" that the frustration triggers really don't matter.<p>> Even though you'd assume leaving a huge gap in front is an invitation for other motorists to cut ahead, they rarely do - especially in congestion.<p>That's heavily dependent on time and place.  I've lived in many different regions, and done a lot of driving in those areas.  I've noticed that the tendency to fill in gaps is heavily dependent on local driving culture and the specific demographics on the road at a particular time of day.<p>> I absolutely swear by this driving method. It's easier on the car, easier on the heart, and even serves to create a bubble of calm around you in an otherwise turbulent flow of traffic.<p>That may, to some extent, be an illusion.  Some people are infuriated by other drivers they perceive as holding them up -- which often includes people who are ""wasting"" lane space by letting a gap of thirty car lengths lie unused in front of them.  Personally, I only get annoyed with such people when they try to keep other people from filling that gap, because as far as I'm concerned a steady gap (given a steady general traffic speed) creates irregularities in grouping through which ambient traffic can accelerate itself, but people who maintain a huge gap then rush to block out people who want to move into it are increasing the danger of driving and doing nothing to help improve the flow of traffic.",1251229301

As a result, I kept getting confused by features I did not much care for while setting up comments for my blog.<p>I just logged back in and am glad to see it is a significantly cleaner interface and that they have split the two products. Having made many sites that went from single page tools to full-blown apps, I can see how the interface slowly gets more and more crowded and confusing as we add more features. Every once in a while, developers/designers must take a step back, analyze what it is that we're trying to do, and make changes to not only simplify the product but also the message.

Now I follow what I affectionately call the ""zen of driving"", to wit: leave a huge gap in front of me, drive at a constant speed where possible [1], avoid using the brakes except in case of emergency, and so on.<p>On long driving trips through mixed traffic, I have made several observations, some obvious and some surprising:<p>* Driving in congestion is no longer stressful. It just isn't. (Hence the ""zen"".)<p>* Dramatically improved fuel economy.<p>* It's possible to drive through even wildly erratic traffic (swinging from 100 km/h to 20 km/h) without ever touching the brakes. It becomes a kind of game. Manual transmission helps.<p>* Some other drivers seem to figure out what I'm doing, and they fall into place behind me at a reasonable distance. I've had people follow me for hundreds of kilometres this way.<p>* Even though you'd assume leaving a huge gap in front is an invitation for other motorists to cut ahead, they rarely do - especially in congestion. If they do, I just let them race up to the front of the gap and then fall back by a single car length to restore the same gap.<p>I absolutely swear by this driving method. It's easier on the car, easier on the heart, and even serves to create a bubble of calm around you in an otherwise turbulent flow of traffic.<p>------<p>[1] Edit to qualify ""drive at a constant speed"". As I noted later, my speed ranges dramatically based on the congestion level - what remains more or less constant is the safe opening in front of me.

I think it is a technique that is manipulative and not in a good way. Let me use the litmus test of parenting techniques: would you let someone else use that technique on your child? I would be uncomfortable if someone guilted my child into doing something against her better instincts.<p>I can't help noting that guilt is used here to set up a negative association with a past misdeed. It is possible to do that with a variety of other unpleasant-to-the-child techniques, such as time outs, confiscating privileges etc.<p>Also, their longtitudinal survey went up to about 5 years of age. This is a time where kids still haven't completely internalised the reasons for good behaviour (eg. social harmony) hence the need for more Pavlovian techniques. It's not clear to me that this scales to, for example, teenagers.<p>Finally, there could be some giant selection effect here: kids who feel guilt are probably more socially sensitive than other kids, and so are more likely to behave in a way that does not cause waves.<p>Difficult to say without reference to the primary material.
