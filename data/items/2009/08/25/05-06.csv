It's basically impossible to find a study of any real-world sociological study whose methodology is beyond dispute..</i><p>Well yes.  And in general, the flaws are pretty gaping flaws.  If you have studies with gaping methodological flaws, then you must completely disregard them.  They are not evidence.<p>The study you cite about the CPC program, is majorly flawed.  In general, the most astute parents figure out how to find their way into these types of programs.  When you look at a more broad based program - like Head Start - the evidence effectiveness does not seem to be exist or be enough to stand out from the noise ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Start#Reports_and_statements_critical_of_Head_Start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Start#Reports_and_statemen...</a> )<p><i>But I think you will have trouble proposing that someone is making an unsupported claim when they say that education increases wealth and social mobility.</i><p>I dispute it.  If you want to play the social science game, check out this article: <a href=""http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/does-education-really-make-you-smarter-349"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/does-education-really-...</a><p>Despite dramatically increasing the amount we spend on education, and the time spent in school, basic measures of vocabulary and math have been flat over the last century.<p>But I don't like playing the social science game.<p>The real reason I don't believe schooling increases national wealth is because I got a topflight education.  But after a private high school and an ivy league college, neither I nor virtually any of my friends learned much in the way of wealth-creating skills.  I earn a much higher than average income, but its all because of self-taught skills.<p>After spending some time in the workforce, I've noticed the vast majority of people learn their wealth producing skills on the job.  This is the norm now, it was the norm fifty years ago, and it was the norm one hundred fifty years ago.  It applies to machinists and it applies to software engineers.  The only difference is that we are so rich now, we can afford to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on formal schooling.<p>If people who graduate college earn more, it must because of some other affect ( selection effects, zero-sum credentialing laws, or because of social networks).  I know this must be the case, because I knows what happens in schools, and I know that outside of engineering (which is a tiny minority of all majors) college does not teach wealth producing skills.",1251179451
