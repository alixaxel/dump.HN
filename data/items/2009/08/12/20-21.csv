The onus is on the OP to justify their stats, not on the person calling BS on the misuse of statistics.<p>Given that the original article is missing the critical numbers and presenting the rest in the most self-serving manner possible, the only data anyone has to go by is their own experience with conversion rates. We don't even know what ""conversion"" means for this website because they don't define it, but that justifies making reasonable assumptions (e.g. users who land on page A end up on page B, for a website in some industry, involving some side-effects to get from A to B that are left undefined by the OP). In my experience, the behavior of users on a web site is quite fickle and dependent on the surrounding advertising campaigns, as well as the weather, the time of day, and the timing of holidays. And maybe a billion other confounding factors. So, is the 5% improvement seen here significant? We don't know, there's no evidence to assume it is, and that's precisely my point.",1250110730

I like to ask people how they visualize the arrangement of months in a year, because there doesn't appear to be any single standard way to do so.<p>When I was in kindergarten, the teacher would lead the class to name off the months by pointing to a year calendar arranged on the wall in a horseshoe shape, starting with January in the bottom left, arcing through the summer months at the top and returing to December in the bottom right. Having been exposed to this particular arrangement so often at such an impressionable age, December and January are in my mind forever separated by gap, and it never fails to generate the feeling that those two months are more distant than any other adjacent months, and I'm sure it has an effect on my planning during that time.<p>It makes me wonder how it might feel to have learned the months arranged in a circle, on a line, or in a grid. Or to have learned European-style Monday-Sunday weeks, lunar months, or something exotic like months of 7 or 8 4-day weeks, or 10 144-minute hours per day. And of course the hacker in me wants to figure out what the optimal arrangement.",1250110633

The counterargument is that we do not have such perfect agents creating our system. The counter-counter argument is to observe that it often works even so.<p>(As you can probably guess from the shortness of that paragraph, I'm not actually making those arguments right now, just setting up some context.)<p>Having truly pervasive electronic agents in the market working on people's behalf changes that argument chain. Maybe <i>I</i> can't study everything about, say, a given brand of hard drives, but my agent can learn a lot more on my behalf. How does this change the way the market works?<p>Honestly, I have no idea, I'd need way more time to think about this than a single HN post can be given. I just thought I'd toss this out there, because I think it's a very thought-provoking question, to the point that I'd say that if you think you can figure it out in 5 or 10 seconds I feel pretty confident you're probably off base. (For one thing, there are clearly second-order effects that will emerge if this ever becomes pervasive.)<p>You can look to the stock market as an exemplar, but there are a lot of potentially-relevant differences between the stock market and an economy full of pervasive use of agents. Price aggregators are another exemplar, but there are also potentially-relevant differences there.

My team is great, my manager is great, the product is alright, and I am paid alright considering that it's a conservative bank (and region).  I just wish I were doing more hacking and less meetings/requirements proofreading/blah blah blah.<p>So I got a job offer from a local startup that has a product out there and some paying customers (although they aren't breaking even yet).  This startup has made me an offer for only a little more then I am currently making, and the location change will add about 30 or 40 minutes to my daily commute.<p>On the plus side, I would be the second developer to join the team, so I'm getting in pretty early, and they have plans for a strong bonus program, once they break even (which probably won't be this year).  I would have a lot of freedom, and a lot of input into the direction of the product and the development process.<p>My brother works for another smaller company who's founder is also one of the partners on this startup, and he has strongly suggested that I take the job.  From what he's seen at his company (with a common founder) has been great and he really enjoys the culture and effectiveness of the organization.  I am really excited about the opportunity but because it's not a very large salary jump (money being one of the main factors in my job search) I am having a difficult time convincing myself and my wife that this is a good move for us.  We lose the known security and face the unknown.<p>I feel like I can get in there and help them get more of their product up to speed and get things really rocking that I could really see a possibility for some big returns, both monetarily and in my career, but it's scary to leave the security of a bank for a startup.<p>I've put together a list of pros and cons, but can you guys give me any additional insight, for or against?<p>Pros:\nQuarterly Bonuses (possible)\nWork from home more\nStartup culture and opportunities\nGround floor, one of the first employees\nLaunching board for my own ideas<p>Cons\nOnly a little more money then I am making now\nSmall/unstable\nWhat if they don't pan out?\n30 to 40 more minutes to the daily commute<p>Thoughts?

Allow free signup, and send me a $3 SMS when an alarm goes off, avoiding any need for credit card billing.<p>Another option would be to have a purely prepaid plan, where your account gets debited based on alarms/users per-period, and per-incident. I'm definitely going to use this service while it's free, but I don't think I'd pay $120/year for it unless I had a web startup.",1250107257

They do not. Nor does Section 508 require it. Screen readers generally work just fine with table-based tag soup. The dc.gov site claims to be Bobby 508 compliant and I'm not in a position to dispute that.)",1250107250

Plenty of bare-metal systems programming projects have been executed on both.<p>I'm a Ruby advocate, but if ""being like everyone else in industry"" is one of your decision axes, Python is a more conventional choice for low-level programming (at least, outside of security).<p>The ""industry standard language"" choice you're alluding to is C, which is a terrible choice for a primary language in 2009.",1250107250

I'm saying they're going to disrupt cost/benefit relations increasingly over the next few years. That's a much more defensible statement.<p>Second, part of the mental block that people are having with understanding this is that the promises that were made in the 1950s were <i>premature</i>, not <i>wrong</i>. Look at actual research coming out of robotics right now, not from the 1950s. It's still early, but there's been a qualitative change in the past couple of years; things are moving again. We got used to ""nothing happening"" so much so that it became just part of the mental background of our lives, but that doesn't make that rational.<p>There's nothing stopping people from being part of the delivery network, either. The most likely outcome is that it simply becomes an outgrowth of today's Fedex and UPS, starting in the cities and spreading out as the economics make sense. It's not even as much of a discontinuity as you might think, as from what I've seen of photos of the inside of the hubs, the hubs are already building-sized robots with small amounts of human help. It's just an expansion of the already-robotic-core of the delivery system, not an introduction of a brand new concept.",1250107233
