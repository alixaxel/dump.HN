757725,comment,756570,756734,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"As far as I can tell - having moved to Austria and acquired a tax specialist - this is backwards.<p>The US gets first dibs. At least they do in my situation. Then the full amount I pay to the US in tax (100%) is removed from the taxes I owe in Austria.<p>Simple example: Austria says I owe 20,000 euros. US says I owe $15,000. I pay the US $15,000. My tax burden in Austria is now approximately 20,000 - 10,000 euros (ballpark currency exchange) = 10,000. (This is assuming you crest theearned income waiver for expats, which is about $85,000 USD now.)<p>Basically, though, you have to hire a tax specialist. There's no way to manage it simply. And tax specialists with international experience are hard to find, but if you're coming from the US you'll have an easier time than if you're coming from a smaller country. Your best bet would be to contact one of the larger international firms, e.g. Deloit. I had to search for 9 mos to find one, myself.<p>(As an aside, I'm outraged that I have to pay US taxes at all.)",1250074611

You know,  a judge and prosecutor don't get involved because of suspicion that you have encrypted data that might be useful for solving a crime,  there are usually a long string of events and circumstances that brings you to that point.  The actual encryption keys are just a formality by that point.<p>Whether or not you can plausibly deny the existence of encrypted data in a convincing manner probably isn't going to be that important.

It's just a sanity check on the mechanic, like calling a friend or another shop.<p>I had a great mechanic for a while who I could trust, but at some point he retired and sold his shop to someone new.  I ended up with a problem that seemed to be getting into the thousands of dollars range.  Is he right?  Is he lying/taking me for a ride?  Is he being lazy?  I'm a pretty technical guy, but I don't know everything about the ins and outs of auto mechanics.<p>I told him to wait, and after a few calls to car-friends and a dealership I could call him back and have him take me through the problem again.  My goal wasn't to 'trap' him, but now that I knew enough I could see what he looked at, what he thought the problem/options were, etc.<p>I ended up taking the car to a different mechanic, not because the first was lying to me, but because it was clear that he didn't have enough knowledge about my type of car.  It ended up being a cheap part and a quirk with the car's computer.<p>I later told the other mechanic (in a friendly manner) and he was genuinely surprised, and offered me a discount in the future if I ever needed anything else.<p>A customer waiving their iPhone around is probably a pretty good way to show that they don't know anything about car repair and are bad at negotiating.

For those that are interested these are the main techniques I use:<p>First I go to slicehost and create a machine, they send me a email when it's done (about 5 mins or so).<p>I have one install script and a syncing script, The install scripts one calls the sync script. After the machine is live I just use the sync one to update it. $hostname is the name or IP address of the new machine.<p>First I copy SSH authorization over, so I can login without a password (assumes you have created SSH keys already - which is one time event):<p>ssh root@$hostname ""mkdir /root/.ssh; echo \"`cat /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pub`\" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys2""<p>Then run various commands on the new machine. I put these in a file ""commands.fragment"".\nwhich contains things like<p><pre><code>  mkdir /var/www\n\n  groupadd -g600 web\n\n  chgrp web /var/www\n\n  yum -y install iptables ntp\n</code></pre>\nand so on, then run it:<p><pre><code>  cat commands.fragment | ssh root@$hostname\n</code></pre>\nThe I run the syncing script (which I'll rerun over the life of the machine)\nThen I sync my code across:<p><pre><code>  rsync -avz -e ssh /var/www/ root@$hostname:/var/www/\n</code></pre>\nand programs I've complied:<p><pre><code>  rsync -avz -e ssh /usr/local/ root@$hostname:/usr/local/</code></pre>\nand so on.<p>Now we have everything in place we can start the services for whatever the box does, for example to start a web server:<p><pre><code>  ssh root@$hostname ""/sbin/chkconfig --add lighttpd; /etc/init.d/lighttpd start""\n</code></pre>\nAnd that's it.<p>My script took me a few hours to write and I did so that I can scale up (and down) in a hurry by adding a machine rather than taking the existing machines (there are 2) down whilst slicehost resize it - which is not something I wanted do while there is a lot of traffic coming in. We don't really need multiple machines, but buying one big slice is expensive to have running the whole time.<p>Hope that helps.",1250071874
