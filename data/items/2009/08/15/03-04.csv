The OP didn't ask if you think this is a good conversation topic for Hacker News.<p>The ""not Hacker News"" meme is the most uninteresting thing here and it ruins many otherwise good threads which is why it is discouraged in the guidelines. This story isn't even on the front page. All you needed to do was flag it and move along.<p>I am not going to argue with you because this argument has already been beat into the ground thoroughly in the cognitive enhancement threads. Suffice to say, the minority of people that agree with you consistently lose the argument. Discussion of drugs on Hacker News is not inherently off-topic.

What you want to maximize is, as it were, the area under the curve on the time-value graph.
