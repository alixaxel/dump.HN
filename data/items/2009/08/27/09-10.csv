A manual; specification + examples, etc. Lisp texts have a specific flavor and you wont mistake them for others. It doesn't have to be written by Guy Steele or Kent Pitman for it to be useful, by the way :-P It's not as codified as the Unix manpage format.<p>In a nutshell, Lisp manuals usually go this way; a short introduction to the Reader syntax; an overview of the special forms; high-level description of the type system; in depth discussion about the evaluation model and all top-level forms, then In depth discussion about the language <i>specified</i> parts of the type system over several chapters.<p>Each identifier is clearly labeled by its type and evaluation method, e.g. <i>special variable</i>, <i>generic function</i>, <i>condition</i>, etc. Its uses and abuses. Its side-effects, if any. Its exceptional situations, what conditions it might raise, if any. Examples. And finally links to other related symbols.<p>Nothing is said about regular expressions, database access, web API or GUI toolkit. A Lisp documentation is sufficient for implementing the language, as well as daily use. That's really the main difference I can think of. The C book by Harbison and Steele <i>C: A Reference Manual</i> is the closest thing I have seen to a Lisp-style manual for a non-Lisp programming language, and it's no coincidence ;-)<p>Regards.",1251365608

You will learn more than you ever wanted to know.<p>One way to do this is to find someone with an info product (software, etc) you wouldn't have moral qualms selling, signing up as their affiliate, writing yourself a landing page, and then driving traffic to it in AdWords.  You're not doing it to make money: you're just playing a more educational, more expensive version of WoW.

I know some advertisers who are freaking overjoyed that I pay them $1 CPMs.  (They sell me ""remnant inventory"", i.e., it is traffic that we expect to have such low performance if it were meat it would be the parts of the cow we grind up to feed other cows with.)

I strongly suspect that most programs that use a lot of memory (which are the ones that matter) do so because they have big wodges of non-pointer data (long strings, images, matrices, ...) and therefore get a smaller-than-average size increase, but I have no actual evidence for this.<p>Anyway, you'd only get a 2x increase if every single byte of memory used by your program were either a pointer or an integer that changed from 32 to 64 bits on switching to 64-bit code (e.g., a <i>long</i> in C or C++, for gcc at least).
