The reason that we should teach Python instead of C is the reason why we teach Arabic numerals instead of Roman numerals. Roman numerals are more difficult, but you get no insight out of this time spent learning Roman numerals. It is extra human created tedious difficulty.<p>You get a much better understanding of pointers and memory from learning a machine language. In C you'd be spending your time on syntactic issues like & and * in expressions and in types. This is what makes pointers difficult. In assembly there's only <i>STORE x INTO y</i> and <i>LOAD x FROM y</i>.",1251395738

We read both Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal in school (nowhere near a complete list, of course), and even if it wasn't everybody's ""favorite literature ever"", at least it was <i>comprehensible</i> to people. You could send students home with a reading assignment, and they might actually do it, and then when they come to class the next day, they can <i>discuss</i> the text, and find out the deeper meanings, rather than having to come to class to find out just what the hell it was they just read. This is not a valuable use of literature time. Also, as I said, I read quite a bit of the ""canon"" of my own free will and could read Ye Olde Texte far better than most people of my age. More than once I was given a school assignment to read a book I had already read.<p>Your story is not a counter to my point; it proves my point. You had to be interested and bring a <i>lot</i> of effort to the task of reading those things. This makes them grotesquely unsuitable to be using them in high school where those things are not generally available. That you found it rewarding is great. I too have done that, both in the computer domain and the literature domain. But an awareness of what it took is precisely why I say it's a terrible approach to general education.<p>I never said it was a worthless sham. I said it <i>wasn't worth teaching in high school</i>, and that it should be left for college. Based on the age you had your experiences, you hardly provide a counterexample for that. It would be way better to simply <i>allude</i> to Shakespeare's genius and let motivated people find it, than spend valuable time jamming it down students throats only for them to see an incomprehensible mass that they are never again motivated to look into. There's no way school could every have given  you that experience. (Maybe a really motivated teacher, but even then it would have been a personal interaction, not a schooling thing.)<p>Basically, my position is that you have to educate the students you have, not the students you wish you had. And, if we are going to build our education system around teaching masses of children, building our core curricula around something that will maybe appeal to one or two kids per year, and then only several years later, is such a waste when we could be teaching people things that might actually <i>encourage</i> rather than <i>discourage</i> the pursuit of further learning.<p>So often the choice is presented as ""Shakespeare or nothing"", or ""only incomphrehensible literature or nothing"". You sort of have those memes in your response too, when you read into my post that I'm against literature. But when I spell that out, it's obvious that there are tons of other choices. There's thousands of other school-worthy candidates that won't have the side effect of firmly squashing all future interest in ""literature"".<p>(There's also a frequently unrecognized assumption that we have infinite time for students to learn in, and therefore it is sufficient to establish that something is ""good"", and therefore we then put it in the curriculum. That's not even close to true. Our time as students is <i>terribly</i> limited compared to what there is to learn, and it's getting worse every year. The question is not ""Is Shakespeare worth learning?"". Duh. Of course it is. But then, there's enough ""stuff worth learning"" to fill your lifetime and beyond. The question is, is it the <i>best</i> thing to learn? <i>That's</i> what I'm challenging. Given the enormous liabilities that teaching Shakespeare... oh, and by the way, C, since the parallel continues to hold(!)... brings to the table, including the very-real risk of completely destroying any interest in literature/programming that may have been present, why shouldn't we teach the things that don't carry that risk?)",1251394621

789607,comment,789065,789065,0,0,tilly,,,"I don't buy it for a simple reason.  It is easy to look around the macro environment and see plenty of reasons why entropy has a long way to increase.  For instance for several billion more years the Earth should be receiving energy from the Sun and radiating it off into outer space, which creates a sustained low entropy situation enabling something we call ""life"" to exist.   Therefore the question of the arrow of time seems to me to be explaining why the macro environment looks that way.<p>I'm not sure where I heard it, but one idea that I like is that it ties to the Big Bang and the expansion of the universe.  Most people don't realize how complicated conservation laws get in general relativity.  For instance it is a matter of opinion whether or not energy is conserved!  (See <a href=""http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/ener...</a> for details.)  In particular suppose a photon sets out on a long journey, gets red shifted by the expansion of the universe, and consequently loses energy.  What happened to the energy of the photon?<p>This question is highly relevant to the issue of entropy.  Current theory says that we had a very hot and almost uniform universe, which then expanded rapidly.  As it expanded any clumps that formed stayed hot, while the space between them cooled off, thereby leading to an increased thermodynamic non-equilibrium.  Worse yet, local gravity pulled the clumps together resulting in interesting things like stars, which further increased the amount of non-equilibrium stuff going on.<p>Of course this pushes the question of the arrow of the time down to cosmology and general relativity.  But given that physicists debate whether conservation of energy makes sense in general relativity, I'm fairly comfortable with accepting that the laws of thermodynamics are on even shakier ground there.  Which makes the physical asymmetry seem not so bad to me.",1251394426

Each step was very small, built on the previous one, and resulted in clearly visible changes to the program. For novices, this is absolutely vital- especially in a classroom environment like this. Now, re: the appropriateness of Ruby's  somewhat-odd syntax for this lesson- I agree that there's definitely some weird arbitrary-seeming stuff in Ruby (""darkred"" vs ""dark red"", etc.). But, let's face it- ALL languages have a few weird syntax things here and there, especially from the standpoint of a novice programmer. It's just part of the way that computers and programming languages work, and anybody who wants to write code is going to have to learn to deal with it. From my experience teaching novice programmers, however, I can tell you that a lot depends on HOW<p>The problem is that, with most languages and in most intro lessons that I've seen, the student is exposed to all of them all at once without much context. I feel like the lesson described in this article did a great job of introducing the students to these language ""features"" one or two at a time and in a relatively sensible order. Eg, the students first got used to the idea that the computer was picky about upper- vs. lower-case letters. Next, they got their heads around the idea that attributes often involve a weird sequence of characters (""=>""). Then, they were exposed to the ""identifiers-can't-have-spaces"" rule. Etc., etc., etc. By the time they were exposed to each new oddity of the syntax, they'd had a chance to absorb the one that had gone before.",1251393414

(In fact, there's been some research indicating that there may not be such a thing as ""totally unfolded""; i.e. that all proteins have some structure all the time.) There are two ways that you get proteins improperly folded. The first is that this is how they are made. In bacteria that number is only ~10%, but in eukaryotes (i.e. Humans), that number can be as high as ~50%. These proteins need help from other proteins to fold correctly. The other way you get unfolded proteins is by stress. Usually it's either heat stress or oxidative stress that causes proteins to unfold (not surprisingly, the proteins which help other proteins fold are often called ""heat-shock proteins"").<p>As for wether or not ""nature has solved this problem"", well...of course it has. We're here right? I think the thing to remember is that evolution is not, strictly speaking, an optimization process. Rather, it is a ""just good enough"" process. For example, a dolphin has more efficient lungs than you, an eagle has better eyes than you, almost everything that walks the earth is faster and stronger than you, and you're actually rather poorly built for walking upright (a reason most of us will suffer lower back pain as we age), but none of that matters. For the niche that humans occupy, their large brains are sufficient to beat out all competitors, and yet chances are that some day something will come around with an even better brain and push us out.",1251393238
