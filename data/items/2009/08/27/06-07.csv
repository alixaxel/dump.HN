For example, many people would consider that a tenured position at a prestigious university, with a generally very pleasant work environment, the freedom to work on whatever you like, to collaborate with whomever you choose, and to have the security of tenure, is ample non-monetary compensation. Academics also enjoy considerable prestige -- both in terms of their reputations to others in their field, and their respect from society at large. You may not value these sorts of non-monetary compensation, but some people do.<p><i>making the greatest contribution to society and wealth are and should be married</i><p>Perhaps they ""should be"", but in reality, I think they clearly are not. Perhaps an ideal system would be different, but that's not the system we have.",1251355230

Being that Verdana was designed for the web, it also allows the company’s image to remain consistent online and in print.</i>",1251354942

The original article is about being an academic (typically a professor) vs. going into industry -- that means, we're talking about PhD students.<p>(1) First, you say that education is about your ""ability to follow instructions carefully."" This is entirely 100% false for PhD candidates. The PhD is about conducting original research, often with minimal guidance from the professor. Saying that PhD students attend ""obedience schools"" is absolutely ridiculous -- real jobs are much more ""obedience schools"" than universities in these cases.<p>(2) You speak over and over about how you don't need to attend college to become wealthy. Well, this point is moot because very few PhD students are motivated to go to school by wealth. Most PhD students pursue a doctoral degree because they are interested in the subject. Ask any PhD student and they will tell you that they realize it is not the path to wealth.<p>(3) Frankly, you sound a bit paranoid and confrontational from your frequent posts (and edits of them) challenging downvoters. I don't think this is a good practice ...",1251354698

The best typefaces cost plenty of money to use. There is a recession going on but.. c'mon.. you know?<p>2) It is a challenge to set and make professional use of a shitty typeface. Perhaps this was a ballsy exercise in flaunting an anti-elitist sort of position by using a ""proletarian"" font. Who knows?<p>I used to get into friendly, though heated, debates with a friend who would accuse me of being an academic typographer. As a defense, I challenged him to make good use of a junky font like Times New Roman to determine who actually had skill and who was a stylistic fashion whore.<p>Maybe this is some such attempt by the designers, I don't know? I kinda have a hard time believing that the print designer(s) for Ikea of all places simply made a bonehead error by using a screen font for print.<p>Just my 3 million bajillion cents.
