SciAm consistently impresses me - they'll break new and groundbreaking things, but what's more impressive to me is how they avoid not giving into fluff the way many other publications do. And they make science pretty accessible and interesting. I've never written as more than a semi-professional hobby, but I'd love to put some of my research together well enough to get into the magazine at some point.",1251338342

Growth curve shifted back n years (in my case 8 years - I did a PhD too, whose main utility was in coming to the US and then realize that PhD was a waste of time - all I can say is that I am a bit slow!). And those were some of the best years, so there is a fundamental change in the growth curve also.<p>The thing I most admire about America is the can-do spirit. I am sad that the education system in America is ""Asianizing"" rapidly, in the spirit of ""We have to compete with the Chinese/Koreans/Indians ...""

In the case that I mentioned, these are people that previously (I assume) worked on the type of projects that they now miss out on.

788441,comment,787768,788426,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Re: lack of quality, it is a classic ""early days"" problem. 1950s Japan had a reputation much like made-in-China has today. It is amazing Japan is synonymous with quality today.<p>It is easy to explain: in a mature economy, any new company would have a mix of experience and new talent.  In an emerging economy, practically everyone is a rookie, regardless of age. There are entire million-plus population cities in India where no one, literally not one person, would have any experience in how to manage a 10 person technology project.<p>The only way to figure stuff out is to make mistakes. Quality is an emergent property coming out of experience. And that is the reason societies don't go from $300 GDP to $30K GDP in 1 year, though it would be possible to carefully mix an immigrant group coming out of a $300 GDP area into a $30K GDP area, and as long as the mixing is at a controlled rate, it is possible to boost the per-capita GDP of the immigrant group very high in a very short time (Indians in the US offer a good example). That is the extra value added by experience of having done stuff.",1251336692

As this is your first real programming gig you will probably be given a hopeless assignment with really bad or zero infrastructure to build upon. Lacking development infrastructure or even fellow developers to work with, you will become a pawn in company politics you are totally unaware of.<p>My advice is : bite that bullet. Work like a demon and spend your evenings building the infrastructure needed to produce a working piece of code. Spend your day time hours building code that is just good enough to demo. Talk to people and get feedback, but avoid giving your immediate superior the idea that you're going behind his/her back.<p>Working like this blows, but do it for half a year to a year and suddenly you're an experienced developer.<p>Now move to a different location.<p>(If you're lucky enough to land your first real-world assignment in an environment where there are experienced seniors to consult and you have an existing build and test procedure, I would give different advice.)",1251336309

For even better performance you may want to look at iSCSI, FCoE or ATA over Ethernet (AoE) I prefer the later two as they run at Layer 2 not 3 and thus are better for data center deployment.<p>It's not just the cost saving on disks.

As the Indian economy liberalizes, talent naturally stays home to pursue opportunity. In any case, India could export a lot of talent, and still not run out (!) - so I never worry about the ""drain"" part.<p>On returnees, it is harder the longer someone has been out of India. Two of my brothers returned and they are doing really well (both start-ups <a href=""http://vembu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vembu.com</a> and <a href=""http://gofrugaltech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gofrugaltech.com</a> ), but they didn't stay in the US much at all.<p>My advice: if you are returning, assume that you never left. Lower your expectations (in every way), you will find it easy to exceed them. Traffic is chaotic, civic administration sucks, water problems and so on. But there is something else to India ... the interesting part for me has been that in such poor surroundings, I have always enjoyed a very intellectually stimulating atmosphere. I still can't explain that part.",1251334820
