When holding down the arrow keys, it would be nice if my cursor moved faster if I was pressing harder. Same with any key repetition. Right now, repeat speed is time sensitive, so if I'm backspacing to delete an entire paragraph, I need to wait a few seconds for it to speed up. Then I have to time it just right to prevent overshooting and deleting more than my target paragraph.<p>Another practical use--I wish my Tivo remote had pressure-sensitive keys. I could zip forward then gradually back off as I approach the end of my commercial block. Just like one of those professional video editing systems, where the operator has total control of how slowly/quickly they can zip through the video.<p>They should get rid of the ""typing harder makes your letters bigger"" part of the demo.

Skinny people find running more enjoyable.  I used to enjoy running cross-country when I was younger.  As I've gotten older, I've filled out.  I'm not fat, but I'm no longer thin and scrawny.  As a result, I find running much more straining.  I can feel it pound away on my knees, and I tend to get shin splints pretty quickly.  So now I no longer run.  I enjoy exercise - biking, soccer, etc. - but pounding pavement for 3 miles a day is no longer enjoyable.<p><i>Exercise CAN make you thin; thus, the statement that it won't is incorrect.</i><p>The article does not claim exercise can't make you thin.  It claims it won't make you thin.  No matter how many calories you burn, your body will send you overwhelming urges to eat more, to compensate for the lost calories.  These urges - known as hunger - are incredibly difficult to resist, and thus you will not get any thinner.",1249864449

751583,comment,750587,750587,0,0,abalashov,,,"I think hourly billing is bad for two reasons, even though I do it all the time:<p>* It just limits the amount of money you can make.  People have a strange psychological approach to hourly figures;  once you hit a certain rate that they consider alarmingly ""high,"" which is a metric that varies immensely, their eyes just sort of glaze over and they go, ""ooof!""  But if you give them a fixed bid that assumes x hours and comes out to an equivalent hourly rate that is ${quite high}, they seem to be just fine with that - in my experience, this is often true <i>even if you itemise it and declare the expected hours</i>.  Some sort of fixed bid leaves a lot more room for padding in case things don't go as expected, and, if you're lucky, more profitability.<p>* Programming workflow just isn't linear like that.  We've all read Joel Spolsky's ""Human Task Switches Considered Harmful.""  In addition to that, programming problems are often solved in strangely noncontiguous, out-of-band ways, like coming up with solutions to a vexing encumbrance in the shower.<p>The point is that billing should attempt to reflect the actual workflow as closely as possible, and the workflow of a programmer just doesn't go like an auto shop's.  If you have a 20 hour project, doing 5 hours here, going off to do something else, and coming back to it and doing another 5 hours <i>doesn't mean the project is 50% done</i> - at least, from a practical perspective.<p>Being a very small business myself with no credit facility and no savings or cash buffer whatsoever coupled with relatively high living expenses inherited from my employed days, I face the additional issue of severe cash flow constraints when I attempt to float long projects that pay hourly.  I describe this more extensively in this comment: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=746517"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=746517</a><p>For me - as for many freelance programmers and contractors - I think the right choice is some sort of flat weekly billing, and splitting up any project of nontrivial size into smaller, manageable and well-defined milestones.   If you can get away with it.<p>I think it's pretty fair to say that you often can't do a linear, 1:1 relationship between time spent toward project and money paid.  One caveat is the one I pointed out above.  The other, more generally, has to do with the fact that at 100% completion code acquires orders of magnitude more economic utility than when it's 90% complete.  At 90%, it's just a useless blob of code as far as most customers are concerned.  At 100% it's a finished deliverable that does what they want - or thought they wanted, whatever.  So, usually there's a bigger balloon payment at the tail.  It's not realistic to expect that when you have 7/8ths of the project done, you'll have 7/8ths of the money in hand.  There are other reasons for this as well;  see the link to my other comment above.  But I think one should strive to get as close to that possible, insofar as it's possible to measure % completion to any degree whatsoever.",1249863234

I am just stating that how bad these experiments were, they did make the lives of later generations better, including the tribes that suffered most from this ordeal. I mean that it would be awful to have to do these experiments again, rather use the current set of data, how bad the methods were.<p>Good things can come from bad things, just like the other way around, science itself is hardly to describe with morality, the usage of said science is what makes the user either moral or a-moral.",1249863014

That came out to about 10 hours of running per week.<p>I agree completely about ""cube rats"" not being able to lose much weight from 30 minutes 3 times a week.  The research mentioned in the first part of the article seemed pretty much in line with my experience.

Its a good idea to use enough assert statements that when there's a problem it is reported immediately instead of propagating and causing weird symptoms that you have to track down.  At the beginning of every function I think to myself ""what am I expecting here"" and then put in 2-3 assert statements to make sure my expectations are met.  For example, if I'm passing a data structure that I expect to be filled, I assert that it is non empty.<p>When I encounter a bug I write an assert that reveals the problem before I fix it in order to prevent having to deal with the same issue more than once.
