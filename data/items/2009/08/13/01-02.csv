It says:<p>""Though much has been made of the system of peonage that kept sharecroppers in perpetual debt, tying workers to the same plantation year after year, there is significant evidence that Georgia croppers moved rather fluidly from place to place and from one form of labor to another. Certainly the reality of life as a sharecropper was a factor in the out-migration of rural Georgians in the 1910s and after. The sociologist Arthur F. Raper found in his study of Macon and Greene counties that of those Georgians fleeing the rural part of the state in the 1920s, the greatest numbers came from the ranks of sharecroppers.""<p>Frankly, it sounds like a system of unjustly exploiting ignorant poor people that was roughly on par with the one described in Chicago in ""The Jungle"" at the same time.

Or visit people in senior centers and ask them about the one most important thing in life they've learned/their signature story. Or whatever. Something that sincerely interests you. If you're passionate about startups, connect with the startup scene in each city. It depends on what your lifelong interests are.

I'm still double checking all the connections but I think this probably the max you can hit within the promotion. I originally wanted to do the international parts like Aruba, PR, San Jose, Cancun but that's just not workable or it'll has to be a trip in itself.<p>Considering the extra costs needed for traveling outside of the airport, food, and living expenses, I'm going to be spending at least $3k ($599 pass + $200 taxes/fees + $1000 food + $1000 beds + rental car/cabbing/bussing?) for everything.<p>Concept wise, I'm also drawing a blank, I need a hot geek girl/onair personality to come along. I can Ustream all the airports but no one will sponsor/pay for it--certainly not JetBlue since they know 1000 people will consider it, a dozen will go through with it, and all the social media marketing will be valued at zero. At best you can tape yourself going to all the airports and talk about them (review the architecture, shops, food, services, etc.) but that's boring after awhile. Time-lapsing and condensing the footage into a 5 minutes Where In the World is Matt video, maybe, but that's marginally novel and I think will only be a moderate (YouTube: 500k? Vimeo: 100k?) viral hit. How do I monetize on viral videos?<p>I don't have access to a pre-existing support system so it makes it that much harder, whoever has access to a film/production crew or video podcast already can certainly this take this and run a big play. Who has connects? Let's talk, I'm willing to help.<p>In my mind I think this is the greatest modern American road trip you can get but in the BACK of my mind where logic resides I think this is the worst idea ever.

Friends had told me that in the first month they were getting about four hours of sleep a night.  What they didn't tell me (and what I discovered the hard way) was that those four hours were really four discontiguous one-hour periods.  Last night my child slept for 6 hours straight.  Six hours!  I got five hours contiguous out of that, and wow, I felt like a brand new person.  I never thought I'd be estatic to get so little sleep.",1250125266
