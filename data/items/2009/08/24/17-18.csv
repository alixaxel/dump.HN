Filling up takes an extra 5-10 minutes above and beyond the fuel dispensing time (assuming that's linear, which, with my CNG car, it isn't, but that's another topic). A car with a 450 mile range over one with a 225 mile range would save me 4-8 hours per year.<p>The second is pleasure travel. Sure, the nearest fueling facility may be under 50 miles away, but it may easily be 10-30% more expensive than a farther one, especially across a tax jurisdiction border (especially Canada/US). At $3/G and 60G for a 2000 mile round trip, I'd prefer to keep the Andy Jackson or Uly Grant (Common Loon or Snowy Owl on the reverse if North of the border) or spend the money on an unplanned couple hundred miles' detour.",1251136559

For instance, those of us who design and build Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs), have a desk in an office, as well as laboratories, machine shops and test ranges. If I'm not sitting at my desk, people then look for me down in the lab. If you make each location look as if you're in that day, but probably at the other location, you can go home for a few hours at a time.

However, because the point is to do a better implementation of something that is otherwise costly, even the proof of concept is likely to require upwards of $15k in hardware.<p>Granted, it could be leased, but, if that means buying brand name, the amount financed could easily double, perhaps even triple, which would be $5k-$8k over 4 months and a subsequent excessive drain for the remaining 20, if they occur.<p>The $100k LoC BootUpLabs offers is almost enough to overcome their unfortunate location and incubator model, since it may well result in a complete, launched product, with no debt baggage.<p>Of course, this is still an order of magnitude below where VCs would come into play.",1251135517

There's no obvious one right answer, though 'box' and 'bucket' are most defensible -- based on expectation of same container or same place.<p>More adults answered 'box' and in reality I think what 'Sally' would do would be very dependent on the exact placement and the path she takes into the room, and her order of perceiving the containers. If she takes in the whole scene before deciding where to go/look, the box; if she moves to the expected place and then is surprised by the difference, the bucket. (This question in its first form may really be testing whether the answerer is primarily visual or kinesthetic in their modelling of other people.)<p>But still, the essential point is the <i>difference</i> when people are told where the ball really is. 'Sally' still does not know, so a rigorously logical answer would be the same as the first case. (The additional information is irrelevant for predicting Sally's actions.) And yet, the additional information does cause a statistically significant difference in chosen answers.<p>That means the answerer's mind, or model of mind, is leaky. Once 'primed' with info, they can't pretend they don't know it, or model the mind of someone who doesn't know it.<p>Note in this case 'leaky' doesn't mean 'worse' (even though it is more like the younger child's answers). A straightforward policy of hewing to what is true regardless of what others know or how the knowledge was acquired is fine; it just isn't ideal for some social roles -- like lawyer or poker player -- that require a detailed understanding of others' limited information.<p>So the real pro predictor, when asked ""Where does Sally look first?"", might ask in response: ""How old is Sally? Does she more often pretend-play to be an athlete or a detective? What are her parents' careers?""",1251134335
