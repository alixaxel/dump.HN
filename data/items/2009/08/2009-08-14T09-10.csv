For every person that neglects a checkup and misses early detection of a highly surreptitious, life-threatening disease, there will be ten for whom it either has no impact or results in low-grade, unremarkable chronic conditions that require occasional office visits and prescriptions.<p>Having to directly bear the cost of going to the doctor also provides a considerable incentive for leading a healthier life and staying away from bad habits with adverse medical consequences, in the same way that people are disincentivised to do avoidable things that hurt their financial standing in other areas.",1250243382

This should soften the meat enough that you can chop it in 2-3 cm cubes with a big knife. Run the cubes (with plenty of air around) in the owen again, on the same program. You'll probably need to experiment a bit, but the idea is that you'd rather have nice and raw on the outside and semi-frozen in the middle, than cooked on the outside and raw in the middle.<p>The semi-frozen bits of meat will cook just fine, if the object is to get small chuck of meat, e.g. for a taco (if you need patties, slow-thawing is the only solution). Just remember not to over-fill the pan, if there's too much on the pan, if will boil, not sear, and you'll miss out on the tasty goodness of the malliard process.",1250242068

762677,comment,760477,762348,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"That's because the notion of insurance is wrong. People need healthcare coverage, not insurance.<p>We are all connected in this stupid country - if the family down the street can't afford preventative care, and the wife gets sick, and can't take care of the kids, and the husband misses work and gets fired from his job, and then they can't afford good nutritious food for their kids, so the kids go to school hungry and don't learn as well and don't test as well, the ripples can last for generations.<p>Here's the thing. People act as if healthcare is something that has to be earned, and deserved, and not only is this viewpoint inhumane (in the Greatest Nation in the World!), but it's <i>economically indefensible.</i><p>If people don't get early medical care, their lifetime economic output can be greatly reduced. And their children are affected. If children aren't taken care of with nutrition and care, their mental abilities, abilities to stay in school, are affected -- and <i>their</i> lifetime economic output is reduced. And targeted poverty (as opposed to where everyone's poor) breeds crime. Which creates greater loss of human economic potential AND greater costs for the government.<p>The country benefits from more, healthier workers, who can think straight, and don't spend significant portions of their time figuring out how to scrape by. These people can then spend money. Middle- and lower-middle-class people spend far more of their income than higher income brackets, if only they have the money to spend.<p>Net effect: The benefits to the entire country outweigh the costs, in a system where costs aren't an arms race between health insurance providers, malpractice insurers, and other for-profit companies.<p>A stitch in time saves nine.",1250241881

(e.g. new, blocked etc)<p>c) The widget has 8 actions (links/buttons etc). 2 of them point to my site and 6 to yours! I would prefer something like 7 to mine and 1 to yours :)<p>d) Certainly add some options. The ""Looking for more on"", ""Or try a new search"" and the 3 related keywords should be optional.<p>e) The 480px is very limiting. I can't put that in a sidebar it has to go to the main area<p>f) The site copy needs a redo.

At that time I thought linux, assembly and writing a virus in Pascal were very cool things, and I didn't have a problem getting my friends to agree. It seemed very natural then.<p>I admit I don't know many high-schoolers now, but my feeling is they really are less hacking-inclined, at least around here (Eastern Europe). I'd guess the main difference is access to information. Then it was very rationed - I remember learning assembly from a reference manual. Now Internet offers a lot less obstacles, so I don't really see a point for ""subversiveness"", at least in mainstream programming.",1250241818
