So it can be more horizontally scalable than a stateful session, but it may also be more CPU-intensive on both server and client, since they need to compute a cryptographic hash for every request.  Also, the lack of a widely-reviewed standard library for HTTP+HMAC authentication means that you might end up rolling your own, which would probably have security holes that you don't catch, like all the recent timing attack vulnerabilities:
