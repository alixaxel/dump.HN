I see what you're getting at, but before one can ask such a question, one must know if the answer will involve statistical theory and that's a big jump. Learn the basics first, then look for applications lest you can't see the forest for the trees.<p>The other problem with this approach is that while you may get depth, there is very little breadth. I find that when learning something for the first time, I want to go wide and shallow. Then once I have a basic understanding I can figure out where I want to learn deeper.<p>OTOH, maybe you just learn things differently from me!<p>I just gave my friend (a PhD in Operations Research) his basic Statistical Theory book back. I also wanted to get a better understanding of statistics, but that stuff was putting me to sleep too easily :-(",1249574320
