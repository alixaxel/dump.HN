At the risk of sounding like an ad, I use one in Austin called Conjunctured (<a href=""http://conjunctured.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conjunctured.com/</a>) and the cost is $250 a month. For that, you also get use of a conference room when needed. That's around $8 a day, and pretty competitive with coffee shops. Check out if there are any coworking spaces near you; they don't have to be expensive.<p>One of the nice benefits I'm enjoying that I didn't expect is meeting a lot of driven, self-motivated, young professionals. Being an old-timer, this has been really refreshing. Plus, I've actually been asked for advice; don't know how useful my advice has been, but man, it's a nice boost for the old ego.",1249531168

I'm not sure how that would improve the quality of your team or its products.<p>All else being equal, I do believe that random companies should hire open source developers preferentially.

That would drain the huge Chinese savings pool and cause steep output contraction, particularly in the overleveraged and inefficient state-owned sector.\nThe excess money in the system, with M2 money supply up 28.5% in the year to June, also suggests that a price explosion cannot be far away.

Just as likely is the various accounting systems for determining the numbers are flawed.  Possibly not intentionally flawed, but these number are hard to assess.  So its not surprising to see when you aggregate them and pull from different sources (different methods of reporting and guessing at the numbers) you may see wild discrepancies.\nI doubt that numbers over the last 8 years were correct either.  The difference is no one cared to question them.<p>As to the view that its a landmark for the Chinese press to openly suspect the numbers, I don't think its such a landmark.  I read the Shanghai and China Daily papers (English) every day while in Shanghai.  I've been reading them for years.  There is always info on gov corruption, fund misuse, crime, etc in the papers. I find the reporting style much better than most mass media U.S. papers.  There are certain hot button issues that are suppressed, but that takes an active effort on each issue.  Lots of negative information gets printed.<p>Let me put it another way.  What is the current debt obligations of all investments banks on Wall Street?
