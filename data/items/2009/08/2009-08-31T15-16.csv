That allows you to use one system to support everything from ""Slay 100,000 orcs"" to ""Print out 75 bingo cards"", with negligible work from your API consumers.  The fact that it is negligible work creates value whereas your base offering (show that you've slain 100,000 orcs on your teaching bingo site profile!  Booyah!) does not.<p>Other easy things to measure are stickiness (time since registration), collecting all of a set of API calls, etc (For example, in the hosted badge designer, you could say ""A Dragonslayer is anyone who submits any [dropdown: two] of the following events: killed-red-dragon, kill-blue-dragon, and kill-green-dragon.  Then customer site only has to fire killed-#{monster.name} as appropriate, and boom, dragonslayers.)",1251734355

796127,comment,795751,795751,0,0,jhancock,,,"Sounds like they run their servers outside China.  This works if most of your users are outside China.  It can be highly problematic if most users are inside China.<p>I do not agree with using ""pseudo-legal registration hacks"" unless you really have to, that is, your business is doing things the China gov frowns upon or your biz model can't be easily classified.  In years past, there was little choice.  Now, its not too difficult to run a proper China Internet entity. You do need a local Chinese company to hold your Internet operating license.  This is not your license for your business and real/intellectual property, this is a license for operating a server in China.  This creates trust and contract issues, but there now exist trustworthy partners.  I recommend to anyone wanting to target the China market to have a local Chinese business partner.  It doesn't matter how smart an expat you are, the locals will always understand some things better than you.<p>Hosting within China does cost more.  As an example of the low end of server hosting, I ran a 2U server (I owned it) for an annual fee of $1200.  For that I receive an unmetered 1Mb connect.  That was the contract.  In reality, I was connected to the IDC's 100MB switch and nothing was managed.  I never had problems.  Some IDCs are better managed than others.<p>As for payments, if your users are paying outside China, you use a HK or other entity for those payments  (you'll most likely need an HK entity anyway to comply with China regs).  For payments in China, use a China bank and China payment system.<p>Final note: for bootstrapping and proof of concept stuff, it can make sense to crank things up in the U.S. or HK and ignore all local rules until you know more.  But you should  plan to clean up your China requirements as soon as possible.",1251733425
