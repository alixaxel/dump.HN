The way that they describe it is misleading -- tending to lead the user to believe that Google's app was replacing parts of the UI.<p>This is how the 'user experience' has changed with Google Voice:<p>* People call your 'google voice' number rather than you cellphone's phone number<p>* Calls to your google voice number are forwarded to your cellphone<p>* Voicemails left at your Google Voice number are stored in  your Google Voice account (rather than on your AT&T voicemail at your cellphone's number)<p>The problem with Apple complaining about the 'changed user experience' is that people signing up for Google Voice and getting the Google Voice app are making a <i>conscious choice</i> to modify their user experience in such a way.

778859,comment,778127,778344,0,0,ken,,,"How is that worse than having the same category for tall and short people?  I see nothing magic about sex as a differentiator.  It's not the sex organs that would cause the imbalance.  It's sport-specific physical differences, like height and muscle mass, which happen to be partially linked to sex.  But once you admit that some people should have their own category because of a genetic coin-flip, why would you limit this to women?  (Sounds pretty sexist to me!)  Wouldn't it be equally fair to have an olympic medal for, say, fastest 100m run by a man under 5'6""?<p>To answer <i>your</i> question, what I'd like to see is for people to realize how silly the current set of sports are -- virtually all slight variants of either ""person moves an object downfield into a goal"" or ""person runs/jumps/lifts very fast for short distance"" -- and a shift towards sports which are more equal to all people.  Where are the sports that reward balance and rhythm and endurance more than speed and strength?  Where are the sports for which sufficient training negates virtually any genetic luck?<p>For example, most of the best rock climbers and martial artists I know are not just short, but downright tiny.  In races, women do better relative to men when distances are longer: I doubt I'll ever see a woman make up the 0.9 seconds to overtake the fastest man in the 100m, but I also doubt I'll ever see a man make up the 5 hours to overtake the fastest woman in the decaironman.<p>If you start with the set of sports for which men hold a huge relative advantage (like any professional team sport in the USA), no categorization will ever truly make up for it.  The fix, then, is to change the sports.  This isn't as radical as it might sound, e.g., (American) football started with a round ball which gradually got pointier as people decided they liked passing more.  We get the sports we optimize for, and I don't know what we're optimizing for but it certainly isn't sexual equality.  As long as we have sex categorization, that's basically impossible.",1250905500
