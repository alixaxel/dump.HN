Although your local pub might not be filled with a dozen angel investors, Portland <i>has</i> embraced the young startup culture. With groups like OMSI, DorkbotPDX, Cubespace, and recently TechShop, it's a haven for hackers of all types. Not to mention a great music scene, delicious food trucks, and the best microbreweries in the nation.<p>The crucial thing it's missing is a large technical school. And that's likely the reason it will never be able to touch Silicon Valley in terms of startups.",1250276293

The most central idea of economics is that there aren't enough goods for everybody to have what they want. Therefore, you have to distribute the goods somehow.<p>Some (more or less) fair ways to do that would be to give the goods to those that pay more, or work harder, or wait longer.

I like lisp (though I have specific issues with many details of actual lisps, as everyone does).  However, after two years of experience with it, I was chagrined to find that it hadn't reduced the time it took to finish projects very much, if at all, over Python and PHP.  There were two problems, really: lack of libraries that did what I needed to build on, and the ever-present temptation, much stronger than in most languages, to build everything myself, even where there was a 80% solution already existing.<p>I recognize that this stems directly from CL's greater power, and I don't want that power removed from a language; I just don't know how to get the power <i>and</i> develop a culture of good libraries and reuse.",1250275735

What's more, in the context of the whole post, it makes a lot sense.<p>If HN audience has one blind spot, it's the fact that not everyone is an entrepreneur, working on their brand new startup, boldly going where (hopefully) no one has gone before. Believe it or not, it's really true that there's a whole lot of people out there who choose web programming because it's easy enough. There's no shortage of companies whose primary business is not software, where you can find a job that involves hammering out JEE applications using Struts (or just plain old servlets and JSPs), EJBs and one or more databases. I recently interviewed a candidate for a Java developer position who has spent 9 years in that same comfort zone, never venturing out of it at all.<p>Yes, Jeff, you did a great job with Stack Overflow. I use it frequently and I really love it. No, it's not trivial. Nothing worth doing is trivial. And no, not all programming will be web programming.

If you can show me an instance where anyone, ever, has successfully brute forced a properly set up (salted AND peppered) hashed password from ONLY the hash and the salt then I will quite literally eat my hat. It simply cannot be done with current technology and no amount of rank-pulling will change that.<p>However, I've actually changed my mind and conceded defeat on this one. If the attacker could grab a copy of the app code as well and get the pepper & hashing setup, bcrypt would indeed slow down the ensuing attack on the passwords.

I was told that while it was a promising area, YC is reluctant to fund single founders.  Fair enough.<p>A few weeks later, I responded to a technical plea for help from one of GraffitiGeo's founders in this thread a few weeks after that: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=413929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=413929</a><p>When we got in touch, we had a long and frank discussion about Graffitio and the space in general.  I told him about the challenges I was facing, and some of my plans for the future.  He brought up the idea that we team up, and I said I probably wasn't interested, but I'd let him know.<p>Then I got the email.  He offered me 1.5% of their company for all of my source code, the name, and my 40,000+ users at the time.  He went on to use threatening language such as ""Graffitio is going to get stomped out of the picture"" and ""Your financial alternatives are bleak.""  I chose to pass on the offer.<p>The first version of GraffitiGeo that came out in the App Store was an _exact_ clone of my app, Graffitio, down to the terminology such as Graffiti and Walls.  They started to differentiate themselves with later versions.  Some of those differences were novel, but others were features that I'd mentioned to him in our conversation.  To be fair, they could have arisen independently.<p>Graffitio is over a year old now.  It was in the App Store on day 1.  I should probably be more annoyed than I am, but honestly, I have a lot of reservations about this space now after being here for over a year.  Dealing with the App Store is another headache.  I haven't been able to get an update through in months.  Anyway, the first round of geotagging apps have fallen flat IMO.  Turning them into a ""game"" like Foursquare and GraffitiGeo isn't going to change the fact that they deliver relatively little utility.<p>There might be a magic combination out there that makes it work, but I don't think GraffitiGeo or Graffitio in their current state is it.  I wish them luck in finding it.  If anything, they've lit a fire under my ass to spend more time on Graffitio.",1250274911

My intro. quantum physics professor was a brilliant and accomplished researcher at the bleeding edge of this field whose most basic concepts were deeply mysterious to us students. We appreciated the passion and keep knowledge that informed each of his tangents, but they were pretty impenetrable and very frequently distracted from the material at hand. I left the class thinking he was a brilliant man but fairly poor teacher. Then I had had him the next semester in thermodynamics and he turned out to be great! Certainly he had plenty of knowledge of the field, but he kept the class somewhere within the scope of the syllabus and relayed the foundations to us much more carefully. He focused on teaching, not the material itself.<p>The GEB lectures you linked are an interesting example in themselves. The early tangents that the teachers launch into on their own are certainly helpful, especially in such a free-form class. But student questions and tangents soon dominate that class too, to the point that I found it quite unbearable. When there is interesting material to be discussed they continually relapse into tired speculations of the ""well maybe the universe is just a giant computer simulation"" sort. The last lecture in particular is completely dominated, and in my opinion ruined, by questions from the most persistent student. A teacher needs to take charge and keep the class on track.

If you are foreigner - forget it. OK who can be a  German citizen - 2 ways - 1) you a German by blood - it does not matter where are you born - blood comes first. 2) you are foreigner trying to get a German citizenships - even if you get it after 15 years or more stay in Germany you will be always 2nd class citizen. Reasons - a ton of reasons - too much to list it here. France - the same. Probably Netherland is better - but no much business opportunities there. England - forget it a closed class society - you have to be from inner circle.<p>In Germany - there are several big companies working with thousand subcontractors. Siemens for example. There is a saying in Germany - if something happens to Siemens - the same will happen to Germany. So basically to have a small business there practically you have to be a subcontractor to some of the big companies there AND better be a German citizen. Big companies there a heavily subsidized by the government. Besides Germany-Russia  are so heavily interconnected so you can imagine the subsequences. The pact Molotov-Ribentrop is still not widely known but the European Union wants to make it official data of victims of fascism and socialism because again they are so close. Recently it was discovered German banks with filials in Luxemburg washing money for Iran government - this is a big theme - where the money come in Europe and why this leisure and welfare theme.<p>Here in US - you can register a business the next day you got your stamp in your passport if you come with a business visa. If you are born here - it is much easier of course, but not much different. I can comment about California where I came not so long time ago but enough to tell - once you understand the US specifics and have a drive you can have a success here no matter what. Opportunities are everywhere even in these hard times.<p>The financing possibilities - there is simply no comparison.\nSmall business friendliness - beyond comparison.

Oh, no, the main character died, its all over, the ship is destroyed and the world has ended. But no, wait! What's that? Oh, its OK.

But that's ok, as you said, its a movie and it doesn't have to be all real. But it has to have some sense and meaning. Using time travel as a main plot device where it is not necessary or even sane, is a serious crime.<p>The actual act of time traveling isn't that important, or the science behind it.
