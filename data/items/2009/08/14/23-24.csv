It appears there is very little useful information available.  The biggest problem, it appears to me, is the lack of any financial incentive to run large controlled trials of diets as there is in drug trials.  What we really, really need for nutritional science to advance much more, is for large-scale controlled experiments, but without the millions of dollars drug companies put into testing their products, in the hopes of making it back from sales on successful drugs, it is not going to happen.",1250294309

As I understand it (I tested for standing, so I can't claim first-hand knowledge), 2110 does a very good job of combining the relevant parts of ECE2030 and the C bits of CS2130. That, to me, makes it a solid replacement for those concepts.<p>The first time 3240 was taught, Olin was the professor teaching it. It covered a fair chunk of the material you'd expect to see in CS4510 that semester while also being an excellent class on lexers, parsers, and interpreters (not so much on compilers, but of course it's not a compilers course). I can comfortably say that it was by far the most interesting and educational course I took during my undergrad career. Since Olin's unfortunate departure, 3240 has apparently turned into just another lexer and parser course.<p>On the whole I'd say the changes they made w.r.t. CS2130 were good. However...<p>Threads has made it so that you can get a CS degree without taking an algorithms or data structures course above the 1000 level, which I find wholly disappointing.

Some of the more useful additions include:<p><pre><code>  * Git hooks for ""official"" commits\n  * Hooks for when automated tests break after a commit\n  * /ping and ""pong!"" client response to see who's at their desk (I don't work in\n  an open concept office)\n  * Times during the day (typing break, lunch, etc)\n  * Notifications from members that need someones specific attention using notify-\n  osd and (optionally) a system beep.\n</code></pre>\nI also built this system because external chats are blocked, but internal multicast cannot be blocked, and doesn't go against IT guidelines :)",1250291334

(i.e. functional languages, procedural languages, etc) Teaching <i>only</i> C and C-like languages is encouraging a monoculture. It doesn't matter whether or not they will <i>use</i> Lisp or SmallTalk in the real world. The idea is for them to come away with ideas and concepts they would not have been exposed to otherwise. I mean this <i>is</i> a university and not a vocational school. I would expect university students to be exposed to more ideas (even if they are ideas that never get commonly applied in the real world) than someone coming out of a vocational school. {/edit}",1250290803
