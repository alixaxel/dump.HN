765558,comment,765435,765530,0,0,jerf,,,"People play endless games with the word ""right"" here, to the point that the word is meaningless. Do you have the ""right"" to be as dedicated to work as a childless 21-year-old whose primary goal in life is to climb a corporate ladder? Then, perhaps, ""feminism"" says ""no children for you!"" Or perhaps it demands free child care, then demands that your relationship to the child not suffer when you're not the primary caregiver.<p>Note how I scarequoted the word ""feminism"" since it would only be one particular variant of an itself-poorly-defined word. (That variant definitely does exist, though.) Such a variant would argue that you have lost a multitude of such ""rights"", which you may not agree with.<p>Nobody (or close enough it doesn't matter) is saying that you've lost anything like ""the right to free speech"" or any such ""natural right"" because you have a baby. (I personally would say you have a <i>responsibility</i> to it, but that goes equally for the father too. I say this as a father, but then, ""parents have responsibility to their children"" shouldn't be too controversial to most people.)",1250391418

Advertising-as-news is worth my time?<p>I get annoyed at CNBC when they report government statistics as if they were quoting scripture. They ignore the constant upward revisions in last week's unemployment data, which happens every week and makes this week's losses look less bad. And why they don't report reconstructed M3 as many web sites have done lately (hint: it's plunging). While it may sound arcane it's a lot more important than hearing the prewritten patter of the CEO of Amalgamated Cowbells.<p>Several months ago there were guests on CNBC laughing at Peter Schiff for suggesting an imminent mortgage meltdown. This was soon followed by the mortgage meltdown. I often wonder why CNBC doesn't show that clip (available on YouTube) to those same laughing guests and give them the opportunity to explain what was so funny. (Are Schiff's current predictions worthwhile? I don't know, but I'm not laughing. Nor am I laughing at Abby Cohen's rosy scenarios. Predicting markets is hard. Shooting the messenger is stupid.)<p>There's a show on CNBC at 5pm Eastern called <i>Fast Money</i> which, 6-12 months ago, was a real hoot. It was sort of a McLaughlin Group for the stock market, with a host and rotating panel of guests each of whom was some sort of money manager or pro trader, with no allegiance to anything except profit. The top two (IMO) were host Dylan Ratigan and panelist Jeff Macke, both of whom were evicted when their contracts were up. Evidently the CNBC execs prefer serving financial pabulum instead of hard reporting replete with finger shaking. One wonders if this is entirely voluntary.<p>Yes, you can have political differences (e.g., Liesman vs. Santelli). Every viewer is used to (occasionally heated) political argument. But when it comes to the financial equivalent of Woodward and Bernstein, CNBC has taken a pass ... and the audience appears to have noticed.",1250390059

765518,comment,765387,765507,0,0,chrischen,,,"Obama's plan is an option right? So as far as the options go, you have the insurance companies and you have the government option. In both cases you'll probably have bureaucrats deciding who gets what. The difference is that the government option will be subsidized by taxes right? Staying even will be less of a concern. So the argument is that as our nation advances further more of our basic needs should be met so that we can free up more time to achieve higher needs like self-actualization. Obama's plan is basically taking us into the next step and making basic health needs less of a concern.<p>I guess the determinant of whether or not we're actually ready to move into the next stage is whether or not technology has advanced enough to make health care cheap enough to be supported through the government. Of course on the other hand if we don't make this push we may not even have the incentive to make healthcare cheaper. So in other words, we have to create some irritation to make health care less scarce, just as we have to irritate a wound to have it heal faster. Obama's plan may be that irritation. If the plan strains the national budget then we will be more inclined to figure out how to make health care cheaper, and as a result a nonissue. I mean most other first world nations have nationalized health care so it's about time to make that push right? So that basically explains <i>why</i> we should move towards that direction.<p>So as my response relates to scarcity, the plan allocates resources better by taxing the wealthier americans more. But we can't hope to support this plan by constantly creating better allocations. Obama's plan is assuming that we're at a point where medical care is cheap enough to be supported by allocating a little more from the wealthy.<p>An insurance company will allocate health care based on profit, the government will (hopefully) allocate it based on need, and that's where we're aiming to go to make it a nonissue for Americans (and everyone in the world ideally).",1250389364

You will not find threads in haskell.  You will not see polling loops or select with switch dispatched networking code in Seaside.  Your program will be easier to read in python or JavaScript (depending on your block syntax preference).<p>You say that C doesn't suck at these things, but it is more realistic to say that it is <i>possible</i> for these things to be done correctly in C.  It is more likely that they will be done incorrectly in C than in other languages.  Maybe the result will be slower, maybe it won't run on your watch, but correctness is more important than speed.  Speed (of instruction) is easy to fix - just wait a year.  Better to get your program correct and your algorithms efficient than to waste your time on speed.<p>> The core C API can be kept in its entirety in a programmer's mind<p>I'm not sure what that means, and I'm fairly certain that you aren't taking into account the complexities of modern compiler runtimes and CPU instruction reordering.  If you think that the assembly output and runtime characteristics of C programs are simple, you haven't looked recently.

C is a really easy language to port to new hardware.  It runs in very constrained environments, like tiny embedded systems.  It is a generally useful language to know as a computer science major.  It is a common language because worse is better, but when it comes to laying the groundwork for your programming career, better is actually better.  Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.<p>> If you teach people to be comfortable dealing with C, they'll feel like Python is pie<p>No they won't, they'll think that Python is C with garbage collection and no curly braces.

Somehow, it was then put aside due to some preoccupation but it keeps returning and flashing to me like owl’s-carrying-letters sent in to Harry Potter, demanding my involvement to perhaps save the world.  Yes, the world is in big trouble and economists can’t help due to perhaps lack of genes and consequentially severe loss of sights.<p>“What went wrong with economics” is: Economics lacks at least one fundamental foundation. Installing this fundamental will elevate Economics to another platform.<p>What is this fundamental?  It is something that sciences cling on tightly, but economics does not.  So, economics has departed from this fundamental, perhaps unconsciously.<p>What is it then?  It is the Fundamental Axiom or Law of Causality, simply means: Cause gives rise to Effect, In = Out, Debit = Credit, a Source for every Outcome, etc which are common senses or self-evident truths.<p>Tell us in what way the Economics runs away from this fundamental?  If you ask: You win, I win, everyone wins, who then is the loser or provider of wealth?  Most of economists will tell you that there is no loser.  The Economics textbooks also say so.  But it cannot be no loser, as it violates the fundamental Law of Causality.  So, we must insist for the presence of loser, as dictated by the Fundamental Law of Causality.<p>On this insistence, one great researcher by the name of HNM had successfully uncovered the identity of the loser and the mask of wealth after an effort of several decades.  Needless to say, he has restored the Fundamental Law of Causality back to the economics and make it a strong and real science. Using his new theory, all events in the past or present could be explained with ease, and that it could predict and even provide future policies and directions for our world.<p>If you are really interested to find out more, please write to me via my email: chinfuilan@yahoo.com",1250388761

765505,comment,765387,765464,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"For the record, if you want to deal in conjecture and annecdotal evidence there's just as much stacked up against the health care system in canada.  I can't tell you how many times I've read of people dying while waiting for a test or surgery.  There are even the proven stories of wealthy canadians flying to the U.S. and paying for surgeries privately.<p>More than anything stories like this (or the ones about Canada) are scare tactics to support a political agenda.  The fact still remains, a hospital in the U.S. by law CAN NOT turn away a patient for financial reasons.  No one is dying on the street for lack of health care.  At the same time Canada generally manages to take care of the great majority of its citizens without killing them by making them wait.<p>Bottom Line: The U.S. system has problems but so does the system in Canada, the U.K. and elsewhere.  What we in the U.S. need to be doing is looking for a third option.",1250388572

Much more so than having lots of private companies, each with shareholders demanding profits be returned</i><p>It's remarkable how our historical examples of this efficiency are so often ignored by all. I mean, consider how the soviets of the USSR succeeded in making that nation an economy to be reckoned with. And Chairman Mao's great leap forward was able to engineer a populace that succeeded in its grand goal of vaulting beyond the waste of the capitalist West. If only the industry of South Korea could prosper in the way that Kim Jong Il has guided his people into a paradise of plenty, then all Korean people could join hands in brotherhood.",1250388569

Pakistan also shows up high for the MCAT which I found pretty interesting. Nepal seems to be high on some of them so it makes me wonder if anything is going on with that.<p>If Google maintains this database for a long enough time period it may be possible to see long term trends in the data - maybe the US had a much higher interest in the GRE decades ago.<p>Does anyone know if these other countries have test that have similar names? That would skew the results.",1250388543

We've also migrated development environments from Windows to Linux.<p>I'd consider myself a professional programmer, but this is my first job in a Ruby shop, and I have to say I am still staggered by the productivity.
