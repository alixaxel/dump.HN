Being a PhD student about to finish in sciences and starting my own company which is already ramen profitable, the biggest concern of mine is how can I stay in US, after I am done with my PhD. I am not that worried about funding, revenues, marketing as much as I am worried about immigration. I wish there was something like PG mentioned in the founders visa article or things are much easier if you are a PhD in STEM in US. I am preparing myself to move back at this point.",1251046760

A salesperson would call these people leads and follow up with them in order to ask the question directly, ""Could your team perform at a higher level with some coaching of the sort I talked about in my talk?""<p>Your coaching work is probably also going to work it's way into your talk because that's where your anecdotes are coming from. Just make sure to spell it out directly at the end of your talk with a slide: ""Thanks for listening, here's what I do, and how to contact me.""<p>There's a non-car-sales technique to selling which is often summarized as give value first. That's what you're doing here because both of these techniques rely on you giving a great talk.",1251046673

Is it because you get lots of applicants from people not in the U.S. and they can't even get a visa to fly over for the interview?  It can't be because the founders can't ""hire"" good talent.

780643,comment,780482,780482,0,0,joez,,,"As lots of people already said, your user growth projection is probably not going to be very exact. ARPU can be pretty close. Expenses can be really close.<p>Depending on your product, you might be able to set up some initial targets and just run with those. I.e. if your marketing plan is to start at colleges (or one particular college that you have strong affiliation with), you can calculate a growth for that slice of your market. Since you are pretty set on creating a model, this will probably help you get closer. I.e. your user acquisition went from a geometric curve to more lumpy. Kinks in your curve are a good indication you gave it some thought. I.e. is there a point at time where you switch to a more aggressive growth by buying users?<p>If you have some goals in mind of when you want to hit profitability, you can backout a user growth rate. So you have ARPU and a pretty good idea of what your expenses will be, just divide expenses by ARPU and you have a user target. So if you then have a goal of hitting break even in 13 months, you know that you will need a x factor of geometric growth. You can make this more complicated by changing your ARPU (I don't know your business model but probably ARPU goes up as you hit critical mass?).<p>Again, probably still a BS hockey stick but hope this helps!",1251046290
