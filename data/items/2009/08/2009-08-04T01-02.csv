Your framing such self affirmation gestures negatively, as an aggression to the other, only shows your bias. The world will hopefully keep one more language around thanks to the people that make that perfectly legitimate choice. In any event, I bet any adversary feelings towards the English language are not due to the name but to the fact that it's been dislodging Welsh out of existance, as your reasoning illustrates.<p>A Gov employee should be expected to know all official languages in the country where she'll be serving. Especially if she is going to have to face public.<p>Considering to move or home school your children only to keep their minds uncontaminated by Welsh sounds more like political or social prejudice than actual educational concern. Trust me, knowing Welsh will only make it easier, not harder, for them to learn Urdu and Mandarin. In Spain, students from nations with one or more languages of their own average a higher proficiency in foreign languages (including Castillian, AKA Spanish) than those of monolingual provinces.",1249350778

740484,comment,740425,740425,0,0,makecheck,,,"I can certainly see how the market has won over code in many situations.<p>I find it personally frustrating, because it goes against my ethical code: I care about what I create, and won't work for a company that takes short-cuts.  I would especially walk out the door if it became clear that they were trying to hide serious flaws under the guise of a quality product.<p>The industry is so young, that it is difficult to protect consumers.  There are people being fooled into purchasing all kinds of things, but at least with a toaster there are regulations like ""can't electrocute people"".  With software, no one demands to see the source to ensure they haven't invested in an unmaintainable piece of garbage; and license agreements are laughably evasive, ensuring that companies aren't really responsible for anything.<p>That's why I am still interested in seeing where open source goes.  In just 5 or 10 more years (a lifetime for maintaining code), some of the worst offenders in corporate environments could be really screwed, as their rickety messes start to crumble.  Their most talented programmers will likely have left in disgust.  Marketing will becoming increasingly the task of putting lipstick on a pig.<p>Whereas, many free software projects are basically honest: you can't really hide ugly hacks in open source, and maintainers are already highly motivated and eager to show the world how they think something should be done.  Young people are already more likely to be knowledgeable about software, which will lead to more forms of marketing based on quality (e.g. writers, colleagues, neighbors, friends, who can guide your decisions based on quality and not flashy ads).  For the rest that isn't open-source, government may catch up a little and start bending the industry to avoid some of the worst offenses.",1249350655

It is all a matter of perspective - computers themselves are a tool, one that can be used for good or bad.<p>The corporation is impersonal by design. It is a structure designed to facilitate enterprise.<p>It does so: 1) by giving an enterprise perpetual existence; 
2) by allowing investors to put up risk capital without having to risk their personal assets in the venture; 3) by separating management from ownership such that the operations of an enterprise can be flexibly handled; 4) by creating discrete units of ownership that can be used to create special incentives for founders, investors, employees and others; 5) by creating a vehicle for widespread public ownership of the enterprise.<p>Is this good or bad? It is all a matter of perspective.<p>Consider that, without the corporation, we could not have the modern startup.

Try to offer equity incentives to employees when all you have to work with is a family business or a partnering-type vehicle.

For one, unless you are actually going to build vdevs and stuff any kernel you build is going to be a microkernel. In my experience, however, I would not say that message passing makes your life that much easier. In addition, it's probably a good idea to write an ELF compatible OS if you want a prompt. Writing a shell isn't that hard, but I wouldn't want to replicate the basic userland tools if I can just statically compile a busybox library. You should also plan to implement some sort of ramdisk if you want a useable environment (or virtual devs with drivers, but that would probably be harder).
