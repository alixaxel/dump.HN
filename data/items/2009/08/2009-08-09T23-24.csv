There's so many small bits of software that really make a difference in everyone's day-to-day life (whether you're an average Joe or a hardcore hacker) that don't ever get fully developed because there's no commercial market for them.

751526,comment,750608,751326,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"What the cigarette companies perpetrated in the 60s was <i>fraud</i>.  This was not mere 'information asymmetry'--this was flat-out lying about what was in a product, which is its own special category of badness (to start with, it's a breach of contract, in some sense).  Also, as an important (but logically irrelevant) corollary, people died.<p>I don't think that ""information asymmetry"" is ever <i>sufficient</i> cause for government action.  And I don't think ""there is a trade-off between the consumer's right to know and a company's... right to privacy"".  That's a weak tautology, like saying ""People shouldn't have to walk through metal detectors, and should still be perfectly safe in planes.""    It's vague enough to be agreeable without actually having said anything.<p>It's easy enough to look at the Hoover Dam and say ""Look at this dam!  Without government intervention this dam would not exist!"" The fallacy is to suggest that the choice is between the hoover dam and nothing.  In fact, it's the choice between the dam and <i>where the money would have been spent</i>.  Was the hoover dam better than whatever the market could have done with the money?  I don't know, but that's an <i>extremely</i> difficult position to argue--you have to argue against everything.<p>What you're saying is, basically, the government intervened to force companies to give us information.  Is that good?  I'm not so sure.  We started (seriously, anyway) regulating the financial markets shortly after the great depression.  Then the market got too complicated for the regulators, and it crashed, so we wrote more complicated regulation.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  There are still as many Madoffs today as there were in the 1890s--the only operative difference is that they've been regulated into a complexity that could potentially fool even me.  Meanwhile startups are too scared to IPO, which is the secret cost everybody overlooks (what we would build with the hoover dam).<p>By and large, you still have the same percentage of bad apples.  Information has simply inflated over the years.  Still the same asymmetries, just a higher floor.<p>And what's really perverse about the whole thing--you see huge gains in the floor during the highest asymmetries.  Think about the great economic booms--railroads, industrial revolution, even recently with MS Windows and/or Office.  These are periods of huge economic growth, of technology raising everyone's standards of living.  And they're the periods of patents, of lawsuits, anticompetiveness, and huge economic disparities.<p>At the risk of committing a huge causal fallacy, I posit that asymmetry, informational or otherwise, is necessary for these gains.  Or at least more necessary than most of us feel comfortable with.",1249861243

If you are still coding and don't want to interrupt your ""flow"" to go write an error handler, just put an assertion or a comment or something that will force you to go back and write it before you compile.  That way you'll know when the problem is actually solved.<p>With that in mind, perhaps also think about the way you are structuring your development.  Do you have a mental (or physical) sketch of the code before you write it?  There's something to be said for having a bit of paper to scribble on before and during the coding process.  Map out little examples (e.g. ""test cases"") and think about how you will deal with all of them.<p>Finally, writing stubs (i.e. functions or modules that are basically empty) when you first start can be great.  If you know you're going to need some pieces of functionality in order to solve your problem, then write stubs for those and then solve the problem (i.e. write the main program flow).  Hopefully then when you come to write the supporting functions that do most of the heavy lifting, you will have clarified your intuitions around how they are supposed to work.<p>So my advice would be to be a little more rigorous in your approach _before_ you get to the point of having screenfuls of code in front of you.",1249861026

Since it wasn't spelled out i'm just assuming it's ""whichever you feel is most important"" :)<p>So for physical sex the ""bonus options"" (i'm excluding transgender in all cases, since it has its own explicit option) would include, but not be limited to: intersexed (itself an enormous list of totally different and interesting conditions), eunuch (a couple of options here as well), someone who has altered their body in a way that does not fall into eunuch or transgender, or that sort of thing.<p>Mental sex is a big one, since we don't really understand it and lots of people have slightly different ways of describing themselves. Just a short list: bi-gendered, neither, androgynes (who might say they're different from the bi-gendered--not both, not neither, but somewhere in between), non-conformist male or female (to the point where they would put ""other"" despite falling more into one category), various cultural versions, and so on.<p>Behavioral sex almost defies categorization, since it's often explicitly an attempt to defy categorization. You've got crossdressers (who might or might not choose ""other"" over male or female--or over transgender too, i suppose--and who might be aiming at ""passing"" or who might be explicitly aiming at perceieved crossdressing), androgynes, various quasi-genders that show up in the queer community (""butch"", ""femme"", etc--though i wouldn't expect these to choose ""other"", they certainly could if we're talking about behavior and presentation), those who choose to ""perform"" gender as a political act, etc.<p>I'm kind of being lazy, but it's a complicated question...",1249859774

Through stepwise refinement, multiple (formal) steps are taken towards a more concrete implementation, which eventually might result in an efficient implementation capable of being executed.  None of this is really new, and I think the differences between a ""program"" and a ""specification"" are reasonably well understood in most contexts.  Tools already exist to do these sorts of things, they are just restricted to certain problem domains where the expense and overhead are justifiable for the extra safety guarantees.<p>Also, I think you're jumping way back into coder-world by talking about declarative high level languages.  Sure, that might be one way of achieving the stated goals (and indeed, many have gone down that path!) however specifications can come in many shapes and sizes.  The idea is to reduce the number of abstractions which the programmer must hold in his or her head in order to write programs.  The ability to construct ambiguous, incomplete specifications that can be interacted with or validated before anything resembling an executable specification comes about is beneficial in many circumstances, particularly when you are talking about concurrent or distributed systems.<p>Basically what I'm saying is that a specification provides only some of the information required to construct an executable program, and may abstract away specific behavioural information until much later into some refinement process.  A ""program"", as such, does not, and by its nature contains a description of exactly all the behaviour that can be exhibited by execution of said program.",1249859169
