I'm really not a morning person so in the morning I just do half an hour immediately after I wake.<p>In the evening I have roughly 7pm - 11:30pm to play with. I normally sit down to write between 9pm and 10pm and then go through till 11 - 11:30.

The best possible outcome of such a test would be a compiler error.<p>His argument that sequences defined as min <= i < (max + 1) because (max + 1) - min = total number of items is just silly. Maybe true for maths, not so for programmers. When reading code, you want to know if the code is valid, not how many items there are in a list. And reading i <= Max instead of i < (max + 1) is simpler.<p>Secondly, his article is about 0 or 1 based arrays, not random selections.

Because of my Omaha ties we do some business there.<p>Omaha is a great place to live.<p>For startups as HN defines them, Omaha is not an ideal location.  There are two big reasons for this:<p>1. Low cost of living.  For a tech startup, Ramen and split-rent costs about the same everywhere.  A low cost of living generally means that the people around you are used to paying less for things.  Silicon Valley is nice because the population has money and is ready to spend it and founders can get by for dirt cheap just as they would anywhere else.<p>2. University System.  SF, NYC, Boston (and RTP!) all have strong startup communities as well as great University systems nearby.  This is not a coincidence.  Omaha is an hour from the University of Nebraska.  The next closest are the Iowa schools which are several hours away.<p>A good part of Omaha that the OP mentions is the creative scene.  I am continually impressed by it.

FARC could just as easily be the world's largest kiddie porn or sex slave ring.  Afghanistan could sell slaves.<p>(I am not speaking hypothetically.  There are nations which do both.
