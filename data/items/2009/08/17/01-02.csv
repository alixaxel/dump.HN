The advantage of going for top posters is that you have a lot of data to judge whether you'd like to work with them.

It was a great and challenging position, not just due to its content (how do you deal with running tens of thousands of nodes in clusters distributed throughout the world?) but the people and the environment (it was one of the few places where you could find people in an operations team hacking OCaml).<p>Ultimately, I was found by a start-up and left, seeing greater responsibility and compensation. Six month in, I started looking around. The lack of mental stimulation scared and de-motivated me. I switched jobs to a non-web-centric software engineering role. It felt ""scary"" (""job hopping"" as the country headed into the recession?), but it was the right choice.<p>The risk is thus: if you're bright, it's very easy to become good at most anything. Some fields (systems administration, web development) can be fun (given the right environment, e.g. the operations team I've described) and are <i>always</i> in high demand. None the less, if you become good at something you <i>don't</i> ultimately find challenging and worth-while it can be a risk further down on.<p>Have you consider going into scientific software development? Both your web development background (the web <i>is</i> the user interface these days) and your scientific education will be of help. You might take a paycut, you may not have the flexible hours, but the job might provide both the content and the environment (i.e. the people) that will keep you sharp.",1250472823

Could you elaborate on just what you mean by that?<p>If I could be so bold as to take a guess at what you mean, it seems you're suggesting that the HN community submit only topical links.<p>I think that suggestion will generally simply be ignored by those people who want to (for whatever reason) submit non-topical links because only a small fraction of HN submitters will even read your suggestion, and most of those that read it aren't going to care (or they wouldn't have submitted off-topic links in the first place).<p>In order to reach all submitters, we could have some sort of global notice reminding everyone to only submit topical links.  Maybe a stern and clearly worded warning on the submission page itself.<p>But say we do that and people continue to submit and upvote off-topic links.  In my opinion, this is precisely what's going to happen.  So then what?<p>I think there is no solution to keeping HN pure short of having the site be moderated by people dedicated to keeping it pure.  But clearly that's not the model HN wants to pursue.<p>As long as HN is self-moderating it will not stay pure, and the more popular it gets, the further away from purity it will drift (witness what happened to Slashdot and Kuro5hin).<p>So, given that HN is not and probably will not stay pure, how can we improve the situation?  I think the solution is clear: tags.  Tags will let each reader more easily focus on what they find interesting, no matter how ""impure"" the site gets.  It's an easy solution and one that should scale pretty well.",1250472415

Journalists could liveblog updates as they investigate, encouraging supporters to give additional funds to help them through the search. The editorial staff could float suggestions for stories and let users vote with their wallets on what they want investigated.<p>In this way users could also directly support the journalists who do good work, and the organization would scale by the level of interest.<p>Probably not what pg had in mind, but it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility.",1250471106

Simply flat-out refuse to engage in a meaningful dialog unless you stop touching my fucking screen.  In fact, I'll even get up and walk away if necessary.  (""How about we go discuss this at your monitor?"")<p>It's not about the expense, and calling it a pet peeve is very dismissive.  It's about respect and personal space more than anything else.<p>Consider this: I'm more comfortable without pants on.  When I work from home, in my own space, I'm usually not wearing pants.  But when I come into the office, I put on pants, because I have some modicum of respect for the people I work with, and I know that pantslessness is going to make people uncomfortable.<p>Your behavior doesn't bother <i>you</i>, but ignoring the fact that it bothers <i>others</i> is the very definition of rudeness.

To make these connections requires that you have, of course, an inquisitive, sharp mind, but also <i>a broad knowledge-base</i> to pull from.<p>So don't limit yourself to one discipline. If you're into comp sci, don't just read comp sci papers. Try some humanities or even art from time to time. The most unique ideas seem, to me, to come from taking knowledge from one field and adapting it into another. I've learned so much by taking a casual interest in fields unrelated to what I do and certainly feel ""sharp"" when I see connections between things I'd be otherwise ignorant of if I were a ""specialist.""",1250470914

The filter on output method that most Rails programmers use involves setting it up on an output-by-output method. I like the input technique because it only needs to be configured once.<p>I think the risk of new techniques getting by this filter are low (although the risk of the filter having bugs is high, as judged by the number of bugs that popup in more critical software). In XSS there are only a limited set of attack vectors (iframe, javascript, flash), and those get filtered completely. The underlying filter is based on whitelisting, so it's not like new additions to the HTML spec are going to open security holes before we have a chance to close them (it's the opposite, new, safe HTML additions will need to be explicitly allowed before they can be used).",1250470890

One co-founder means you get a bigger slice of the pie, but also means that there's no mediator if the two of you can't agree. And take it from me, there will be many times when you don't agree. That's why I prefer two co-founders, because when two people take a side they're often able to convince the third member.",1250470873
