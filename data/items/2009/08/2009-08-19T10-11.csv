772449,comment,771587,771587,0,0,hooande,,,"So let me get this straight... people told you to study hard and over achieve, and now you're upset because things aren't as easy as you were promised?<p>Welcome to the real world.<p>Sad Fact #1: Everything people tell you isn't true. Even your parents, religious leaders and teachers will tell you things that aren't entirely true, mostly because they have their own motivations.<p>Sad Fact #2: You can do everything the right way and still fail. Mostly because there are a lot of people who's parents also told them to study hard and overachieve, and by the nature of the system you can't all win big.<p>I had to learn these lessons the hard way, too. Everyone does, sooner or later. Some people respond by taking another look around and wondering what else they don't know. Other people start to demand the respect they were promised without having yet accomplished anything impressive. If you're in that second group you have what they call a ""sense of entitlement"", no matter what the previous generation told you.",1250679293

772443,comment,770196,770196,0,0,peterbraden,,,"I started using django a few years ago. Previously I'd been using php and had built up my own 'framework' of tools. I'd learnt python though, and loved it (perhaps the finest language in the world) - I'd heard some talk about django and thought I'd give it a go.<p>And it blew my mind how easy it was. And how well architected.  And how it took me a tenth of the time to make a website/app<p>I've chosen it for every project I've had a say in since - absolutely no regrets.<p>In terms of framework envy, I've tried out a few others. Rails seems nice, pretty equivalent to django, but I haven't really any desire to learn ruby - it seems too similar to python.<p>I've also played with stuff like web.py etc.<p>One of the advantage with django's full stack is that it 'just works'. While it is undoubtably a big framework, if you get in the right mindset you can develop ridiculously rapidly.",1250678467

772438,comment,770196,770196,0,0,etherael,,,"Bought in to work on an in house framework that was to be fair quite outdated, needed to find something that would fit the same space as the technology it was replacing (Basically Java + J2EE) but at the same time wanted something that was friendly to rapid app dev + agile, had used Django extensively before but obviously not a possibility here.<p>Looked around in the J2EE space and found grails which was;<p>A) Modelled after ruby on rails conceptually
B) Constructed from a large amount of best of breed components in the respective sphere which addresses that piece of the framework, like Spring and Hibernate.
C) Had a language which didn't make me want to tear my hair out.<p>I'd actually never used groovy, which is the language that the grails framework uses internally, before, but found it to be easy to adjust to having a fairly good grip on the general digital polyglot, and having the ability to mix and match with java code has been very eye opening just because of the sheer volume of ready made solutions to the vast majority of problems out there.<p>To be honest the thing I hate the most about grails is stack traces, they're ridiculously verbose, huge, multipage sprawling monsters, and there's really not much to complain about aside from that.<p>If I could start my project over again and the need to have it work in the J2EE space was not there, I'd be very hard pressed to say if I'd choose grails or django, both are spectacular at what they do, with their own unique advantages and disadvantages.<p>I didn't choose it because I wanted to learn it, I was already very familiar with the paradigm and it was obviously the right path forward in terms of getting some rapid app dev processes in place for this organisation, mostly I just wanted to show people what was possible, rather than building apps with string concatenation and manual sql with selects by row and index ( I shit you not ) while staring at AJAX and the general web app environment with increasing confusion.",1250678128

A new ""financial system"" will have to grow naturally to create any sort of stability, that is based on the trust in the system. And mind you your bank adviser is not really an adviser but a salesman. If you want advise on money use Mint.com.<p>There is nothing that hinders this kind of thinking to scale.<p>Microfinancing shows that there are money to be made in decentralizing where the money comes from and where they go to. It fit's perfectly into the ""spread your investments"" that seems to be the most stable.<p>To add to that, I actually think the future will bring much more small to medium sized companies than necessarily large organizations so it seems to be the right way to approach it.",1250678066

772428,comment,770938,770938,0,0,CrLf,,,"I participated in some ACM programming contests when I was a student. My university had about half a dozen teams, and we had local contests and participated in national and european level competitions.<p>I can see where the author is coming from, but I can't agree with him fully.<p>Programming contests really are no measure of how good a programmer is. At most they are a measure of how good a programmer is at memorizing solutions to ""standard"" classes of problems and then quickly adjusting them to specific instances of them at the competitions. But I don't think that's why competitions exist at all.<p>I admit, I was never a good programming ""athlete"". I like solving those kinds of problems, and I like to solve them as quickly as I can, but I also like to immediately go back to them once solved, to ""clean up"" the code and make sure I can understand my solution when I read it again a few years in the future (which will probably never happen, but nevertheless). The problem is the ""as quickly as I can"" never was ""9 problems in 5 hours"", not even 5 problems in 5 hours. And the same applies to my fellow teammates, which I don't see as bad programmers at all.<p>In fact, looking back, it is funny how I seemed to like to pick apart other people's solutions when they happened to solve the problem as far as the automatic judge goes, but then seemed to have some corner case problem where it would probably fail (incomplete solutions). This happened from time to time, and it could also be attributed to me failing to solve the same problem, but incomplete solutions really irked me. :)<p>But the social aspect of the thing was important, probably more important than the actual programming, not only because of the visits to other academic institutions, but also between the teams of the same university.",1250677297
