But that's not even the problem.<p>Security is all about the weakest link. There is no point dialing one of the links up to absolutely insane heights without taking commensurate measures with the rest of your links - and a salted, hashed, SHA1 password is already pretty freaking secure.<p>Let me give an example. If your opponent possesses the <i>incredible</i> resources necessary to brute force SHA1 in a useful timeframe - and there are probably only a handful of such organisations on earth, all governmental - then they will not even bother with that. They will simply bug your server and collect the passwords plaintext somehow there. Or they'll subpoena you and force you to start collecting the plaintext. Hell, what do they need the passwords for anyway?<p>See what I mean? It's solving the wrong problem. Anyone who could actually brute force SHA1 is such a formiddable opponent that they could not care less if you changed to bcrypt or whatever. You have already lost if they even decide to mess with you.<p>Plus, it's yet another dependency. And then the speed penalty. Forget it. Put the time into setting up SSH keys or turning off root login or something; you're a million times more likely to be compromised by those kinds of everyday flaws than NSA-level shit like this.",1250261972

Both the quote it reacts to and also the conclusions drawn from it are absolutely wrong (and I do think, this strong wording can be used in this context).<p>Web programming is difficult in a different way than say, compiler construction or kernel programming. Web programmers have to deal with malicious users, a potentially vulnerable gigantic stack of applications, sessions, databases, communication costs and whatsoever. One might say: Web programming is mad due to integration issues and malicious users.<p>On the contrary, take compiler construction. Compiler construction is hard, because language design is hard and because mathematical reasoning about programs and program transformations is hard. Generating code for a language is hard, too. Thus, one might say that compiler construction is hard due to mathematical issues and hard with respect to algorithms.<p>I do not think, I would be able to build a secure, good webapplication anywhere soon, despite having touched and worked with two large, strong complicated compilers. Thus, I think the difficulties are different.<p>On the other hand, 'all programming is web programming' is just ridiculous. I mean, one can easily drop a gigantic list of things: kernel programming (without kernels, NOTHING works), compiler construction (without compilers, we'd be in stone age), games (c'mon, totally disregarding egoshooters?), media codec implementors (videos, music, ...). None of these directly interface with the web, but all of them are important (at least kernel programmers and compiler constructors are crucial for usual boxes to somehow work).

Instead I've learned to balance all of my bad habits in a way that continues to optimize productivity for me. So for example after smoking for five years in my early 20s, I quit cold turkey. As for eating, I'm learning to control my blood sugar levels. I'm finding there is a blood-sugar/caffeine/alcohol feedback system that I'm dismantling. But then there are big problems that I'm still working on, like procrastination and too much web reading (which are related!) I probably lose dozens of hours a week on these. Sometimes I make progress, such as no TV (except for movies) Still others seem intractable, like enjoying coding so much I keep over-coding things.<p>I think as you get older you begin to realize how screwed up you are -- if you are introspective at all, that is.
