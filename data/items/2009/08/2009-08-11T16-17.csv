It was the easiest way to motivate people to accurately report the value of antiquities.</i><p>Yeah, it does sound unrealistic.

Microsoft's developer relations are bar none the best for any commercial entity or platform I've ever developed for.  That's not saying their API's or SDK's are well designed, what it is saying is their developer support simply cannot be beaten.<p>Now, I've been entirely Apple based for the last three years and - in terms of hand holding tool chain support - it's a relative ghetto in contrast to what MS provides.<p>MS is definitely more open than Apple is, specifically when it comes to the iPhone, so I'm not sure how Apple is the new Microsoft in the slightest sense.  Now, I don't mean open in terms of open source and all that, but I mean open in terms of what, when, where you develop and deploy.<p>In many ways, I wish they were the new Microsoft.  That would mean that iPhone is an open landscape with API's that aren't encumbered with a ""father knows best"" mentality, which, as a developer, is frightening if it's a picture of what's to come.  Can you imagine a future where Apple dictates what you install on your laptop or desktop?  Why is the iPhone/iPod Touch any different?  Because it has a GSM chip?<p>The problem is that if consumers accept this scenario, which they've readily done with the App Store, then the next logical conclusion is that the next device from Cupertino that isn't a laptop or desktop will come with the same closed, crippled, handicapped (from a developer's perspective) ecosystem.  Then the next iteration after that will move it closer to the reality that your desktop will be locked down in the same fashion.<p>No, Apple is not the next Microsoft.  They've become their own brand of monster.",1250009764

I continued being a physics major despite doing terribly in most of the upper-level classes.

It has to be; most of the things you might find are exciting aren't even taught in high school.

It will never be cheaper, easier, or more socially acceptable.  The semester I spent in New Zealand cost my parents about 1/3 as much as a semester at Amherst (mostly because tuition + room & board at New Zealand universities was around $7000/NZ, while tuition + room & board at Amherst was $20k+).  It massively broadened my perspective - not just because I was in a different country in a different hemisphere, but because I was living on my own, with a 14-hour time difference from my parents, studying at a different school in a different university system.  And if I hadn't gone, I'd have to have stayed back on campus while all my friends were abroad...<p>I think I probably would've gotten even more out of the experience had I been brave enough to go to a country with a different language and vastly different culture, eg.

The original Mac was likewise an open book (albeit one without an expansion bus). Take a look at the first edition of Inside Macintosh. Even modern macs aren't ""closed"" in any meaningful sense.  You can develop and deploy software for them using most or all of the tools Apple has internally.<p>And in any case, it's not the ""closedness"" that people are complaining about with regard to the iPhone; that's just the practical tool Apple is using.  The complaint is about Apple's attempts to use dominance in one sector (smartphones in this case, though I think a similar argument can be made about media players and iTunes) as leverage against competitors or to favor its own products, or those of its allies.<p>And it is <i>that</i> behavior that seems very Microsoft-like to those of us who remember the 90's.",1250008074

Statistics (Descriptive and some Probability),

There are core programming skills, and there are technology-of-the-week skills.

Very few men, at 18, are good enough judges of character to not end up losing badly on this gamble. Most 18-year-old men have certain, umm, influences on their judgment of other people that make them pretty bad at this.<p>Obviously, some people luck out and meet a soulmate at 18. One of my friends met an amazing woman (also his first girlfriend) in his freshman year and is now happily married. I've seen it happen even in the US, where the average quality of women is low (""hookup culture"", <i>Sex and the City</i>) and the odds are bad.
