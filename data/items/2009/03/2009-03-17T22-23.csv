As long as you have privacy you will have this kind of thing. If somebody starts a popular service with (close to) 100% anonymity and 100% data privacy (e.g. server provider doesn't hold encryption keys), they are virtually guaranteed that it will be used for this kind of content. In other words, any truly private service is almost certainly an unwilling accessory to this kind of abuse. Further, users of such services are going to be stigmatized for sharing a service with kiddie porn consumers/producers. That is very unfortunate.<p>Also, since apparently this kind of content is easily available, we are all one click away from becoming criminals. Imagine somebody posted a link to some kiddie porn on news.yc with a title like ""Apple Announces iPhone 4G"" on some non-alarming domain. Anybody that clicks the link to get their daily Apple rumor will instantly become a criminal.<p>Eventually, nearly all of us will probably have some kind of incident like this. And, as companies and governments start recording and analyzing everything we do online, this means that we will all eventually get caught. At any time, any of us could be instantly arrested and (nearly) instantly convicted. This is just like how cops claim that if they follow somebody long enough, eventually they will break a traffic law because it is nearly impossible to follow the laws.<p>Somebody that can solve these problems would be doing society a lot of good.

As goofy as it sounds, I found lots of inspiration trying to convert BASIC game programs (as in Ahl's 101 Computer Games) to Python. First time through try to get it to run. Then try to get it to work with fewer lines. Then add some features. You'll be surprised how much you learn.<p>Good luck.",1237327915

That kind of interaction will be come critical day to day, it also helps test the depth of the candidate.<p>I guess that's why I don't like puzzles - it feels too much like a trick (also, I'm terrible at them).

I am far from being a  ""true"" hacker but I've learned along the way that programming (hacking) can really only be refined through practice.<p>Believe me, I used to think that reading books/tutorials/articles made me a better programmer, but, honestly, building something is the best way to learn.<p>As for steps, I'd say go in this order:<p>1.  Do some (quick) research about some languages you're interested in.<p>2.  Decide on the language that is most intriguing to you and that you think you'd stick with.<p>3.  Find an idea for an app that will be useful to you.  Be sure to set the goal of your first app properly-don't try to take on too much (mathetica clone) or too little (Hello World) with it.<p>4.  Build the darn thing.  This is the point where you'd start looking up tutorials/etc in order to figure out <i>how</i> you'll actually do things with the language.",1237327815

For example, I'm not comfortable with an 18 year-old being viewed as a predator for having consensual sex with a 17 year-old.<p>But other than the fringe cases, I really don't see how it ever can be healthy for a child to be involved with an adult, or even be in a situation where they can give consent.<p>There is too great a power difference. Somebody mentioned earlier that some parents were basically forced to get their kids involved with porn so they could eat. What is the child going to do in that situation, say no? Basically, in that situation, if the child has a choice it's between eating and doing porn.<p>Also, minors today are taught that it is the acceptable thing to defer to adults. So children already have a lot of pressure to defer to adults instead of enforcing their personal boundaries.<p>And I can't imagine a child being seriously attracted to an adult. They are both in different stages in life. After I started college, I really viewed high school students  differently. They are just in a different place in life. I have different goals, responsibilities, and plans then I did in high school. I really doubt I would have enough in common to be attracted to a high school student, let alone be able to make a healthy relationship work.",1237327760

How about:<p>More storage (always more storage), more RAM, maybe a faster CPU if they could do it without ruining existing software by running it too fast, the new more precise more responsive multi touch screen design that was demo'd on recently, a front facing camera, new radio support (e.g. 4G), reduced power consuming components (3G/bluetooth/gps processors), improved internal speaker for music/handsfree use, new WiFi standard support, more CPU features, camera flash.<p>What about manufacturing changes?
