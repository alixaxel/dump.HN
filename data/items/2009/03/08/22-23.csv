After everyone finished reeling in horror from the senseless murders of many of their families and loved ones, some subset of the people would quickly realize that all the competition had just been eliminated from the drug market, rendering it extremely profitable and lucrative. Time to stop whatever they were doing to start producing and selling drugs instead.<p>(Were you <i>really</i> being serious?)",1236553139

I tend to structure my code so that a malloc() and its eventual free() are both in the same function, most of the time.  C++-style RAII object lifetime management is even easier.<p>Meanwhile, I've been coding in Objective-C since 2001, off and on, and I <i>still</i> get releases and retains in the wrong place sometimes.  objc 2.0 property syntax means I can't even eyeball them to make sure they're balanced anymore.<p>And I don't think I'm the only one.  Go find a forum with newbie objc programmers, and I'll bet you a buck that most of the mistakes they're making are too many releases, not enough retains, making use of objects that have been freed, and so on.",1236553011

507609,comment,507509,507585,0,0,mcslee,,,"Your argument seems a bit inconsistent. While I generally understand the spirit of what you're saying, claiming that ""over 50% of the US population has tried it to little effect"" doesn't seem any less anecdotal than your example of the friend trying ""X"" 3 or 4 times.<p>All these substances should be assessed scientifically for medical risk, and empirically for societal risk.<p>Asking for dealers to be shot on a drug-by-drug basis is a bit sensationalist. Drug dealers simply respond to demand in the market. They sell whatever people are buying -- they don't have personal agendas about which drugs to sell. Demand for drugs is notoriously inelastic.<p>I'd modify your last statement to say that people tend to dump all <i>illegal</i> drugs into one bin, and <i>legal</i> drugs into another. Most everyone seems to think legal drugs are safe, but people tend to be split on illegal drugs (some think they're all the worst things ever, others seem to falsely presume they are all reasonably safe).<p>Personally, I think there needs to be more and better education across the board. The legal/illegal distinction is rarely meaningful and detracts attention from a proper comparative analysis of drugs and their risks. For example, fentanyl is more powerful than both heroin and morphine, yet is a legally prescribed painkiller. Similarly, Adderall has a family-friendly reputation for helping kids study, yet along with its use come many of the same risks associated with speed. This is not surprising, because they are in fact the same thing -- amphetamines.",1236552624

In my country I've seen a Xerox all-in-one color laser printer for about $500. It's more expensive than ink printers but you save a lot of money since toners are cheaper than ink.<p>Aside: How can HP be called reputable?

507602,comment,507509,507571,0,0,chris11,,,"I haven't thought much about the effects of big business on a legal drug market. It might be beneficial though.<p>My views on drug policy border Libertarianism. If you want to significantly damage yourself by using hard drugs, that should be your right. If you hurt other people while high I would be in favor of very tough consequences. I'm not totally sure whether that would increase drug related crimes though, so that attitude might not work.<p>But I would be extremely disgusted by any person or company who decided to manufacture hard drugs like meth or cocaine. So I'm not quite sure how comfortable I would be with a multi-billion corporation selling hard drugs.<p>Allowing corporations to sell hard drugs might actually work out well. Right now drugs can be cut with materials such as glass and even cheaper drugs like meth. So legal hard drugs might actually be safer than the illegal version. And any corporation that successfully sells drugs would have to compete with gangs, and other violent organizations. This would mean that criminal organizations would probably lose a lot of market share.",1236551813

507598,comment,507185,507300,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I have no idea if the average Japanese programmer is any worse than a European or American one; what I can say with some certainty is that the average European <i>game</i> programmer is quite a bit better than the average <i>programmer</i>. Probably because game programming pay in Europe is terrible compared to ""normal"" programming. (you're talking by a factor of 2-4) So European game programmers are in it for the love of doing it. Maybe that difference isn't there in Japan?<p>What I can also attest to from first-hand experience is that the Wii SDK stack is/was riddled with problems on pretty much every level.

507597,comment,507358,507358,0,0,mixmax,,,"If I understand correctly the businessplan goes like this:<p>1) Keep alienating consumers and digital music outlets with courtcases and other mafia-like behaviour until CD-sales approach zero. Make a bit of money, and since music is going to be free anyway, who cares if consumers and the future marketing channel hates us.<p>2) When CD-sales are low enough give the music away. The sites we are now suing will play along once they get our stuff for free. And those guys over at Apple don't know what they're talking about when they tell us that consumers will gladly pay for music if it just works. We don't really believe that they have digital music sales in excess of $1 billion.<p>3) When we can't make any more money from CD's well change to 360 music deals, and we'll get a cut of merchandise, live events, etc. Of course well have to find out how to do world tours and other stuff we haven't got a clue about, but we'll worry about that later.<p>4) During the roll-out of the above we will ignore the fact that artists hate us and are fleeing our labels. They'll surely come back once we get our new business model going.<p>I mean seriously - is this the best they can do?",1236551641
507596,comment,507306,507393,0,0,bemmu,,,"In my experience any moving part in a computer (fans, magnetic platter hard disks) will eventually fail, and printers are certainly no exception to this. Like the Office Space fax machine, all printers I've ever had to interact with have got paper jams or problems with paper feeding. I believe the printer at work actually came with a contract with a repairman that would come and do magic with it when it failed, which was often.<p>An ideal printer would have the minimal amount of moving parts. Currently printing consists of taking a slip of paper and moving it vertically while moving the printing head from left to right.

But the bulk of the top selling games are not made by sony/microsoft. The profits get slimmer and slimmer.<p>For Wii, the hardware makes profit (owned by nintendo) and NEARLY ALL of the top selling games on wii are made exclusively by nintendo. So even if, as you say, you only ever bought 2 games ... Nintendo is not complaining!

In other words, during internet search, savvy users constantly assessing the credibility of sources and validity of answers. This gives directly two principles which Google has used to dominate the market: authority, as encoded in page rank, and the swift checking of relevance and credibility, as helped by the short blurbs of relevant text, the back-links to similar pages or pages that link to it, and the quick viewing enabled by Google cache and 'view as html.'
