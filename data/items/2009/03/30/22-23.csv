I'm not talking about anything esoteric, I'm talking about core business metrics, like the number of people who sign up for your service.</i><p>That's because a lot of people, namely the intuitive sort, don't track that stuff enough for there to be a good counterargument.<p>That said: intuition has long been a part of design. Architects don't design buildings according to a numbers game: there's a part of the process that's wholly creative. Obviously, artists don't rely on metrics. They go with their gut. Numbers can show some things, but not always. Would you say that Rotten Tomatoes, by being fair and balanced, is really showing us the best movies? Is Toy Story 2 the best movie ever made? According to their reviews it is. According to ticket sales Titanic is the best movie ever. Are either of those metrics true? If I make a movie expressly intending to score better numbers than those movies, am I doing justice to a movie?<p>Get rid of this ""right decision"" argument. Past a very basic point, that's all subjective. There is certainly an objective layer design, but past that it's a matter of ""like"" and ""don't like."" The argument is like the Mac versus Linux argument, where one side says they ""feel"" better and the other side brings up numbers. The numbers are accurate, but to assume that the other side has no argument merely because they base opinions on intuition is stupid.<p>(By the way: there's more to a business than number of users. I'd rather have a site that had a very bright, small userbase than a site with a lot of users that I personally didn't like. Hacker News versus Digg, for instance.)",1238452628

539258,comment,538949,539245,0,0,unalone,,,"Commentaries, no. Summaries, yes. If you're adding <i>your own creative action</i> to what I've done, then the resulting work is yours. So, as I said in another comment, that Gospel According To Harry Potter is a creative work unto itself. It creates things that I didn't create initially. But Sparknotes isn't doing that: it's just summarizing what I've written, and while that takes work, it's not creative work, it's mechanical summary.<p>Fantasy adds a new element, because a huge part of fantasy is the mechanics of a created world. I think that a fantasy writer ought to control their world. If Rowling wants people to stay away from that creation, it's her right, in the same way that a programmer ought to have the right to stop people from taking their source code and making new things with it if they want. If I hacked my iTunes.app to give it new functionality and then sold it as a new program, I'd get nailed by Apple. That's completely good.<p>I should have final control over my creation because it's <i>mine.</i> I have every right to it. I support the actions of people who want to maintain their creative control.

539257,comment,538949,539151,0,0,unalone,,,"So J. K. Rowling, who spent seven years developing her universe before she even began writing her first novel, who spend inordinate amounts of time developing her systems, her characters, her plot, the morals and concepts she focused on... once she finished it, that's yours? You own some sort of a right to it?<p>You have exactly as much a right to Rowling's universe as she wants you to have. That begins with her novels: she has decided that you have a right to read her stories once you pay money for her books, or once you access her books in some way that involves, somehow, her making money. Once you've done that, you're free to discuss those ideas, you can talk about them with people, you can write about them. But that <i>doesn't</i> give you a right to alter or modify her writing in any way, and I don't think it gives you a right to alter her works for commercial purposes in any way. If you want to make a free online resource, go for it, but if you're going to make money over 17 years of J. K. Rowling's life, there may be a problem. (It's better phrased: she has the <i>right to give you a problem.</i>)<p>Interesting concept: perhaps authors could sell licenses to enter a world's commercial universe. Asimov made a universe for other writers because he wanted them to keep out of his own, then never wrote a story in that second universe himself. Perhaps an enterprising writer could create these huge worlds and scenarios and license them for profit. That would make for a fascinating take on the idea of creative world design that we've already seen explored with things like Dungeons & Dragons.",1238452056

(No, you don't need to be a huge-ass body-builder-douche, if you don't do 'roids you probably won't be one, you'll look normal and athletic.)<p>I think probably it's all about testosterone - weightlifting increases the levels of those and thus makes us feel more ""manly"" and that just blows away the insecurity.<p>I'm not a scientist, so that testosterone stuff is just a guess, but it was amazing how at the age if 17 it transformed me from a shy, withdrawn, never-look-people-in-the-eyes teenager to a ""real man"" - relaxed, confident, one who talks to people as a real equal. Much of social interaction has hidden traces of very primitive instincts behind it: the sexual instinct and the fight instinct, and weightlifting gives you confidence in both (even though you would still be beaten to a pulp by any 120 pound Thai Box fighter, but that doesn't matter, you probably don't actually need to fight: it's just the feeling) which transforms into a relaxed and confident social interaction.<p>Another way to put it is that as an Aspie, I always felt alien from both the world and from my body. My idea of ""me"" is something in my head who tries to drive my body with a remote control and it just doesn't work well. Weightlifting got me to connect with my body, it made by body a part of the ""me"", and through the body as a medium, it made me connect with the world and other people. (Probably it's something about strenghtening some under-used neural pathways that connect the ""self"" parts of the brain with other parts.)<p>Now at 30 I'm often too lazy to do it, but whenever I do it for a few months, my Aspiehood just goes away.</i>",1238451945
