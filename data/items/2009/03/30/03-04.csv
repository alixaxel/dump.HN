538167,comment,537783,537783,0,0,nikblack,,,"WAY over-rated story. The network is built using a script kiddy tool called Gh0st RAT, which relies solely on social engineering to propagate. There are no new exploits here, or nothing as sophisticated as confiker especially since Gh0st RAT is a simple client/server model that is very easy to block (infact, most firewalls should already be blocking it).<p>The security company that wrote that report probably charged hundreds of thousands of dollars for information that any competent network admin could have found online or would already know if they kept up to date with the 'latest' (ie. 10 year old) threats.<p>It just happens that one of these networks hits a high-valued target, and then propagates. Note that most of the victims are incredibly unsophisticated and from poorer countries or organizations without a clue.<p>The lesson here should be about training computer users and having competent administration and support of IT infrastructure, rather than a scare campaign about Chinese government hacking. ('oh the host server is a Chinese IP, it must be the government! (300M net users in China.. durgh)).",1238385305

538151,comment,533782,533934,0,0,mde,,,"I appreciate the call-out of an important omission from the article. I've learned that <i>having a bizdev on the team is truly critical</i>. That whacked me on the side of the head when I started thinking about Twitter's strategizing (<a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/13/twitter-decides-to-hire-someobody-whose-job-it-is-to-make-money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/13/twitter-decides-to-hire...</a>), and thinking about the shaping of various features that customers are not getting a chance to weigh in on. I've tried to wear the bizdev hat myself but it is all-consuming. Now I have a full-time bizdev partner and it's making a world of difference in focus/direction. The XP practice of ""on-site customer"" is really enabled by having bizdev pull the customers close early on.<p>Another valuable role I've discovered is that of the incubator (I'm not YC; doing OTBC in PDX). It's another secondary role similar to Lawyer, but can be very supportive in making sure you're focused on doing all the business stuff that hackers can easily lose sight of. I'm presently being shown the value of having a solid business plan, perfecting multi-length elevator pitches, and refining the more formal investor and sales pitches. This is all possible thanks to experienced entrepreneurial coaches who really want to see you succeed.<p>Lastly, the ""consort"" is a non-obvious role -- someone who can give validation to your thinking, and exchange predicament stories with you. You may find him through the incubator, or at a hacking event, or wherever. My main consort is an extremely capable hacker and our regular discussions are gold.<p>So with the core team containing the right hacking, creative, and outreach balance, you can make progress. But I want to stress that the supporting people (Lawyer, Consort, Coach, et al) provide a lot of necessary elements.",1238383576

538133,comment,536181,536478,0,0,dkarl,,,"Divorce means wasted years, loneliness, traumatized children, and yes, even in America, social stigma.  Nobody wants to be on the dating market as a divorcee, because everybody looks at you and wonders what went wrong and what kind of baggage you have.  As a never-married guy, I can say that despite my best intentions I view divorcees with suspicion.  If you think people take it lightly, then you're wrong.<p>In reality, marriage in America illustrates the blade of freedom cutting in both ways.  I would like to point out that traditional marriages, Indian or otherwise, carry very strong expectations about the partners' roles and the structure of their home life.  If one partner fulfills his or her economic and social role, the other partner's expectations are fulfilled.  In American marriages, there are fewer culturally determined and socially enforced rules on who brings what to a marriage.  That creates a disorienting number of possibilities.  It is harder for two people to live together when every choice made by one closes off possibilities for the other.  In a marriage where tradition has already closed off all possibilities except one (if indeed any other possibilities are imaginable) there is less disappointment and less reason to resent one's spouse.<p>Obviously, it would be nice to have a modern marriage contract, a new set of obligations such that if each spouse fulfills his obligations, then both spouses share a mutually beneficial marriage that supports, rather than hinders, their goals in life.  That is what traditional marriages offer, but they are too concrete about household roles and duties.  Modern attempts to define marriage are rather abstract and dependent on interpretation; probably that's what bothers you when you say that Americans depend on a ""feeling"" being there.  Modern definitions of marriage are very wishy-washy because there's no concrete division of duties to found them on.",1238382500

So I'm not sure how useful your fact is without data or context.<p>Agreed that a woman's reasons for infidelity are probably different than a man's reasons.  But I don't think that is much consolation to the man she cheats on.  So, I feel that time_management's desire to find a woman not prone to infidelity is wise, but he is embarrassing himself with an immature understanding of women (to put it kindly).<p>I would also say that this issue is covered in considerable depth in the movie ""Chasing Amy"", and I think that one of the conclusions in that movie is that, no, it is not psychologically easy for most men to set aside a woman's sexual history, even if he wants to.",1238382440
