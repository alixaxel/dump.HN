528011,comment,526694,527170,0,0,owkaye,,,"""Regarding YC, I believe they offer a ton of value beyond the money.""<p>I'm sure they do, but finding a co-founder who is a programmer just to get into their program seems rather ass-backwards if you ask me.  I would much rather own 100% of my company, hire a programmer to do that work, and use my time to make my own contacts.<p>If you think you have to move to the Valley to make these contacts there's nothing wrong with moving.  People always brag about it being a common everyday occurrence to meet and chat with VC's there anyways. I don't know how true this is, but that's only because I've never been there to experience the environment firsthand.<p>And I'm not belittling the value of YC in any way, I'm just reminding you that there are other ways of doing things than the ways you've conceived.  Whether or not they work for you is up to you to decide.<p>I have a very independent outlook on life and business, so even if this might work well for me it doesn't mean it would work for you or others.  I would actually love to partner with the right people in a new venture, but I won't take the time to seek them out because of two reasons:<p>1- I know I can be successful on my own without them, and if I take time out I will have to sacrifice the progress I'm already making in order to find them, and ...<p>2- Given the unreliable nature of the task of finding a reliable 'partner' I feel it makes more sense for me to just stick to what I've already started, and just keep working on it myself.<p>If the right partner comes along for me that's great, but I won't lose any sleep over it if I have to do everything myself.  I get a lot of support from my wife anyways, and it's probably better support than I might get from another kind of 'partner'.  This may be another reason why I do not agree with some online claims that having a co-founder is so important to the success of a new business.<p>On the other hand, I was launching new ventures years before I met my wife, and going back to ""doing it all myself"" simply doesn't phase me in the least.  I am not one of those folks who need someone else around to keep my energy and focus, that's all.  For better or worse that's just the way I am.",1237780659

National Bureau of Economic Research (Cambridge, MA), 2003 showed that Krueger and Dale aggregated their data in a way that tended to underrepresent the advantage of going to the better college for ALL students, not just low-income students. So if you carefully read the Krueger and Dale study, you can tease out an advantage to the better colleges that they admit is especially strong for low-income students. But they might have found an even stronger effect size if they had analyzed their data differently.<p>Anyway, yes, for low-income students who manage to get admitted the lesson from all studies is clear: go to the best college that admitted you, and take advantage of your opportunity for an elite education.",1237780285

Imagine a bunch of people in a tribe doing something on a beach (I don't know, eating crayfish or something).  All of a sudden a huge explosion erupts on the horizon and the air is filled with a sulphuric stench.  The medicine man/chief/authority figure says 'the gods are not pleased, we should not eat the crayfish'.  They gather up all the crayfish and throw them back into the sea.  The eruptions stop.  Thus : the people stop eating crayfish for fear of upsetting their god.",1237777599

527931,comment,527873,527873,0,0,tempest67,,,"I find it interesting that the reports tend to consistently state that college prestige is indeed important for students from lower income families.  I found that to be enormously true, myself.  I am from a working-class background -- did my undergraduate degree at a state school, and found it boring and, really, a waste of time -- much like high school.  But I also think now that a lot of this was my own fault -- I had no idea how to approach college, and how to really make it work for me.<p>Later, I then did a graduate program at an Ivy League school -- and the scales fell away from my eyes.  The most important thing I learned there, I think, was how successful people work in the world -- how to resourcefully make the most out of every opportunity, how to seize the initiative, how to make connections.  I have the feeling that if I hadn't been brought up in the class I was, I would have inhaled these things at my parents' knee -- as it was, it took me much, much longer than it should have; but it was an enormous lesson, and <i>almost</i> worth the ridiculous student loans I now owe.  ;-)<p>(I am also by no means saying that an Ivy League school is the only place for lower-class kids to learn how to work the world -- far from it!  I was just not talented enough to figure it out myself, and the experience made all the difference in the world for me.)",1237777283

All the bluster and outrage about the employee bonuses is merely because it's been successfully framed as a moral issue and not a financial issue.<p>All crises need a scapegoat and the management of AIG have been rightly or wrongly handed the role.  If each household in the US had been handed an invoice for $5000 to raise the hundreds aof billions to bail out AIG, then the bailout would never have happened.  Yet you can argue the same thing has happened.  And most of the money went to counterparties, like Goldman Sachs, courtesy of Paulson.",1237777233
