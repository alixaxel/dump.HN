529001,comment,528765,528765,0,0,biotech,,,"This article does make a good point. It has been my experience that highway traffic can move more quickly when people do not change lanes. I have seen this happen a couple times in very snowy conditions; the traffic density was such that it should have been stop & go traffic; however, due to the large amount of snow between each lane, everyone pretty much stayed in their lane. This made traffic go at a steady 20-25 mph. (Note that the set of circumstances in which snow can cause traffic to <i>speed up</i> is very rare).<p>The main problem that this article does not address is bottlenecks. Even with a perfect system, it is impossible to keep a constant speed if there is a large influx of traffic at a certain point or the road narrows to fewer lanes.",1237834432

I haven't had a TV in many years, and I've very rarely been a regular TV viewer (I can count the shows I've watched with regularity in the past ten years, before Hulu, on one hand).  Now, there are several shows I watch on Hulu every week.  I'm a customer the networks would have <i>never</i> had.<p>I think the only thing they're doing wrong (from the perspective of convincing me to spend some more of my time with them) is expiring some shows after some period of time.  I sometimes hear a recommendation for a show from a friend, and I'll go to Hulu...they'll have it, but it'll pick up mid-season because early episodes have expired.  So, I skip the whole series.  I don't like to sit down in the middle of a movie...same thing with TV series.",1237831846

Empirically an expiration date on a termsheet is not always evidence that a VC is desperate or dishonest.<p>It's when this idea gets imported into seed funding that it really becomes a problem, because of the synchronous nature of this market.  And it gets worse as the number of seed firms increases.<p>The root of the problem is that people think seed funding is regional.  They think they're starting the YC of St. Louis, or wherever.  Then after they get started they realize that in fact the seed firms are all drawing on the same national applicant pool, and that the default fate of the nth seed firm is not to be the YC of St. Louis, as they'd expected, but to be the YC of the nth quality bucket.  That's a pretty grim situation, and it tempts them to take desperate measures.  The VC market is more fluid, so VCs aren't subject to such pressures.",1237831326

If you (or anyone) come up with a better system of screening individuals for positions, the world will be a much better place. Right now, we typically rely on things like resumes, experience, interviews, etc. which don't really give a good picture.</i><p>There's a solution, but it's radical: a massive push in the direction of social equality, decoupling one's material well-being and lifestyle (somewhat) from one's job position. Right now, the perks associated with a corporate leadership position are so obscene as to create an incentive for the wrong people not merely to put themselves forward for these positions (which could be attributed to a benign overestimation of one's skill) but to actively manipulate the system.<p>Obviously, society needs to encourage and reward hard work, but the mainstream corporate approach is seriously broken. Hard jobs should pay more than easier ones, and high-ranking jobs should only be available to those with sufficient experience and knowledge, but the concept of a job title as a reward for previous accomplishments (work for less than you're worth now, maybe be an overcompensated and famous CEO later) has proven itself to be a practical disaster, in addition to the model's ethical problems.<p>The main reward for a high-power job should be the work itself, so that those who fill the positions are likely to be people who actually want to do the job (and are likely to be good at it) rather than those who want the salaries and status. 95% of Fortune 500 executives are not people who want intrinsically to run companies; they want the perks.<p>Regarding material rewards, that's a matter of ""getting the stakes right""-- not so low as to be insulting (since trivial rewards/costs are less incentive than intrinsic motivations) but not so high as to encourage people to lie about their talents, skills, and work ethics (more than they already do, human nature being what it is).",1237831325
