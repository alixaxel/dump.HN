This is a major operation and carries with it an assortment of long-term health risks to both the donor and recipient (though, obviously, the recipient has essentially nothing to lose; long-term followup studies of live donors are still pretty small and not that informative)...yet the entire article seems predicated on ""you'd be a monster <i>not</i> to give up <i>at least</i> one of your kidneys!"" Where's that attitude coming from, exactly? Why not just toss a lung into the mix as well?",1236959974
514992,comment,514660,514660,0,0,harshavr,,,"I was attracted to this viewpoint, especially as it makes serialization/deserialization easy. But there are good reasons behind using objects (and their dual, abstract data types). Because many times, you don't want some parts of your program to know about the internal fields your datatype has, as the implentation can keep changing all the time.<p>ML which uses ADTs solves this problem nicely. You can just write a module containing the map which implements two different signatures, one signature with the restricted set of fns, and another signature which will expose the map. Regular modules will import the restricted signature, while serialization or database interaction modules can import the map signature.<p>I like PLT scheme's unit system which comes from ML. It is better in two ways, units & signatures are first class values. And, you can use the powerful macro system to get rid of any repeated syntax pattern involved in exposing a map in two different ways.",1236959941

My goal is to keep everything below half what ec2 charges.)   -  Nick finished up the new server and put ordering on last night, it's got 30GB still free.   there are parts for two more 32GB servers in the UPS system as we speak, so hopefully there won't be a gap between when this one fills up and when I get the next one installed.<p>the key to cheap ram servers is twofold.  1. get motherboards with 16 ram slots.   this is changing, but 4gb modules are still more expensive than 2gb modules.  2. get motherboards that support registered ecc ddr2 (not FBDIMM-  they take a whole lot of power)   I use the low-power quad-core opterons.   then don't go crazy on the CPU.  (most of mine are 1.9Ghz bartons.  if you go that route, make sure you don't get a broken stepping.   one of the new servers will be a 2.1Ghz low-power shanghai that just came out.  they are cheap!
