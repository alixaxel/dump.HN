536520,comment,536509,536509,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Does that count as an export?</i><p>Yes.  If you provide a service to people outside of Canada, this counts as an export and is zero-rated (i.e., 0% tax).<p><i>Do I have to register my business in the jurisdiction of wherever I sell (that sounds silly, but I need to know for clarity!)?</i><p>No.  Unless you have a presence in a jurisdiction (approximately defined as ""have an office"", but the exact rules vary -- simply renting a server somewhere doesn't count, though) you don't have to deal with that jurisdiction's sales taxes.<p>As an Ontario company, you'll need to deal with Ontario's RST (for Ontario customers only) and GST (for Canadian customers only).  You don't need to worry about US sales taxes, you don't need to worry about European VATs, and you don't need to worry about other provincial sales taxes (unless you set up an office in another province).<p>Provincial and federal sales taxes are enough to worry about, though -- because depending on how your service is categorized you might have to charge a different sales tax rate or none at all.  I ran into enough ambiguities in the rules that for tarsnap I'm taking the simple approach of not accepting Canadian customers for now -- because the only thing I could be absolutely sure about was that I didn't have to charge any tax to non-Canadians.",1238255799

536518,comment,536132,536280,0,0,cwan,,,"Are you referring to that massive unregulated and unfunded liability known as social security which is supposed to be even better than people saving for themselves?  (Even if people's retirement assets were shaved by 50% - surely this is a better outcome than the likelihood that in 20 years time the US government is going to have to shave benefits by considerably more to pay for all the retired people?).<p>That's the problem with these deficit projections now - things are going to get so much worse in the future with unfunded pension and social security liabilities that aren't reported.  Government reporting is conveniently at a much lower standard than corporate/public reporting or else we'd really be getting worried.",1238255769

536515,comment,536181,536213,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Even if financial and legal incencives don't matter for you, they do matter for many people. If you start rewarding women with money for dumping their husbands (as vaksel implied US law does), many families that were close to the brink will disintegrate and many okay families will move that much closer to the brink. We don't live in a world composed of ideal men and women - that's why we need laws and money in the first place.<p>I find your comment similar in spirit to a common pattern of defending the C++ language against criticism: the idea that, if C++ shortcomings worry you, then the root of your problem is bad design and muddled thinking. It's true, but the language could work to fix the problem instead of making it worse. So too with divorce laws.",1238255566
536514,comment,536132,536280,0,0,anamax,,,"> These people have zero credibility on anything debt-related until they repudiate their party's economic policies under Reagan and Bush II, both periods when it should not have been necessary for the US to radically increase its debt burden.<p>Reagan's spending was during a recession, which is when the standard theory says that govts should go into debt.  I note that the folks on the left didn't want less spending at that time - they wanted far more.  And, they were in a position to cut a lot of spending and refused.<p>As to Bush II, the only opposition from the left to any of his spending increases (other than Iraq) was that it wasn't enough.  Since debt is the difference between revenue and spending, anyone who advocates increased spending when revenues are not increasing even more is advocating increased debt.<p>> Lest we forget they were also a major proponent of social security reform (translation: Republican-championed efforts to invest Social Security funds directly in the stock market in ways that would generate private management fees).<p>Because Ghod knows that a govt worker will always do the right thing and for less.",1238255541

536498,comment,536054,536311,0,0,cwan,,,"I'm not sure how making the argument that blaming regulators who created the incentives and environment for an industry to act against their long term self interest is inconsistent with being libertarian.  What Wall Street did was celebrated by regulators and legislators up until the point they realized that it was a house of cards (which was after its collapse).  Wall Street took the bait - for which I'm not going to deny they have some responsibility over their own destruction - and they have paid heavily financially for that pain (look at financial sector stock prices and how many actually remain),  But to the original point (and the linked post):<p>""A free market in which participants risked their own money might work quite well, but that’s not what we tried.  We had a market in which participants risked other peoples’ money and pocketed much of the upside but suffered no downside risk, all made possible by the government’s regulating away public company shareholder power.""<p>AIG's demise has come rather late in the game.  CDS's are responsible for their massive losses, however CDS's are not responsible for this crisis.  There's a difference here.  However what's infuriating about the response that it is overdone relative to the crisis.  He wants to be able to monitor risks private firms take with their own money and that of their investors.  This is a power grab - since it's not like he only wants these powers for AIG - for something akin to the rogue trading at Barings bank.  AIG's collapse could have been managed.  Most of the business units held by AIG are actually quite profitable not to mention highly regulated.<p>To put this in perspective with respect to legislation, what Geithner could have done if he wanted to have an orderly liquidation or even save AIG was to push for the suspension of mark-to-market which would have allowed AIG not to seek massive amounts of funding to meet _regulatory_ requirements.  AIG was already regulated as an insurer and as a financial institutions.  What Geithner wants extends far beyond preventing what happened to AIG.",1238253860

That's how insurance companies work.<p>And all of this was approved by regulators.  In AIG's case, by both bank and insurance company regulators in the US and (at least) bank regulators from other countries.
