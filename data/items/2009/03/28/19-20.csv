Punning is self-centered, masturbatory humor.  The punster is often not trying to entertain anyone but himself.  He/She's playing a small but pointed gag on everyone listening, often to amuse no one but him/herself.  Understandably, this bothers people. It's self-indulgent humor.<p>2.  People who pun display a mastery and control of the English language that annoys and intimidates others.  It's like guitar players who have the ability to launch off into a flurry of self-indulgent trills and finger-tap patterns.  The other guitar players think it's awesome.  Most people think the guitarist's a wanker.<p>3.  Punning is a form of hacking, and some people are never comfortable with that. The punster hacks the English language to draw connections between words that aren't typically seen there.  A lot of people are made uncomfortable by the idea that words have no meanings of their own, only those that people give them. The pun points this out.",1238270369

536700,comment,536611,536676,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  I bought Brain Age 2 when I got a Nintendo DS, and while it's fun (and some games are more real world useful than others; the music phrase game, for example, is a good little music training tool, and it'd be cool to have a whole suite of similar games), I don't really feel any sense of accomplishment or like I've done anything useful with the time.  So, it sits unused on the shelf, while Korg DS-10 and some homebrew music making software gets a lot of use on my DS.<p>There's probably a really big business opportunity in building software of this sort for home use.  The ""home gym"" market is obviously a gold mine (which is why so many late-night TV shysters are mining it), so this one may potentially be an even better market.  The cost of software is practically zero compared to building real physical gym equipment, so I suspect very few people will continue to drive to a remote location to play these brain games.  One could even do it in a way that it actually teaches real skills in subtle ways (like the music phrase game in Brain Age).<p>Given that brain games aren't even all that graphic or sound intensive, one could even do it on the web.  Though I'm guessing there's call for things like special purpose controllers and such, which would require installable products.",1238270117
536699,comment,536639,536658,0,0,frustrated,,,"There's nothing inherently wrong with fvwm2. I'm sure it was cutting edge back in your day. But it's ridiculously outdated in 2009. You might have learnt to use it, but today's students need to <i>unlearn</i> everything they've learnt. Even if they manage that, it's plain inefficient. By a big margin.<p>Whatever technology you grew up with, you're bound to think of that as the natural interface. That's exactly the point I was making about the professors.<p>There was a time when you had to do typesetting by typewriter. There was a time when all cars were stick-shift. There was a time when farmers had to plant seeds manually. That doesn't mean it's a good idea to do any of those things today.<p>I'm not sure if you were claiming you will learn linux better if you use fvwm2, but that's simply not true.<p>But that is not the main point I'm making. What you need to understand is that no matter what you, the admins or anyone else might think of fvwm2, it's turning away the students in <i>droves</i>. This needs to be stopped.",1238269996

536691,comment,536611,536676,0,0,shard,,,"There may be some parallels to physical exercise.\nInstead of lifting weights or doing cardio, you could do backyard farming or small scale construction, or run to the grocery store.  However such tasks usually come with a minimum work quantity required, so that you don't end up with a half built shed, or running two thirds of the way to the store.  The same with learning a new subject or reading a new book.\nSecondly, the targeting of the exercises may be different than real-world tasks.  For example, it might not be as easy to work both arms equally when gardening as opposed to using dumbbells.\nThird, the short exercises have faster rewards, and therefore is more encouraging than learning a whole new subject.  Motivation is important when it comes to doing certain things, and having to learn new algebra and physics could kill the motivation.",1238269558
