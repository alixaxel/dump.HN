The current, large hurdle in this is color.<p>So, for black/grayscale print, your students might be able to have a printed copy (in addition to electronic) while you still come out ahead, in terms of cost.<p>I mention the consumer class printers really just to emphasize per-page costs and perhaps with regard to one-off copies.  If you are trying to outfit several hundred students, you would probably want to farm the printing (and binding) out to a professional, on-demand printer.  I'm unfamiliar with what happens to color costs in that environment.<p>My main point is that open textbooks may make economic sense, even without dropping a computer in front of every kid.",1237409159

Yeah, maybe on a per-core basis, but you are comparing (like) 8 cores to (like) 240.<p>The basic difference is that the silicon used for hiding memory latency (cache) in a CPU is used for more raw computational power and memory bandwidth in a GPU. So if the data are structured so they fit into the data-parallel paradigm, the GPU will kill a normal CPU. Not because of some magic, but because they were designed to do that.<p>You wouldn't try to run an operating system on a GPU, or a web browser, or whatever. But to say that a GPU only can handle rasterization is to vastly understate the realm of applicability. There are plenty of fp-intensive, data-parallel tasks that fit very well into a GPU paradigm.

I've seen a lot of smoke, but little fire.<p>Anecdotally, I've heard and seen that it helps, and that it hurts. I've seen people praise it as the answer to all productivity problems (along with TDD and ATDD, of course) and I've seen people curse it.<p>My opinion? It's good for leveling out the programmers on a team. If I had 6-8 team members I might have one pair going at all times -- usually the pairing up a weak/new developer with somebody who can help him. But I wouldn't expect productivity improvements -- I'd simply use it as a way of level-setting the team. It seems like a good mechanism for bringing people up to speed quickly.<p>Having said that, you have to let the team be the judge. If they like it, do more of it. If not, don't. Whatever you do, don't let hype and religion get in the way of the team performing. Life is too short to make it miserable by doing something everybody thinks is stupid.<p>Some of the TDD guys are doing ping-pong pair programming.

Fearing the boss antagonizes him on a subconscious (if not conscious level). He doesn't want to be a boss, in most cases. Fearing co-workers can socially isolate you. Careful confidence is one thing, but fear is professionally crippling, and the vast majority of people from middle-class backgrounds have way too much of it for their career's sake.<p>So, to answer your question: I don't personally go to work with fear, but I'm not in a hierarchical environment. I don't know how I would handle one if I went back into one.<p>One other trait I've noticed of Ivy League graduates in the workplace is that they handle grunt work pretty gracefully. You might think the opposite; having come from prestigious schools, they might act as if they're ""too good"" to do menial tasks, but the opposite seems to be the case. They handle it gracefully because it doesn't damage their confidence. (Of course, if you give an elite college grad only grunt tasks for 6 months, he'll leave because he's not learning anything; but that's different from the ability to take on an unpleasant project without getting insecure about being assigned it.)",1237407751

To immerse yourself is to learn.<p>> If you are simply aiming for some eventual goal, and view the process of getting there as a necessary misery, you are setting yourself up for failure.<p>I don't think I'm enjoying the process. I think the solution is to start going to Spanish Language meetups (break out of my one-on-one private tutoring) and maybe just walk around the Hispanic areas in my city and make smalltalk).\nOr maybe the solution is there is no solution - take advantage of serendipity, go with the 'unexpected opportunities' as you say..<p>> studies have elucidated that a lot of language acquisition occurs before/below the level of words and semantics<p>""Impossible, because if you move somewhere foreign, you're going to learn the language unconsciously within 6 months. People who have only lived in the US don't know this. It almost takes no effort. The human brain is good at this sort of thing."" from <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=500969"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=500969</a><p>One of my tutors recommended I buy the Spanish language audiobook and <i>the book</i> and follow-along - much like I see my friend's kids do (and as I did when I was younger - 'when Tinker Bell rings the bell, turn the page'). I could probably even listen to it while sleeping. What's stopping me? Motivation. Why do I want to learn? Do I really want to go through the pain curve of becoming competent?<p>I'm also tempted to buy the Spanish language voice from <a href=""http://www.acapela-group.com/text-to-speech-interactive-demo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acapela-group.com/text-to-speech-interactive-demo...</a> and put in in the background and have it read Spanish newspaper articles to me. What's stopping me? Probably the fact that listening to Spanish news now is very draining energy wise - trying too hard perhaps?<p>Total immersion is the best way to learn. In fact, I now think that toddlers learning language is the <i>best</i> possible total immersion program (e.g. their parents are 1) emotionally invested - encourage anything that represents progress with genuine admiration and smiles - e.g. 'Sigh' for 'Sky' is <i>close</i> enough, to begin - and 2) have the requisite patience and 3) the toddler wants to control/understand his environment [e.g. terrible twos] - so it is his/her incentive to improve quickly - as a side note, maybe that is why 'No' becomes a very common word for parents to utter..).<p>> the Japanese film ""Shall We Dance"" may illustrate this<p>Years ago, I saw the original. Loved it. A favorite, even though I've never watched it again. So much better than the remake (even though I've never seen the remake - I know it can't be as good).
