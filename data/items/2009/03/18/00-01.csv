It's utterly retarded.  He is the classic ""bad cop"" who is off doing shady crap in his free time, punishing perfectly good law-abiding citizens as part of his power trip.  I mean, really, Hank Greenberg was the squeaky-cleanest guy you could find; yeah, there were the backroom deals and whatnot, but that's called ""the old boys' club,"" and nothing that was severely impacting the fate of the global economy.  Leaving AIG in the hands of Marty Sullivan and his gang of idiots, however... Well, we see what has happened; AIG is now so impotent that it is used as a mere pawn by the banks and the Fed.  Spitzer practically shouldn't be allowed to write about this without acknowledging that he created the problem.<p>The problem with politics is ...

Derivative contracts ""spread risk"" but, as we've seen, they don't avoid risk. So what they do is turn the individual risk of corporate bankruptcy into the risk of systemic collapse.<p>That is called an ""externality of production"". Individual companies sometimes don't mind taking gambles that have a downside for people not otherwise involved with them. Much of governmental regulation is specifically for preventing these externalitie from impacting people - this is why banks are regulated, why companies must proper precautions handling toxic materials, why automobile drivers must have insurance, etc.<p>So, ultimately, these kinds of contracts <i>are</i> bad.

If that's unfair, the party it's unfair to is the artist; they're the ones who got ripped off by an artificially low face value.

First, there were a lot of ""concrete assets"" created in recent years. As simple evidence google ""condo glut."" Also, you're right - these business loans are fundamentally different. Unless I'm missing something, they're fundamentally riskier - there's no collateral (overvalued collateral is better than none), and the entity you loaned money to is FAR more likely to simply disappear.<p>As to whether they'll go to better uses - hey - I hope you're right. I hope it helps create more value / helps the economy, etc. However, plenty of people took money ""out of equity"" in loans and spent it on stuff that created value in a similar manner. For instance, there used to be quite a burgeoning business in selling solar panels to homeowners.. many would argue it's good for the environment, adds value to the home, etc. The interesting part here though is that the salesman weren't really just selling solar panels. Their job was to walk the homeowners through how to get the money in a mortgage ""out of equity"" on the always-rising value of their home and collect any tax credits available.",1237335704
