Is there any reason why users don't get those benefits if the ""closed"" source helps provide those alternatives?<p>I note that open alternatives to the Microsoft stack were seen as a good thing, yet alternatives to the Google stack are somehow second class because Google helped.<p>Is it fair to mention that some of the alternatives to the Microsoft stack were developed with some help from Microsoft?",1238212743

He explained an algorithm that does more general matching than tineye and it seemed to work great. One of the demonstrations was a search for a starbucks logo that turned up a bunch of pictures that had a starbucks cup somewhere in them.

Once you have easily scalable renderfarms, you could switch the the somewhat slower (though currently less heavily optimized) raytracing approach, and run almost as many cores per frame as you like. That way the only thing limiting your render time is your budget (not that that hasn't always been true, but your set up makes it sound like there is a ""rock bottom"" limit that you reach before the end of your budget at one hour per frame).",1238210707

536135,comment,535878,536012,0,0,rgoddard,,,"My guess is that this was the cheaper option. It only cost Joel a couple of days and several hundred on the hard drive. What it did not do is interrupt his programmers. As Joel has already described, he is now a grunt worker. His job is to make it as easy for others to do their jobs. Their time is probably worth 10 to 100 times his, because they are the one actually making something that directly results in more sales and money for the company. So all Joel had to do was save a couple of hours of work for the programmers and he would come out ahead.<p>Plus these additional side benefits:
The programmer who was complaining does not feel like he is being ignored.
Joel is now going to upgrade most of their computers, making it better for the entire company. 
So lots of warm fuzzies to go around, leading to happier programmers, leading to a better product.",1238210495

It means that I'm more likely to hit compile after a smaller change before moving on to the next thing.  It means I can iterate more rapidly on my approach to fixing a bug, keeping the issue hotter in my mind.  It means I have half the time to get distracted by something shiny.  Any time you can make the build perceptibly faster, you win big.",1238210392

I have realized that I am probably not going to be an early adopter unless it solves a specific problem in my life.<p>For example, I don't use Twitter right now. I don't have a need to write 140 character messages to the general public. But I have changed in that I now see that Twitter could improve some situations in my life. I could imagine using it to send text messages to all my friends to see if they wanted to grab lunch. I could also see myself getting it if a future boss or coworker used it extensively. So while I could not see much value in Twitter when I first heard of it, I see value in it now.<p>So I am just assuming that I either don't fully understand how I could use Hunch, or I don't really need it right now. That just means I am not going to be an early adopter of their service. I would not say that the service is total crap.<p>Even now I can see some situations where I could use expert systems to make decisions. I remember when my parents got a new car my dad took the cost of the car, the mpg for the car, and the amount that he drove, and used that to find out which car he expected to be the cheapest. I am sure he would be willing to input some numbers into a web page and use the site's recommendation instead of doing all the work himself, assuming he would be able to actually view the decision tree.",1238209729
