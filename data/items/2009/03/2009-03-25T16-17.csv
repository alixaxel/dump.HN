At my work, we get vendors that promise everything, charge a ton and we set up all our data in their product, deliver on less than half of what they claimed and by that point it's too late/expensive to move away from them.<p>It's why I don't trust enterprise vendors.  They make their money of few, very high margin sales.  They claim things like ""support packages"", but really that's just a way to let IT managers pass the blame onto someone else - your users can blame the vendor rather than blaming you (even though you chose the vendor)<p>It's dangerous to work with any company to whom losing you as a client would radically alter their finances.  To illustrate the difference: if I cancel a 37signals-style app at $40/mo, sure they loose money and they don't want that, but it doesn't really alter their financial picture. They don't need to lay off staff or adjust salaries or anything.  If my business terminates our contract for one of our ""enterprise"" packages, that company is losing $50,000+. At that point, they might need to let people go.  Someone is probably losing a huge sales commission that will significantly impact their life.  They're going to do everything to prevent that.  Since actually creating a quality product is difficult, they tend toward lock-in and promises.  So when the IT manager is asked ""why are we still using this horrible product?"" they can say, ""it would cost so much more to transfer out since all our data is in it and we can't get it out without essentially re-doing all that data entry"" and, ""they've promised XYZ that will fix things in 6 months.""  By the 6 month mark, the IT director can pass the blame onto the company saying, ""how was I supposed to know they wouldn't deliver?"" if anyone still remembers.<p>I'm sorry you got snagged by such a bad company, but there are many worse companies out there.  Always beware of any company that can't lose you as a customer. People think that means they'll get good service from them.  Really, it means that they'll use any underhanded trick to keep you on the hook hoping that you won't take the steps to rid yourself of them - for example, once you give functionality, it's very hard to take it back and if we had offered lots of options and moved down to 4 within our firm, we'd never hear the end of it, right decision or not.",1237998653

I have about equally many European ancestors who simply left Europe because they were wretchedly poor, leaving the two countries (Ireland and Norway) that experienced the greatest population loss to emigration experienced by any European countries.

531996,comment,531850,531963,0,0,jawngee,,,"A variety of reasons.  First and foremost, the side effects were typically worse than the benefits.  For example, I was on Effexor XR for a year.  The side effects from that included a lovely bubble sensation in your brain, sort of a cranial pressure that literally feels like your brain is growing too large for the skull it's contained in.  The worst side effect, though, hits when you forget to take it.  You get these things called ""brain shivers"" where moving your eyeballs causes an electric shock sensation in your brain.  The more days you miss, the worse this gets, to the point that you are unable to get out of your bed because the slightest movement of your head results in a mildly painful shock.<p>Zoloft, on the other hand, is much more mild, but didn't really put a dent in it.<p>The benzo's were helpful, but are highly addictive.  I still carry Klonopin around with me for those times when it's real thick, but I only use it as a last resort.<p>The most beneficial thing, for anyone suffering from anxiety, is CBT therapy as it teaches you a set of tools for navigating the anxiety and minimizing the impact of panic attacks.  To me, that's far more sustainable than being a guinea pig for Pfizer.  With CBT, you learn how to tackle it head on and come out on top.  It takes some time, but it's doable.<p>For anxiety, in general, I see the AD's being used until you get to a point with CBT that you can handle it without.  The long term impact of AD's are still unknowns, and their efficacy is constantly challenged.  If you can get control without that dependancy, the better off you'll be.  That's just my opinion though.<p>As for the marijuana, it took some trial and error to discover what worked there.  In the last six months or so, I smoke significantly less than I used to, in fact I haven't smoked probably in the last three months, save a few times at parties or hanging with friends and playing Killzone 2.  It has it's own set of problems though, but in contrast to all the other medications I've been on, it's been the most effective with the least side effects.",1237998239

The cost of hardware is just dramatically higher for most users (an XServe may be nearly cost-competitive with equivalent Sun hardware, but compared to low end white-box or Dell hardware used by most hosting providers for most customers, it's just insanely expensive).  It just wouldn't be possible to run a profitable web hosting venture on Apple hardware.<p>I think we have two customers using Mac OS X.  To put that in perspective, we have over 1500 customers using CentOS or RHEL, and a few hundred using Debian or Ubuntu, and a couple dozen using FreeBSD and Solaris.

The only reason for-profit journals still exist is that (a) they have a big existing audience (everyone reads <i>Nature</i>) and (b) they supply a seal of quality. (If you get published in <i>Nature</i>, people know you're a Big League Scientist and you get tenure faster and/or get more grants.)<p>Point (a) is extremely fragile in the age of the Web. A journal which charges exorbitant subscription fees is one tiny tipping point away from losing its entire audience to a website run from a $9.95 Dreamhost account.<p>Point (b) will be the last stand. And this move from MIT threatens to undermine it, because MIT manuscripts carry prestige, and any venue where they appear gets prestige by association, and those manuscripts will no longer appear in any exclusively-closed journals.<p>Meanwhile, technical book publishers have no pressure to apply at all. None of those books make any significant money for their authors. [1] Far from applying pressure, the publishers of scientific books must <i>beg and plead</i> for contributors to commit to writing chapters, and then those chapters routinely run <i>years</i> late, because book writing is the lowest priority on a professor's calendar. From what I've seen, many of them end up being ghostwritten [2] by postdocs in their spare time, and as a rule postdocs don't have a lot of spare time. It's a miracle that we have any decent graduate textbooks at all. A lot of fields don't, in fact.<p>---<p>[1] Except for freshman-level college texts, which are a weird little monopolistic world of their own. God, I hope MIT's rule applies to those as well. That would be awesome.<p>[2] Okay, that's an exaggeration. Grad students and postdocs get credit for co-writing books and book chapters. That's the least they deserve for doing the majority of the work. ;)",1237997869

Quito vole hunts during the day, and comes inside to sleep on a tower pole of carpet at night. He watches with a proud smile on his face, full of himself after doing a marvelous job vole hunting in the garden.  The other day I visited my friend. I watched Quito hunt and amuse himself during the day, and at night I would walk by him and whisper to him stories.  The night before i was leaving, Quito was laying in the chair I usually sat in.  I sat beside him, he turned belly up, like a U, tail between his legs, paws wrapped around his tail.. GAWD.. soo cute.  I told him the story of his beautiful successful day with this one particular special moment, about a hole in the tree.  Quito was up in the tree eating the bark, and noticed a hole. The hole said, ""Quito eat me"". Quito replied, ""I cannot eat you, you are a hole, you are empty...it will not fill me up.""  The hole replied.. but, I am infinitely filled-up inside... eat me.""  I made sounds of popping the hole into my mouth, and Quito took his paw and quickly tapped my lips,  awww Quito tried to eat the hole, but he could not.  The story distracted and satisfied Quito, he jumped down back to his tower and slept, most likely dreaming of the hole that is infinitely filled-up.",1237996958

As soon as the server sends an HTTP header and data response, it's there on the XHR response. (Also iframes mean memory leak, and possibly 'loading' spinner. Neither of which you get with XHR).<p>You can also do some neat optimizations like decide that a latency of 100ms is ok enough, and so delay sending any data for up to 100ms to see if you can piggy back on the next recv request and reduce the HTTP request count by 1. Also in order to batch up sends.
For example:<p><pre><code>  Without optimization--
  0ms Long polling Recv
  800ms Send some data
  900ms Long polling Recv (After some data was received)

  With optimization--
  0ms Long polling Recv

  900ms Data sent, in Long polling Recv request.</code></pre>",1237996942
