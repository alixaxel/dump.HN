520844,comment,520766,520826,0,0,akeefer,,,"Sure, but people rent movies for $4 without knowing if they'll like it, based solely on reviews.  They buy wine they've never had before for $5 or $10.  They order food for $5 or $10 or $50 from restaurants they've never been to before.  People will even spend $50 or $60 on a game they may or may not like, as long as it's for their computer or their console and not their iPhone.  Life is full of uncertainty like that, and most of it costs way, way more than any iPhone applications do.<p>My point is that people who wouldn't balk at spending that kind of money on something else that they may or may not like/use will freak out about an iPhone app that costs that much, and I really don't think there's any rational reason for it:  it has nothing to do with uncertainty or expected value, but rather people have just been conditioned to expect that apps are free or $0.99 because the app store is flooded with those apps (just like people expect web-apps to be free just because lots of other web-apps are free), and that's a shame since it makes it that much harder for all the developers that are working on making great applications.",1237334013

520835,comment,519844,520015,0,0,olefoo,,,"Obviously I was not sarcastic enough.<p>Look: public infrastructure spending stimulates the economy on multiple levels; directly, through spending on contractors and suppliers (who in turn buy from their contractors and their suppliers) and indirectly by creating public benefits that create new opportunities and enable new industries; and through the fact that it engenders stability (a dam has a lifespan measured in centuries if it's maintained, a functional transportation link is not likely to vanish overnight, and so forth). The thing is that these benefits are diffuse enough (though they are measurable) that no single commercial entity can afford the risk that they might not be able to capture those benefits.<p>The blinkered view that all public spending is automatically evil prevents clear discussion of the possible alternatives. Not all public spending is equal, some projects deliver more overall benefit than others.<p>I guess my take is that those who are strident in their distaste for any public spending are patsies in the hands of the special interests who are trying to capture as much of the benefits of public spending as possible.",1237333506

It was not a startup, so the cash flow from existing business easily supported the one-year timeframe.  (We did the design in our 'spare time' when we weren't busy with day-to-day work.)<p>No industrial design (very utilitarian product, simple molds), and we had someone with a bit of molding experience.  Had to go outside for mold design and construction, of course.  We went with hard steel, single cavity, half a dozen molds all in, but I'd certainly go with aluminum (for the initial production) if I were to do it over again.  I'm thinking we spent just over $100k on mold stuff before we had our first test shots.  Talk about an exciting UPS package!  ;-)<p>Our product didn't require much certification, so we saved there as well.<p>Not only are the first 100 electronic widgets much more expensive, it (was?) hard to get them made because our usual suppliers weren't set up for a low-volume job, and we didn't have existing relationships with the more proto-oriented CM.  I did a lot of soldering that year.<p>It would be much easier today, especially with so many cheap dev/eval/reference kits on the electronics side and the rise of quick turn mold shops such as Quick Parts and Protomold.<p>Hardware is a real blast.

520812,comment,519619,519619,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"The big overlap between mathematics and programming is proof
by mathematical induction. The standard example in
mathematics is proving that<p>1+2+...+n = n(n+1)/2<p>The proof has two parts, first is it true for small values
of n, and second does truth for a large value follow from
truth for all small values.<p>Well, 1+2+3 = 6 and 3x(3+1)/2 = 6, so small n is looking good.<p>What about general n? Can we get the formula for n from the
formula for earlier n, perhaps n-1?<p>Suppose we already knew 1+2+...+(n-1) = (n-1)((n-1)+1)/2 = n(n-1)/2.<p>Adding n to n(n-1)/2 does indeed produce n(n+1)/2 so gives
us the second part and completes the proof.<p>The standard example in programming is writing a fast
sorting routine.  Given data x1,x2,...,xn pick one item,
perhaps x1, as the pivot and work through the data
accumulating two lists, big and little, of data larger than
and smaller than the pivot. Join the sorted versions of
big and little with the pivot in between.<p>The algorithm works because it works for small n as special
cases and works for larger n by breaking the big case into
smaller subcases.<p>A list with only one item is inherently sorted and a list
with exactly two items is easily sorted by swapping them if
needed.<p>A list with n items gets broken into a pivot and two lists
big and little.  Both lists are less than n long. Even in
the lopsided case that one is empty the other is only n-1
long because we have taken out the pivot. So the sorting
routine is going to work because it works for smaller cases,
by just the same logic that underlies mathematical
induction.<p>School mathematics has a misleading focus on
computation. University mathematics is focused on proof.<p>In programming we tend to keep the proofs in our heads and
not write them down. The reason for this is that computers
need a great deal of handholding and babysitting. A computer
program is mostly made of details that spell things out for
the computer in detail. These details are typically
mathematically shallow. Provided we have not made any small
slips with the details the program will work and obviously
so.<p>On the other hand, interesting programs have tricky bits
that are not mathematically shallow. How do you write those?
You need to think like a mathematician writing a proof. You
need to find bases cases and inductive steps.<p>Mathematics and programming are different but mutually
illuminating. There is a very close connection between a
mathematic proof and the explanation of why a tricky
computer program works. Learning how to create mathematical
proofs will help you with writing tricky programs and
vice-versa.<p>The most important example is calculus. Many mathematics
students struggle with calculus. It is a useful exercise
(perhaps for 16 to 18 year olds) to write your own computer
programs for numerical differentiation and for symbolic
differentiation and to get the two to agree as closely as
rounding error permits. Much that is obscure about calculus
then becomes clear.<p>The overlap of mathematics and programming is very clear in
formalisms such as ACL2
<a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/</a> which use a
computer programming language as a logic in which
mathematical theorems are stated and proven. The ACL2 book
is excellent, but alas, it assumes a university level grasp
of meta-mathematics. I fear that the book the poster seeks
has yet to be written. Perhaps some-one on HN will take up
the challenge?",1237331934

Power has become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the rich,  and now there's only one part of society to blame for the economic crisis.<p>Yes,  the UAW plays a role in the problems of the US auto industry.

You can't blame unions for AIG,  Lehman Brothers,  Bank Of America,  Merrill Lynch,  CDOs or the housing bubble.<p>I'm sick and tired of the ""Atlas Shrugged"" fantasies that many people have.  Most billionaires are billionaires because they own large blocks of stocks in public companies.

(ii) There's a large population of people who have money to spend on goods and services.  Mass prosperity is the trunk of the tree that holds the rich up.
(iii) People do work in their companies that creates a stream of revenue.<p>I'm no communist.<p>Capitalists play an important role in deciding where resources can be profitably used.  The root of the financial crisis is that the financial system is no longer capable of performing this crucial role.<p>Capital and labor need to be in balance.

The number of dollars spent buying stocks has to equal the number of dollars made selling stocks.  It's simple math.<p>The average return on investment across the economy equals the rate of growth of GDP in the long term:  where can you get the returns from?  from changing the way that wealth is partitioned in the economy.  Some inequality of wealth creates an incentive for people to work and invest -- but the game ends when all of the money is in one person's pocket,  just as it does in the game of monopoly.<p>We've managed to fool ourselves in the last decade by (i) taking on unsustainable debts,  and (ii) stealing from ourselves as workers in the name of (imaginary) returns that we thought we'd benefit from when we're retired.
