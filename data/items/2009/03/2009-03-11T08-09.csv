511482,comment,511254,511254,0,0,dantheman,,,"The problem is that the notion of an income tax is considered a legitimate way of funding the government. In reality the government should be funded by property, sales, and tarrif taxes (not protective tarrifs, just a fee to offset the cost of government).<p>The current income tax we have now is worse than the serfs had, @least they only had to work 1 or 2 days on the fields for no pay.  We have to do that on our income, let alone all the other taxes and fees we need to pay.",1236761653

Are you planning on selling the app yourself once it's developed? If you were then you need to evaluate both options and decide for yourself (or with more input from HN after more details are given) which is the best choice.<p><i>2. What are the disadvantages of selling the IP rights?</i><p>You can't make your app again, for yourself or anyone else. You might not even be able to use certain functions of code you've written for the app in any new apps you wish to create, depending on how the contract is written. Get a good lawyer for this.<p><i>3. Why would they be after the IP of this software?</i><p>To protect them from competition down the road. They want to make sure that you don't re-sell your app (or future derivatives of said app) to other companies while they are working on profiting with this app.<p><i>4. If I do decide to sell the IP rights, how much should I charge for it? How is this calculated?</i><p>This really depends on what the app is, what it's worth to you, what it's worth to them, and if an agreeable middle can be found. Try to guess how valuable this app is to them based on what they sell, and how well this app will add to their bottom line. There may also be lawyers that specialize in IP pricing.<p><i>5. What is a good model for a working arrangement between my company and this other company?</i><p>I would suggest having your company produce for their company as a client. Don't let them buy you. Let them buy your product. They may try to reel you in as a contractor or even employee. Just remember to operate with them as a representative of your company. This keeps your options open down the road.<p><i>6. It was suggested to me that I sell the IP rights, then have a contract stipulating the price of each feature they want built. Is this a good idea?</i><p>Well, the less ambiguity in a contract the better. I don't have any information about your app or the company, so I can't judge them. I would probably negotiate with them, saying: you can buy this unfinished app as is, with no support, and then hire me as a consultant if you need help finishing it, or you could buy this app with future developments built in to the contract price. Make sure that it is cheaper for them to spend more now, than to just buy the minimum.<p>Goodluck! I hope that helped!",1236761646

The people who make more money (including those who 'made off like bandits' like you say) were already taxed for their earnings.

Isn't it a matter of plain innumeracy? $1 trillion = 1E12 dollars, 300 million Americans = 3E8 persons, and hence that is only approx. 3 grand per person, like you mentioned. This is basic arithmetic. It's not even a problem of economic illiteracy, though economic illiteracy is a serious problem which allows demagogues to manipulate the masses easily.

You receive tax breaks for disabilities, children, educational spending, and charitable donations. Corporations would be taxed at 30%, but owners could take profits without being double taxed. Corporations could also receive up to 50% tax breaks through charitable works and/or donations (provides tax incentive for community projects, being 'green', or donating to a cause).<p>It all seems reasonable to me. Maybe I'm missing something. This would also simplify the complicated and bloated tax code we currently have.

They are, by a number of definitions. At even a simple flat tax the rich are paying more than others, because they earn more. Now we add progressive rates so 'the rich' pay a higher percentage of what they make.<p>Do they receive more of the benefit from their tax dollars? Probably not. National defense protects just about all citizens equally, public schools are hit and miss with tax dollars per student (which may be irrelevant because of private schooling for those who can afford it), and public services like libraries, roads, and protection are not distributed according to who pays more (except when you have higher income communities). If anything the rich receive less benefit per dollar taxed from them than any other group.<p>Now I'm all for helping out those in need, and giving those who don't earn as much a tax break, but in terms of justice and equality I think our tax system unfairly burdens the rich.
