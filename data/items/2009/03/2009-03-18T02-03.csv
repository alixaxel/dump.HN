Also I do understand why people use the enhanced reflex ones, because they can use those traits to startle an audience effectively.<p>Personally, from a startup perspective, I'd be more inclined to go with a shambling type zombie, purely because keyframing the animation can be achieved fairly effectively with python scripts and then motions adjusted with bezier curves on an individual basis.<p>Doing more with less basically.<p>Also, stylistically I think the whole ""tortoise and the hare"" effect with fast protagonists and slow moving, shambling antagonists is quite amusing.",1237345154

After we recover, possibly if, companies like AIG that are single points of failure need to be broken up.<p>I don't know if this is practical or not, but what if future regulation were aimed at limiting the total size/amount of money/whatever that a company is allowed to own with the goal of keeping risk distributed enough so that we wouldn't fear letting bad companies fail?<p>They'd also have to monitor board membership and stock ownership to ensure you didn't end up with hundreds of companies being virtually one giant company behind the scenes all following the same bad policies.<p>I'd imagine this isn't all that dissimilar to dealing with monopolies.  Too little competition is bad and now we've learned that allowing any single point of failure is just as bad.<p>As all hackers know, single points of failure are risky, even if a crash is unlikely.

521054,comment,521008,521008,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I voted no, because I don't really like zombie movies on balance. But I am a lover of film and cinema in general.<p>My beef with zombie movies is that they're usually cliche, and are going for ""cheap scares"" first and foremost. Often they're punctuated by gore for the sake of gore, and it's done tastelessly. Frequently there's a large cast that you feel no real attachment to and don't bond with, because they need lots of people to kill in a variety of ways.<p>But the upside: Apocalyptic scenarios in general give lots of options for plot and character development and interaction. I'd say take a look at something like Mad Max - it's a bit campy at times, but I remember some very interesting scenes. There was a relatively small cast that you developed some attachment to, and the sometimes slow pacing made the heavy action scenes really stand out.<p>Off the top of my head, I can't think of a zombie movie with really exceptional acting and minimal cliches. (If someone who is a fan of this genre can recommend one, I'll check it out). What I'd want out of a zombie movie is focus on character development of just a few people who interact with a broken world. And the filmmaker resisting the temptation to have the ""dumb, defiant, big-boobed blond girl who doesn't listen to the leader and thus gets impaled on a fence and eaten"" - the zombie scenario itself isn't unsuitable for a good movie, but the execution in these films leaves a lot to be desired.<p>For inspiration into some unique elements, you might check out the first two Fallout games. It's been a few years and I've not checked out the third, but the first two had some interesting scenarios and plots. In particular, humans interacting with other humans during the apocalypse/zombies could lead to interesting dilemmas and development. In Fallout, the world had fallen apart, and yet there were still people being really petty and villainous instead of uniting. This jives with my understanding of human nature, and makes the games more interesting. Human/human conflicts amidst a zombie background could be a fascinating way to break from the cliches.",1237344422

Realistic and accurate images were then displayed in the Optical View Sight and SLR RCD (Radar Correlator Display) in the RSO cockpit.

The wrinkles are that it isn't a standard tournament bracket point structure, and nobody is sharing their algorithms.<p>The point structure is that each person picks 8 of the 64 teams. For every game that those 8 teams win, the person gets the team's seed added to their point total. This makes the team selection a very, very interesting exercise: pick a high seeded team and be very confident of getting a few points, or pick a lower seeded team and risk getting no points, but perhaps win the whole thing with that one team.<p>I bought a copy (price: one starbucks coffee) of 24 seasons worth of data from a dependable source (he knows i'll poison his next coffee if he made a mistake). Now the issue I'm grappling with is that he and I both know we have the same data, so a game theory element is added.<p>For those who are interested, it turns out that 3 seeds and 6 seeds have historically done fairly well, and I've cooked up some rationalizations that I like for why this might be the case, but then we'll just see what happens this time around.",1237342363

Parenting is likely the best way for a person to  learn how to parent (though supplementing reading, mentoring, and so on will likely be even better), but reading a scientific study is going to give you a more accurate concept of the mental and emotional capabilities of children in general than your experiences parenting a single child (or several).<p>As the saying goes, the plural of anecdote is not data.",1237342010

You have an entire lifetime, just like you shouldn't be exposed to a huge dose of radiation, you shouldn't expose yourself to a huge dose of mercury, because fish contain mercury (and my lack of eating fish has likely balanced out any mercury I was actually ever exposed to) and if you eat tons of fish, sucking on broken thermometers and breaking florescent bulbs might just get enough mercury into you to make you nuts... although if you're purposefully exposing yourself to raw mercury to begin with I believe it's probably a moot point.",1237341850
