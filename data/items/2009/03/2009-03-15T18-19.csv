I didn't read the paper, but I watched a debate on television. The main thing that changes is that Switzerland drops the distinction between tax evasion (not mentioning some of your money) and tax fraud (forging documents). Now both are illegal.<p>This article is weird, it quotes the times of london as its source and gets the capital of Switzerland wrong (it's Berne, not Zurich).",1237143409

Over the years political reporting has cut down on the politicians' own words and created an important role for journalist as meta-politician, an intermediary between citizen and politician.<p>We read the newspaper to find out what Labour say, what the LibDems say, what the Conservatives say, and instead we get the journalists version. If it is just neutral reporting we could go instead to the parties websites and get their views directly. If the political news has been spun by the journalist we are more strongly motivated to go to the websites to get the news straight from the horses mouth. The journalist owes his position in the system due to the need to own and operate expensive printing presses in order to disseminate information.<p>I've been making this point for a few years and at first it was a pretty stupid point. The websites of the political parties were crap. But my point makes sense, and on checking again today I find the websites are much improved.",1237143346

They're obviously crucial towards building any sort of reasonably complex application in Javascript.<p>It's hard to find the analogy - I tend to think of the transition from Asm-to-c. A lot of hardcore machine language believers complained at the lack of controls and speed they had to endure when using C.

517026,comment,516829,516829,0,0,shader,,,"Unfortunately, the reason that we are in this recession is that people took too much risk. We have been living with a net negative national savings rate for a while now. That consumption of capital is partly what has allowed this downturn to occur. We need to be saving now more than ever.<p>Also, there is no paradox of thrift. When people save, it does not mean that they do not produce, merely that they are refraining from consumption. And at a savings rate of five percent, we are hardly refraining at all.<p>Normally the higher savings (refrain from consumption, higher interest in future goods over present ones) would cause businesses to invest more in longer term production, i.e. making more future goods. Thus a higher savings rate is responsible for a higher future standard of living, and more risk taking. So attacking the savings rate and saying that we shouldn't be so careful is a terrible idea.<p>That said, businesses are still likely to take too much risk because of the low interest rates. The way that the higher interest in future goods signals the companies is normally through lowering interest rates, which the federal reserve has done recently even though there has not been a corresponding increase in savings. This imbalance between business expectations and actual consumer desires is what causes booms and busts.<p>So please don't tell me to be risky with my money. I'm not saying that taking advantages of opportunities is a bad idea. I like the idea of being an entrepreneur myself. But telling us that a five percent savings rate will cause our depression to get worse is like telling a sick person that taking a 15 minute nap will make them more sick.

This is because my grandma is not very money-wise and is especially vulnerable to that kind of thing. I doubt she is particularly unique in this respect among grandmas.<p>Do you see the problem here? Do you perhaps realize why I might want to discourage salesmen like that from coming in contact with my grandma? Look, it's just a guy selling a book, right? If my grandma decides that she needs it then that's up to her, right?<p>Why is it hard to understand that there are people out there who can be taken advantage of legally but shouldn't be? There is a point when you cross the line from providing value to taking unfair advantage of others. It's reasonable in the latter case to call it a scam, ebook or no ebook.",1237140263

I'm not sure what that was my reaction, but I think it is the layout of the ""New & Interesting"" which looks about like a domain squatters link operation. Maybe if it was somehow integrated with the billboard above it wouldn't look pasted in.<p>Second, the billboard frightens and confuses me. Giant popups shoot out when I roll over the buttons at the bottom, but I can't seem to click on the buttons. The buttons hilight green to show they are active, but they won't click.<p>I see a screencast button, but I eschew those because I like to go at the speed of reading.<p>I can't see enough without an account to bother creating an account.<p>I suspect many of your features require an identity to function, like listing my equipment. Perhaps you could just create the identity as a cookie on me, then when I decide to create an account associate it at that point.
