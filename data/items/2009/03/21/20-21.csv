I switched from Firefox to Chrome about a month ago; I think Chrome's interface is much nicer, and it <i>is</i> faster than Firefox. The two major drawbacks of Chrome for me were:<p>- no extensions for Chrome (I miss Adblock and Flashblock)<p>- Linux edition not available (I'm waiting for the beta to come out)<p>If it weren't for Google's promises to come out with extensions and a Linux version, I wouldn't have switched.<p>The main advantage Firefox previously had was that it's so much better than IE. Now it has to be better than IE <i>and</i> Chrome; this is a pretty high barrier to dominance.",1237669151

526602,comment,526341,526341,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"This post seems to basically be ""I love rails and ASP.NET is not Rails so it's inferior.""  Now I'm not saying the author is wrong for loving Rails, just that there was no way ASP.NET MVC could win in a rigged game so the comparison doesn't hold much weight.<p>To be a tad more specific...<p>1.  A few of his issues are just wrong.  The MVC team has been very open about including the community and taking contributions for example.<p>2.  A lot of the author's comparisons are unfair because he's comparing a product that essesntially had it's first official release a few days ago to Rails.  So complaints like ""the community is too small"" or ""Microsoft might kill the project as a cost cutting measure"" are not fair<p>3.  A lot of his arguments are really the age old static vs dynamic language debate.  I won't open that can of worms now but needless to say both sides have valid opinions.  So it isn't fair to ding C# for that.<p>4.  On another point Rails is what most call ""opinionated software"" while ASP.NET strives to give a lot of choices.  So dinging ASP.NET for allowing the programmer to choose an ORM package that fits their needs doesn't seem really fair (Microsoft does provide one in the form of the Entity Framework)",1237669081

526577,comment,526145,526145,0,0,jballanc,,,"Ugh, really? Perhaps the author hasn't checked the latest market share statistics for Internet Explorer? If FireFox couldn't kill IE when it was the technologically superior browser, then why would Chrome kill Firefox?<p>I'll tell you why: Google has lot's o' cash and just might start paying OEMs to install Chrome in place of IE. That's something that Mozilla can't do (at least, not on the same scale as Google), and most people use the browser that's installed for them anyway. So what should Mozilla do?<p>Well, here's a thought: once Google starts paying OEMs to install Chrome, Microsoft is going to have to take a long, hard look at what they're doing in the browser space. Once they do that, they'll find there's no compelling reason to keep draining resources into the black hole that is Trident. That leaves them two choices: WebKit or Gecko. WebKit might be the obvious choice, since it would bring them close to feature parity with Chrome, and isn't controlled by an ex-arch-nemesis.<p>On the other hand, the Mozilla foundation <i>could</i> write a couple of nice, soothing, ""I'm sorry for that whole anti-trust litigation deal"" letters to Ballmer. That way they could swap one sugar-daddy (Google) for another (Microsoft), give Microsoft the rendering engine they so desperately need, and continue to develop XUL and Firefox off on their own.",1237668289

526574,comment,526334,526334,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Use 3rd party stuff cautiously. I think ""never use 3rd party stuff"" is a little extreme, but remember that when you pick up the tool, the tool picks you up too. (Sorry -- watched too much Yoda) That is, you may want the tool for 1 or 2 really cool things, but the tool may demand out of you a week of playing around, pain and suffering, and a dedication that your spouse doesn't get.<p>One rule I use is that when I pick something up, I make sure that I can google help whenever I need it. If Joe-Bob's awesome language or widget set has only 47 people using it, and you have to put up with abuse on an IRC channel or buy 15 books just to get respect from the community -- forget it.<p>Wise choice of tools also means your cognitive load decreases. You simply don't have to remember so much crap anymore. Problem remembering how to attach events to an element in Javascript? Ten seconds with Google and you've got your answer.  There's a certain tipping point that products reach. Be careful using stuff before acceptance grows to that point.<p>That's _platform-ish_ stuff. Tools, widgets, languages and such. For whatever you're actually <i>doing</i>, consider rolling your own stuff. Most times you only need a small subset of functionality, and if you're a good coder it's as easy to write it as use somebody else's. Plus, you understand what's going on. Many times I've used stuff with open source code only to spend hours plugging through their code trying to figure out what the heck they were trying to do. That hurts. Don't do that if you can help it. Sure it's great to modify OSS, but it's probably just as easy to spend that time learning more about the technical problem domain.<p>For instance, I'm playing around with the idea of writing another web app. I took a look at YUI -- I really like it. But at the end of the day, so far at least, it does a whole lot of stuff that I don't need, and payload size is important to me. So I'm just going to roll my own stuff. You're always weighing future hassle against productivity. Sometimes, like with learning functional programming or picking up COM or something, the rewards may be much greater than the hassle. But for most stuff, like version control, project planning, configuration, deployment, setup, etc -- you don't have the luxury of taking 3 days to figure some of these tools out.

I personally love figuring out new systems, and starting to work in new unknown environments. Yes it takes a lot of time to figure things out, but when you have done it enough times (figured out 3rd party software), you get a feel for it, and can draw the right conclusions on how a program works fast.<p>Inexperienced troubleshooters often enter the work with pre-concieved notions of how the system works and hold on to them for too long. Always doubt your knowledge.<p>I think it usually takes 1-2 days with a system until you start to get our bearings. Before that, you are just collecting data, random tidbits of how the system works.<p>I second the recommendation to use recommended libraries, and I love github for the code network analysis. Back when I did a lot of java development there was often a java library available which solved the problem available on the internet even for a specialized problem, but more often than not it turned out to be a completely shit implementation that needed to be replaced. Of course there are good java libraries, the trick is to know someone you can trust who can recommend libraries.<p>OTOH for some rails tasks that can be resolved by just adding a plugin the quality of the code doesn't matter much, since it's just a few lines of code configuration. Still a good library is much better than a bad. I wish there was some kind of leaderboard, or official plugin list for rails, it can be very hard to judge plugins for a newbie.",1237667899

I was hoping to get a trial going with their subscription quickie form builder but couldn't figure out how to get return data. I'm sure this is possible, but it all seemed more like it was setup for magazine subscriptions than for online subscriptions.<p>2. Zuora is a company that keeps getting mentioned on TechCrunch and had given me the impression it was subscriptions done right, where right is simple API and simple setup. On investigation, they're only open for private beta and they seem more like a ""solution"" provider where you're going to have to talk to a salesperson to get anywhere.<p>3. If you mention Zuora on twitter you will be contacted by a company called Aria Systems. In order to see their API they will say they ""need a signed NDA as our API's are mature proven and we guard them like the family jewels.""<p>4. Spreedly seems a little bare bones but is the only company out of that bunch that seems to share my sensibilities.<p>I would love to hear an authoritative answer.
