You update things, you create things, you delete things, you replace things. Wonderful stuff.<p>But as soon as your application steps beyond that, you're sunk.

How can it be insulting to offer a percentage which wasn't even in the initial agreement?</i><p>Maybe you're thinking about it in the wrong way.  If you were to commission somebody to create a painting, you wouldn't paint over his or her name, scribble your own over it, and try to take credit for the work, would you?  Even if you bought an unsigned piece of artwork for investment, you wouldn't go around telling people you created it, would you?<p>Sometimes it all boils down to something as simple as respect or attribution.  If this desktop app is the next big thing, the coder probably just wants to at the very least make sure that he gets some kind of acknowledgment for his work.  For some, acknowledgment can be as simple as ensuring nobody rips off their code and reverse-engineers it, and stamps a different name on it.  For others, it is about monetary compensation.<p>I don't know what this dude's deal is, but of all the factors in your little moneymaking scheme, having the ability to write working code is probably the most valuable.  10 percent doesn't seem like a very equitable exchange.",1237650379

Nothing overly noticeable anyway. In fact, they advocate learning and using mostly keyboard shortcuts which is handy.<p>However on the animation side (different kettle of fish understandably) it has a vastly superior workflow and I can produce content at a faster rate, which I would estimate to be 2x faster?<p>But really, the difference in price between Blender (free) and Maya (starts at $2k per license) and many of the other Autodesk (Autocad starts at $4k, 3DSmax at about $3k) the difference in price is astounding.

526223,comment,524956,525906,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"You make good points that I partially agree with, however I still don't believe this is optimal for a few reasons.<p>End-user design is about creating a usable experience and often deriving an emotion to make them want to do it again, a process that relies on color <i>combinations</i>, layout, typography, etc. -- the complete package. I'm less attached to GOOG webapps because they lack subtle things such as sound feedback. I've found sound to be critical in software usability, far more important than very minor color discrepancies. That is, when software goes outside of very basic operations, and requires more attention from the end-user.<p>(Fighting about the shade of blue makes me puke in my mouth at the thought of such a corporate cliche).<p>Furthermore, this type of color testing would need to be extended to cover cultural differences to be truly effective. Colors will trigger completely different responses in China, Japan, France, etc, often the exact opposite of American counterparts.<p>Honestly, I think the engineers have a place AFTER a design has been released and there is data to mine and analyze that takes into account the entire product presentation as a whole. Interjecting them in the design process too soon and giving their opinion overriding power is a mistake. It's akin to slapping memcache on your back-end before you've done an ounce of optimization on your queries.",1237650251

526221,comment,526120,526156,0,0,ratsbane,,,"REST simplifies web applications because it works with the behavior built into the different levels of the web infrastructure.  Browsers pop up a dialog box if you try to go back to a page requested with a non-idempotent method (anything but GET or HEAD).  Caching servers treat non-idempotent requests differently from idempotent requests, etc.<p>Understanding what REST actually means and whether something is RESTful isn't always obvious.  To me it means use the appropriate HTTP method as defined in the RFCs; use the URL, including query string, as the sole resource descriptor; use the request body only to contain new information.  I get a bit tripped up over what I understand to be Roy Fielding's objections to maintaining state through cookies - I continue to do that, but with a vague feeling of unease that I'm missing something.",1237650019

Some people print at home because it's instant and cheaper and there's no shipping cost. But there's plenty of reasons to order 2D prints online instead, including different materials, potentially higher quality, and lower up-front costs.<p>The 3D printing concept seems like it works even better than 2D printing as a made-to-order service; it's more dependent on materials, a fancier machine will be able to make better stuff, you probably don't need it instantly, and shipping costs will be relatively smaller.",1237649939

The areas redeveloped were full of impoverished people, BUT the areas were not redeveloped FOR the impoverished people.  Generally, those people were moved out to section 8 housing, (rentals), and new people would come in.  People who were decidedly non poor.  Then, of course, those people started to default on their mortgages and the rest is history.  Witness the downtown condo boom that happened across the US.  Then witness the downtown condo bust that is happening presently.  Been to Chicago or Miami lately?<p>So, in short, the developers never sold their condos to ""ex-strippers on work release and Taco Bell clerks"".  They sold them to retirees, empty-nesters, and a crapload of yuppies and speculators.

Advice like this will suddenly put this person in your view as negative, despite the fact that ""mr. know-it-all"" is a very hardworking employee who is extremely loyal to your company.

Sewing as a young kid, 3D printing as I got older.<p>As someone who owned and learned how to use a sewing machine at the ripe old age of 10, I can't help to find fault in this guy's argument.<p>Admittedly I was building Rokkaku's, Speedwing Stacks and Parafoils out of ripstop nylon and carbon fibre (well, the parafoils didn't use carbon fibre), but that's not the point.<p>I recently looked into 3D printing for producing components for another hobby of mine (tabletop wargaming) and the fact is that it is stupidly expensive at the moment in terms of both purchasing a machine or getting someone to print for you. I ended up just learning to sculpt and scratchbuild with polystyrene card.<p>Now to address some of his points.<p><pre><code>  1. when someone develops a 3D modeling application that anyone can use and many can master\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.blender.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blender.org</a><p><pre><code>  2. when someone develops a post consumer recycled 3D printing material\n</code></pre>\nI'm fairly sure you can recycle acrylic and print with acrylic, so where's the disconnect there? My chemistry isn't up to scratch so can someone please clarify?<p><pre><code>  3. when printing metal and circuits becomes cheap    \n</code></pre>\nGot me there, I never researched printing either of these things, so I can't comment.",1237648066

I would think many more copies of word processing packages are in active use than was ever the case for typewriters. Word processing is several orders of magnitude easier than typing and as a result it's an incredible success. If a 3D printer allows you to pick a design from the web, click on the 'fab' button and start using your new product within the day, expect them to sell like hot cakes when the price drops.",1237647841

Granted we probably don't need as many plastics as we currently have, but even a single polymer like Lexan would need to come in many colors. These colors also also impacted by ""flake"" material being included to introduce reflectivity and a variety of other special effects. Also, the nature of molding something allows you to have certain material properties that cannot be achieved through additive fabrication.<p>Of course, we could move to metal for some product categories, but cost becomes an issue there as well, you might be willing to pay more for a one off object, but 20X as is the norm now?<p>Regarding the superficial nature of most clothing customization, you are correct that most offerings only allow you to change graphics, but Walmart has a tremendous business along those lines. Also, next generation startups like www.propercloth.com are allowing more customization in fit and function.<p>In any case I think we both have valid points and there is only so much we can accomplish on a message board. If you are ever in Boston give me a shout.",1237647620
