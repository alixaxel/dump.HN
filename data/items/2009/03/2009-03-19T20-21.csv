523986,comment,523108,523963,0,0,snprbob86,,,"Python's generator expressions let you get the common 90% of what you would do with Linq. Generator expressions, however, quickly become awkward when nested and don't really support joining or grouping data. Python has a groupby method and similar helpers, but they simply aren't as natural as the SQL-style syntax. Also, Linq puts the object being queried first to make it toolable (IntelliSense can offer completion for members in where and select clauses, etc).<p>I don't know much Ruby, but I'd suspect that blocks can simulate Linq far better than Python can. However, the Lambda-inspired syntax is a bit cluttered when compared to the SQL-inspired syntax.<p>Linq is a feature about 3 things:<p>1) Correctness via static typing checks<p>2) Interoperability of various data backends (Microsoft provides backends for XML, SQL, and .NET objects)<p>3) Clean and beautiful code<p>Neither Python nor Ruby can provide #1 (at compile time, anyway). SqlAlchemy and other projects attempt #2, but I don't have enough experience with them to comment on their success. And while Python as a whole (and I presume Ruby) has lots of #3, complex data querying is not the most beautiful experience.",1237496336

Why should we have to deal with inferior forms if we paid for it?<p>We are entitled to the right to assess how well our government is doing AT EVERYTHING it does. And we generally will need data to assess, otherwise we have to trust what they tell us blindly.

This man makes 400,000 a year!""<p>Of course college doesn't guarantee that you'll come out making $100k a year or more, but also NOT going to college is the same.<p>As happy as I am for this person, I hope no one gets the wrong idea from these posts and just drops out. Having an idea is one thing, putting it together and having it be a success is another. If anything, I would say the YouTube and Facebook guys had it right, they made the product during college, released it during college, succeeded during college, and subsequently left college. Thats the way to do it IF ANY.<p>And for some people, school just isn't there thing. Anyways I'm rambling, I think my point has been made.",1237493545
