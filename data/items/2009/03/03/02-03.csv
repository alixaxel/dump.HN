So, with my indicator, we're all doomed.<p>Using Dow's transportation notion, we might look at the number of new truck driver certifications as a leading indicator of the market.  However, looking at the certification rate for Freightliner vehicles (a non-existent certification, but fun to think about) is more likely a measurement of the relative importance of that brand of truck than anything macroeconomic.  And, rather than looking at certifications, why not look at number of truck miles driven, number of truck tires purchased, etc.  Shouldn't Cringly be looking at Cisco's sales data for routers instead?<p></i> I know nothing about their numbers today!",1236049190

The income threshold over which a family is a net contributor to the government probably isn't much about $60K.  So, importing just about anyone with a skill would lead to a lower tax burden for all.  And, it would improve the lives of the lowest paid Americans by creating more demand for basic services (house cleaning, lawn mowing, etc.)<p>I understand the labor unions' reluctance to allow unskilled immigration, but they ought to press toward allowing more skilled people as it would increase the demand for their members' services.  Interestingly, I think most unions are now in favor of legalizing illegal immigrants -- kicking out 10M people seems undoable, so they're best served by eliminating the illegal, un-unionizable underclass.",1236048458

This is a HUGE cost for start-ups and for clients to swallow, once the true cost is explained to them.<p>Just supporting the way various sub-versions of IE6 inconsistently handle cookies is a nightmare, and in many cases lead to unsolvable issues. This costed a client of mine real $$$$ to discover, and less than 20% of their audience used IE6. Less than 15 people actually complained about the issue.<p>IE 7 isn't quite as bad, but it still adds a measure of time to front-end development efforts. I would estimate it in the range of 10-20%, depending on how complex the interface is.<p>On two recent projects, we dropped IE6 support, with virtually no push-back from a general-use audience. IE6 is almost 8 years old. Most people don't keep their cars that long, and can understand that an old crusty browser is not going to perform as well.<p>The only place where I would be hesitant to drop IE6 support is on marketing sites (where you need to entice someone to a call-to-action within the first 30sec-1min) and on e-commerce sites, where every dollar counts.",1236047497

The Taiwanese have a proverb, ""Better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a buffalo,"" and they strongly value being business owners rather than employees of large organizations. In the 1980s, the development pattern of Taiwan and Korea, otherwise rather comparable countries, was quite different because most Taiwanese worked in small, family-owned enterprises while most Koreans worked in giant industrial conglomerates.<p>Today, Taiwan's economy is HAMMERED by the worldwide recession, but I think the response will be to find more ways to do more entrepreneurial business formation, and Taiwan will be all right.
