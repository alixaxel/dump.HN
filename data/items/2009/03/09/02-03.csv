Or one in which more drugs were legal?<p>As various other commenters have pointed out, between prescriptions, over-the-counter pills, vitamins, and additives in the foods we buy, we're all drug users. This whole argument seems to rest upon an absolutist view that all currently illegal drugs are absolutely destructive and have no merit.<p>Countries like Singapore and China have radically different ideological approaches to policy than most Western nations. They are comfortable enforcing absolutist positions that limit individual freedoms. Such a position is against America's founding principles.

My info is that  they are currently losing the fight as the growth is happening at the bottom of the economic pyramid.  China has a clear history of what opiates can do to their country.  The other stuff takes a back seat as they fight other problems, like clean water.<p>As for Singapore.  There are lots of things that Singapore does that do not scale well to other societies.

I think that people using drugs should talk to people as much as people thinking about killing themselves, because with drugs you can go too far, but that's not the same thing as thinking that the people using drugs are bad people.

This results in your C methodology providing significantly less functionality as compared to reference counting.<p>Moreover, Objective-C's reference counting rules are logical, consistent, and short.<p>- All objects are allocated with a reference count of 1.<p>- All objects will be deallocated when their reference count reaches 0.<p>- If you receive an object reference that you did not allocate, and you wish to maintain a reference to that object beyond the current scope, you must increment the reference count. Doing so will ensure that should the object's reference count be decremented elsewhere, the object will remain valid.<p>- If you allocate an object or increment an object's reference count, it will not be deallocated until you decrement the reference count.<p>Those rules -- coupled with utilities such as NSAutoreleasePool -- permit simple, language-wide ownership invariants.

You'll always have people saying they don't like this or that about the design, but at the end of the day if that's all they are complaining about you are doing the right thing. If not, prioritze other complaints first. Content is still king.<p>The main goal of the site should be to get good content in the door and get it distributed to the users. Additionally, before you make any user interface changes from feedback such as the OP, definitely do a few ad-hoc user tests with friends or random people off the street as a sanity check. It's cheap and really helpful.",1236564518

I can understand that argument, because it appeals to the idea that government action intended to stop one bad thing can lead to something much worse.<p>But you seem to be actively defending the idea that there is nothing immoral in a vocation that will inevitably destroy the lives of many people.  You point out that the people being destroyed are complicit in their destruction, but I do not see that as a fully qualifying factor.  If someone was contemplating suicide, and someone else happily persuades them to go through with it instead of trying to talk them out of it, that's a morally neutral choice?<p>You also seem to be equating bad camera work and writing with drug dealing, which I will assume is not what you meant because that would be pretty silly.  Now, if you are just re-iterating the point that you do not want to incriminate drug dealers, that position can be defended.  But if you honestly believe that there is nothing morally wrong with intentionally and actively enabling people into addiction, I doubt that the gap between our views on morality can be bridged.<p>I suspect there is some misunderstanding about where you are arguing for not criminalizing activities versus defending their morality.  If so, could you clarify?",1236564450

Like alcohol many people don't appear to be negatively impacted by it.  But, we don't hear ""Please smoke pot responsibly"" instead pot and people with an <i>alcohol problem</i> are demonized.  People see anecdotal evidence and such as the large number of entertainers that admit smoking pot and assume it's safe.  They then extrapolate to the sample size of their friends when evaluating other drugs.  Ecstasy does horrible things to the human brain over time, but people don't evaluate the long term medical effects they just assume they are invincible and ""the man"" is full of crap.<p>I am further suggesting that for drugs that need a large scale distribution chain, and are extremely addictive and dangerous a more effective deterrent than prison should be employed.",1236564273
