MIT was founded on a philosophy of practicality, and everything else is secondary. If you couple that with the belief that fundamental computer science is the most efficient way to enhance practical software engineering, Scheme was a wonderful choice. Java and C++ may have been more directly practical to software engineers, but they are not good for the field or people pushing the limits of the field - you spent too much time mucking around with their paradigms and idiosyncrasies.<p>Python (and, frankly, a number of the scripting languages-turned-mainstream) combines this clarity of computer science with a practicality that Scheme never had. If you can convey 95% of the basic ideas in Python, and you can also open the door to learning how to deal with 3rd party code, you'd be a fool not to.

The following represents a summary of those trends:...the development of programming skills in several languages is giving way to cookbook approaches using large libraries and special-purpose packages.</i>""<p>I agree with the ""several languages"" part, but why is using a large library a worrisome trend? Is it really that bad?<p>Using a library doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. Programmers often advocate code reuse and using a library is an example of code reuse. If you need to sort data, use a provided sorting algorithm or one written by someone smarter rather than writing it yourself. If a problem is solved, don't solve it again, right?<p>Does it have to do with understanding the solution to the problem?",1237922151

Founded by the John Geisse for Dayton family (also the founders of B. Dalton book stores).  The Dayton family had had investments in department stores since 1902;  Walmart - 1962 with 1 store in Rogers, Arkansas.  Founder Sam Walton had experienced previous success with running a Ben Franklin discount retail franchise.<p>Technology Infrastructure Milestones: Target - 1969, Computerized distribution system; 2004 RFID inventory tracking trials;  Walmart - 1987, Satellite network allowing inventory and sales communication between all stores.<p>Target was an investment from the get-go.  The Dayton's were the investors, and Geisse was the visionary who understood and founded the discount retailing business model.  The Company grew through acquisition and strategic investment - even booting the founder (Geisse) in 1968.<p>Walmart was a spin-off of an existing discount retailer franchise.  Sam Walton understood his customers, and his business from a local level.  He grew the company organically from town to town at first because its all he was familiar with.  The company was built from the ground up to distribute and market discount retail products.",1237921474
