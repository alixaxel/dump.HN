I don't understand how these teams can make such generic conclusions and then immediately contradict each other on such level. One team says ""we are certain, reality doesn't exists"", the other says ""nope, it does exists"". Either the articles interpreting the teams' results are exaggerating the claims, or quantum mechanics is mocking both teams making contradictory results possible.",1236365905

Their reputation has got worse and worse and I believe you're right, it's going to start damaging their ability to enter any market other than computers and games consoles (and only there because they actually have a <i>good</i> reputation).<p>I don't trust MSFT's reliability with products. I've even noticed some classic MSFT flaws in the Xbox 360, namely that it tells you somethings wrong with how <i>you</i> set up the Xbox when it cannot connect to Live, yet if you actually watch the connection steps it connects to the network, connects to the internet and gets 2/3 the way through connecting to MSFT's Live and then it fails, yet they blame you. This reminds me of Live Messenger, when the service goes down for everyone (including articles on ZDNet and places about the outage) you check the service and it <i>always</i> says that the Live systems are running without a problem. I still can't understand why MSFT simply never admits there's a problem; IMO it hurts their reputation a lot more that they don't than if they did.<p>Honestly, I find myself looking at the apple website, watching the prices of all their products. Because once there's a good enough deal, or I have enough cash to spare (whichever comes first) then I'm getting one.
