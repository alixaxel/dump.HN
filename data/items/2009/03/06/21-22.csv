And I don't think the school would have gotten anything close to $8000. Most of the modular office buildings are being offered for around $6000 to $7000. But the most expensive one is going for $25000.<p>My first impression when I saw the article was that the school got ripped off, and so if I had the chance, I would not have bought it.<p>The buyer might have thought that he was ripping off the school. So if he still wanted to rip off the school he could do a few things.<p>1. Sue the school in small claims court for cash. By the time the case has gotten to court it has probably been at least a month. And it looks like transporting those are really expensive. So it might be reasonable to argue that the buyer can't profitably move it and sell it at that time and so deserves cash.<p>2. Argue that he would have been able to get around the limit for small claims court lawsuits because the most expensive are going for over 24k, so 8k to 10k in damages might be reasonable.<p>So basically if the school didn't sell, they could be sued in small claims court which means a quick  and inexpensive court case. And they might pay out more money than they would have gotten selling it.<p>Ebay:<a href=""http://shop.ebay.com/items/__modular-office-trailer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.ebay.com/items/__modular-office-trailer</a><p>PA small claims court: <a href=""http://www.consumeraffairs.com/consumerism/small_pa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consumeraffairs.com/consumerism/small_pa.html</a>",1236376036

505989,comment,505938,505938,0,0,jeremyw,,,"Hmm, are software startups really high risk to founders?  Does this argument even matter?<p>Liberal industry culture lets founders move in and out of startups, consulting and full-time arrangements.  High compensation lets founding teams take sabbaticals often.  If one has a reasonably low cost of living and a solid hourly rate, working 1/3 of the year vends 2/3s startup time.<p>Given that PG has said many YC founders are older, I'd expect they've moved into the low-risk category, extra responsibilities of life included.

But it's best to have (and propose) that clear use for the money opposed to making people sacrifice out of principle.<p>The later point of my post was that founders should be able to agree to their ""buffer"" and shared expenses.  What you don't want to do is reserve money based on the philosophy the company <i>COULD</i> use it better, but not actually execute on that.  You can quickly demoralize quality people by saving up a war chest for ads, while people are trying to do their best work on ""ramen"" draws after the release (and reality sets in).<p>When intelligent people know they get a percentage of the profit at weekly checkpoints, they can do the math on how their time is being spent in the present (opposed to thinking it will rain money at the finish line; which maybe it will, but it's rarely that easy).",1236375727

You have all the structural advantages, as the original project owner. Your competitor is just playing to lose.<p>It's not like this is a supposition of mine. A great example of a project that executed this business plan: SourceFire/Snort (now a public company). Lots of companies have tried to piggyback on Snort, but for Snort's core customers, nobody has succeeded.<p>There's no clever algorithmic idea you can ""hide"" in closed-source code.

I wrote the linked post.<p>Very early on, you are right; it doesn't make sense to pay founders before you pay the bills and invest in your product/marketing.  But when you maintain the bootstrap mentality beyond the very early days, and when you add people who aren't programmer types, you need to think about incentives rather than sacrifices.  The fuel that keeps people going very early on is thinking about launch/release, but realistically very few things achieve overnight success.  Organic growth can take a while, and my point was by giving people a fair, scalable taste of the profits (at a weekly interval, out of real profits) you can keep morale and creativity up.<p>-Jeff",1236375257

Electric guitars, amps, and guitar pedals are expensive, and I doubt most teens have that kind of disposable income. I went to high school in a pretty affluent suburb, and even kids playing in bands there rarely had anything but entry-level guitars and a couple of cheap $40 pedals.<p>From my limited experience (working in a record store, giving guitar lessons, touring with a band), the biggest purchasers of these items seem to be men in their 20s and middle-age married men with kids trying to recapture some of their youth or introduce their children to music they love.<p>That said, I'd like to see where Zed buys his pedals (guitar center?), because most of pedals that I've seen have pretty tame names, like the popular Korg series of effects pedals, or technical names, like Behringer CL9 or Boss AD3.
