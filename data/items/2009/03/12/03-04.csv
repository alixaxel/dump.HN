For some reason many in the development community seem to see the iPhone as some great untapped market where you can make easy money.  When the reality is the iPhone/iPod Touch platform is probably the most competitive market out there right now.<p>There are already 25,000 iPhone apps after just 8 months and all reports seem to indicate that the growth rate is quickening.  So you better have some significant resources behind you if you want to get noticed.",1236830093

More likely, he wants their code to be easier to grade.  In the latter case, of course, he should just write a program to automatically evaluate their code, which would save everybody lots of time.
