The same effect can be achieved just as easily with event handlers, and will result in more modular code with greater separation between the structural and behavioural layers.<p>If you really want to do form validation you'd be better off using something like Ojay's Forms package:<p><a href=""http://ojay.othermedia.org/articles/forms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ojay.othermedia.org/articles/forms.html</a>",1236246956

504115,comment,503987,503987,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I can't bear to get screwed over again.</i><p>I think your only true protection against getting burned again is to deeply face what it is in yourself that created those painful situations in the first place. No contract in the world will protect you from creating an equivalent situation again, if you haven't learned what you need to learn from the previous ones.<p>Your use of phrases like ""getting screwed over"", ""getting ideas and hard work stolen"", and so on, suggest that you believe that it was because other people did bad stuff to you that things ended up the way they did. I'm willing to believe that other people did bad things. Nevertheless it was your own choices that put you there in the first place. As a wise person once explained, it was never really the other person you were trusting; first and foremost you were trusting your own bad judgment, and that's what really betrayed you.<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't put things in writing or draw up a contract. By all means do. One way to protect against the risk of a relationship going bad is to have shares vest at a certain rate per month. I think our arrangement is 1/48 per month (so, over four years), with a 1-year minimum, and a portion of up-front vesting for work already done.<p>But that pales in important to the deeper issue: if you don't want to get screwed again, then stop ascribing your painful experiences to other people. This doesn't mean you have to absolve or forgive <i>them</i>, it means you have to be truly honest with yourself about what <i>you</i> did and thought that was wrong. That's been my experience anyway... the only solution that works is fundamental growth.",1236246713

504113,comment,504075,504075,0,0,webmaster,,,"It's tough these days being a developer.  I know from experience.  If you are lucky you can get clients to pay the development costs and you are most likely going to give them something they like.  Trying to break into the shareware or apps for purchase is a whole new ballgame.  Customers demand perfection and there's a middleman around every corner trying to sap your profits.  That's the risk of the entrepreneur.  Fortunately, the web rewards innovation, but it requires hard work.  At least the iPhone developer license is nothing compared to a Nintendo or XBox license.<p>Paul St. Amant

And then a hundred dollar are no longer an extra hour, but up to 2 extra days. You learn that stuff if you fall on hard times someday - and if you try doing a startup then this is something that occasionally does happen.<p>Well, anyway, as much as I understand him, myself I still don't work with pirated software.

504095,comment,502672,504074,0,0,adsyoung,,,"To address your idea specifically, I definitely think something like that is possible. If the formulas and data where separated such that one spreadsheet could inherit formulas from a master etc. There is so much variation in engineering though its just a matter of working it through and seeing where the limitations are.<p>In making things better in engineering the first goal is first try and stop people spending so much time managing and moving data around. This really takes up a large percentage of the work done, unnecessarily.<p>Second is to start getting engineers to see things more like programming where things aren't repeated and data is separated out from the method. If you receive new data (e.g. new aircraft loads and geometry) your goal is for there to be nothing whatsoever required for you to update your analysis. Its already setup, you just point at the new data and it's done. This is rarely the case I find.<p>Finally, I think is the issue you are talking about which is to tackle the problem of engineering by forming new abstractions and figuring out how to best represent those abstractions with existing tools or something new. This is definitely promising but honestly there's lots of easier stuff to do first that would make a big difference.<p>The thing that makes it so hard in engineering is that every job has its own set of ""approved"" methods and the amount of work required for each part varies for a number of reasons. There's a lot stuff you're never going to get the world to agree on but a spreadsheet type thing that separates the data and formulas completely is a good start.",1236244258
