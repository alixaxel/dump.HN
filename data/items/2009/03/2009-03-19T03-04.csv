Very cool - later at another company I got to speak with the GUI designer Keith Ohlfs and personally thank him for the best copmuter experience I ever had.)<p>For instance, NextStep's POSIX interface was broken and thus, Next was not able to compete against the then-very-inferior SunOS in government contracts (because POSIX compliance was a requirement).<p>Instead, Next did win in CIA/NSA and other exempt contracts where the solution was considered to be ""custom"" and thus didn't have to follow the standards.<p>It probably would have taken a competent Next programmer a few weeks to fix the POSIX layer - but since POSIX was viewed as ""dumb"" it was never made a priority.<p>Apple is letting some of the boring stuff slip - which is a danger sign.  Programmers at Apple can't all be programming the cool CoverFlow stuff and ignoring the ""guts"".",1237434957

522822,comment,522786,522786,0,0,sgrove,,,"Can't agree more. In my undergraduate research in the Cognitive Neuroscience labs at Berkeley, it was disappointing to see how much effort was wasted because people avoided technology instead of embracing it (in neuroscience!).<p>The work done there was incredible, but as I was passed around to researchers in the lab, programming the experiments they had designed (have to pay your dues to get into research), I got a chance to see the methods they used before they were able to get competent programmers. Manually marking spikes and anomalies in EEG data when there was an api for the program to allow access to recorded data for just such a purpose, dealing with timing issues because few understood the difficulties of achieving high-precision event timing, etc.<p>It was depressing to think of how much further it could have gone. When I left to pursue my startup, I was working on some automated techniques to remove noise from fMRI data. That type of work will speed up research and allow researchers to spend time on meaningful things.",1237434558
522821,comment,522197,522531,0,0,Rod,,,"Thank you for an insightful analysis. It's somewhat interesting that HN'ers believe they are <i>super</i> smart but downvote anything that goes against the mainstream dogma. Finance is complex. Even a smart guy like Philip Greenspun made a fool of himself in this article. Better not make strong statements when one is treading outside one's area of expertise...<p>I would argue that many allow emotion to cloud their judgement. Of course that taxpayers are not happy to see their money being wasted on bonuses, but shouldn't we analyze the situation in objective terms? Your analysis was one of the most balanced I have read in recent times. Sometimes one must choose between two evils. Things are seldom <i>black & white</i>.<p>I liked your take on the need to compensate and keep AIG's traders, in order to avoid them going elsewhere and start predatory practises against their former employer. Makes sense. I wonder why no one had mentioned it before.",1237434450

522813,comment,522786,522786,0,0,kyro,,,"Biology students should definitely learn how to program.<p>I'm in my 4th year as a bio major and have been involved with several research projects. The first involved inducing schizophrenia in rats, and recording their movements in reaction to a set of audio stimuli after being given a set of varying medicines. We had folders and folders filled with spreadsheets of data -- data that would have to be manually inputted into some crappily obsolete software. Even with somewhat specialized software, each run was saved as a separate file, adding to the clutter. Our research would have definitely progressed more quickly had we had programmers that built the appropriate software to aggregate our data.<p>In my second research project, our team was trying to, and still is, find the metrics to 'the beautiful face.' This requires morphing pictures of women together, presenting these synthetic images to a focus group, who then rates the images. After the pictures are rated, they are subject to a natural selection type algorithm we developed, and the beauty evolution is done manually. We would've definitely found much value in recruiting a programmer who could've written a program to automate the selection process, and perhaps built an app that brought the focus group rating aspect of our research to the web. We do use hotornot.com, but it's not ideal.<p>I'd like to add that additionally, medical students and doctors should learn how to program. There are many many many areas in medicine and healthcare generally that are behind the tech times. Coding doctors would definitely expedite the progression of the medical field from within. At least I think so. That's what my med school personal statement was about. :P<p>As someone who has studied biology/medicine, and has a definite interest in programming (teaching myself currently), I hope to find myself helping in the progression of the convergence of these two fields.",1237434049

Pretty much everyone on Wall Street's compensation has gotten hosed so I don't think trading partners are going to flinch about seeing employees go bonus-less.<p>There's a bit of irony in me saying this (think about who I might be doing technology for[and it's not AIG] that would make my words the most ironic...), but bonuses only work as a positive motivator up to a point.  Past that, you end up getting people doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons--there were a few good HN posts about this concerning case studies conducted on bonuses and why companies should pay above the market average but not be at the top percentile.",1237433180

And if possession is illegal, better round up everyone at Youtube, because I know they've <i>distributed</i> videos of people getting killed.<p>Your argument that creating a community and market creates demand has some merit, but note that I specifically specified anonymous downloading with no ties to the ""community"" whatsoever. Would that render it OK, then? If not, why not? And why doesn't your argument apply to, say, news coverage of school shootings, which definitely creates a ""market"" for horrible crimes?<p>And your argument about individuals with ""inappropriate thoughts"" (how sad that we even have to type such a phrase) who ""could well be encouraged to put thoughts into action"" - perhaps, but our entire legal system is supposed to be based on <i>things you have done</i>, not things you may or may not do in the future.<p><i>You cant pin any specific blame but removing them from society is always going to help :)<p>Plus of course you dont know what they may do in th future. Looking at images may develop into actual abuse.</i><p>I cannot disagree strongly enough with the above. If you can't pin specific blame, what that means is that they haven't done anything. What they may do in the future is not something you can arrest them for today.<p>Using your logic, why don't we, say, go and arrest anyone who looks like they might be in a gang? Who knows what they might do in the future!<p>You disagree with that, right? So why does it suddenly become a valid argument with child porn? And ""because I really, really hate them"" is not a good enough reason.<p>It's a circular argument. We make having these files illegal, because they show someone might do something wrong. Oh wait, they have done something wrong, they have these illegal files! Do you see what's wrong with that?<p>Rehabilitation? For what? They haven't <i>done</i> anything! Look, if they rape a child, punish them! Throw the book at the bastards, lock them up for life! You have my complete support!<p>But locking people up for things they haven't done yet is wrong, wrong, <i>wrong</i>. That is not how our legal system works, no exceptions, not even if we really, really hate the accused. That's why, in case you didn't know, Lady Justice wears a blindfold.<p>You've taken off that blindfold, and in doing so, corrupted the system. That is what makes me angry enough to ""come out in support of"" something I personally find reprehensible.

(I don't work on the team but from my understanding of someone's comments, this is how it roughly works)<p>3) Regarding extensibility, I agree that I doubt Google is going to provide much extensibility of the actual browser <i>chrome</i>.

And, despite this ease of targeting, you can ""load"" as much, or as little, energy into the stream as you wish, because photons have negligible mass.
