And 20/19 = 1 + 1/19, which means that 2/19 is a single rotation away.<p>If you've ever noticed that 142857 * [1..6] produces different rotations of the same number and wondered why, you might have thought about this.  Dyson had probably already done all the hard work on the problem and knew immediately that the answers were rotations of some repeating fraction, and one where multiplying by 2 gives rotations by 1 digit.",1238022276

Some amateurs might have read more about the issue than the self-proclaimed experts.<p>And if non-experts are not qualified to speak, how do you justify letting them vote? Not saying democracy is perfect, but apparently there was a thought that even if people are not experts, they might be able to inform themselves sufficiently to be able to decide which experts to trust.",1238022122

I might try to guess what the guy who downmodded you thought (that even non-specialists have the right to express their opinions? that lobbying is a legitimate activity?) but after all I'm left to guessing.
