The various institutions of course never became absolutely unregulated but particular, symbolically important regulations were removed.<p>It is true that regulations like the distinction between savings banks and investment banks might not prevented similar banks maneuvers were the banks determined to engage in them.<p>However, it is actually important to keep in mind that a good deal of state's symbolic action toward private institutions are crucial for its limiting or not-limiting their behavior.<p>Throughout the financial industry, ""Greenspanism"", the idea that the market knows best, became the watchword of the regulators and the regulated, meaning that the regulators often failed to take action around worrisome trends. The Federal Reserve, for example, could have punctured the housing bubble at any time by saying <i>loudly and forcefully</i> ""this is a bubble, you have to stop now"". The results might not have been pretty then but they even uglier now...<p>Also<p>> Subprime mortgages were a creation of regulation and were overvalued as US regulatory policy.<p>I would love see documentation of <i>this</i>...<p>> Regulation and tax policy encouraged US banks to hold more Fannie and Freddie stock than they would have otherwise, which guaranteed that they'd all take a hit at the same time.<p>Actually, I'd see Fannie and Freddie as ""poorly regulated but guarantee"" institutions. Certainly the worst kind.<p>I certainly don't view the state as automatically good and the private sector as automatically bad. But not I also wouldn't see all state actions as good regulation or even regulation in any sense. The Post Office is owned by government and maybe regulated by the EPA. The US military, is controlled by the state but can tell the EPA to <i></i>* itself and often does.",1238281100

536867,comment,535797,536110,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>Is this a web-app for people to pose questions because they're too wishy-washy to weigh their options themselves?</i><p><i>Everyone</i> has trouble making decisions sometimes--it's human nature on contact with a world more complex than the one we evolved in, not a character flaw. I don't just mean major decisions either--sometimes the hardest ones to make are things like where to have dinner or what movie to rent or what color shirt to wear. People are constantly encountering situations in which the cost of making an optimal choice exceeds the consequences of making a sub-optimal choice.<p>More generally, this is the problem of bounded rationality. If you can't make perfectly rational decisions, you have to find efficient heuristics to approximate those decisions by reducing the amount if information that has to be collected and considered. We've reduced the cost of information <i>gathering</i> to nearly zero, but that only exacerbates the problem of processing it into something useful for making decisions.<p>Most attempts to mitigate this aim to rank, rate, and prioritize, in order to narrow the firehose and give you  only the relevant information.  This is great if you know what information you need to make the decision and how you weight various aspects of that information. It's useless when you don't know <i>how</i> to decide: <i>what</i> information to consider and <i>how</i> to rank it.  It's like having a research assistant when you want an expert.  So what is useful in that situation?<p>It turns out we already have technology for that: expert systems.  They're good for reasoning through a problem because they actively ask for information as it becomes relevant rather than requring the user to know beforehand what is relevant.  They're great for situations involving uncertainty because they don't require answers to every question in order to provide potentially useful results.<p>Where expert systems fail it is because they lack common sense, breadth of knowledge, and the ability to adapt and expand themselves.  These are all things which the collective intellegence of networked humans have demonstrated great aptitude at.  Driving the former with the latter seems likely to produce interesting results, even if Hunch itself fails.<p>I have no idea if Hunch will be ""huge"" or hugely mediocre -- that is heavily dependent on the yet-unseen functioning of the site itself and users that contribute to it (the who, the why, and the how), but I at least find the approach novel and interesting, which is more than can be said for many startups.<p><i>Must be nice to have a huge name to tag onto some silly idea that'll make insane money no matter what.</i><p>Not as nice as it is to take shots at people for being successful, right?",1238280458

536862,comment,536422,536730,0,0,lucumo,,,"Allow me to clarify. I don't mean that it's confusing or ambiguous. What I mean is that the only place people have seen the backslash in their language and many other places is as an escape operator. This means that the backslash - when seen alone - was most likely to be an escape character.<p>When scanning code, you often use ""landmarks"" to find your way about. This is why indentation is so useful. But this is also used on a smaller level. When seeing a comma, you usually expect to find something else after it, just because that's what you're used to.<p>The same can hold for backslashes. Personally, I ""feel"" that backslashes are an escape character to such a degree that to see one without an escaped item after it, feels like a syntax error.<p>Now, I'm not arguing that this is a terrible choice of the PHP folks - at least we finally get namespaces - but I do understand how some people find the backspace an irritating choice.",1238279930

I was thinking about the phrase that stuck with me ""Do something hard"" and came back and have reread it 3-4 times over the last month.<p>I also recently watched a Disney movie called ""Meet the Robinsons"". It has a great moral and at the end there is an amazing quote:<p>""Around Here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. We <i>keep moving forward</i>, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths."" -Walt Disney<p>I was so struck by this quote that I printed it out and it now hangs above my desk.

The point was that doing so sped up the compiler which saved time for a large number of users (this was back in the days of compilers as commercial products).  Clearly the discussion was targeted to self-compiling compilers.<p>But the lesson here would be that some effort spent on the speed of compile could positively impact developer productivity or at least negatively affect swordfight time.  And yes, I think that very short compile times, like you see in CL (sbcl as an example) or Smalltalk can have an avalanche effect on development.  And yes I do believe that small incremental changes are th3e best way to do software development.
