The fact that it doesn't look new and challenging doesn't preclude that.  They have a design that's nuanced in thousands of ways to improve their business.  Their design is reminiscient of Victorian architecture, every last detail polished off until it was perfect.

I know low is a difficult word to associate with tuition but without development money coming in, the money would need to be raised elsewhere.<p>It's almost like when investing in startups.  Not every graduate is going to strike it rich but the more graduates there are, the more likely that more of them will (assuming your standards remain the same).  So you can keep your tuition low enough to attract enough people and hope that the lost tuition revenue will be made up for by alumni donations by those who do well with their degree.<p>Trying to apply ""business model A"" to ""business B"", seeing that it doesn't work, and then saying ""business model A"" is a dumb idea isn't a worthwhile approach to looking at something.

524997,comment,523518,524571,0,0,bokonist,,,"Let's say that in the counterfeiting example, the counterfeiters pumped $300 billion a year of counterfeit bills into the economy.  The counterfeiters spend all this money on wine and women.<p>When the counterfeiters are found out, this $300 billion dollars of demand for the vineyard and brothel industry evaporates.  That will cause much unemployment.  I agree with you that this should be allowed to happen.  The workers in those industries must find new jobs that are economically productive.  The government <i>should not</i> step in and start printing money to prop the brothels up, as this will simply create zombie industries as Giles noted. (Nor can the Giles recover the lost wealth - the counterfeiters already spent the money, the resources that went into producing the wine and woman have been consumed).<p>But there is a second cause of unemployment, which is the unnecessary collateral damage caused by the deflation.  When half of the money supply evaporates, people's savings to expenses ratio are now at dangerously low levels.  So they start reining in expenses.  But all expenditures are another person's income, so business revenues fall.  In theory, the businesses could drop their wages and prices an equivalent amount, and eventually you would get a pigovian rebalancing effect.  But the trouble is sticky labor and, more importantly, debt contracts.  When revenues fall, the businesses cannot pay debts, they go bankrupt, people are unemployed, and you get a full fledged deflationary spiral.  Millions go unemployed, not because they were not building something people wanted (they were), but simply because contracts rely on a steady money supply, and when money supply drops by 50%, all contracts get shot to hell.<p>There are two solutions:  one, the government could announce that in light of the discovery of the counterfeit bills, all contracts will be redenominated at a 2:1 ratio - thus debt contracts will be cut in half, wage contracts cut in half, NFL salary cap cut in half, leases cut in half, etc.  Or, the government could announce a one month window in which people can trade in their counterfeit bills for real ones.  This will restore the money supply to the original levels.  Either one of these solves the problem instantly and completely avoids the depression.  There are no zombie industries, everyone just continues with their productive pursuits.  The only unemployed people are at the vineyards and brothels, they must still find new jobs.<p>Of course, if the government decides to restore the money supply by printing money and giving it to government workers digging ditches, then you will still get massive frictional unemployment, and you'll permanently reallocate resources into useless activities.  This is the Keynesian/Obama solution and it's a terrible one.<p>The problem you, Giles, and the Austrians have is that you do not distinguish the unemployment caused by necessary restructuring ( the brothels and vineyards) from the unemployment caused by a fall in the money supply and the wrecking of contracts.  The first cannot and should not be avoided.  But you can, and should, prevent the collateral damage that creates a great depression.  Until you see the difference between these two types of unemployment, you guys will get killed in debates with the Keynesians, and no one will listen to you.  Which is too bad because the Austrians have a lot of great insights, and the Keynesians are awful on a lot of other points.",1237561862

I mean clinically depressed, not just metaphorically. So as someone who has been there; quit. You may have to buy a lower grade of peanut butter for a couple months at Trader Joe's but your freedom and your happiness are priceless.<p>Sure, the economy isn't great but our society (I'm assuming you're American) has come up with this notion that if you don't have a job at some big company as your parachute you're somehow going end up living in a van down by the river. WRONG. I quit that terrible job and traveled the world, and let me tell you I'm still here in one piece and haven't had to look for used vans yet. Since traveling I've ended up in jobs I didn't like but found it much easier to quit those and move on when I've been unhappy; that was the freedom I learned from having that first bad job experience. Now I know I can leave an employment position and my life won't fall apart.<p>All that said, don't do anything stupid like quit with no money in the bank. You're still going to have to realistically pay bills and you may end up needing to take a job that's not so glorious after leaving this one to help you get from point A to point B. If you do, make the most of those experiences. Know they too are temporary and only there to help you get to your end goal. Set a timeframe so you know those temporary jobs will eventually come to an end. Stay focused on where you want to be and you will get there.<p>[edit] I'll also add, don't quit and leave your current company hanging. Give them the proper two weeks (minimum) notice. Try to leave without burning any bridges, regardless of how little you like your current job.",1237561757
