524821,comment,524461,524461,0,0,gjm11,,,"Rivest stresses multiple times that the process he describes is ""not encryption"" because the cryptographic primitive being used is an authentication one. Therefore, he says, his process can be implemented using software that's approved for US export -- this was back when that was a problem, of course.<p>Well, yes, kinda. But:<p>1. The whole process most certainly is encryption by any reasonable definition, especially if (as he suggests) you do it by authenticating two versions of every bit, only one of which checks out. It's basically an obfuscated version of the following scheme: you take your message, you exclusive-or it with a stream of random-enough bits (the bitstream, or enough information to generate it, is your shared secret key), and then you replace 0 with 01 and 1 with 10. So, as with Rivest's scheme, the ciphertext -- oh, excuse me, the plaintext with added chaff -- is basically an interleaving of the plaintext and its bitwise complement, and you need some secret knowledge to know which bit to use from each pair.<p>2. Sure, you can implement Rivest's scheme using a cryptographic building block that does something other than encryption. But if you build software that does this then <i>that</i> (see 1 above) is surely encryption software, so (back when Rivest's article was written) you run into the same problems with US export as you were trying to avoid.<p>The Alice/Bob/Charles scenario is bloody clever, though. (And the ability to do this sort of thing, rather than the claim that the process ""isn't encryption"", is the real point. What Rivest has done is to find a way of decomposing an encryption+decryption process into a small number of parts each of which can somewhat plausibly be claimed not to be for encryption.)",1237553488

524814,comment,524348,524682,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah, in an ideal world we would all use ""common"" for the one concept and ""ground"" or ""earth ground"" for the other. But in practice we use ""ground"" to mean ""common"" and ""earth ground"" to mean ""earth ground"".<p>I remember, when I was a beginner, being completely confused about what all those ground symbols meant. That was one of my first big stumbling blocks in electronics. The answer is that they're usually nothing but notational: They save you drawing some wires (every ground symbol is assumed to be attached directly to every other ground symbol by a very-low-resistance wire [1]) and more importantly they define your reference voltage (once you've drawn a ground, you can say things like ""this point in the circuit is at 3.2 volts"", instead of ""this point in the circuit is at 3.2 volts relative to Point X"".)<p>---<p>[1] There are times when the connections from ground to ground have too high a resistance, or when you pour so much current into ground that the ground-lead resistance can't be ignored anymore. Those are called <i>ground loops</i>, and are topics for advanced class. I have a nasty ground loop when I connect my stereo system to my cable TV. It manifests as the sixty-hertz hum from hell.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_(electricity)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_(electricity)</a>",1237552912

The supply chain was simplified by making the suppliers partners.\n   3. Shipping the whole car as kits for the downstream distributors to assemble, thus reducing several costs.\n   4.

524801,comment,524787,524787,0,0,brk,,,"Despite the question in the headline of this article, there is very little actionable advice.  ""Get closer to the customer"" is about the best teaching the author can come up with.<p>There has been a lot of talk about this $2500 car, but everything I've read (in articles with actual data) indicate that there is no way to sell the car for $2500 and cover the cost of raw materials plus assembly/shipping.  This is even with the concept of the dealer doing some of the final assembly.  Then you have to offset R&D costs, and the other overhead of trying to run an automaker.<p>A car at a sub-$5,000 pricepoint might work in India, where the regulations are much less stringent than in the US.  But, to imply that there is any great new innovation here that other automakers (I don't see Toyota with a $5,000 vehicle, either) have missed is somewhat of a stretch.",1237551826

You are not different.<p>Except that these days we don't fund many things that way.<p>But it wasn't always so, in the past if you were not a patron of the arts (which also meant science), you were nobody. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage</a><p>Effectively that was a way of funding exactly the type of thing you describe - you just had to explain how what you did helped society.

What labels, points and such it shows seems to depend on the position and shape of the moon rather than on the position of the screen and the zoom level.  Sometimes I want to see something (like a village's name) that I just <i>know</i> is <i>there</i> but I have to center the screen on something next to it and then try a couple of zoom levels to see if I can make it show up.<p>Also, Picasa with its smooth scrolling.  I try to scroll somewhere by dragging the scrollbar or clicking it and instead of scrolling where I drag or click it, it scrolls smoothly (read: <i>slowly</i>) at a top speed of maybe three pages per second.  Aargh!<p>Oh yeah, Google Earth has this too: when you click the N on the compass to realign your screen with the cardinal directions, they thought it would be neat to make it turn really really smoothly.

524794,comment,523905,524775,0,0,rms,,,"...the poster is asking about stimulants and shows an interest in cognitive enhancement. He talks about being easily distracted. I'm not diagnosing him; that's up to a physician. I'm saying that if he's interested in these drugs, it's as easy as talking to a doctor because he probably could be diagnosed with ADHD if he is interested in stimulants.  I take care to use the phrasing ""meets the criteria for ADHD"" because I don't think ADHD actually exists in the vast majority of cases, at least not as a disorder. Concentration and focus are a continuum, some are better at it than others and stimulants improve concentration for everyone<p>See an online ADHD inventory like this one: <a href=""http://www.addresources.org/article_adhd_questionnaire_amen.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.addresources.org/article_adhd_questionnaire_amen....</a>. Western medicine has a very generous definition of adult ADHD -- if you get distracted easily as an adult, and had behavior problems OR organizational problems as a child in school, a doctor is likely to diagnose you with ADHD. This doesn't rise to the level of disorder in my opinion, but when the diagnosis is handed out so freely, stimulants are a safe, reliable method of cognitive enhancement. I am generally against our society's overmedication of children with stimulants without their consent, but as adults, we have the ability to make informed, rational decisions about the substances we put into our bodies.<p>This Nature article discusses some of the ethical issues behind cognitive enhancement in the healthy. <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/13134612/Naturrecom456702a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/13134612/Naturrecom456702a</a>",1237550636
