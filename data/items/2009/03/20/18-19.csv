That's asinine. It seems these days when people say bugs and shortcomings ""don't matter"" they really mean ""I haven't run into a situation where they've screwed me over yet or if I have I just let the framework win"". It's a web framework, people; it should make easy/moderate things easier, not make hard things any harder, and get the hell out of your way. It should not make you change your life to use it.",1237575560
525390,comment,524956,525084,0,0,ellyagg,,,"Nowhere does his post imply that the reason he's leaving is because his design aesthetic clashes with Google's desire for ""clean, spartan, and utilitarian."" It's perfectly possible to meet those goals and not be ugly, like, e.g., iGoogle and Gmail are. I consider most of Apple's designs to be ""clean, spartan, and utilitarian"".<p>Requiring user testing for shades of blue and thicknesses of border is the height of silliness. I'm reminded of those room makeover shows they have on TV. At the beginning, the designer tells the couple one of the colors they've chosen. The couple is aghast. ""What, I can't stand magenta. No way!"" Sometimes, the wife looks like she's about to cry. At the end, magenta is used and the design is breathtaking.<p>There is no way user testing has gotten efficient enough to beat a designer at that level of detail. Moreover, users often don't know they want something until a designer shows them they do. You can never get to those designs by testing blues and borders.",1237575351

525379,comment,524715,524715,0,0,jasonkester,,,"That was pretty much my first impression of Django as well, and I bet it's the impression they want to leave.<p>The reality doesn't really hit home for a few weeks.  Django gives you all sorts of really cool stuff right out of the box that does nearly everything for you.  The problem comes when you want to do something just that little bit different, and you find yourself unrolling every single piece of it one-by-one as you discover that these pieces don't fit your needs exactly.<p>I also found myself baffled by the terrible decision to make everything revolve around function calls rather than a Request and Response object.  No matter what happens in your page flow, you still need to return a HttpRequest object at the end of the day.  No more Response.Write();Response.End(); from any point.  You need to have every bit of code capable of returning in a way that triggers the thing above it to return in a way to trigger the thing above it to return a HttpRequest object.  Makes debugging a serious pain.<p>So yeah, if you're doing a simple CMS for a media site (which is what they wrote Django to do), it rocks the house.  If you're trying to do any heavy lifting, it seems to fall apart pretty fast.<p>I don't think I'd use it again.",1237575006

It was a kind of Pascal/ pseudocode language that we used to program an imaginary one-armed robot to perform some tasks on a deck of cards. We would write a program for sorting the cards by number, or pick all cards with the number 2, things like that. I think it was a good idea for those of us not familiar with either computers or the English language.<p>The language didn't have a running implementation that I know of; it was all paper-based.<p>(""Timba"" means ""gambling"" in Argentinian slang -- for some reason writing TIMBA programs always reminded me of the late Rene Lavand, the one-armed Argentinian magician.)",1237574839

525374,comment,524715,524715,0,0,tdavis,,,"As a huge fan of Django, Python, and both communities I would like to point out a few more things:<p>- Always track the trunk, there's really no compelling reason not to. It's always extremely stable and full of new features you won't find in the tarball release.<p>- The ORM is good for simple things, but you may find yourself needing to write SQL if you're doing anything complicated. In reality this probably applies to any ORM, though. Even though people ignore it.<p>- Caching is built-in, effortless, and awesome.<p>- The template language is intentionally crippled in various ways to keep you from ""doing too much"" in them. Thankfully Django is modular enough to allow you to drop in a more powerful replacement if that's your thing.<p>- Django is basically retarded when it comes to multi-processing environments and should not be considered even remotely thread-safe. I mean it. Copious use of locks can <i>usually</i> keep transactions from walking all over each other, but your mileage may vary.<p>- If you want some piece of functionality or add-on or whatever, chances are somebody has already written it.

525334,comment,525067,525067,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Getting up in the morning used to be one of the central struggles of my life (seriously), but I rarely think about it now and I'm almost always up by 430am, which is something I never thought would happen.  Here's my story, if anyone is interested.<p>I've struggled with getting up my entire life, and so has my entire family, immediate and extended.  My 18-year-old brother regularly sleeps until 1pm, as do many of my cousins and their parents.  I was homeschooled growing up and the day didn't typically start until 11am.  In high school, I got suspended numerous times for missing my first few classes.  I joined the Navy out of HS and I pretty rarely had issues with being late because I overslept, because the military is very effective at putting the fear of God in you regarding the consequences.  I still always slept until the last possible minute before getting up.  After the Navy, I went back to finish college and ended up taking about 30 hours worth of classes every semester, which helped some, but I still overslept and was always jumping out of bed and rushing to class at the last second.  I very often would sit down in class about 5-10 mins after having been sound asleep before.  My wife was very frustrated, and I was frustrated with myself.  I was sure that I had some kind of sleep disorder, especially since my whole family is like this.<p>So what changed?  Mostly what changed is that I realized what you've realized: life is too short to sleep it away.  My central problem has always been the actual act of getting up; once I'm up and awake, I'm fine.  So I started looking around and I found this article by Steve Pavlina:<p><a href=""http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-ea...</a><p>Basically, his method is to practice getting up, in the middle of the day.  Bizarre (and embarrassing), but it works.  I did this every day for a few weeks, and I immediately noticed a difference.<p>The other big thing I did was go to bed early.  Not earlier, as I typically went to bed at 1am or 2am, but <i>early</i>.  Like 8pm.  I'd go to bed at 8pm for a week and get up at 5am.  That was more sleep than I usually got, and since I was doing it consistently, it got easier over time.  Then I started going to bed a little later and now I usually get to bed between 9pm and 10pm.  Because I'm consistent, I get better quality sleep and I can get by on 7 hours consistently.<p>I know it's frustrating to have someone tell you to just go to bed early, but I found that it's a lot harder than it looks, especially because you've almost always got way more to do than you have time for and it feels like you should work on some of it rather than go to bed.  The key for me was realizing (after some ""split-testing"") that I get probably 2-3x more accomplished in the four hours from 5am - 9am that I do from 10pm - 2am.<p>A few other things that I found vital:\n  - no caffeine after noon\n  - no computer or tv within an hour of bed\n  - keep room as dark and quiet as possible while sleeping\n  - try to keep the same schedule on weekends\n  - alarm clock in different room\n  - once you're up, immediately splash water in your face\n  - exercise several times per week\n  - track your progress!<p>Try this for a month.  Most people I know who have become early risers would never go back.  There's something incredibly rewarding about hitting 8am having already had breakfast, worked out, showered, knocked out a bunch of emails, read all your blogs, and built two new features.

525327,comment,524837,524837,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Definitely get out of there.  However, I'd suggest considering keeping the current job while you look for the next one.  If you are looking for a ""standard/real"" job, being currently employed seems to be viewed as a plus.  And it may take some pressure off, money/benefits wise, so that you don't end up feeling the need to take whatever ends up being available/offered.<p>This approach may still make you feel somewhat better.  Once you know you are getting out of the current situation, its annoyance becomes a temporary inconvenience.  Still a hassle, but not one you are going to endure indefinitely.<p>On the other hand, a job does take up a lot of time and energy, particularly traditional business hours.  And -- as I know from personal experience -- a bad situation can become so soul sucking that it becomes paralyzing.",1237572748

525323,comment,525067,525147,0,0,niels_olson,,,"To go to bed earlier<p>1) get up earlier<p>2) You can only shift your schedule about 1 hour per day. You can try shifting it more, but you're going to have sweater-head, nausea and hot flashes. If you go from getting up at 11 to getting up at 5, expect five days of feeling like crap.<p>3) The pineal gland is activated by light incident on the retina. So calculate when you need to go to sleep based on when you get up, and stop using the computer one hour prior. <i>AND</i> use Flux, or do something to turn down the absolute amount of light coming from your screen(s).<p>4) The sleep-wake cycle is naturally about 25 hours. It takes discipline to go to sleep at the same time every night. Or exhaustion.<p>5) Recent findings suggest that starvation can suspend the diurnal cycle 12 hours or more. So eat a good dinner.<p>6) Additionally, fats, proteins, warmth, and bulk activate the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest). Simple carbs offer none of these things. So fatty snacks are better. Unsalted nuts are a great snack (salt stimulated the cephalic phase of eating. So, sorry, but bacon is not a good snack).<p>7) Caffeine. Metabolized in the liver at a second-order decay rate by CYP1A2. Effective half-life is 3-7 hours.<p>Coffee: 30-170 mg/8oz\nEspresso: 30-50 mg/oz\nTea: 10-50 mg/8oz (more with black teas)\nSoda: 30-60 mg/12oz\nDark chocolate: 20mg/oz<p>Minimum effective concentration is around 0.05 mg/dL. Total body water is 40L for a 5'10"" male (5'10"" male has about a 70kg lean body mass regardless of total body weight and 40L of that is water. The 70kg and 40L vary linearly with height for adults). So those two cups of French pressed Sumatra you stopped drinking at 8:30 after a 7pm pasta dinner could easily keep you wired until 1 or 2 in the morning. Go on, have that chocolate ice cream, too.<p>8) Calculate when you want to get up (remember, you need to phase in the change, one hour a day). Establish a routine that starts at dinner. Eat. No more caffeine. Work. Have a small, fatty snack. Work until an hour before you need to go to sleep. Brush your teeth, change; lay down. Read something good. I recommend the classics. Doesn't really engage the problem-solving areas of your brain, but you've been meaning to start reading those things. Start with Plato. Very readable.<p>9) If you just absolutely have to go to sleep with noise, I recommend white noise. A beat, rhythm, or lyric will capture your conscious mind.<p>As for getting up, the only thing I've found that definitely will get me up without relying on sunrise is a social commitment. If surgery starts at 7 am and I need to round on patients before then, it's relatively easy to get up at 4:15. If I'm on a ""research month"", um,  yeah.",1237572606
