They both have strengths and weaknesses, but I see Zimbra as the better professional solution. The search in Gmail is great, but no amount of tags can replace good old fashioned folders in Zimbra - especially if you subscribe to a bunch of FOSS project mailing lists - I just don't need to read it all that often but when I do I want it in one place. The calendaring system in Zimbra is useful for scheduling meetings as well.",1236302744
505025,comment,504802,504802,0,0,endtime,,,"Overall, this article is of pretty low quality.  Poor spelling, poor grammar, and near-zero insight.  Also, the content is somewhat inaccurate.  I don't read Digg any more, so I can't speak to the accuracy of its summary, but I still do use reddit, and I have to say that the list is missing at least two popular reddit topics:  hating Israel and hating police.  And hating Digg very rarely comes up.<p>I'm not really sure who the target audience of this article is, but I can't imagine that it's HN.",1236302722

(My startup is a commission-based model as well.)<p>But let's be honest - there are plenty of great, useful apps supported by advertising and lead generation where the end-consumer pays not a penny: Google, Yelp, YouTube, Zillow, SideStep, YellowPages, TicketStumbler, and so forth.  And plenty of media sites make money on ads: Ars Technica, Pitchfork Media, TechCrunch, Huffington Post, and so on.<p>Let's not let the quest for ramen profitability distract us from looking long-term.",1236302637

What really drives the 30/60 minute timeframe? Is it medium or culture? Does shifting online really change that? A medium can change quite quickly, but culture changes far slower.",1236302436
505021,comment,504753,505009,0,0,wallflower,,,"Google does not have access to the XMPP firehouse (all tweets, the public timeline). More importantly, Twitter posts do not neatly fit into the page-rank concept (# of followers does not always equate to authority). Summize got around this problem by not even trying to address it - e.g. most recent tweets are first. Twitter is probably more easily gamed and adding Twitter results to their standard search would probably dilute average AdWords CPC.<p>Of course, the flip side of this is Twitter tweets won't be monetized as efficiently as Google keyword-based ads.",1236302380

And people skills are harder to pick up than technical skills if you don't already have them.<p>My MS is in Software Engineering and on a day-to-day basis I use more of the stuff I learned in Project Management and Quality Control than just about anything else I learned.
