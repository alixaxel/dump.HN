There is a sharp contrast between witches and wizards in his work.  While in many ways his witches do the ""dirty work"" and the wizards sit in the university, the way it's presented is such that the witches are about helping people and getting things done, whereas the wizards are a bunch of doddering old windbags in slippers who don't really do anything at all...and when they do, they usually screw something up pretty badly.<p>Granny Weatherwax (a witch) is easily one of Pratchett's best characters.  (She shows up in Equal Rites, and then again in Wyrd Sisters, which is a sort of retelling of Macbeth...and in several books since.)",1237154306

517295,comment,517053,517053,0,0,derefr,,,"The obvious, technical reason for all this was skirted by Prachett, but never addressed directly: a ""witch"" is, by the oldest definition, a woman who is ""in communion with"" or ""consorting with"" (sleeping with) a devil or demon, and that is wherefrom she takes any power she may possess. A wizard has no such requirement--his magic is actually of an internal nature.<p>To put it another way: all magic--all power, really--actually comes from men, and more specifically, from their ""wands"" (ahem.) A woman doing magic is just serving as an avatar or proxy for her boyfriend's ""will."" Further, because she is committing a carnal sin by not being <i>married</i> to this creature (by definition: you need a priest, and no priest will marry you to a devil), she starts off on the ""evil"" side of the line, even if she wants nothing to do with it.<p>Then there's the whole matter that she's ""draining his willpower for her own purposes""--mythology tends to discretize single creatures into multiple over time, so ""witch"" and ""succubus"" were likely the same idea. Even if she was sleeping with a perfectly good Wiz, she'd still be a vile temptress.<p>That all seems more in line with medieval European folklore to me.<p>(Of course, the question of what happens when someone <i>marries</i> a wizard is left unanswered; it's usually assumed that wizards are too ingrained in their world of rites and formulae to go a-courting, but what if a girl were to just love them anyway--like I'm sure the wives of many mathematicians today do? Would she gain ""legal"" access to his magical energies, or is there some sort of biblical clause against that? In fact, would the wizard be allowed to marry at all? Would a priest condemn Merlin in his time, even in his role as the king's advisor?)",1237154159

517293,comment,516829,516829,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Can someone explain how this article isn't self-contradictory? On one hand, ""In January, Americans saved 5 percent of disposable personal in­come, up from 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007"" but on the other, ""We also need to start investing again"".<p>Where are those additional savings going? Barring folks stuffing the money under their mattresses, it must go into some investment instrument, which means it's going into either equity or loans to businesses, or into banks where it goes into loans to businesses or consumers (other than banks building up a buffer against the risks they're finally recognizing). If those loans go to consumers, they must obviously get spent. If we're talking about any of corporate equity, corporate debt, or bank loans to companies, all three of these things are investments in future production. The only discrepancies should be those bank buffers, and any investments going overseas. Money always gets spent, it's really just a question of how quickly, and on what.<p>Also, ""Last year, Delaware ... saw new incorporations drop by 25 percent [relative to what?]."" Well, at least part of this is our own doing. This has been going on for several years, but new incorporations have been down for several years to the costs and risks that were added by Sarbanes-Oxley. See, e.g., here <a href=""http://www.nysun.com/opinion/reclaiming-the-market/46366/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nysun.com/opinion/reclaiming-the-market/46366/</a> and here <a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb042/is_2003_Nov-Dec/ai_n29046313"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb042/is_2003_Nov-Dec/...</a> .

Many regard the FDA/USDA to be largely corrupt in their handling of health information, due to the many conflicts of interest and ties to pharmaceutical companies and food industry.<p>Making it illegal for farmers to label their beef as mad-cow tested is one example of this.  The way trans fats are labeled in the US compared to Canada/EU is another example.  In fact, in most of EU trans fats are not acceptable food ingredients.  In the US, they're acceptable ingredients for vitamins.  A third example might be the silence regarding the importance of sunlight and vitamin D as a prevention for many forms of cancer.<p>Regarding ""these statements have been evaluated by the FDA"" -- it's actually illegal for supplement companies to make anything that resembles a health claim about their own products, even if it's demonstratively true.<p>In general, the big problem with health information in the US (as you've demonstrated) is that it's inaccessible.  There's plenty of industry and financial interest in it remaining inaccessible.

Eating fruits is fine, but HFCS is dangerous.<p><i>""A high flux of fructose to the liver, the main organ capable of metabolizing this simple carbohydrate, perturbs glucose metabolism and glucose uptake pathways, and leads to a significantly enhanced rate of de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) synthesis, driven by the high flux of glycerol and acyl portions of TG molecules from fructose catabolism. These metabolic disturbances appear to underlie the induction of insulin resistance commonly observed with high fructose feeding in both humans and animal models. Fructose-induced insulin resistant states are commonly characterized by a profound metabolic dyslipidemia, which appears to result from hepatic and intestinal overproduction of atherogenic lipoprotein particles. Thus, emerging evidence from recent epidemiological and biochemical studies clearly suggests that the high dietary intake of fructose has rapidly become an important causative factor in the development of the metabolic syndrome.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/5</a>",1237152562

517259,comment,516778,516778,0,0,horia314,,,"Hello,<p>There's a small thinking shift between writing a game in an imperative style and writing it in a functional style. In particular, it's smaller, I think, for games than for other kinds of applications.<p>In a typical game, you have a global state - a series of objects describing the properties of the game world at a certain time. You continuously update these objects, based on what input you receive from the user, and then present those changes to him, by way of video and audio rendering.<p>In pseudoC it would look like this :<p>gameState s;
int time = 0;<p>int main() {
   load_resources();<p><pre><code>   while(!game_exit()) {
        get_input();
        update_state();
        render_video();
        render_audio();

        time = time + 1;
   }

   return 0;</code></pre>
}<p>Switching to a functional language, a way of thinking about the game flow I've found useful is this :<p>The main loop becomes a function of two parameters : the current game state and the current inputs. From these it computes the next state. After the current simulation tick has passed, the next game state become the current one, whatever video and audio you have is updated and new inputs are gathered. It would look like this :<p>int main() {
    game_loop(load_resources(),init_inputs(),0);
}<p>gameState game_loop(gameState currentState, gameInput inputs, int game_time)
{
     render_video(currentState);
     render_audio(currentState);<p><pre><code>     game_loop(next_state(currentState,inputs),new_inputs(),game_time + 1);</code></pre>
}<p>Yeah, in C it will blow your stack, but functional languages have to deal with recursion much more often, and what you see there will be optimised away to a loop and be executed in constant space.<p>Other things to note are that you see the state passed explicitly between functions (no relying on it inherently existing as a global) and that the shift is from modifing an object as the game progresses, to creating a new object to represent the new state of the world, and discarding the old one.<p>Languages, be it lisp, haskell, calm, scala, f# or python, java, c, c# (used as functional languages) are relatively easy to learn. What's hard is adapting your thinking to the strengths and limitations imposed by them.<p>Hope this helped.",1237151882
