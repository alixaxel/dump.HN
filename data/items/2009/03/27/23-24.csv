University shouldn't expect me to install windows, matlab, indesign, full office, visual studio, etc. on my own box. It's also nice to have a reference machine - it's much easier to work with ""project has to run on the standard uni boxes"" than ""it has to be compatible with X, Y, Z and compiled with V"". At my university they reduce energy usage / maintenance costs by using Sun Rays - we can login to a unix, or windows server, or just get a simple mozilla-only session which loads in a second or two.

535876,comment,535675,535837,0,0,gcv,,,"With regard to web apps, you ask a big question, which I, for one, am unprepared to address in a brief comment. In general, however, functional programming aims to make it easier to think about what a program does as it runs.<p>In imperative programming, you create variables and you change their values (or the values they reference). This is called mutable state. Functional programming claims that mutable state makes it difficult to reason about the value of a variable, because anything and anyone might have changed it. I happen to agree with this claim. Functional languages discourage, or outright forbid, changing variable values or referenced values. Instead, functional programs call functions in which the desired new value of the variable is an argument.<p>Initially, for people weaned on imperative languages, this is a mind-bender. It turns out, however, that with a little practice (I'd say less than two days of reading through SICP), that functional programs can be shorter and easier to understand than imperative programs. It turns out that modifying state becomes even trickier to think about once you introduce multiple threads of control. Variables clobbered by different threads leads to subtle and difficult bugs. A purely functional approach aims to eliminate this source of bugs at its root.",1238197340

Context also helps tremendously with disambiguation, one huge flaw in machine translation.<p>Culture is another interesting aspect.  What somebody might translate as a greeting might require a totally different literal translation in another language, but it's always hard to justify translations that aren't exactly literal.

What is the kind of problems (web app in particular) that functional programming helps to resolve? And if i dont use myself all the features of OOP in Ruby, does it makes me a ""functional programmer""? There must be some concepts that are unique to functional programming. What is the Essence of functional programming vs OOP programming? Why functional programming? (it would be nice for me to have a wikipedia page about this but in simple english).<p>Thanks in advance.",1238195493
