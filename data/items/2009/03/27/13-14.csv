Them sort of being the 'Emergency Room' staff for failed nations does give them insights into typical reasons for malfunction. I don't really have a grip (and most people don't) on how these huge sums here in the U.S., e.g. 4-5 trillion dollars estimated in bad assets on the books, add up. Reading Krugman/ de Long/ Cowen/ Kedrovsky etc. still hasn't given me enough perspective. So I'd like to see some input from people that know all the angles on how crooks get away with money! Their experience from developing nations is helpful.",1238162109

Setting aside the issue of how accurate these surveys are, one of the dominant traits of these organizations is that performance appraisals float up the chain of command as well as down.<p>This means that employees and junior managers get a chance to evaluate their bosses as much as the bosses evaluate them. I don't think Bezo's action shows a lack a faith in lower management but rather a ""trust but verify"" approach.<p>Of course it might be a more strategic approach to finding out how stuff really works on the front line. Given a big enough management structure the ""on the floor"" reality might not filter up to the board room correctly. Remember the game of gossip? That effect plagues large organizations.",1238162062

535037,comment,534562,534688,0,0,vyrotek,,,"Good suggestion for the tour.<p>So the private/public pages thing gets a little tricky and it has been on my mind since I started the project. Pages are actually default to public but that doesn't mean open to the internet. What that public means in this case is that any registered user can search/find and view the page. In short it basically works more like facebook and not myspace.<p>After viewing a few other sites that provide guestbook/forum type services I noticed that a lot of people (moms/dads/grandma) seem to be more willing to post emails and other contact information publicly because they trust the site for some reason. Which means google could crawl that.<p>Of course, as I mentioned I'm not convinced 100% yet that this is the right way to do it. There are definitely many people who just want to view the page and not bother with signing up. The alternative is to make public pages open to the internet so that any unregistered user can view it.<p>But that makes things interesting for the private pages. Thats because when we ask for the 'password' for a page we actually only ask for it once and then store the fact that you now have permission to view the missionary in the DB. Maybe the solution is to either create a cookie if they aren't a registered user or store it in the db if they are?",1238160862

Prodded by some buzzword-compliant\nconsultants they are expressing concerns that the app's underlying\ntechnologies - perl, modperl and mason - are becoming obsolete. They\nfeel that a web application framework must have 'rails' or some other\nbuzzword in its name.<p>But their main argument is that perl is declining as a web developement\nlanguage. Also they rightly feel that competent perl developers are\nbecoming harder to find.<p>What arguements could I use to address these concerns and convince them\nthat their initial investement in perl is still safe and won't be\nobsolete in 10 years?<p>The client's local developers (who maintain the app we've built) feel\nthat mason gives too much freedom to write messy code and badly\nstructure a web app.<p>Indeed mason has very little constraints, maybe just slightly more than\nstraight modperl. So it requires experienced, self-disciplined devs,\nwhich are few and far between.<p>So my second question is, what perl web development framework should we\nrecommend to our client?
