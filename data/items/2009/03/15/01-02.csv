The project is 10+ years old, but I don't believe the full history has been kept. We use Perforce, but several major developers don't fully trust it, and we're investigating other options.<p>It does seem to handle large binary files reasonably well, at least, though fully scanning for any changes (the equivalent of ""git status"") generally takes about two minutes on my computer, so it's a mixed blessing. I think tracking binary data would be better handled by a fundamentally different kind of tool, really; there are major differences between managing large binaries vs. managing heuristically merge-able, predominantly textual data.<p>* One example: Two functions with similar names but reversed arguments (i.e., methodA(from, to) and methodB(to, from)) had the arguments transposed during the merge in many, many files. It introduces some really subtle bugs. It also happened again during the next major merge from ongoing-development to release.",1237080753

Thus, as I said earlier, dose is not relevant.""</i><p>Is that based on your personal experience, your (unsubstantiated) belief, or any scientific data? This is an honest question. Though I have smoked pot, I never smoked more than one joint per night.<p>Sure it's none of my business how much other people consume just as long as no one gets harmed. But you're assuming that people are responsible and most people aren't. Murder is murder, but there are accidents that could be avoided if people were not mind-altered. And I am referring to alcohol, not pot.<p>I don't think it would be too ridiculous to hold pot to a higher standard than alcohol, for instance. Solely for practical reasons. Alcohol is legal. Pot is not. If imposing caps on consumption would reduce the resistance to the legalization of pot, then it COULD be worth considering. This is speculation. I am not saying it would be worth it, I am just saying one should not discard any possibilities without a more in-depth analysis.",1237078817
