519667,comment,519649,519649,0,0,buugs,,,"Seems like a really weird way to compare ratings, when you have match ups of childrens movies to horror movies or something along those lines I know I for one cannot compare two movies in separate genres well as you can't base them relatively. Just an opinion of mine, if you compare lets say stuart little to the omen, one person may choose the omen because they don't like animated childrens movies, another may choose stuart little because it made them feel fuzzy or w.e, now if you put the omen against halloween or stuart little against madagascar you get a more truthful comparison.<p>I guess I'm saying I would like it better if you had like different genres, they don't even have to be that specific like say horror action comedy family; and could compare withing those, but I guess that is limited with your selection right now.",1237283966

That society was actually doing better in comparsion with their neighbors in some aspect. Did you know that they have the cheapest international call rate on the continent?<p>However, I know little about them since I never travel there.(Iceland is historical so that's a different story) One has to travel to Somalia to decide for themsleves if anarchy actually work. Even then, you have to take into political situtation so you don't get a skewed view.(The UN is trying to establish a state I heard)<p>In as so much for special interest group. I thought such society will undobutly exists in a free market society but they probably will be kept in check by the free market. My big worry is more about the system collapsing into a centralized system, which become a big vector for corruption.<p>If you want the definte work on how a free market society might work, you might want to read the Machinery of Freedom, written by David Friedman.<p>However, I know no such works dealing only with organizing a society's incentive and disincentive structure to deal with corruption.",1237283812

519657,comment,519619,519619,0,0,yason,,,"It depends. :)<p>You don't need any in-depth knowledge that e.g. a university math student would gradually attain. On the other hand being rather good at, for example, high school math will help you understand basic concepts such as complexity (why 1000x operations is better than x^2 operations...)<p>Logic and logical thinking is also valuable but it can exist without much math per se. It also helps a lot to know set theory because you can think of many things in programming as sets.<p>On the other hand being smarter is more important than knowing math, because if you're smart you will usually pick up enough of any basic math that you need. Also, there are lots of people who like to, for some reason or another, explain and model their ideas and algorithms mostly ""in math"" whereas doing it ""in English"" would also be possible and much more comprehensible, thus removing an artificial barrier to understanding something.<p>However, most important of all is practising and hacking as much as you can because that's what eventually makes  you smart, with regard to programming too.",1237283444

The gist is that we're compiling a list of movies based on head to head votes, as an alternative to imdb star ratings.<p>The format is 1000 movies facing off in a round-robin tournament (~500k votes per round). We needed a non-arbitrary sample of movies to vote on, so we've started with a list of the Top 1000 US box-office takings. Each round, the bottom 50 will be culled to make room for the top 50 in the Up & Coming.<p>We're working on... 1. an 'add movie' page, allowing you to add any movie to the up&coming 2. member pages showing your own votes & reccomendations, 3. actor pages, ranking the movies people have been in by popularity.<p>Monetising... 1. netflix add-to-queue buttons, 2. amazon links (the site is great at reminding you of things you want to see), and feasibly 3. targetted advertising (ie. only show this ad to people who have voted for romcoms).",1237282750
