Any transaction executed by two entities at their own free will is generally supposed to be beneficial to both the entities, otherwise the transaction wouldn't have taken place. Yo mentioned only one side of the deal and it sounds as though you are here purely to help the US.<p>Coming to my argument part, I was not actually arguing that the immigration policy is good; it has its own problems. I was wondering about why ambitious people behave this way when they face obstacles. The fact that I have been seeing this attitude for quite sometime including on HN drove me crazy and I probably sounded more sarcastic than I would have wanted. Sorry about it.<p>Anyway, my point is this:\nPeople who are ambitious and want to achieve face many obstacles. If you are really serious, you jump over them, work around them, crawl under them, move ahead and work towards your goal. Obstacles won't stop people from realizing their dreams.\nIn Randy Pausch's words ""Brick walls are there for a reason. They let us prove how badly we want things.""

So if there's $1000 of fiat money in the system, then there's a total of (say) $1200 owed to the central bank.  So we have 2 corporations, each of which has borrowed $500 from the central bank, and owes $600 to it.  If the bank were unwilling to increase the money supply through further loans, then one of those corporations would necessarily default (assuming that they have to pay it back in the currency they borrowed.)

The skewed payoff may mean that you only need 25% accuracy to break even or it could mean that you need 95% accuracy to break even. It doesn't matter. Either way, you can effectively ignore it and consider, for a given payoff schedule, how your prediction algorithm will perform.<p>If we live in a universe where you can under-perform a coin toss and still make money because of how the bet is skewed, then I can do better by flipping a coin!<p>If the bet is skewed the other way, then we will both lose money but my coin toss will lose less.<p>Let me restate that: you can completely dissociate your prediction algorithm from your cost function<p><pre><code>  > As for the rest, what does ""opposite trade"" mean?

519057,comment,518586,518897,0,0,jgfoot,,,"It isn't so much that legalese is a separate language with its own subtleties; it is just that it is language with predictable effects in courts.  Think of contract language as code, except the only time you get to run it through a debugger is when someone sues.  Only then do you get to find out whether your code runs as intended, i.e. whether a judge interprets it to have the effect you intended.  Once language is proven to have a certain effect, lawyers like to re-use that language in the sometimes naive belief that it will always be given that meaning.  The tradeoff here is that the language can be difficult for laypeople to understand, especially as usages change.  Some of the most notorious legalisms are redundancies, like ""free and clear,"" that according to some scholars date back to the Norman conquest, when contracts were written simultaneously in two languages (free being Germanic, clear being Latinate).<p>There is another comparison here: recall how Joel Spolsky criticized the Netscape team for throwing out their old code and starting over?

It's like a creationist argument.  He says \nthat things were great in the late middle ages. Wages were the highest ever.\nWell that is true for a few hundred years either side of the fourteenth century.  But the\nreal reason is not the superiority of economic system, but because everyone else was \ndead. Sure wages were high. but that was because the hundred years war, the black plagues,\nand the little ice age had killed off 2-thirds of the population.  As soon as the\ngood times were over, it was misery all over again.  Contrast that with now.  Half the\nworld's population is middle class.  Three billion vs a few 10's of thousands in the\nlate 14th century.  And middle class today is a lot better than well-to-do of 600 \nyears ago.<p>Then he conflates a whole bunch of things, government monopoly with corporations, the \nBritish East India with American trade.  Government monopolies have a history as long\nas history.  The medieval guilds are an example.  The American patent system is another.\nBefore the invention of corporations, investors were partners in an enterprise and all\nwere liable far beyond their investments in the event of the enterprise's default.\nOver the long run the two are independent concepts.  If he made the argument that \nlarge corporations tend towards monopoly, he made it in an exceedingly roundabout\nway.  As far as I know the British East India Company had nothing to do with the \nAmericas.  There was a lot of tension because of a British law that all trade to \nand from British ports had to be on British ships.  The Americans sent their cotton\nto England because we did not have the manufacturing capacity to produce fine\nwoven cloth. (IP restrictions also.)<p>He also argues against government monopoly of currency.  You get things like grain\nbased currency when there is no stable currency.  Early in US history currency was\nprivately issued by banks.  That proved to be a pretty lousy system.  If the bank\nwent under, not only did you loose any deposits, the value of the currency went\nto zero.  Yeah, I would really like to be holding AIG currency right now.  It's\nbad enough they have my life insurance.  I live in California and we damned near \nhad California currency, because Republicans refused to allow a budget.  Nobody\nhere was looking forward to it.<p>I personally think we have a huge problems with monopolies: the banks, the energy\ncompanies, the information infrastructure, the drug companies.  And the recovery \nfinancing is making it worse.  Good stuff for HN discussion.  It's just that this\nguy is so wrong in so many places that he pollutes the discussion.",1237248541
