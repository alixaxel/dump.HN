Why make me re-authorize myself.<p>4) Creating an album before upload is an extra step.

508561,comment,508415,508415,0,0,tptacek,,,"Well this post sure makes an incisive point about the power of... successive powers of 2? We could add just 4 bits to IPv4 addresses and address any reasonable addressing argument, providing 10-20 static IP addresses for every man, woman, and child on the planet. That's not the challenge.<p>The challenges are:<p>* It is extremely painful to migrate from IPv4 to IPv6, not just because of the obvious stuff (like renumbering and upgrading routers) but also because tons of important programs are written to assume an IP address is 4 bytes long, or fits in a scalar data type.<p>* The argument for enduring that pain is weak. There are 6 billion people in the world, so we can't number them directly. But I haven't had a static IP address in years and years, and if you offered me an address out of 172/8 for my laptop I wouldn't take it. Most of the Internet works fine through NAT, and the trend is towards more NAT-friendliness.<p>* Any argument about the scarcity of IP addresses is clouded by the fact that IP addresses are doled out OPEC-style by a cartel of standards groups with an ideological bias towards hastening IPv6 adoption. There's no liquid market for netblocks, so we don't know what they're actually worth. Of course, if we had such a market, we'd probably find out that they're not worth all that much to people with laptops, and readily affordable for people with servers.<p>Put differently, in a vain attempt to steer this back to the topic at hand: you could make a similar point about the sheer size and flexibility of ASN.1 and X.500 directory naming schemes. But nobody's talking about chucking the DNS to get that.",1236614031

Youtube, Digg, Facebook, Myspace, etc, none of those would be as big as they are today if they charged users.<p>However becoming big is hard, so you're left with a big decision — a hard, if not impossible road to become massive while still being profitable and not charging users, or target only the (smaller) paying audience, but remain profitable from near enough day one.

508531,comment,508475,508475,0,0,mdasen,,,"The reason that the web lost faith in charging for stuff is that marginal cost is so low.  What is the cost to 37signals of having another customer sign up for one of their services?  If I sign up for the $49/mo. Basecamp product, they are offering me 10GB of storage as well as bandwidth and application processing.  None of that has a high marginal cost.  Maybe $5/mo?  Plus, many users won't use all that space so it's a maximum of $5, but the average marginal cost would probably be a good deal lower.<p>So, while many applications might have very high fixed costs (like paying people to create wonderful applications like those in 37signals portfolio), they have marginal costs that are so insignificant that people would like to charge customers less and get more customers - often ending up with them wanting to give it away for free for maximum uptake (with the whole profit thing put off until later).<p>Beyond that, some applications you can't charge for.  37signals has a portfolio of applications that don't get better for users as more people use it.  That's unlike Facebook, Delicious, Digg, Wikipedia, etc.  If those services charged a monthly fee, it would degrade the content that the sites have.  Facebook isn't useful if they only retain 10% of their user-base because they're charging $10/mo.  So, some websites must try alternative ways of monieization since charging users isn't an option.<p>Finally, the web often forgoes charging for stuff because they get big paydays for it.  StumbleUpon got $75M.  Reddit commanded at least a few million.  Digg is looking for hundreds of millions while having no plan for profitability.  Facebook is looking for tens of billions with no plan to make money!  Jaiku was bought for millions.  YouTube for $1.5B. I don't need to go on.  People get rewarded for the behavior of creating a site with no expectation of profits.  As long as that's working, they'll keep doing it.<p>Personally, I think 37signals has the right idea.  But that won't stop people from making free sites with no profit plan which they hope to get bought since it happens enough.  Yeah, I'm not going to create visions for myself of taking over the world, but others thrive on that.  As long as there is some potential of getting bought for millions and a low marginal cost, people will create those free sites.",1236613190

I think some components to the recipe for success are: reasonably dense population, lots of car traffic, convenience (train stations have to be fairly close to where people want to go, and connected to other public transport), reasonable distances (less than plane distances, greater than bus distances).  Another thing that helps here in Italy is that they're reasonably frequent between major destinations... if I miss one train to Venice or Vicenza, there will certainly be another one in an hour, if not a half an hour.<p>In other words, in the US, it makes sense to build trains, say, in the bay area, but probably not so much between San Francisco and Los Angeles - there isn't <i>that</i> much car traffic <i>between</i> the two cities, and in LA, which is so spread out, you're screwed if you depend on public transportation.  Also, it's far enough that a plane is a lot faster.  On the other hand, Milan to Rome is roughly a four hour train ride, center to center - so by the time you factor in going to the airport, checking in, flying, baggage claim, getting back to the center of Rome, they take about the same time, and the train is less stressful.",1236611430

Though I am blessed with friends who still call me ""young man"", I'm no longer a kid, and I'm a veteran of many years of lecture-based courses. But that era is over. There's no longer any technical reason to deliver lectures in uninterrupted fifty-minute blocks. And it turns out that they only reason I ever liked that format is that I didn't have alternatives.<p>I've attended so, so many physics lectures. They break naturally into chunks: Some scene-setting (""let's talk about conservation of momentum in two dimensions""), proposing a problem (""here's an ice rink with two hockey pucks that collide""), a derivation (equation, equation, chalk dust, erasure, equation, more chalk dust, fix the sign error), a summary (""look, momentum is conserved! And we can draw the following general lesson...""), questions from the audience, and finally a bunch of homework problems.<p>How great it would be to have each of these chunks be recorded as separate bits of video. You could play through the scene-setting and the summary multiple times. You could play through the derivation at higher speed, slowing down or repeating the bits where the prof makes a subtle point but speeding through the parts which are obvious to you. You can skip the student questions that you already understand but play through the subtle ones more than once.<p>About the only disadvantage of this way of learning is that it's kind of isolating. It would be nice to combine it with lots of lab-type gatherings where all the students can join together and feel like a team.<p>---<p>[1] I had a few professors who avoided using chalkboards. They would provide handouts with the day's derivations and equations on them, then use an overhead projector with slides. (This was all before Powerpoint was widely available in academia.)<p>This was a mixed bag. It worked okay, but it wasn't an obvious big win over chalkboards. One advantage of the chalkboard is that it is very flexible: you can gesture at it, redo it on demand, or scrawl circles and arrows all over it. Another advantage is that it is typically <i>huge</i>, offering you lots of opportunity to, say, write Maxwell's equations in a box to the left and leave them up through the whole lecture for reference. Finally, chalkboard derivations go up slowly (sometimes <i>really</i> slowly, if the writer is not well practiced), which can be bad, but which also makes it easy for the professor to interject meaningful comments.<p>But I think the availability of digital video playback, cheap cameras, and nonlinear editing changes this problem a lot.",1236611410
