They did have major uptime issues but I think that's mostly in the past. I'm not on 100% of the time so it's quite possible I missed a few sightings but back in the summer and fall it would go down a lot whereas now it's a rare occurrence.",1235958967

499553,comment,498581,499083,0,0,amix,,,"Like I have already stated I am interested in how the system will run in production. Generally, you will do lots of small updates and lots of small fetches with key-value databases. You won't do batch operations - which makes your benchmark pretty irrelevant.<p>Try to benchmark your relational database by doing this:
- create a new connection
- fetch one row
- close connection<p>And try to compare this to selecting multiple rows at once. The result will be MUCH different. And this basically outlines the difference between your benchmark and mine.<p>This said, you will only hit limitations with a relational databases if you are having lots of data. If you run a blog, a low traffic site or can keep all your data in memory, then you won't have any problems. And I do have experience in the world of relational databases and using MSSQL won't solve this problem for you (else you would see Facebook, Friendfeed, Twitter and Google etc. use MSSQL or Oracle).",1235958068

Linus seems to have taken organic route, gradually

of the other strategy, the two-job route, of 
which they are the most extreme form.<p>(For a few very lucky people, a startup can
also be one's life's work.  But it's usually 
all one can do to make a startup succeed without
also satisfying that constraint.)",1235957677

In fact, what a massive user base does do is to create so much cost in running the service that it's hard to find a way to make a profit.<p>Twitter's already $55 million dollars down which shows just how much it costs to run the service.  So even if every one of Snoop Dogg's 25,000 followers were willing to pay a dollar (unlikely) and Twitter got all the profit from it the money wouldn't make a dent in the cost of running such a massive operation.",1235957351

Give Facebook some time!<p>I agree with Facebook board member Marc Andreesen's assessment: Facebook could be profitable and make over a billion in annual revenue whenever they choose. Instead, they're forgoing that for bigger riches -- and even more entrenched market power -- down the road. Facebook understands the game they're playing.<p>Facebook users face higher switching costs than Google search users. And individual features in Facebook -- photo sharing, status streams, comment threads, group utilities, invitations/RSVPs, instant-messaging, etc. -- already compete against multiple other companies.<p>When Facebook turns on their revenue spigot -- whatever it turns out to be -- they will look a lot like Google, in the same ways the article highlights. They will be subsidizing a bunch of free services, to the detriment of potential competitors, to defend their master proprietary asset -- the social graph plus a critical mass of users -- and the massive revenue that flows from it.",1235956843

499535,comment,499067,499067,0,0,hedgehog,,,"As a few people have already pointed out, right now App Engine is missing functionality that a lot of apps need. Right now coding to App Engine means lock-in to a single hosting provider.<p>But that's today, and I think the business will grow up fast. Hosting apps and databases rather than VMs and block devices (Amazon's current model) allow more granular control of resource allocation. At the same time the app hosting model lets you export problems such as geographic replication and failover to the hosting provider. The app hosting business can be accelerated by building on top of VM hosting infrastructure from companies like Amazon.<p>The way I see this playing out: VM hosting will continue to proliferate. App hosting will start to get popular and the frameworks will get fleshed out with the functionality 80% app developers need. App hosting companies will build their infrastructure on top of VM hosting infrastructure. Interoperability standards will get created (probably in the form of extensions to frameworks like Rails and Django). As there are more companies offering app hosting and the hosting environments get more feature-complete companies will start to switch for new development. In another 3-5 years we will see most new services being built on app hosting rather than dedicated/shared/VM hosting.<p>For legacy apps and apps that don't fit in the limitations of something like App Engine the VM hosting model works well. I've written one app on App Engine and I'm in the process of moving my company's legacy code base to EC2 hosting right now. VM hosting is always going to give you more control than app hosting just like running your own hardware will always give you more control than VM hosting. That said app hosting will give developers more pre-built infrastructure. How many devs actually want to patch servers or set up MySQL site-site replication? Negotiate bandwidth contracts? Rack servers? Not only is that stuff irritating to deal with, it costs money. App hosting is a pretty big win.<p>So is App Engine the wrong product? I don't think so, it's just not done yet.",1235955979
499534,comment,498588,498588,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"What makes a time travel story good isn't the machine or lack thereof, it's the consistency.  A good time travel story sets up its rules for time travel, sticks to them, and makes a good plot out of it.  This is what makes the story pass the ""suspension of disbelief"" test--not the believability of the machine or devices involved, but whether the story has a self-consistent set of rules and abides by it.  Of course, it isn't a coincidence that the stories that don't try to fit hard science into the mix are the same ones that tend to violate their own rules.<p>A simple example of this being violated is the case of having a story that tries to use <i>both</i> the ""many worlds"" theory of time travel <i>and</i> the ""paradox"" theory of time travel.  Obviously, they're mutually incompatible.  Another common example is the concept of ""San Dimas Time""--having a ""race against the clock"" situation in a time travel story, even though this makes absolutely no sense at all.  To quote TVTropes:<p><i>""As a result, events in two different time periods are shown to happen concurrently, so that people two years in the past may only have X minutes to stop the villain from committing some terrible act in the present, even though they should technically have X minutes plus two years to sort it all out. This, of course, makes no sense at all.""</i><p>The best time travel film I've seen recently is Primer.  The story is quite convoluted--enjoy your multiple temporal paradoxes and the fact that most of the timelines are merely implied to exist, not shown--but it is still quite a good watch.  And for when you're done, there are charts on the internet explaining the full extent of all the events involved, so you can figure out those last few loose ends for yourself.",1235955961
