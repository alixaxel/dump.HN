To be honest it can be argued that obama would have won by a much larger margin in america given that 16/17 year olds could vote, and though this could probably show a good thing most people that age do not understand the government nor any policy action that would be put in place by there vote.  At 18 there is already some trouble in my opinion especially seen by such ad campaigns as vote or die, or teenagers coming on tv saying I'm voting for so and so because they are more handsome etc.. you find this much less in older age groups.",1236740124

511180,comment,510872,511143,0,0,bokonist,,,"You are confusing ownership with being a customer.  Customers pay rent/taxes.  Owners exercise control.  The charter of modern democracies promise equal ownership based on birth or residency, not on whether or not you pay rent.  Or rather, the preamble states the goal of equal ownership.  The fine print in the thousands of pages of legal code give actual ownership to an oligarchy of the civil service, congressional committees, and organized factions.  You may like to get an ownership share based on paying rent, but you have no legal or moral claim to it, just as you have no legal or moral claim on controlling your landlords' spending.<p>BTW, you are also confusing totalitarian with authoritarian.  Authoritarians deals with the management structure of a government, totalitarian with the scope of its activities.  The US government in 1800 was non-authoritarian, non-totalitarian.  Stalin was authoritarian and totalitarian.  USG in 2009 is non-authoritarian, totalitarian.  Louis the XIV was authoritarian, non-totalitarian.",1236739320

You just have to practice a bit for 3 days to learn to get the right fingers on the right keys from memory. The key to learning quickly is that you try to reproduce some text on the screen while NOT LOOKING at the keyboard, and you go as slowly as you need to avoid looking up (well, down), it doesn't matter if it takes 15 seconds for one keystroke at first. The important thing is to try a recall from memory at all costs before you finally know you've really completely forgotten and then look it up. And you do like this for each letter.

The older you tend to get, the more unique experiences you tend to have. If you ever are fortunate enough to meet anyone who had to become a head of household at a young age, compare them against someone a few years older then them and see the results. When a boy or girl takes responsibility for younger siblings or a parent that can't function well as early as 14-16, they're a hell of a lot more mature at 18 than most people are at 25 when they're starting to get promoted out of entry level jobs. No doubt entrepreneurship, becoming a parent, traveling and/or immigrating, working, leading, managing, and so on add to maturity.<p>Regardless though, lowering the voting age won't make that much of a difference.

The current system protects children from politics, but why?<p>You mention targeted political pressure, but only in a vague sense; it almost seems like foreboding of something unknown, and therefore scary and threatening. It may not be for you, but for people who develop this sense of foreboding about everything unknown, this sort of argument can carry a lot of weight.<p>Anyway, this pressure already exists. It is how people already have formed political identities when they reach voting age, and are willing to defend them, even irrationally, against people of differing political philosophies.

Protecting them in this sense seems like an almost insurmountable problem.<p>Or maybe I misunderstood what you mean by political pressure?",1236736886
