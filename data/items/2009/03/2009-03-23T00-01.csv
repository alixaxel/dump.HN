Just put the link in an HTML comment where the source is loaded, or at the top of the source file.<p>You're another one of those so-called pragmatists who only thinks about the short-term, ja?<p>Just think, 20+ years ago there wasn't very much free software (nor very much open source software).

Yes, but only as a marketing slogan, with companies co-opting it and the consumer never really knowing exactly what it means for software to be free.<p>>We've got to move away from this notion that software should be free (gratis).<p>You're allowed to charge money for any Free Software.

You do know who RMS is, yes?<p>His overriding concern as an ongoing basis is that people should have the freedom to tinker with software - to be able to read, improve, share the programs we are running.<p>He's not arguing that you're falling into a personal, small scale 'trap' like you will get your finger stuck or something, but that whole groups of people who care may not have noticed this set of events sneaking past them.<p>Or that this is yet another area where we should care, but don't, and that should change so that if you do care, you <i>can</i> do something about it.<p><i>No end users care.</i><p>That maybe true, but it shouldn't be true.<p><i>I think the majority just care if something solves their problem, rather than if its open source or not.</i><p>Exactly the problem - this week I saw an end user called us up asking us to help get some information out of a program they run. Luckily, it runs on a popular database backend. Unluckily, it's proprietary closed source software and there is no documentation of what the database tables and fields mean or how they are used.<p>They bought it because it ""solved their problem"". Now that lead to other problems. Problems which are both completely predictable (information stuck in artificially limited proprietary system) and avoidable (use artificial-limitation-free documented open system).<p>And on a more general level, promote the use of such across the entire computing industry so such programs become available.",1237769005

The idea of hiring someone to help with a blog is also good, however I think it might be costly for me at the moment... If you don't mind me asking, how much those guys charge? I understand there is a huge difference if I give my text to proof-read or order original content... Maybe some rough figure... Thanks!",1237767065

That means you can feed people with a quarter of the land, and therefore half the pollution. The real numbers aren't so simple, but the principle still applies. This focus on local organic food sounds driven more by warm fuzzy feelings than by reality.",1237767051

Remove the users and the service is worth nothing. You can't say that about shrink-wrap software; even if the great majority of the people don't use it, there is that one or two lucrative corporate or government contract to make it all worthwhile.<p>So in that light, shouldn't the users of web apps be entitled to something a little more than ""free use""? Say, a little assurance that the platform they trust so much of their private lives is transparent, extensible, and should the company sink tomorrow, available for replication?<p>What happens when you strike it rich, sell the startup to a Mega Corp and move to Tahiti?

527693,comment,527627,527627,0,0,lethain,,,"Stallman surely realizes that minifying JavaScript is a standard process, but it doesn't seem particularly relevant to his point. First, it not straightforward to determine the licensing for many scripts, and second it does not provide access to an unobfuscated copy of the source. In no way does he ask for JavaScript to be served without minification, but rather he asks that minified JS contain a pointer to a non-minified copy. Doing so doesn't create an additional cost for the site owner, beyond possibly requiring an extra step in a build script.<p>I think you are pushing two distinct movements into the same
box: the free software movement championed by Stallman, and the ""get users first, monetize later"" euphoria of the ""Web 2.0"" movement. The first group is pursuing a moral agenda; the second believes that it is a legitimate route to wealth. Much of what you are blaming Stallman for seems better directed at the second movement or at open source developers (who are often a very different breed than Stallman, and who--in my experience--tend to hate the GPL as an unnecessarily restrictive license).<p>I also find your example of iPhone and Facebook applications as somewhat problematic. These platforms are ghettos where developers are dependent on the capricious rules and regulations provided by the owners. This is hard to ignore when you see traffic to applications dropping by a reported 50% after the latest redesign for Facebook, and also when independent apps like Podcaster (err, whatever the name was) barred from the AppStore because it competed with functionality that Apple's own apps provided. Opportunity abounds in both, but there are many many losers in both as well. The real winner in both these situations is Apple and Facebook. Asking forgiveness from Marx, when possible it is always best to be the landlord.<p>My second to last point in this unfortunately disconnected response is that neither Stallman nor Web 2.0 have <i>ever</i> been the ""guard"". Both are and have always been fringe movements. The ""guard"" has always been large companies selling software to other large companies and making tremendous sums of money while doing so.<p>Finally, people do get paid for open source contributions. It isn't straight forward, and the correlation between time spent and money returned is not predictable in the same way it is for an hourly consultant gig, but there is always money there for people who grasp it.",1237766643
