I don't think holding him responsible for every possible vulnerability is really all that practical, especially when the code is wide open.

Correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm NOT a web guru, but I think there are three ways to get the user names, and it's enough if this only works in some cases:<p>(1) Brute force (look at who's currently active on the site)<p>(2) Look at browser history (HN users have to constantly look at their own profile to check for replies, and the URL contains their user name)<p>(3) Send whatever request the browser sends to HN normally, and gets the user name embedded in the page.<p>Again, I don't know enough about browsers/JS/HTTP/HN to know if any of the above would work. I'm just saying I'm not sure that explicitly giving out your user name is required for this.<p>Edit: typos",1237259562

Now that I've given this loan, a lot of my money is stuck and I can't give loans to other people. However, I know it's a good loan with a very low risk of default. So I turn and say ""Hey, I've given this loan, and here are the details which explain how much this loan is worth in non-real terms. You'll have to guess at the market interest rate to figure out the ""real"" (economic term) ""value"", but that's doable. Would you like to buy it from me?""<p>If someone agrees to take possession of the loan, they'll have to reimburse the bank. Hey look! The bank has capital to repeat the process until it can't find any buyers of these loans. It's a good, honest bank, so it doesn't do anything fishy to move more loans. Eventually, we hit an equilibrium between people buying these loans, the bank holding loans, and people getting mortgages.<p>Now you're telling me a derivative, the thing the bank sold, has no value?

519309,comment,518508,519154,0,0,felixc,,,"Yes, completely different.<p>Proof by contradiction means that you start by assuming the opposite of what you wish to prove, and then logically arriving at a contradiction. The existence of a contradiction implies that your premises were false, and since your premise was the opposite of what you wanted to prove, what you wished to prove must be true.<p>Proof by induction works by showing that a particular case (usually the first/smallest case) is true, and then showing that the fact that one case is true implies that the next case is also true. In other words, prove that your statement is true for n=1, and then prove that if the statement is true for m, it is also true for m+1. Since it's true for n=1, that implies it's true for n+1=2, and since it's true for n=2, that implies it's true for n+1=3, and so on, and thus you have proven that it's true for all n larger than your original case. Of course, it doesn't <i>have</i> to be that n implies n+1 -- it can be n-1, or any other variant, the point is that it chains up and leads to all values being proven.",1237259151

Words, like numbers, are ultimately just empty buckets with a bunch of tags attached that tell us something about how it interacts with the world.
