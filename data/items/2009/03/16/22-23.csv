Luckily, we've progressed past mercantilism in many ways, and fiat money <i>could</i> be easily replaced without destroying the economy.<p>His conclusions about the banking system seems a hopeless confusion between <i>central</i> banking and a market for capital. He indicts the former, yet wants to tear down the latter.<p>While he seems to be aiming at corporatism (or corporate fascism), he only takes an unsupported swipe at corporations in general, placing all blame on their shoulders without acknowledging any blame that might fall on the government and democracy.<p>Saying ""For one business to pay back what it owes, another must go bankrupt"", he reveals a childish idea that all business must be zero-sum, so that there must always be a winner and a loser. But it can plainly be seen, when two parties freely enter into a transaction, that <i>both</i> feel that they are coming out ahead.<p>He seems never to have considered that business can actually <i>create</i> wealth.

The EU has over 20 official languages, and all legislation approved by the EU needs to be translated into all of the languages. (The situation is further complicated by several categories of laws: EU regulations are practically equal to federal laws, whereas EU directives are ""law blueprints"" that must be translated into national law, thus giving member states some leeway on how to implement them.)<p>I don't know exactly how EU lawmaking works (nor do I really want to know too much about what goes on in that monstrous Brussels/Strasbourg sausage factory), but I'd presume that the law drafts are most commonly worked out in English and French. A final document is then produced in either of these dominant languages, but it's written in a specific form to make it easier to translate into 20+ languages without catastrophic signal loss.<p>Your system could replace that subset of English or French... And it might actually be fairly easily accepted by EU officials because it would offer a scientific, seemingly objective solution to the perennial problem of what language the EU itself speaks (currently the situation is rather close to ""all EU languages are equal, but some are more equal than others"").",1237243972

There's something wrong with a system that allows one individual to amass more wealth than the bottom 40% of the population combined.

518920,comment,518281,518807,0,0,katz,,,"> But when I read ""people from Culture X tend to succeed; therefore we should give them a preference"" what can I call that statement but racist?<p>Firstly, culture is not equal to race - it has nothing to do with race. The criticism against racism is usually because it is immutable (a person can not change his race) and race does not have any bearing on how a person acts (i.e. your personality is effected by the environment) or his intelligence.<p>Culture is the opposite of race - culture will determine how a person will react in certain situations. Culture can also be changed. People of all creeds can have “western” culture – i.e. democracy and respect for human rights. Other cultures have aspects that is undoubtedly perpendicular to western cultures (e.g. in its treatment of women).

Not much, maybe the higher cost of living/higher legal fees etc.  However, I agree that making a successful startup in the UK is a far harder, and it's probably due in part to that lack of an identifiable community.<p>There just doesn't seem to be the same depth of startup culture that exists in the US;  the UK has no Silicon Valley and the online situation just reflects this.  I think that's because we don't have a long history of really successful Internet startups.<p>The European VC scene does seem to be a little bit of a cargo cult version of the US model.  The UK YCombinator doesn't exist, because there was no UK Yahoo! to sell the UK Viaweb to.  As a consequence of this today's UK startup community is shepherded by individuals and companies with little Internet startup experience of their own.<p>It's kind of like having parents who were never themselves children.<p>As others have suggested on here, we could certainly build the software to create a place for UK startups to hangout.

Why not just start a discussion?<p>-- The name did make me think there'd be live timing function. Unless the thing with the broken, blinking <i>00h00</i> is it.<p>-- Project naming is broken. You allow projects to be named with more than one word, but things break if you do that: you can't use <i>@Project Name</i>, and todos added to a multi-word–named project are saved incorrectly and only get tagged with the first word of the project, so they aren't added to the project at all.<p>-- The projects should not be listed with arrows between: they imply a hierarchy where there isn't one. Also the general design breaks with more than two realistically named projects: <a href=""http://imgur.com/Q49W.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/Q49W.jpg</a><p>Seriously, everyone should work with <i>real</i> examples. It takes time and mental effort to enter realistic data, but how else will you know how well your product works? <i>And</i> you'll be able to take much nicer looking screenshots that actually show what your product can handle rather than only hint at it and make me figure the rest out myself.",1237241432

You may as well drop them - maybe replace with a <i>screenshot</i> tour (I don't usually like watching videos because you can't skim through them).<p>Also on front page, your tag line (""For individuals ..."") is too close to the word ""planning"" with a big gap underneath it. The tagline could be very much bigger and make better use of the available space.<p>Your signup page is a bit of an eyeful. I like the narrative on the fields, but maybe put the elements in a table with the narrative in a column on the left (in place of regular labels) and the fields on the right. However, thanks for guessing my timezone correctly (or maybe it was a lucky default ;) and letting me change the date format up-front.<p>The video is too long at 5 minutes. My (admittedly short) attention span ran out at 2 minutes. In fact, the first two minutes were enough to convince me to sign up based on the look and feel, etc. Someone I know who does marketing told me ""give them just enough information to choose you over your competitors. Everything else is wasted."" So less is more on the video front.<p>However, I did sign up and I like the look of the app itself. Judging from your help page, there's a lot to know so maybe you should make those pages into a PDF so people can print cheat-sheets? Looks like each section should fit nicely on an A4/letter page.<p>Sounds like I'm being critical but it looks like a great app and I wish you luck with it. I'll try to use it some more and post again.",1237241255

The way that you just hover over everything and get to see what different features do without committing to anything allows me to explore your app without much fuss.<p>Feature requests:<p>1.) When I add a task, sometimes I'd like to add a really detailed description (or any description for that matter) (i.e. a project spec) and I'd like the ability to do that. The ability to bold, italicize, change font size and format, etc, would be helpful in descriptions.<p>2.) Attachments. I want to be able to attach files to my tasks.<p>3.) Keep the above features out of the way. Most of the time I won't need them, but when I do, I really need them.<p>EDIT: 4.) Just realized that the projects aren't hierarchical. I expected them to be, and it doesn't allow me to be super organized for more complex projects/tasks.
