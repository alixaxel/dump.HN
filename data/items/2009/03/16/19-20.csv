The legal expenses are no different from any other one time expense such as a sign-on bonus. As such, just like sign on bonuses, if an employer believes they would be compensated for their legal expenses only if I stay there for X years, they should put it on a contract. If I think it's fair as well, I'll sign it.",1237233590

518663,comment,518177,518568,0,0,lethain,,,"There are a number of areas where Findjango--or vertical search engines in general--can outperform a mainstream search engine. It's certainly a work in progress.<p>1. ""Perfect answers"" that relate to the topic at hand. For example, Findjango has an index of Django's documentation and lists related documentation at the top (above search results). For a large percentage of searches, those links will answer the search immediately (also, the links deeplink to the correct location on the documentation page, as opposed to simply dropping you at the page's beginning).<p>2. Because of a narrow scope, it is possible for a vertical search to be more current.<p>3. Because of the narrow scope, it is possible to apply custom relevancy algorithms suited to the specific niche which may outperform generic relevancy algorithms. Findjango  has begun traveling this route, but is clearly not there yet.<p>4. The ability to collect and display targeted metadata. Although I'm not taking advantage of it yet, Findjango knows the number of followers and last commit date for each GitHub  repository, and can display them in-line in the SERP. For a targeted audience this can be worthwhile to add, whereas for a main-stream search it would represented a negligible usecase.<p>5. I believe that vertical search engines can be monetized much more effectively--and while doing so create more added value for the user--than a generic search engine. Certainly I have no numbers to back this up as of yet.<p>In the end, my argument is that a vertical search can outperform a general search engine within its vertical. It is certainly not my argument that it will inherently outperform, and certainly Findjango lacks the breadth of content to compete thus far.<p>This is a long-term project, certainly not an overnight road to success.",1237233408

I think everyone involved benefits:<p>* More startups get to receive YC aid and funding, and these startups are more likely to have (as a group) advice from/access to a top-tier VC firm.<p>* YC gets to fund more companies, while spreading the additional risk and reward around. This also means they get to expand the YC alumni network at a faster rate.<p>* Sequoia gets to invest, via YC, in web companies that may not need big enough rounds of funding for it to directly be worth Sequoia's time. And they arguably get a slight edge in investing in those YC startups that <i>do</i> wind up wanting more money later.

And I'm quite sure doing so would've saved him a lot of time and trouble.<p>I use Windows as well as OS X, and, knowing both sides, OS X is just so much more comfortable to use. Especially for people without previous knowledge, such as my mom or my sister. I did install OS X on my sister's Eee PC a while back and it runs great, she's never had any trouble with it.  I'm confident it would've worked with his mother too. (Though buying a MacBook is much less trouble than hacking OS X on any other system)",1237231268

It could be the way I wear them or maybe their size. Using the wax earplugs, with very loud construction works at say 200m away, I can block out enough for me to work and I can't hear the TV in the other room with open door.<p>One thing with wax though, they are waterproof. I do feel a little pressure build up so it might take a little getting used to.",1237231196

They are doing their projects  with the hopes of getting a gallery show or maybe some contract work making a blinky display for a Macy's holiday window. The levels of desperation and competitiveness surrounding this activity are much higher in NYC than places where Arduino hacking is just considered an obscure hobby.<p>In contrast, in SF/Silicon Valley the people doing physical computing hacks are all well-paid engineers or programmers during the day and the arduino-artsy stuff is just a hobby. Nobody makes any money off of it and they are happy to share tips. Also, everyone in Silicon Valley already knows that you just buy everything from Digikey. ;)",1237230857

It's unlikely that the community will get swayed too far in one direction or another (all games need programming, and it's nice to have good art). ""Idea men"" have to find some sort of talent they can use for their team, otherwise they'll just be ignored or, at best, used as a playtester or level/content designer.<p>Negatives are that you have to clear out an entire weekend, and find a place with power and wifi that will let you stay (and potentially sleep) there.",1237230815
