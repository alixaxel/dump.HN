""Are you happy with incomplete understanding of API, provided that your app seems to work?""<p>For me, the answer is ""not always"". When the topic is security or performance, I definitely prefer to have as much knowledge of the API as possible.<p>I remember reading an interesting article about Java's File and how the internal implementation used null terminated strings (which ultimately meant that you could bypass a string-based check (such as 'filename.endsWith("".jpg"")' and have the subsequent new File(filename) call open a different file than you'd expect.<p>On a different story, I was able to speed-up a web-app  speed significantly because I knew (from reading the js library's source code) that the DOM querying functions we were using so extensively were very inefficient.<p>With those anedoctes out of the way, I'll say that knowing how every single function in every single API ticks is probably overkill.

When it's good, it's really, really good and when it's bad it's better than nothing.'<p>But apart from stuff like javadocs (which usually is just type information and fairly relaiable but generally uninformative) any coder with a few years under their belt will just see documentation as signposts. Stuff that might, just might, get you part of the way there.<p>Let's take Microsoft as an example. Everyone is always going on about how stellar their documentation is. And they're right. MS does documentation for established products really well. But if you happen to be interested in, say, the limits of the jscript library ... well, you're out of luck. It becomes a hole and you have to resort to black box techniques or reverse engineering to figure out what those limits are.<p>Also, software documentation has its own scale. Where do you put all the documentation you're supposed to be writing about your codebase? Some of that is easy ('document a method') but as you move up the abstraction scale you end up with tutorials, which obviously have no place in source code. Where do you draw the line and how do you manage to keep the documentation outside of the source in sync with the source? And while we're on it, changes in source will have to be kept in sync with documentation about it that exists somewhere in the codebase.<p>(All of this is no excuse for not actually having good documentation, btw).",1237855197

An abstraction can include changes of (abstract) state, and it can include performance characteristics/gotchas (as in Joel's ""Leaky Abstractions"").<p>An API can be designed for learning, by forming a series of nested abstractions, such that you can completely understand each well-defined subset independent of understanding all the other subsets. Perhaps an example is a String object in Java or Python. Understanding creation and assignment is a completely self-contained subset of its functionality, without using any of its methods (as such). A deeper level of understanding includes performance characteristics.<p>To answer the question: I feel I must understand the <i>subset of the abstraction</i> that I am using, in order be confident in the correctness of my code.<p>But many APIs are not designed this way. Designing APIs for usability is <i>hard</i>, and most programmers prioritize features, performance and internal elegance over it. <i>I suffered to write this. Now it's your turn.</i><p>And, worse, the <i>implementations</i> of many APIs have bugs (well, all of them do). It's just that <i>more users find more bugs</i>, so more popular libraries usually have fewer bugs (in their mature parts).<p>I find a constant pressure between writing the best possible code - and getting things done (one advantage of getting something done is it puts you at a vantage point where you can see more - and becoming part of the process of understanding).",1237854714

An ordered list is always ordered, the only question is whether ascending or descending.

I also feel like this is the dogma in ""formal"" neuroscience; it is hard for nurture to maintain favor when all you look at is whether some gene turned on or some phenotype expressed.<p>But, there is an area where it may be impossible to show either way, and you have a battle of religion. To see why this is the case, consider inherited fear responses (I forgot the actual term for this). You can, for example, probably train a goose to not fear an eagle-shaped shadow. There would be a measurable change in neuronal wiring, because the fear response previously paired to the pattern recognizers of eagle-shaped shadows is now inhibited or diverted. If this works, it is ""nurture.""<p>But to turn it around, the fact that you could re-train the goose would imply that plasticity was part of the equation. This is ""nature."" Then, there are parts where plasticity is simply never going to be part of the equation (without some extreme bioengineering): you cannot teach a modern goose to read, period.<p>So, to rephrase: it is possible to interpret <i>all</i> ""nurture"" phenomenon under an all-nature framework: it's simply a distinction of whether you are <i>born</i> with plasticity for certain domains of learning. This difference, which you can validly call nature vs. nurture, is meaningful in many contexts, but in my opinion is not so much a dichotomy than different ways of looking at the same thing.<p>I'm not all about predeterminism though; the important task to figure out what, why, how, and when circuits are plastic.",1237853956

It's about the highway exits. The circular highway is usually three lanes wide. It has exits, many of which are slow (entries to the city). The exits take the form of an additional lane to the right. When the ""contact zone"" of the rightmost lane with the additional lane is long and the traffic is middle or heavy, the jam is a sure thing.<p>Why? Even if the exit has a reasonable speed, there are drivers that wait until the last moment to take the additional lane. There are so many that most of the vehicles that reach the exit are of this kind. If you are kind enough to take the additional lane as soon as it is possible, you get caught in a trap for ten to twenty minutes.<p>It's a moral dilemma. Either I am a good citizen and agree to be victimized for a quarter of an hour daily or I do the same to others. Please, don't ask me what I do.<p>It also creates a jam for the cars that aren't taking the exit, because the late changes of lane affect them. Not only the right lane, but also the middle one are filled with ""late-exit-takers"". And the slow cars have to change lanes to avoid the stopped cars waiting to exit.<p>I've observed that there is a disposition of lanes that prevents the problem: separating two lanes to exit and two lanes to follow on the highway, making the exit lanes long enough (to have a ""buffer"" for the slowness of the exit) and the fork instant, not a long ""contact zone"". But this disposition is seldon used and I haven't really made the experiment to be sure :-)<p>About the article: I don't think the ants are similar to cars at all.
