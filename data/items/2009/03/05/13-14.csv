All they need to do raise 100 Crore from various financers and produce the film in 5 Crore. They would then make a film that will never work, a film that will be hooted out on the first day itself and run away with 95 Crore.",1236261058

It's not going to be email or the web that kills their current business model, it'll be higher-res printers.<p>I bet a fair share of desktop software persists soley because of how awkward it is to print from the browser. (The reason no one realizes that the URL, page number, and timestamp can be removed is entirely because of the unnecessary complexity of the UI.)<p>If Mozilla, Google, or Apple made their printing interface dramatically better (which would be synonymous with making it dramatically simpler) they might be able to win a surprising number of IE users. The correlation between technical proficiency and a penchant for hardcopies seems roughly inversely proportional. While, for instance, my parents don't see much additional value in using Chrome over IE for browsing, they'd probably use it exclusively if it made printing significantly more comfortable.",1236258523
