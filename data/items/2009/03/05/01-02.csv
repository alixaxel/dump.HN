Do the quick extrapolation on how many mothers there are in America, how many of them use the Internet, and how many you can reasonably convert.  Yeah, $40 million for a market leader doesn't seem that unreasonable now does it.<p>You will not get invited to give conferences at The Future Of Web 3.0 2012 if you make greeting cards.  Nobody will ask you for your insights on scaling, principally because at your scale it will be a boring engineering problem with well-understood solutions.  You'll just put smiles on a few mothers' faces and, oh, well, there might be a little bit of money involved.<p>I think I've mentioned this a few times, but to say it one more time: <i>grown women have money, too, and nobody in tech wants it</i>.

What's ""healthy"" depends how far you want to go down.<p>2. We don't know know how to eat healthy, just healthier. And what's healthier depends on the resolution you're looking at the body. Also you're particular goals and biology.<p>3. There's still a lot of conflict about basic things.<p>4. My old sense of black and white, bad foods and good foods, got destroyed; it wasn't nuanced.<p>For instance, even spinach and flaxseed contain cyanide [1]. Though not enough to kill you, in extremes they could. That was shocking, and just one example.<p>With eating and sleeping consider leptin levels. [2][3][4] Some people, because of obesity and overweightedness, in the long-term especially, have awkward leptin sensitivity. Also there are individual differences in genes and gene expression, or overall biology. And exercise factors too.<p>And that's just one hormone. You add insulin and how that reacts with leptin, and how that's effected by macro-nutrient balance, et cetera. At best I consider myself an intermediate in nutritional knowledge, considering what we now know. The next step up from interpreting papers on PubMed is producing them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/11/5762"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/11/5762</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062&ct=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-docum...</a>",1236217506

503717,comment,501696,503191,0,0,froo,,,"Except that I'm not talking about producing films. Yes, Pixar films are expensive because they are swinging for the fences.<p>That means they have many, many models, sets, textures etc that go into the production of any film, which of course increase your cost of production considerably. That's just a matter of fact.<p>What I have been saying is that if you take a different view, don't start out by trying to swing for the fences (you can always scale up later), essentially limit some of these choices you could probably get away with a smaller team in the beginning.<p>For example, lets move away from films for a second and talk about sitcoms. One of my favourite is Frasier.<p>Frasier has (for the most part) a very limited series of sets and characters. You have your 5 main characters, your 6 occasional supporting characters and for the most part these back and forths take place in 4 locations...<p>That's about 6 seasons of entertainment there for a sitcom, or about < 1 minute of Pixar animation.<p>That's really the kind of difference we're talking about in terms of cost of production.",1236217445
