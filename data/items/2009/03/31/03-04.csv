539582,comment,539105,539534,0,0,jerf,,,"The fair use analysis for citing an advertising slogan is very different than it is for a tweet. You're not affecting the slogan's value the way that republishing a tweet against the author's will can, and the purpose test is more in your favor since you're probably mentioning it to be critical of it in some way.<p>Based on my experience, at this point I expect someone to start jumping in and trying to slice and dice their way between these standards. So let me try to preempt that a bit by reminding you that you have to be taken to court for copyright infringement before you can make a fair-use defense and that an intrinsic part of the process is the judgment of the court. The judge would laugh M&M Mars out of court if they claimed my citing ""Taste the Rainbow"" as a trite slogan was a copyright violation, but republishing a person's tweet is a radically different thing, and the question is not ""can I weave and dance and obfuscate and blur the question on the internet?"", but ""can I weave and dance and obfuscate the question in front of a judge?"" There is a professionally-trained human hairsplitter in the decision loop, by design.<p>Mind you, I might still be wrong in my analysis; I'm not saying I can't be wrong, my point is that pulling the whole dodge, weave, and obfuscate move to try to show that I'm being hypocritical or that I somehow disagree with myself is not valid.",1238471170
