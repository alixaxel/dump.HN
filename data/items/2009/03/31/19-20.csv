I find that there are pieces\nthat I love and pieces that I hate, but the pieces that I love usually enable a level of expressiveness that lets me fix the\nbroken bits or at the very least work around them in an elegant way.<p>One piece that I struggle with and have yet to find a good model for working with is the DOM -- the big piece of global state\nright in the middle of my application. I've tried a few things to mitigate the inevitable problems. At first I tried wrapping up\nelements in objects and treating them as private instance variables. Of course the elements were still global and I quickly grew\ntired of this metaphor. My new strategy is to basically treat the DOM as a database. I use a CSS selector to grab elements I care\nabout and then apply changes by mapping a function over the resulting set. I never store references to the elements and simply\nuse the selector to get the elements I care about at any given time. I never make any assumptions about the state of the element\nand merely 'apply' the changes onto the element.<p>But of course almost all of my functions are riddled with side effects. My strategy to prevent this from becoming over complicated\nhas been to keep my code base as small as possible so I can see at a glance what's going on.<p>So, to all the hackers out there that are much more clever than I am, please help a guy out. What strategies do you use to work with\nthe DOM? Am I even approaching the problem from the right direction?",1238526975

Btw note that this is common in compression code that tries to do fast. in things like Fastlz and similar libs this is a compile time define, I may do the same, if SAFE_DECOMPRESSOR is defined it will do the check, otherwise will just skip the checking code.<p>Also note that the access is read only, so basically it's not possible to use such thing to run unprivileged code. Also in moder operating systems pages are zeroed before to be used in a different process, so it is not possible to read part of memory about a different process.<p>Thanks for the hint",1238526741
