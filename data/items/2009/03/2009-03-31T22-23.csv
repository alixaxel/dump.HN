So your society, whatever it is, will have an extremely poor and old social class. These are the people who will also have the most problem with health care. When they get sick, the hospitals will not let them die - their medical care will be paid - by the government. Those people will turn to begging, alcohol and create a new class of homeless people.<p>It's nice to want to put responsibility on the individual, but those 20% will make your society an unpleasant place to live in. Are you willing to deal with all this?<p>Retirement has to be be made into an institution that runs on its own. Don't let people work their entire life, and then retire into hell.",1238540326

Now, you certainly cannot blame Apple for all those writing about them feeling like they know everything, but I would argue that there at least exist PR strategies that don’t make the tech press go crazy when writing about you.

540995,comment,540005,540931,0,0,mkn,,,"They use the term 'discover,' I would presume, because it's the most technically accurate term for what they do. As near as I can tell, as a relative layperson, mathematicians look at the existing state of mathematics, embodied in proven theorems, and consider the implications of those theories, looking for unanswered questions or outright contradictions. They then attempt to find the new theory that will provably answer the question or resolve the contradiction.<p>The only 'invention' that goes on seems, to me, to be on the order of brainstorming, i.e., inventing hypotheticals to test their implications or shed new light on an existing conundrum.<p>Fundamentally, I think the use of 'discovery' terminology, rather than 'invention' terminology arises from the nature of the new thing produced. Discoveries, in the scientific or mathematical sense, were 'always there' within the corresponding realm of inquiry (e.g., the set of axioms that comprise mathematics, the physical world for scientific discoveries, & etc.) and represent a mere formulation of an existing but previously hidden truth. Inventions, on the other hand, represent a novel application of existing principles for some external purpose. The implementation cannot be said to have flowed from existing knowledge in any meaningful way. Nor do inventions have any <i>general</i> theoretical utility. (Mousetraps are fun little inventions, but don't contribute to a 'Theory of Pest Control' and we certainly would not refer to the 'discoverer of the mouse trap.')<p>Additionally, other scientists do in fact use the terms 'discover' and 'invent' in precisely the same sense as mathematicians do, and for similar reasons. In fact, these are the commonly accepted notions of the terms even among nonspecialists.<p>Using 'mathematical invention' rather than 'mathematical discovery' erroneously (or maliciously) ascribes arbitrary subjectivity to mathematical thought.",1238539613

Regardless of how the actual quality compares,  people think American cars are lower quality.  It didn't happen over night either.    I can't imagine what went through their minds as they just let it happen;  there was probably a lot of corporate thought control and it was un-PC to actually drive a Japanese car or say anything good about one for decades.    You know you contrast that to like MS and their approach to Linux,  MS is on top because they fear EVERYBODY and give them some respect.  I just can't imagine letting my company develop and image of creating lower quality products than my competitors, for years and years.<p>Now the bigger difference is when you buy an inexpensive, smaller Toyota or Honda,  they are radically different than an inexpensive, smaller Ford or GM car.  The styling choices are different.   For years Americans associated big and heavy with quality,  they always thought the Japanese cars are tinny and flimsy.  It really seems like when you buy an inexpensive American car,  you get a cheap car but when you buy an inexpensive Japanese car you get a cost reduced version of their nicer cars.",1238537334

Google expanded into so many fields other than search after their IPO, I wonder which territories would Facebook venture into. Currently, other than a few LAMP/memcache/API stuff, Facebook isn't doing much outside of the Facebook social-networking world. Google ended up with a phone and transit. Will there be a Facebook channel or matchmaking?",1238537225

""Brian, that language adequately reflects the feeling we have when we discover a site that is accepting questions and requests from users who expect an answer there - and will be disappointed when they don’t get it - is taunting the conversation with words like we haven’t committed to an open conversation and then have a price tag to make that go away.<p>GS’ is certainly helping to turn that image by being quick to respond here, but that doesn’t really change how the situation arose.""<p>I think it might have been more polite to privately discuss this with GetSatisfaction first, but this needed to be discussed publicly.<p>The only difference between an official support page and an unofficial support page is the added announcement at the top that says the page is unofficial.<p>The official support pages also says it is supported by employees, but I don't really know what that means by itself. Does it mean that the product is only supported through Get Satisfaction, or does it only mean that company employees read the questions there?<p>Just check out the pages for officially supported products and unofficially supported products. Photosynth is only officially supported by GetSatisfication. The NY Times has its own customer support. The only big difference I see is  that the NY Times has the added message that it is unofficial.<p>Photosynth:<a href=""http://getsatisfaction.com/livelabs/products/livelabs_photosynth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getsatisfaction.com/livelabs/products/livelabs_photos...</a><p>NY Times:<a href=""http://getsatisfaction.com/nytimes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getsatisfaction.com/nytimes</a><p>GS is advertising itself as a one stop customer support solution.If I believe that a company solely uses GS and try to contact that company, I am going to treat any response as an official response.<p>With 14k+ plus support pages on GS, I am sure that there are a few companies out there that don't even know they have a GS page. So if GS is not clearly saying that those pages are unofficial, any lack of correspondence will hurt that company.<p>GS was basically hijacking some companies customer service. If I have a problem with a product, and I incorrectly believe that I am being ignored, the company will end up worse off. At the minimum, I will seriously consider not buying from that company again, and I might mention my bad experience to other people I know. And if my problem was severe, I might think of filing a chargeback.<p>I really doubt 37Signals spends a lot of time scouring the internet looking for people infringing on their IP. So probably this was brought to their attention by their own customers.  So while they could have go about this in a less confrontational manner, I really don't think they were being an arse.

It's up to you to control this degree. A highly-trained violinist has a more functional left-pinky (more than the right pinky), for example.<p>Another interesting thing about lefty and righty-ness, is that some people make the observation that lefties cross their arms and their fingers opposite of righties (e.g., left thumb on top for lefties). I reasoned that this was just habitual, so I deliberately changed mine, and over the years the ""lefty way of crossing"" is the most natural one.",1238536977
