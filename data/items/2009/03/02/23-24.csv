The only US city that loosely fits this description \nto my knowledge is Chicago, given the iron grip of the Daley dynasty on the mayoralty.<p>What advantage would accrue to non-government actors who kickstarted this hub beyond the uncertain \nmonetary return once the paper profits were booked? In other words, how can they capture as much of the \nvalue created by this new hub as possible? Given a long enough time horizon buying up property within an \nhour or so's travel of the chosen location would show handsome returns, assuming success. If we assume, \nI think conservatively, that 20 years would be sufficient for a hub to be mature, we have to ask who invests \non these kind of timescales besides governments? Charitable foundations, university endowments, insurance \ncompanies and family offices, that's who. With the concentration of elite universities in Cambridge, MA, their \ngreat, if recently depleted endowments and the locale's current position as #2 startup hub of the US and thus \nthe world, they might be able to equal the Valley, generate a handsome profit and prime the pump for future \nbenefices from grateful students. Alternatively, anyone with a substantial portion of the minimum neccesary \nto fund could put said funds in escrow, not to be paid out until matching funds were committed by other \nparties. Or one wealthy individual desirous of leaving a lasting positive legacy to a city they hold dear could \ndo it altrustically. Say, Warren Buffett for Omaha or Steve Schwarzmann for New York.<p>And outside North America? It would be easier to jumpstart a global city than somewhere with minimal \nlegal or financial infrastructure but for $100m you could probably jumpstart a minor city of 500,000. The \nbetter the pre-existing institutions the bigger the bang for the buck.<p>Singapore\nA city-state run by economically literate technocrats who plan for the long term, with the rule of law, \nan educated workforce, good if not elite universities, and a liberal immigration policy. It also has form \nwith the deliberate cultivation of expertise, e.g. it's biotech industry and the state holding company, \nTemasek's, investment in oil rig expertise despite the fact that it was unprofitable for over a decade.<p>China\nThe CCP is not constrained by the unpopularity of targetting small areas for rapid development instead \nof spreading the pork around. Look at Shenzhen Special economic Zone, going in fifteen years from a \nfishing village to a manufacturing metropolis of huge importance to world trade. They could probably \ndo it even if they did it wrong. Imagine a commitment of US$10m for each of ten years to competing\nY Combinator clones, university backing as worthy gap years after a degree at Tsinghua or Peking, \nenticements to ethnic Chinese with Valley experience to come over, act as angels and VCs, etc.<p>Britain and Ireland<p>As close to being the USA as you get on the wrong continent, well, apart from Australia.<p>The only elite university in Computer Science is Cambridge, and it an edge case. With all of the EU and \nEFTA to draw upon for talent and no immigration restrictions, this is less of a problem than it seems.\nThe money is there, whether private or possibly governmental. It seems likely that Labour is on the way \nback to the political wilderness for a generation, and throwing money at some  Northern city, e.g. \nBirmingham would be a grand political gesture for a new Tory government, and possibly even a vote \nwinner in the city. To my mind just doing it in Cambridge would be the better idea, but absent the \nUniversity taking the initiative this seems unlikely.<p>Ireland is an unlikely candidate, but it has a reasonably competent industrial development agency and the \nexperience of developing a second tier financial centre from nothing by careful planning and a devotion to \ntailoring a conducive legal environment. Dublin probably isn't quite dominant enough to be able to overcome\nthe desire to spread the startups around which would defeat the point. Only here because I'm Irish. I suspect \nthe Auctomatic lads would just say ""Nah, no way""<p>Western Europe\nLuxembourg. Only a new, no account university, but fully able to draw on the surroundings, small enough \nthat the entire country would share in the benefits, so the ""Where's my pork?"" problem doesn't arise, many \nmany rich people and an establishment small enough that you might be able to get it done by talking to the \nright civil servant at a cocktail party. The expertise in crafting a conducive legal environment point from Ireland  \napplies here too.<p>Berlin. City-state with a population that's a quarter non-German and you can get by on just English. Fantastic \nculture and surroundings, very good universities, internal migration magnet, cheap. Best European bet.<p>Zurich. Has ETH, world class university, easy for EU/EFTA citizens to get a residential visa, wonderful city. \nSwitzerland's only disadvantage is the high cost of living. Ramen profitable would actually be a substantial \nbarrier.<p>Paris, and it's suburb, otherwise known as France. My Economist reading sneer says no way, and the dirigiste\ntendency is strong, see the abortion that is Quaero, but if you could convince someone it would just be done. \nOne very substantial disadvantage is the legal obligation that the working language be French.<p>Eastern Europe\nRomania seems to have a phenomenal over-representation in CS circles given its population, and Russia pulls\nits substantial weight. St. Petersburg would be my pick as the most cosmopolitan Russian city that isn't Moscow \nwith its disadvantages (no parks worth a damn, expensive as all get out, but it shares that last with St. Petersburg)<p>Israel\nMuch like Cambridge, MA, Tel Aviv is already a hub of note.

I've got a handful of ideas for IMHO great but simple apps and the possibility of me being actually able to do it fairly easily is very exciting...<p>I've also got an idea for one not so simple game, already a proven success on desktop for years that wouldn't even require direct access to Palm's hardware. Unfortunately, I presume this would require much more real programming skills (not web programming skills I can provide) so we'll see what happens with that...

500764,comment,500486,500704,0,0,MarkN,,,"Author here! I enjoyed Zack and Wiki on the Wii, and some of the adventure game titles on the DS like Phoenix Wright, Professor Layton, and I've referenced some of those in my other writings about adventure games. My main reason for focusing on PC games and older titles was that that seemed to be where the majority of interface evolution and changes took place. Zack and Wiki is an entertaining concept, but the interface is primarily point and click with some supplementary controls using the motion sensing of the controller and all the buttons the wiimote allows for... similarly with the DS adventure titles, it treats the touch screen as a point and tap world.<p>As for portal, drawing the lines between adventure games and other genres can be fuzzy. Bringing games into real-time 3D is a much more significant shift than bringing a game from a text adventure to a graphic adventure. While there are definitely many types of games which involve puzzles, I prefer to define Adventure Games as being based around solving abstract puzzles that aren't dependent upon a real-time engine.",1236035204

First, he asked coworkers (4 or 5 of them) if they knew anyone with a netbook.  Most people didn't even know what a netbook was, and offered up a friend or relative who owned a Kindle instead (This may well warrant a separate discussion of its own).  Of the rest of us, we came up with two netbook owners.  Two.  Of the people surveyed, there was very little to desire to own a netbook.  I would rate these coworkers as fairly tech-savvy.  I don't mean to pass this off as any sort of factual representation of the market, but I think it begs the question:<p>Who are the big buyers for netbooks in your opinion?<p>Do you think the current economic client plays to the advantage of the netbook market, or is there a significant disadvantage insofar as netbooks are perceived as luxury items-- a little brother to your existing laptop?<p>Do you own one?
