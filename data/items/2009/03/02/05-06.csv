I don't really care about what the text says, just how blocks of it change over time.  I am after the ascetics present in the ever flowing change of data.  I think your script might be a good starting point.  Think of the videos of a flowers growing, that compress months into a few seconds.  Do something similar with wikipedia edits.",1235973562
