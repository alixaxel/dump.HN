I think you need to make it very clear why it's worth installing the plugin initially. Something concrete that we all wish Google did.<p>Reassuring people that the plugin is lightweight and won't compromise their security is also very important. The history recording might be great, but it <i>sounds</i> creepy.<p>I don't know if it's true, but a dark themed web site might not be a good idea when trust is important.

If I really want to watch something, and just can't find it on Usenet or TPB, then I grudgingly accept the fact that I will have to use Netflix.  The UI and video quality are both terrible.  Why is it that I can stream full-HD video for free, but I am only able to <i>pay</i> for low-quality DRM'd crap?",1235962616
499608,comment,499405,499405,0,0,ggchappell,,,"It is interesting to consider how effects like this operate at different levels.<p>For example, if I picked up a coin, flipped it 6 times, and got heads each time, then I might reasonably be suspicious about the coin. On the other hand, when someone claims to have flipped a coin 200 times, it is the ones who never get 6 in a row that are suspect.<p>Similarly, a tax return that does not have numbers beginning with 1 is certainly suspicious. On the other hand, if you gave me a million tax returns, and <i>all</i> of them had lots of numbers beginning with 1, then I would be suspicious of the collection as a whole. Benford's Law deals only with probabilities, after all; we should expect some deviations from what it predicts.<p>Given the sizes of data sets that governments deal with, the ideas outlined in this article can certainly be useful. However, the virtual certainty of false positives is something that also needs to be dealt with. It is to be greatly hoped that these ideas are implemented in the context of human wisdom and manual fact checking, and not merely as a yes/no way of determining who gets treated like a criminal.<p>In any case, this was a thought-provoking article. Thanks for posting.",1235962586

We're truly boned, and our only hope of profitably exiting this deal is to unload it on a bigger sucker.  Sadly the big suckers are hurting for money at the moment, and unlikely to try running another major site as a public utility, which is annoying because despite the fact that the web part is nearly free those SMS charges for 180 character messages are nearly killing us.  So basically we have to keep up a facade to justify our valuation per user of about $75, which is about equivalent to the present value of, say, a WoW player, despite the fact that they have proven their willingness to pay money every month, are intensely engaged with the service, and have low churn rates -- absolutely none of which we can boast of.

But it's on the edge of the cliff, if it mutates any faster then too many of the mutated cells aren't viable and not enough live on to the next generation to maintain the population.<p>You have to understand that most mutations are harmful, beneficial mutation are extremely rare so there is a maximum rate of mutation before mutation itself becomes deadly to the virus.  Pushing it over this limit by hijacking its replication process and damaging the DNA is brilliant.<p>Consider how long the human race would survive if our mutation rate was 80%, things like mental retardation, autism, physical deformity, infant death, etc. would sky rocket, it wouldn't be long before most people couldn't take care of themselves.",1235961509

499570,comment,497951,497951,0,0,donaldc,,,"There is no way that money alone would be sufficient to recreate a Silicon Valley. Of course, it would help, but some of the other obstacles are daunting.<p>* Non-competes. Within the U.S., California is by far the state least inclined to enforce non-competes. This happened as a historical accident, well before Silicon Valley arose. Getting another jurisdiction to adopt a similar attitude toward non-competes would involve, not money, but politics, which is far messier and more uncertain. The existing large companies in a given state generally perceive, rightly or wrongly, that it is in their interest to have non-competes enforced as vigorously as possible. This, in turn, has two effects detrimental to competing with Silicon Valley: (1) employees often can't go off and start a competing company in their area of expertise without a two-year waiting period, and (2) the really ambitious among them may get around this by moving to California (often Silicon Valley), where their non-competes are unenforceable, thus furthering the Valley's lead.<p>* Specialized insfrastructure. Whatever a hardware or software computer startup needs, it has access to in the Bay Area. Legal services, financing, management expertise (useful as a startup gets bigger), and above all the hardware and software engineers skilled in even the most arcane (but sometimes needed) technologies. This sort of infrastructure cannot simply be bought, it must be grown.<p>* Many of the metro areas that conceivably might be able to make a run at competing with Silicon Valley (i.e. those that are not economic basket cases) already have a different industry that is their specialty, and have no good incentive to try and supplant that industry for a clone of Silicon Valley. And without the other industry being supplanted, it's unlikely that the density of computer/web startups will even approach that of Silicon Valley.<p>With all this to overcome, one billion dollars doesn't seem anywhere near sufficient.<p>Silicon Valley will eventually be rivalled by a metro area that specializes in something related but not quite head-on to what Silicon Valley does. For example, it's conceivable that Seattle, with its focus on more consumer-oriented software and web companies (such as Amazon), could gradually ooze its way into having a bigger share of the more purely web-based startups (such as Google). But that's very different than trying to create a Silicon Valley rival from nothing.",1235960157

499567,comment,499370,499370,0,0,antiform,,,"To most mathematicians, valuing intuition is not a new idea. While one of the most distinguishing qualities of mathematics is its rigor, to focus on this quality misses the big picture. Henri Poincare, arguably the greatest 20th century mathematician, said it best: ""It is by logic we prove, it is by intuition we invent."" This theme is echoed in many of his writings about creativity in mathematics.<p>Turing's argument is beautiful and elegant, undoubtedly one of the gems of modern mathematics. However, the reason you don't see the intuition behind Turing's argument taught is that there is too much material to cover in a general theoretical computer science course. You need to be able to master the known material, to stand on the shoulders of giants, to make new advances in the discipline. This may not necessarily be the best way to encourage creativity and insight in computer science, but the hope is that interested students will delve deeper (like the author) and discover insights for themselves.<p>Lastly, at least among many mathematicians, Turing may be up there with Euclid among the demigods of mathematics, but there are those that lie still higher, people like Gauss and Euler who have yet to be matched in terms of mathematical output and impact.",1235959953
