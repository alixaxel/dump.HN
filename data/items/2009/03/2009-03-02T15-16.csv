I imagine it would be very difficult to control an experiment just on response to anger (as opposed to other emotions). Without seeing more detail, this article to me basically says that being self-aware and having a healthy understanding of the full range of one's natural emotions ""is good for career."" Doesn't seem particularly groundbreaking that anger would be included in that list.",1236009373

They just don't use it.<p>Offer support and updates via your website (requiring a login associated with a valid license to get it), and you'll make it really hard to steal the whole value of your product.  Make automatic updates contingent on a valid license.  Phoning home is really hard to crack, since you have control over the whole interaction and if you don't want to serve the update there's not a lot the user can do to make you.  If they disable automatic updates, they lose the new features until another crack appears.  If they leave them enabled they get a popup reminding them that they haven't paid for your software (subtly, though, as sometimes the user is innocent and the problem is technical or on your end; something along the lines of ""It appears your license is invalid.  Please contact blah blah for assistance in correcting this issue."").<p>The nice thing about this is that it keeps you honest.  People who pay for software expect, and deserve, regular updates correcting bugs and such.  If your license provides a year (or until the next major revision, or whatever) worth of updates, you'll increase your sales and your customer satisfaction.",1236009330
