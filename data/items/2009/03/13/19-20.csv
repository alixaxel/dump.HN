Some are doing very well and are very impressive.<p>While I'm also doing some of that, I'd like to experiment in a different way, that of building new features. The conversation view, while it is not a totally new concept (it is available in a similar form in the Summize page, and the current Twitter search page), doesn't exist yet on the iPhone clients and it's pretty interesting how much you can do in the backend to churn out just a view of a conversation.<p>Digress a little: I've been working full-time on iPhone applications for the past 3 months but have only started selling a few weeks ago (a delay of 3 months due to the paperwork blackhole!). And it's been a huge challenge to break into the market and break even, but nevertheless an interesting experience.<p>As I mentioned in the article, I have a few ideas (for features) in my mind which I'll be experimenting with. If anyone of you have any ideas, please feel free to share them and/or discuss/comment on what I have done.",1236974349

Small children aren't going to remember to plug these back in, and I'm unsure if teenagers would even remember to plug these back in, so I would love to see a wireless charger for these. I mean even if it's simply one of the touch-charging pads and not the longer distance WREL.<p>Also things like battery life would be nice to know. I mean do these things last as long as an iPod's play time, or do they last like 15 minutes?<p>One thing I'd love for these is if they were capable of parallel processing. It appears they just pass information off to each other, and then the one device does its own task. I'd like it if you could stick 3 together and run a program that 1 alone can't. I mean with WREL power these could compete with PCs, with the right software, because the more power you need you simply stick more blocks together.<p>I mean you want portability, then stick a couple together and you've got a PDA. Need a bigger display, well stick another four together or have an external display you can click multiple siftables into to get a full screen. Need more power? Stick an extra row under the four and still use the existing screen. Going on a road trip with some friends, but still need a laptop? Well if everyone has a couple of siftables each, then stick 16/32 together with an external display and boot up ubuntu or XP! I hope the technology goes this way, but I have my doubts.<p>Edit: The laptop example would be perfect, each persons siftable carries their own data. Yet when you click a bunch together you can all carry different accounts on a laptop and do your own thing, and when you're done you take your siftables back with your modified data.",1236971575
515202,comment,514767,515151,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"This is an excellent point. I suppose I was just thinking about the natural world (on planet Earth). Indeed, replicating information, RNA or not, would be a form of ""life"", provided it was persisted. I think persistence here is the key. A genetic algorithm would be life as you say, provided I think that its states could be saved into a database or the like. Self-replicating, persisted information in some kind of definable form or shape is life, roughly I would think. So, sure, a GA counts provided you persist it someplace. Naturally occurring crystals in a cave would too for that matter. And if the physicist Lee Smolin is right, the universe could be a replicating entity as well, making new universes via black holes or similar mechanisms (see his book, ""Life of the Cosmos"").",1236971559
