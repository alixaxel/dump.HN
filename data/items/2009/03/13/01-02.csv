See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns</a><p>Separation of concerns aims to produce modular, loosely coupled code.<p>Now, if we start from the point of view that they should be in separate files anyway (in the ruby way, each file should contain one class rather than many - and I don't think it's helpful to change that), then I don't see what difference it makes whether the files are in the same directory or in separate directories.<p>If you have any sort of decent editor, opening the file you seek should be a matter of pressing a shortcut and typing part of the filename... Certainly, I rarely use the mouse to open files - except when i'm browsing through a new project, but that's a fairly rare use case.<p>Now, there's another problem I can see with your proposed organisation: although in some cases (even many) applications are built around resource objects, almost every non-trivial application has many edge cases of functionalities that are not directly attached to objects, or are attached to multiple kinds of objects, or are attached to objects but in a way that could be mapped to one object or to another, and is actually best thought of as being linked to something else.<p>Forcing the file system to be organised around resources like users, projects, items, etc would coerce us into trying to fit functions onto specific objects - and, importantly, it would remove the flexibility of being able to <i>not</i> tie a function to an object.<p>As such, I think the current model is more flexible and offers something that your proposed model doesn't support and which is useful on most projects.",1236907679
