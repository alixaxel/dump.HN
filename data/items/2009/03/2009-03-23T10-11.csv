Even though they may lose some ad revenue (I don't know the details), their bandwidth costs may dip a bit, and ads aren't their real path to monetization anyway.

What if the UI was semi-automatically giving feedback? Like each link could have two variations: 
normal: _change time zone_  
and with feedback: _change zone but why this was buried here_ 
Now as a webmaster I could follow up if people started to ""complain"" on something.",1237805713

(Close to jobs, cheap services etc).<p>So basically, unless you are buying rural property, prices will go up when people want to move to cities.<p>All that's economics - but the real world is a bit more complicated. People determine how much to pay for a house based on two things: how much the seller wants, and how much money they have.<p>Easy loans made it such that people had lots of money for houses. Sellers like to make a profit when they sell a house (it's emotional, not logical).<p>Put those together and you have a housing price boom. But it can't (couldn't) last because it doesn't match the real economics of the situation.<p>At the end of the day prices should move based on population in cities, and inflation.<p>And BTW people are already buying up city blocks in Detroit. The biggest problem there is crime though, which makes it hard to buy a house and hold it for a while.",1237805564

There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about those in a startup. All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities"" so, why not try out building a startup",1237804894

528334,comment,527500,527733,0,0,gjm11,,,"I think you're entirely wrong about the ""copy of the GPL"" business. The LGPL consists of the GPL plus a bunch of extra stuff. The LGPL document found e.g. at <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a> lists only the extra stuff. Therefore, whenever it imposes any requirement to distribute a copy of the licence, it says ""a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document"". That's all. If there were a requirement to distribute your stuff under the terms of the (not-L)GPL, then it would say so. (Merely distributing a copy of the GPL along with your code would not put the code under that licence.)<p>Those terms to which you object mean, I think, the following: If your object code includes bits of the library header files, and if those bits are substantial, then you have to (1) say that you're using the library, (2) say what licence the library is covered by, and (3) include a copy of the documents that define that licence.",1237804226

I love open source.<p>What I don't love is the notion that either all software should be free (gratis) à la Stallman, or the less extreme view that you can make money from it as long as you do so in a very inefficient and non-scalable manner (basically charging for support).<p>Also, I find it quite ironic that some people describe (with a straight face) the supply of proprietary extensions to open source code as an 'open source business model'. That's akin to funding a peace march with the proceeds from arms sales.<p>And whilst I have lots of respect for what the community has achieved, and the people who helped make it happen (including Stallman and Raymond) I would argue  that there is no inherent conflict between open source ideals and the notion that some users should pay for the code. If a developer wants to give his code away for free, then that's his or her choice and I respect that. But if another developer decided that his code is not free for commercial use, then I respect that position as well.<p>I hold the view that a low-friction and equitable licensing system for open source software would have a further galvanizing effect on this already vibrant sector.<p>DS",1237802552
