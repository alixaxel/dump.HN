522710,comment,522068,522623,0,0,ice799,,,"Short answer: depends what you care about.<p>Long answer:  if the allocator is poorly designed, a lot of time will be spent traversing its free list/tree/whatever looking for a block to fit your size requirements. this lookup time can be exacerbated if your heap is badly fragmented, or if the allocator does a poor job coalescing freed blocks. you could end up spending lots of time in malloc looking for a nicely sized block.<p>also, with regard to heap fragmentation - long running processes which do lots of allocations/frees can cause fragmentation, again depending on the design of the allocator. if there is a lot of heap frag, you could see some substantial bloating.<p>so profiling your process for those two items can be valuable.<p>what you say is true; the major gain for TCMalloc is in multi-(native)-threaded apps.<p>perhaps the next version of malloc_wrap will support multiple threads.<p>in either case, we have not yet finished collecting data about the different allocators, so I am not currently in a position to say which is better for our use case.<p>i just wanted a tool to let me replay a constant set of allocation patterns against different allocators to find out if swapping out libc's malloc made a difference for us and that is precisely what malloc_wrap is.",1237427837

That difference is captured with the notion of ""objectivity"", which is why I said that corporate executives face an objective performance standard while politicians do not.<p>The only potential discipline for politicians is made by voters who mostly don't understand the issues that well and don't spend a lot of time following their representatives in office.
