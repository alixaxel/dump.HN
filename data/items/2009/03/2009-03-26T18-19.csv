The accountholder is left with no options, and money that has outright been stolen from him by Google - at least this is what the the rest of the world sees.<p>The interesting thing here is that any competent PR or HR person would be able to tell you that this code of conduct was a PR disaster waiting to happen, but apparently the engineers got the last word.<p>It's OK to do regression testing on which words in a CV makes you a potential succesfu hire based on past history (which Google does), but it's not OK to let it replace the hiring process completely.<p>That's what seems to have hapened here.

533926,comment,533741,533741,0,0,Tangurena,,,"I've come across this argument before and it fails to make sense. What the author calls the ancient Greeks and Romans were the tribes that managed to appear in the power vacuum left behind by what we now call ""the sea peoples."" I think that they were more appropriately called ""the city burners"" as they engaged in a multigenerational war to destroy every city (several more than once), and to kill off everyone who could read or write. There were only 2 cities that survived: Memphis and Thebes. The Egyptians mentioned that the war lasted about 30 years on their front, and weakened the Egyptian empire to the point where it was later conquered from the south.<p>If it were not for this pol-pot-like elimination of all civilizations, then there would not have been any chance for the greeks and romans to be more than minor tribes. But you don't learn that in school. Western history starts several hundred years later, pretending that the bronze age didn't exist except as myths of gods and giants.<p>Of the cities destroyed, you've probably only heard of Troy among the 45+ cities that were wiped out. Even the cities in what is now called Greece were totally forgotten. And the name for the wiped out civilization is called ""pre-mycenean"" after the name of a city built near the ruins of a now nameless city that was destroyed by the city burners.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/End-Bronze-Age-Robert-Drews/dp/0691025916/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/End-Bronze-Age-Robert-Drews/dp/0691025...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Peoples</a><p>What sort of anger would draw people from regions as distant as what we now call the Baltic and Afganistan to engage in a war that lasted longer than most people's lifespan?",1238093535

One thing that caught us out a little is that they are very strict on the no publicity before the conference rule - that's fair enough of course since they want to maximise publicity/exclusivity around the event itself.  But it meant that we held back from publicising ourselves waiting for their decision (and due to the large volume of applicants, final decisions were somewhat later than advertised).  Unfortunately when the decision came through it was negative - we would have loved to go, but it's not the only way to get yourself known.

Doctors have a wide range of attitudes towards therapists.  A friend of mine who is a GP is scared to enter therapy because he's scared that other doctors in his area might find out and lose respect for him.  So, evidently, your doctor might help you locate a therapist or might just decide you're a loser, or both.  Or he might try to steer you toward a particular form of therapy that you don't want.<p>There are online services that list therapists in your area.  I think (don't recall exactly) this is the one I used:<p><a href=""http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/</a><p>The profiles include therapists' training, preferred approaches, and pictures.  Highly analytical people should <i>really</i> make sure they get a therapist with a PhD.  Therapists without PhDs tend to be more empathy-based, less analytical, and more likely to ignore the content of what you're saying.  A PhD will at least listen to your complicated ramblings, try to understand them, and glean information about you and your problems from them.  She will be able to understand your questions and complaints.  That doesn't mean she'll buy into your own framing of your problems and engage with you using your own terminology, but she will recognize that what she's hearing is important to understanding your inner world.  A PhD is also more likely to be smart enough to provide a critical perspective on your beliefs and to explain and defend her own ideas.",1238092656

Even if it's a project to make a decision based on historical conditions, students are doing exactly what they'd be doing if they were running the company or division, and in most cases they are or will be running those or similar companies and divisions making the same kinds of decisions in the same ways, which is the whole point.<p><i>This is more like it</i><p>During the course of working on the project it's really exactly the same as the above.<p><i>Well, this will become a ""real business"" when it is actually running?

Look, her school is a top-tier business school and the business we are talking about aren't social web startups. When you are dealing with industries that require a large capital investment, it's often much harder to start and the consequences much worse when you fail. I've had to take more than 6 figures of investment for a web company and I've never needed to give up more than equity and sometimes some strategic guidance, whereas in other industries I might expect to be signing a personal guarantee, possibly even having an investor become an integral part of operations. So when we are talking about planning a business, we aren't talking about a web company with a one page business plan.",1238091348

I would choose a good package manager over the latest and greatest packages from a poor package manager every single time.  So, I would choose fink, were I using a Mac (and when I've been charged with maintaining developer Macs in the past, I used fink, though I also experimented with darwinports, as it was called back then).  Neither was great, since you still have to get fancy with paths and such in order to select between which versions of things to use, and header file paths can be a problem when building your own software, if you have the Apple developer tools installed, too.  And, if you're distributing binaries, you have to be careful you're building against the libraries your users will have available.

But, yes, /opt has mostly been settled on in the past few years for most third party applications...and it's a place where randomly named paths are not considered a faux pas.  Such as, ""/opt/ruby-1.9.1"" and ""/opt/perl5.005_04"" and such, and they don't have to live in normal /usr/local/usr, /usr/local/etc, and so on, paths, which is the norm in /usr/local.  One can argue all day about what makes something a ""local extension to the operating system itself"".  Is Python a local extension to the OS itself?  What if a large number of system tools use Python (as is the case on Red Hat based systems, Gentoo, and Ubuntu more with every release)?  But, because the /usr/local binary directories tend to already be in the path (and before the / equivalents) installing random stuff in there is probably a horrible idea.<p>But, folks really ought not be encouraging this sort of thing, in general.  Unless you really know you need some specific version of software, and why, you should probably be using the OS-provided packages, which are better tested (so they're generally more reliable), better supported (so you can complain to someone when you run into a problem), and more widely used (so you can find people talking about your specific version when you hit up Google for advice).<p>Anyway, I agree.  /opt is the socially acceptable place to put random crap on a system.",1238090722

533840,comment,532374,532374,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I find it interesting that the planet is presumed to be warming at roughly 0.02C a year, yet we pump out [enough energy to raise the temperature by 20C a year]. (Ed: Sorry, I'd mistaken my numbers. Our potential to raise the temperature of the atmosphere is actually 200 times what I'd mistakenly put (originally 0.1C). Our potential to raise the temperature of the oceans is 0.1C a year, when in fact the oceans temperature raises at 0.01C. Sorry for the mistake folks!)<p>I have several problems with all the eco-energy projects. Namely wind turbines are likely to cause more ecological problems than solve, I'm sorry but they're killing off bats in phenomenal numbers and killing a species high up on the food chain causes problems. We do it to seals, but we eat the fish that they would so ecologically it's not all that harmful... unless we're going to start eating millions of tons of bugs a year, I think killing off the bats might cause a serious problem. I mean the last thing we need are plagues of locust.<p>The other problem with wind turbines is that they slow local wind speeds, if this is produced on a global scale this could inhibit the transfer of energy to the night-side of earth to be radiated away. This is the same problem that wave-energy will produce, mass use of this technology will cause a reduction in water flow, which in turn will cause more energy to be stored by the water. This one is particularly unpredictable: reduced tidal action will reduce the cooling effect of water vaporisation, however this will likely be balanced by an increase in evaporation, yet this could potentially be disastrous because hotter water = stronger storms, so mass use of wave-power technologies could drastically increase tropical storms, more than global warming ever could. Hopefully the wind turbines can slow these down!<p>I haven't even touch on the fact that wind turbines place angular stress on the ground they sit on, which on a large scale has never been predicted. I mean we're talking about placing angular forces on entire tectonic plates that will change as the direction of the wind. The effect of this is inherently unknown, and I don't want to know what could happen at stressed fault-lines.<p>My problem with solar power is that it reduces the albedo of the planet and ultimately turns the electrical energy into thermal (infrared) energy, which is then trapped by CO2! Lowering the planets albedo will increase global warming even if we decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, this problem will be compounded if they ever get the holy grail of solar energy, the orbital solar power plant. Placing solar power plants into space won't increase the planets albedo, however it will transfer ridiculous amounts of energy to the planet and to be viable they only need a 20-30% efficiency due to the sheer abundance of energy. However, the other 70-80% will still be absorbed by the atmosphere and convert to thermal energy. (If anyone doubts this, please put a cup of water in the microwave and this is essentially the result as 70-80% of the energy will be absorbed by the atmosphere, which is roughly equivalent to a 10 meter layer of distilled water)<p>Global Warming is (95% probable) a byproduct of human civilization in one way or another. However the solution proposed by environmentalists is a planet wide geo-forming project.<p>I think the potential for harm could be much, much greater from geo-forming the entire planet than sea levels rising. We know what global warming <i>could</i> do to the planet, we don't know what geo-forming <i>could</i> do to the planet and no one is looking at it.<p>Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that realises the solutions to the problem are potentially worse than the problem itself.",1238090547
