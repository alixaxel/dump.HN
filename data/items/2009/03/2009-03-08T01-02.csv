On average we might see 80 or 85 percent of the seats.<p>Sherman: Are those the good ones or the bad ones you’re not getting?<p>Azoff: The vast majority of the best seats in the house.<p>%< ----------------<p>From a later article:<p>[..]<p>Hmm .. it sems like an almost insoluble economic problem. They have inventory … it’s sitting on a shelf  … and it’s highly perishable—worthless at a minute after showtime.<p>Whatever can be done?<p>The article crystalized a feeling that I had several times while watching the hearings on the merger: Why does Live Nation need to merge with Ticketmaster to deal with the alleged broken concert industry?<p>In this case, why couldn’t it just, you know, sell the farther-back seats for less money?<p>[...]<p>Indeed, I recently got an email from someone who added an additional wrinkle: Paraphrased, the point was simply that LN controls too many goddamn venues.<p>Why are the company’s bookers not putting acts in smaller rooms? <i>Because LN has to keep its own buildings in action, even if they’re too big for the artist in question.</i> [em. orig.]<p>Are these guys squirrelly or what?",1236477482

Our company forums get an onslaught of spam about once per week, and though the spam never lasts more than a few hours (far less these days, as I've added a couple of moderators), it seems to be the same spammer doing it over and over again, so they must consider it worth a shot.

Because I just can't see a need for two reasons: 1) the RPC functionality of the inaccessible host (""the client"") is unknown, you actually need to have known code running on the end that is opening the connection, and 2) it doesn't matter how bad you want to make a remote call to a machine you can't get to if you need to wait for it to initiate the connection.  If you can put known code on a remote node, you can just have it open up a non-HTTP connection to accept RPC calls over.<p>Not only does this break stock proxying, but clients would have to use the CONNECT method to enable bi-directional requests on port 80.  This is normally reserved for things like SSL, where you need end-to-end connectivity assurance.  This sounds like a way to by-pass firewalls (""if we make it work over HTTP, it'll be able to punch through anything!""), which may be a legit goal, but as a system, network, and security administrator, it doesn't enamor it to me.",1236476347

However, it doesn't follow that all graduate school is bad.<p>The key here is the distinction between practical and impractical knowledge.  The author seems to operate under the assumption that only practical knowledge is good.  In her experience, she has been able to gain practical knowledge at least as efficiently outside of the graduate educational system.  I agree with her point here, but I don't think you can discount the value of impractical knowledge - which I would define as knowledge that does not have any immediate real world application.<p>The value in impractical knowledge is twofold: 1) it can (and often is) able to called on later and 2) it can serve as an introduction to other practical knowledge.  For instance, even the lawyer that the author has argued has wasted his/her education by transferring to a different career field may immeasurably benefit from some theoretical aspect of his graduate experience.  More likely, an experience in graduate school may introduce a person to a subject area or conceptual idea that has a practical application they would never have been exposed to outside of that environment.<p>Some may argue that both of the above benefits can also be obtained through real world work experience, which leads to the question of knowledge for its own sake.  I personally am a believer in learning for learnings sake, although I'm not sure I can articulate that argument in a comment length...",1236475241

Those with options have not exercised them yet (otherwise they'd be stock holders, not option holders), so they have not taken any risk against which gains or loses could be considered. If the employee considered the options as a significant part of their compensation, then I guess there is a loss in terms of time or opportunity (as in they could have worked somewhere else for different option terms), but it is also in the current share holders' best interest to keep employees happy and not bailing because they had a reduction in a certain kind of potential.<p><i>Google workers had an incentive this week to root for the company's shares to decline, lowering their exercise price and boosting the potential payout they could reap later.</i><p>Only if the stock price reverses its trend and starts going up -- it's been on a downward trend for over a year, and I doubt it's going to back to its $700 high any time soon.<p>If they don't reprice the options and an employee does exercise them (they'd be stupid to do so) and then sells, the employee LOSES money on the transaction.  Even if you aren't that stupid, it doesn't send a good message to the employees that the company, and their contribution, is worth something.
