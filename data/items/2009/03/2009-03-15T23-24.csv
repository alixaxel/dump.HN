It's also generally about recognizing patterns (consumer/producer problem, dining philosopher problems) and being able to see them irrespective of the implementation (I first began playing with POSIX threads before college, learned the formal concepts in a class which used Solaris threads and am now working through Doug Lea's book about concurrency in Java: <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/cp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/cp/</a>).<p>There are many people who go into MBA and JD programs with CS and EE undergraduate degrees (it's excellent preparation in the sense that it's a lot of brain gymnastic; statistics also show many undergraduate engineer majors also go on to medical school as well). So one may not necessarily be a hacker (they don't code for fun) but have a CS education -- or they may even be a hacker (they <i>do</i> code for fun) without being a professional developer (they've never worked in a software engineering organization).<p>Incidentally, I can describe people that fit <i>all</i> of those molds (many CEOs of big companies generally fit the ""has a technical undergraduate background, climbed the technical ladder at big-co, got an MBA and switched to management or sales"" pattern; start-up founders frequently fit the ""worked on Wall-Street by day, coded for fun by night"" pattern).",1237161005

If one could show that one's parents were big business people, that lends confidence, but there is always a chance someone is on the short end of the gene pool. Would not it be great if we could predict the winners from the losers in society ahead of time, based on some selection criteria. But this is difficult. A DNA scan (expensive in itself) could show health and even cognitive fitness, and that could be augmented by IQ tests, etc., but there is not a sure way to do this. Only markets can determine fitness, and that is in retrospect. Ahead of time, I do not see how we can predict the fittest members of society, which is what this scheme would demand, the ones ""most likely to become millionaires"". Performance picks the smart from the dumb, but predicting this ahead of time is dubious. A DNA scan is as close as you could get I suppose, to weed out people with a likelihood of developing mental problems later on in life, etc., but still, there is error here. You want to find the Over-Man of Nietzsche. In my opinion the only Over-Man is that what the market determines. And you can't ever know that ahead of time, even with DNA sequencing. That helps your probabilities but you are still playing dice.
