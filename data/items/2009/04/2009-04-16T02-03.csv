It does precisely match the PubSub use case, and I still hope to see something based on that. Laconica isn't wrong to ignore it, per se, but they will end up having to do (or have already done) a lot of very, very redundant specification as a result of ignoring it.

564592,comment,564032,564491,0,0,jerf,,,"The problem with 3D interfaces is not the 2D display.<p>There are two major problems with 3D interfaces: Your best input devices are fundamentally 2D. Fully 3D interface devices exist but are unusual and generally tuned for a specific purpose. (Even if you want to jump up and say ""The Wiimote!"", from what I can see it is typically used in a 2D manner. Those 2D are not the conventional 90 degree angles(<i>), mostly in a way to make them easier to use with wrists and arms, but it's still a lot of 2D motion with rare forays into true 3D that get old fast.)<p>The other major problem is that </i>full* 3D is virtually incomprehensible; we live in a 2.5D world. Try to train a ""normal person"" to play Descent. (If you think full-3D interfaces would be awesome, go play Descent to be sure!) We can't use the full 3D. What we <i>can</i> use is a 2.5D plane stretching out into the distance. But, as long as we're using 2.5D, why not place it perpendicular to our eyes and see the maximum area, instead the 3D-engine view that moves all but a very small part of the 2.5D plane out of our field of view and range of action?<p>Fully 3D interfaces are fundamentally and deeply flawed. We've had the hardware to display them for at least a decade now and there's a reason there isn't even a halfway decent prototype... and it's not for lack of trying. It's just a really, really bad idea, one where you can't even overcome the fundamental flaws with brute force and ideology.<p>(*): Recall that dimensionality is not constrained to the traditional three 90-degree rotated planes, it is a measurement of how many numbers need to be specified in a given situation. Hold out your arms and fingers straight, and move only your wrist around. As you move your wrist around, look at the surface defined by where the tip of your middle finger is. It is piece of a vaguely spherical shell which curves in 3D space, but is itself a 2D surface; given the situation I laid out I need only two numbers to identify a point on that plane. The Wiimote is capable of being used in full 3D and it certainly is in some cases, but the human body itself imposes constraints on how you move that thing around and full 3D gets tiring, fast. Even the ones that use full 3D still strike me as using 2.5D; a full 2D for the wrist motions, and .5D for just thrusting backwards or forwards with no meaningful wrist interactions (just serving as a tactile button). Another example: Using the Wiimote as a steering wheel, as nifty a use case as it is, actually cuts it down to 1D, as only the angle matters.",1239850003

Our assignments were to summarize the arguments of philosophers. No personal opinions. Just summaries.<p>Regardless of the substance of the course, the skill of digesting, analyzing, and summarizing the position of another is surprisingly valuable. It is also surprisingly difficult.<p>Summarizing is difficult because it is too easy to mix up personal ideas with those of others. This tends to result in a mish-mash of words and ideas that don't fit together, resulting in the incomprehensible academic-speak complained of in the article.<p>Summarizing is important because it is persuasive. If you can rephrase your opponents' views without bias or argument, and then build on those views to reach your conclusions, your opponents are much more likely to entertain and accept your conclusions, because they feel like their views have been fully heard.<p>It is unfortunate that so much of writing focuses on making arguments, to the detriment of the equally important skill of understanding the arguments of others.",1239849538

 - Perhaps an option to send a second text message when the site comes back up?
