From my understanding it seems to be about antagonising these females.<p>I added the inferiority thing to show that these females might feel they are undermined and might perhaps feel some sense of discrimination. From my understanding basically it is a power possession issue. They might feel that they are not on equal standing with their male counterparts and that such presentation only serve to legitimise and create a culture of harnessing such perceived or real inequality by further creating a sense that this presentation is only aimed at guys as most of the pictures were of females.<p>I mean how would you feel if all those pictures were of men rather than women, it would just be weird.",1241027814

But implicitly, the standard of comparison makes a statement, too. It makes the statement that women are sex objects who should be judged only on their most superficial characteristics. Men can be judged on their ability to play basketball but when it comes to women, the only standard of value is how sexually attractive they are.",1241027783

585500,comment,584451,585194,0,0,fatdog789,,,"Class representatives do not have the right to bargain on behalf of members in materially different circumstances. Technically, orphaned book authors should not even be part of this class action because an orphaned-book author is not in the same position as an identifiable author. At best, the orphaned book authors could be part of a subclass, but they would require a separate settlement (or rather, sub-settlement).  The problem is clear, as here, where the Guild negotiated money on behalf of orphaned authors...to be paid to the Guild. The Guild is not required to attempt to locate these orphan authors, or their successors/estates...it can just keep the money until <i>the authors</i> claim it. Even worse, the Guild is allowed to use this money for its own purpose, rather than setting it aside into a trust account for the orphan authors.<p>In this case, others have challenged the settlement on two grounds: (1) antitrust, which is the most important issue, and (2) the orphaned authors were not fairly represented by the Guild, as evidenced by the lack of proper notice, the Guild negotiating to receive money for orphan authors, and the Guild granting itself the right to use that money for its own efforts.  (Note: the challenge on (2) is both to the settlement AND to the class certification.)<p>You're right, the pocket summary says a lot about the quality of Google's research. But it's not a clever hack of the legal process, because a law student could easily observe the antitrust issues arising here. It's an example of Google's lawyer's fucking up on an issue, and getting the Justice Department involved (and millions spent in responding to the JD's subpoena's and information requests) where the JD didn't need to get involved.

This is all mental, and you learn to love it.  The mental barrier grows exponentially more difficult to fight as you get closer to...<p>The second barrier.  The true hard limit, as defined by your body's innate physical capacity to perform.  At this point you've managed to push past the mental barrier and used up every ounce of energy.  It's typically marked by a visible decrease in performance aka ""hitting the wall"".  I've done it before, and there is no amount of mental convincing that will get the body moving when there is no more fuel in the tank.  This shutdown might be a protective function of the brain (as a physical organ) looking to ensure it can still function, but there really is no physical capacity left to continue at speed even if the will is there.<p>Any true athlete intuitively knows from their training when that second wall is approaching and will time it as best as possible so that they get as close to it as possible just as they finish their performance (hence running faster at the end).  This is much more evident in endurance events where blowing past the anaerobic threshold too early is disaster for the competitor.<p>One of the best events to watch athletes hit the second wall is the 800m.",1241026818

585477,comment,584557,585149,0,0,tptacek,,,"Beej's guide is really about writing synchronous network code. You connect a socket. Your program waits for the connect to complete. You write something to the socket. What, the write might only complete 10 of your 20 bytes? Wrap the write in a loop that keeps feeding more bytes to the system call! Ok, the request is completely sent? Great! Now write a loop that sits there waiting for all the data that we need to come back on the socket. Back and forth, back and forth, in lock-step.<p>Efficient network code just isn't written like this. It's scheduled, the same way processes are in the kernel. Even in threaded code, nothing sits there waiting on a socket.<p>Beej touches on this a little with his description of select(). But select isn't a utility function in socket programming. It's the kernel. And getting that loop completely right isn't trivial (timers alone can offer you 4-5 mainstream data structures to choose from). Moreover, select isn't the end-all kernel interface to scheduling I/O; if you're writing a server, it's probably much faster to use a more modern interface.<p>Libevent both hides the complexity of the event loop from you, and also abstracts it so you can drop in kqueue or epoll or whatever without being tied to a single old system call interface.<p>None of this is a knock against Beej's guide.

There's a high priority placed on politeness (real or not), service, and ultimately obedience. While this conservatism may have it's roots in religion, the attitude permeates through the rest of the culture.<p>The US is a country of immigrants, and if you look at the history - immigrant groups tend to be pretty dang religious. Pilgrims and Puritans, Africans embraced Christianity with zeal because of their circumstances. Later waves: Irish & Italian Catholics, German Protestants, European Jews; all very religious. And modern immigrant groups, Latin Americans, Koreans, Indians, etc. can all be quite conservative. Religion and culture intertwine because people tend to hang out with their own in the beginning - and the place to find them is usually at a church/temple/whatev. I guess it's like the old lunch table theory, you'll prefer to hang out with people that you think are more like you.<p>[edit] And to extrapolate this to the current topic, the presenter's greatest sin in the eyes of many US'ians is not his gratuitous use of sexual imagery to convey a point, but his complete lack of tact when doing so.",1241025904

Travel sites are a great example.<p>Companies like TripAdvisor literally have an army of 30-40 people whose sold job is link building and they measure how many they are able to generate per day.  They literally calculate the ""cost-per-link"".<p>So, while they are not buying text links (which Google forbids), they ARE hurling manpower at linkbuilding in a systematic way.<p>So, if a link is a ""vote"" and Google is democratic, many SEO-centric sites like TripAdvisor are hiring people to drag voters to the ballot box and persuade them to vote for them.",1241024488
