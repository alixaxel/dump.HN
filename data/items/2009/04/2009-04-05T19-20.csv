Because of that I think the killer use case for a Kiva iPhone app is evangelizing Kiva to others: showing them the investments I've made, the repayments, the status updates from the entrepreneurs, and letting people look around for other people on the site that appeal to them.  Help me show my friends - over dinner - that they should put money into Kiva.  Actually signing up or doing lending on the iPhone, I think will always be simpler on my full computer.<p>When you were pitching the idea Dave McClure mentioned that the biggest problem Kiva has is inventory of borrowers, not of lenders.  I think that didn't come properly over the mic.<p>I think what you're doing is great - I'm stopping by Startup Weekend later on today and will say hello.

How did Republicans get into a discussion of the missile capabilities of China and/or defensive mechanisms carrier battle groups might or might not have?<p>Come on, guys. Take the politics somewhere else. People of both parties have lots of differing opinions as to various threats posed by various entities. Until it gets to funding, it's a professional judgment thing, not a partisan thing. And we're not discussing funding.<p>I don't think we're in danger right now of unlimited war with anybody, but then again nobody is paying me to worry about it. I think the point of strategic surprise is to maneuver your country into such a position that it <i>could</i> launch a surprise attack and get away with it -- your opponent has no time to build a counter-measure.<p>Of course, believing that a dominant weapon system from the 1940s is still viable today might be completely crazy. History tells us that things change dramatically in warfare. On the other hand, if it is <i>not</i> total war, then who cares what systems exist that are not going to be used?<p>There's a very interesting discussion about military theory and history here.

It seemed to me that the language and concepts seemed really <i>old</i>, in a way that furiously contradicted its sci-fi nature... When I read Dickens, for example, I don't get a feeling that its thinking is old-fashioned. Although written centuries ago, the thoughts are still fresh and powerful.<p>When I last re-read parts of the Foundation series (I didn't get through the whole of it), there were so many things there which seemed... passé. Part of it was the language, and part of it was, I guess, the technology.<p>I think this is the curse of science fiction. Because it gambles on predicting the future, and predicting the future is so damn hard, it invariably diverges from the real future more and more as time passes. And the more it diverges, the more the science seems pointless and outdated.<p>I shudder to think how ""hard sf"" novels like ""Red Mars"" will read in 30 years, when another bunch of major technological revolutions will have come to pass...",1238960887

a practical nation, never saw the danger to which they were exposed.  For
many years they had been spending nearly a hundred millions a year upon
their army and their fleet.  Squadrons of Dreadnoughts costing two
millions each had been launched.  They had spent enormous sums upon
cruisers, and both their torpedo and their submarine squadrons were
exceptionally strong.  They were also by no means weak in their aerial
power, especially in the matter of seaplanes.  Besides all this, their
army was very efficient, in spite of its limited numbers, and it was the
most expensive in Europe.  Yet when the day of trial came, all this
imposing force was of no use whatever, and might as well have not
existed.  Their ruin could not have been more complete or more rapid if
they had not possessed an ironclad or a regiment.  And all this was
accomplished by me, Captain John Sirius, belonging to the navy of one of
the smallest Powers in Europe, and having under my command a flotilla of
eight vessels, the collective cost of which was eighteen hundred thousand

As the Ruby community has grown throughout the years, there have been some controversies among Ruby users every now and again. For example, now that there are many Specs and Tests to run when testing a Ruby implementation, there has been the implementation of a minimalistic and fast runner for them which was not meant to be fully compatible with RSpec and Test/Unit, which has caused some discontentment at times... :-)<p>JRuby too is not without its own love/hate feedbacks among potential users. ;-)<p>That said, Ruby and its ecosystem is not ""too big to fail"" yet. Other languages and systems like Java and C# are ""too big to fail"" and it can be hard to compete against them with other less-supported tools. Scala builds on top of Java and to some extent it works great that way, right? Ruby ""loves"" the Java world in the JRuby form and it works quite OK that way, without the static typing and absolute performance of Scala.<p>Scala and Ruby belong to different typing systems, static and dynamic, and may well be extremes on each end of that spectrum. Ruby has had a ""motto"" of encouraging ""duck-typing"" as in ""if it walks like a duck, quacks like duck, then it's a duck"", so no need to check the is_a?(Duck) with Ruby. It kind of betrays the way Ruby is ""meant to be"" to do stuff like that. If big systems weren't to be built in Ruby, Ruby on Rails is that exception, that wonder of a miracle, really. Ruby on Rails with all kinds of plugins and stuff can be quite a featureful framework... And yet, it's constantly under development and the (lack of) typing system hasn't killed it just yet...<p>In celebrities wars, we are just fans really...",1238960444

Anderson, which is a crap book that speculates about very little in a sci-fi setting.<p>If you think about it, starting a company that makes a new product is basically speculating about a world that is unlike our current world because of your product!

Such behavior only increases the church's ""general fund"" and would seem to be equally distasteful to you.<p>What about spending money from one's tax rebate on a church raffle?<p>Also, how is anyone being forced to contribute money to a church they oppose?  Are you saying that if my tax dollars went partially to the $0.50 someone used to purchase that donut at a Presbyterian bake sale, that my tax dollars are now being used to support a church I oppose?",1238958221

I can only guess that he sees negative Ruby coverage like this as a threat to new Ruby development, and thus the future of his consultancy.<p>With few exceptions, Ruby applications running on MRI will be wholly unsuited to high throughput environments.  This is true regardless of how good your Ruby code is.  Saying that using Object#kind_of? is bad Ruby coding may be true but it's mostly orthogonal to the speed of the code.  Even the most aesthetically pleasing, extensible, and clean Ruby code will be slow.<p>After a certain threshold of requests per second the bottleneck will almost always become Ruby.  After all, it might not even matter how aggressive your caching strategy is if it can take upwards of 50ms to even talk to your cache.  MRI Ruby's IO subsystem and its threading model absolutely hamstring its suitability for even IO bound applications.<p>The good news is that Ruby will improve in the future.  For better or worse, Engine Yard hitched its wagon to the 1.8.x generation of Ruby.  Engine Yard's customers will be using the 1.8.x series of interpreters for quite some time to come.  And Engine Yard has the engineering know how and an economic interest on improving that generation of Ruby.<p>But in the meantime those of us building applications that need to make efficient use of a given set of hardware are left with a choice.  Do we fight with our platform tooth and nail to try and wring even an acceptable amount throughput out of it?  Or do we change our platform to best suit the problems in front of us?",1238958054

You yell.  That's why cable TV news shows (and politics in general) suck so much -- you get two sides who refuse to actually contradict each other competing on volume to have their message triumph over the other.<p>That's because most of the people watching are going to come away with one idea, and <i>you want those people</i>.  If you want to ""win"" in the minds of those simple-minded people, and your opponent isn't saying something that can be easily falsified, you have to compete on volume, arrogance, and ferocity.<p>On the other hand, if you only care about the viewers or readers who are capable of having a nuanced view, you can simply say what you have to say, as clearly and cogently as you know how.  They'll understand and remember.  But will you really be satisfied with those people?  Probably not, if you're fighting for votes or market share.
