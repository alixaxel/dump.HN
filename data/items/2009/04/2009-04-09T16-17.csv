The basic premise is sound, but why can't I just buy something from Ztail and then have an option to return it a year later directly to them for a fixed price (like Chegg for textbooks)?  I don't want to deal with eBaying it myself.  There are way too many intermediaries involved for me to feel comfortable as a consumer.  Are they planning on making all the affiliate revenue first and then figuring out how to handle the refunds a year down the line?<p>I like the example in the TC article of the $900 stroller.

However they will continue to exist regardless.<p>I hold the opinion that good hackers should be able to use the most appropriate tool for the job, not debunk one language over another.

554688,comment,554295,554384,0,0,Retric,,,"I think focusing on selling to other companies is a difficult trap to get out of.  After the first sale companies can be milked for an extended period for support contracts / upgrades.  Innovation is not really needed and growth / profit are an easy to understand process.  You can even make money by bribing middle managers (see: drug companies for an example of this).<p>However, individuals require far more bang for the buck. So the margins tend to be far smaller and you need to sell to large numbers of people constantly to keep up.<p>At the same time selling to companies tends to focus on boring products so most of your innovative people tend to leave.  It's not exactly a binary choice, but companies like AT&T often go from selling to individuals, to making money from companies, to making money from the government.  In the end the quality of your competition tends to drop the closer you are to working for the government which is why I think it's a death spiral.  Overtime the company becomes unable to deal with change and the next round of innovative companies tend to disrupt them.<p>PS: Which is not to say old companies like GM can't sell products to customers it's just they stop being able to make much money doing so unless they can leverage a monopoly.",1239296199

I am also known to express dismay whenever a friend tells me he will take/keep a full time job. A few days ago I was at a party when I ran into an old gym buddy. I knew he was a pharmaceuticals post graduate then and I wanted to kick back and forth a few ideas someone else raised to be about starting a medical software business. My friend said he was working full time at his university and he wasn't interested in losing that lazy but paying academic gig. It really ruined my night and I kept trying to talk him out of it.<p>Sometimes people will come to me with ideas and I will take them and run with them. The next day I would have been exhausted all possibilities and now I have several pages of business analysis in my notebook. Only problem is, people usually ""have"" ideas but they're not convinced of them. It than falls on you whether to put the 4 weeks of coding necessary to launch the service and start marketing it and make $, along side your other projects in the little time you have. It's a judgment call you have to make, and I always choose to ignore it and just apply the lessons I ""learned"" to my own projects.<p>Ideas are cheap, just make sure you're not telling them to an _executioner_ if you're not yourself a taker.

By contrast, developers usually expect a particular version of software to generate revenue for a few years at best, and even then there's the expectation that the developer should release patches throughout the lifespan of the software.

These visas are basically a ""I'm coming to the USA to get a big wage and send a ton of money home"" visa, and I don't know if a lack of these will help the economy (by reducing the amount of $$$ going to a foreign country) or hurt it (lack of workers reduces the net income more than the worker sending money out of country).<p>Personally I believe this is more likely to hurt the economy. I'm sure it doesn't help that the workers send money to a country that largely doesn't invest in the US (there's minimal 'imports' into India from the US), but I'm sure the products these workers make will more than cover the money sent out of country.",1239294460
