572313,comment,572248,572248,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"With all due respect: developers are not designers, and visa versa. <i>Puts on M$ Monkey Suit</i>, ""Delegate, delegate, delegate!"" I know you're not a big company, but that doesn't matter — if you're developing a consumer-facing web application, you need to be thinking about UX/UI, branding, etc. The bar is raised, web-app market is ultra-competitive,  consumers will ditch a bad looking site.<p>In my humblest opinion, your current website is better structured and more professional looking than ss5u.png, but that's not to say it can't be improved. I too am not a fan of the color scheme (brown, orange, etc.) but from a design standpoint, it's feels like a complete thought while ss5u.png looks and feels like an unfinished wireframe (as a customer, I'd wonder if your product is unfinished too). However, there are elements from ss5u.png that I think you can merge, like the call-to-action button for one, the lighter color scheme, etc.<p>I think people mistakenly believe a designer's job is easy, and quite frankly it's not... it's torture. Reading your blog post, I was happy to see you came to the same conclusion. :) People see a clean and simple design and say, ""that's easy, I can do that!"" but fail to realize the amount of work and iterations that it took to get to that point. Visual harmony requires balance, and there's a reason why few companies can reproduce Apple's simplistic product design. It's NOT easy.<p>Designers live in a perpetual cycle of NEVER being satisfied because we tend to be obsessive-compulsive. I'm glad you got to experience this, but now I think you should put down the mouse, get back to hacking, and let a professional handle the job. :)",1240322385

You can see this pattern on the Internet any day you like. Go onto a Tolkein newsgroup or discussion forum, and try saying ""You know, The Two Towers is a little dull. I mean loooong. We didn't need that much description about the forest, because it's pretty much the same forest all the way.""<p>Try having that discussion.

Go in and try and have that discussion.<p>Now, in some places people say ""Yes, but it needed to, because it had to convey the sense of lassitude,"" or whatever.
