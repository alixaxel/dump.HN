568590,comment,568364,568560,0,0,matt1,,,"In my experience, if you ask the people who use IE6 why they don't upgrade most of them will respond with something like ""What's IE6? Oh you mean Internet Explorer. What's wrong with the one I have?"" and then <i>if</i> you finally convince them they they should upgrade you have to explain to them how to do it, which for most people who are still using IE6 can be a big challenge.<p>My grandmother uses IE6.

For any item where there's significant variance, argue about it until the variance dies down, or break the thing up into smaller tasks and re-estimate.
