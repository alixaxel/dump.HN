The image showed up fine.<p>This is an extremely clever solution. I know jQuery UI's icons are in one giant image file and background offsets are used to display the correct icon, but this is probably better for a dynamic solution because the amount of CPU it would take to stitch upwards of 100 images together.",1240438294

It's also that they use the same <i>name</i> for the crippled version. They will be derided for that, and that bad PR is going to carry over to the entire Windows 7 brand. What are they thinking?<p>Apple put a Mac OS with a ""different user experience"" on the iPhone. But they didn't advertise that to anyone but developers. The word ""Mac"" is not mentioned in connection with the phone. The iPhone has a <i>really</i> different user experience -- it's not just the Mac OS on slow hardware with a one-app-at-once limitation, it's a whole different universe. And it is very deliberately branded, <i>not</i> as a very small, kind of slow portable computer with no keyboard, but as the world's best phone.",1240438247
