573428,comment,572730,573335,0,0,Silhouette,,,"So what happens when some big corporation has managed to lawyer their way to copyright over pretty much all basic font designs, and anything remotely sensible is close enough to be considered a derivative work? Now no-one can use <i>writing</i> to communicate. There is no sane universe in which a tax on writing is in the interests of society.<p>Font files, as in the programs that describe the shape of a font in vector or bitmap terms, are already copyrightable, but I think the US gets this one absolutely right by specifically excluding font designs from being monopolised.",1240368647

573426,comment,573127,573127,0,0,mahmud,,,"Worse is NOT Better; use a safe and high-performance programming language and learn its foreign-function interface to call out to C and C++. Life is too short for core-dumps and premature optimization, plus you only have two feet to shoot at.<p>The better designed a language the better its development process feels. You can get immersed in a lowly Lisp, J, or Forth listener. Just a little black xterm with nothing else to it, and you feel productive already (never mind the amazing environments there are for Lisp.) BADLY designed and malignant languages have 3rd party tools to augment its functionality. There are things to bolt on, hammer in and stuff to bake into the scaffolding before you stuff in boxes. The C and C++ equivalent of a listener is `cat` or maybe the system-shipped vi or nano or pico. Can you seriously feel yourself getting something done?*<p>* (I will answer myself and say yes; I learned Unix programming over a serial line, but it was not an immersive experience; I had books on my desk and lap and was flipping back and forth to get anything done; a masochistic sort of fun, fueled by the mischievous possibility of breaking into another account ;-)",1240368558

573382,comment,570095,570095,0,0,asinglenet,,,"No, Assembla is not proud of having such a low  selling price.  We have seen that as a problem since the beginning.  The original sin is not the current low selling price. The original sin was offering the ""private"" product for free during a time when it wasn't a serious business for us.  We took an enormous amount of abuse when we discontinued this product, and to soften the blow, we worked to keep prices low.  We did this even though it's clear that a customer who makes a decision based on a $2 price point isn't going to make much of a contribution to the company.  It's now clear that our gesture wasn't fully appreciated, and it's dragging down the pricepoint for our serious customers - startups, corporate product developers, outsourcers, agencies, and consulting companies that need professsional management features.<p>I have to disagree with the guy that says the service doesn't have value over $20.  Even on the face of it, he would replace it with a server costing $50/month, plus install and admin time costing at least that.  So, he's already at $100.  He's probably only using the subversion repository, which he could easily install on his own.  However, if you are serious about getting the most from your team, you would be using the  alerts, code browser, the ticketing system, which would cost you substantially more if you bought it from Atlassian or Fogbugz, and be well worth it.  If you have a consulting operation, as many Assembla customers do, you will use the time tracking and reporting. In other words, if you manage your team professionally, you will get a lot of value out of this software.  And, certainly we will work on charging appropriately.",1240365862
