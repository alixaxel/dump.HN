So that if you add or remove an index, you don't need to adjust all the queries on the table, for example. Obviously the query planner is imperfect, but planner hints are fairly common in practice.

I noticed they did have an ambient occlusion setting which produced some noisy-looking shadows (though that could've been a video artifact). Obviously difficult (i.e. highly indirect) lighting situations will seriously impact the framerate, but it would still kick ass if they could hardware accelerate it. Given that they use GLSL to define their surface properties, I'd be interested in how they figure out where to cast their random rays.<p>Baking this into an ASIC instead of an FPGA would be awesome.

That'd give you a great lifestyle, but even if you can manage to rent it out for $6m the next year, that's not <i>business</i> growth. <i>business</i> growth would be renting out 2 properties, 3, etc etc. Reinvesting the profit into the business in order to provide sustainable long term growth.<p>>> ""I would think that's the nirvana description of any business, though.""<p>So I'd disagree with this.
