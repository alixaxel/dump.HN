It's all about you :P In reality social pressure comes from so many sources.<p><i>popularity is typically an extrinsic measure, relative to your peers (i.e. it wouldn't make sense for everyone in your high school to be considered one of the popular kids) while attractiveness is an intrinsic measure </i>\nThe whole point of my piece was that we are told attractiveness is an intrinsic measure whereas, in many ways for women, it is much more arbitrary and akin to popularity. Women in the states above all want to be thin. But if we can invent a pill tomorrow that will make everybody thin, is everyone suddenly going to be hot? For a while maybe, but soon a new arbitrary standard that excludes the majority of the population will emerge.<p><i> clear that being smart is a cause/excuse for being unattractive </i>\nMy other main point is that being a conventionally attractive woman is hard work! Think about it this way...Katherine Heigl had to lose 10 pounds to play opposite Seth Rogan in Knocked Up.<p><i>I think it's abhorrent to tell smart kids being anti-social in general or smart girls rejecting their femininity in particular that their behavior is some sort of badge of honor.</i>\nI'm a girly-girl. There's nothing I love more than to put on some makeup and look hot at a party. There's a difference between enjoying something when it's fun for you and having it be an obligation.<p><i>If there's something you'd like to change about yourself, change it. If you're happy with yourself as you are, even better. People should accept themselves, flaws and strengths alike, </i><p>That is exactly as I would like the world to be. But right now, if you are a woman and you don't diet and you don't wear makeup and you don't spend a lot of money on grooming products and cloths and frankly a lot of other bullshit guys don't even know...you are at a distinct disadvantage. I'm just a regular girl who is tired of the bullshit. I haven't cut back on personal hygiene or anything. But I will not go on a diet or obsess about my weight unless it is for health reasons. I haven't read a fashion magazine for year, and while I do have nice cloths for special occasions, my wardrobe and spending on beauty is a fraction that of my peers.",1239766741

562855,comment,562014,562568,0,0,dkarl,,,"Radical honesty isn't a presently effective means of communication.  It's an attempt to reform the channel and move towards a new protocol.  Radical honesty guarantees being misunderstood in the short run, because if you say something more honest than expected, you're communicating -- according to the prevailing protocol -- ""I'm desperate"" or ""Fuck you"" or both or something worse.  You have to accept the cost of the miscommunication you cause by speaking your own niche language to people who only speak the prevailing language (and probably speak it more fluently than you do, simply because they specialize.)<p>Frankly, I don't see the point.  Most people <i>are</i> pretty honest already, if you understand the language they speak.  White lies are designed to be transparent; people who expect them to deceive don't get it, and people who are deceived by white lies deceive themselves.  ""You're not fat"" can mean so many things depending on how you say it:<p>1.  You're not fat.<p>2.  You're worried about being fat?  Really?<p>3.  Why are you asking that when we're all twenty pounds heavier than you?  What kind of bitch are you?  Fish for your compliments somewhere else.<p>4.  You're fat, but I don't want to hear about your problems.<p>5.  A better question is, are you hot?  And the answer is yes.<p>Et cetera.  There's no point in being dissatisfied with the channel and the protocol because you can actually communicate whatever you want on it.  I'd rather just get better at speaking and understanding the language that everybody else speaks.  The only problem is that sometimes honesty is unexpected, and the protocol is not optimized for unexpected honesty.  If you want to say something completely honest, you might have to spend some time setting it up to avoid it being interpereted as ""Fuck you.""",1239765847

I'm about to be late for dinner at a friend's so I don't have time to come up with something now, but if no one has by the time I'm back I'll think about it.<p>Edit:  How about the sum of the differences of adjacent elements - n - 2?  This seems to capture the notion that something reversed but in order is okay.  I still don't think this is admissible though.<p>Well, here's an admissible one.  Count how many adjacent elements are not the element to the left + 1, and divide that sum by 2.  Pretty sure that'd work.",1239765421

Since nearly all startups are unprofitable for a while, I suspect that most don't really care what the tax codes in the area are, as long as they aren't ridiculous (insert your version of this accordingly).<p>I feel tweaking tax codes to encourage startups won't have its intended consequence, but rather encourage established companies to try to pretend that they're startups.  They are much more likely to have the resources to chase tax incentives than a real bootstrapping startup.",1239765260

562833,comment,562513,562513,0,0,endtime,,,"One naive solution is to realize that you can move (remove/reinsert) any element with two reversals.  For example, given:<p>[1 2 3 4 5 6]<p>You can reverse elements 1-5 (if indexing starts at 0):<p>[1 6 5 4 3 2]<p>And then reverse elements 1-4:<p>[1 3 4 5 6 2]<p>This moves the element in position 1 to position 5.  Generally, to move the element in position x to position y (shifting everything else to make room for it), do the following:<p><pre><code>  def move(v, x, y):\n    v.reverse(x, y)\n\n    if y > x:\n      v.reverse(x, y-1)\n    else\n      v.reverse(x+1, y)\n\n    return v\n\n</code></pre>\nGiven this ability to move/insert elements, you can implement several sort algorithms.  In fact, it's easy to see that there's a O(n * x) sort here, where x is the runtime of the reversal operator.",1239764971
