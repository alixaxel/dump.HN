The reason is that creating software is basically the process of taking something from the real world and reducing it to a series of logical components and relationships. This is pretty much the exact process for applying formal logic to philosophical questions.<p>On the other hand, actually coding the software taps far more into the mathematical and linguistic aspects of formal logic, since it's involves piecing together units of mathematical logic to construct a logical machine.<p>In practice, this whole process is obviously more nuanced, interconnected and filled with gray areas.<p>It's also certainly possible to argue that all reasoning is math, but this isn't a new concept and dates back to Plato.",1238597966

I say this not just from his self-deprecation, which I've learned not to take at face value. But these weird non-sequitur ""questions"" he comes up with for article titles suggests he is not at an adult level of proficiency with his craft. Asking whether programmers ""should be 'mathematically inclined'"" is like asking whether movie directors ""should be visually creative."" They damned well better be, or go find something to do with their lives that is not a waste of their and their audience's time.<p>When I was, oh, twenty or so, I used to be one of those systems programmers who thought that the fanciest data structure I'd ever need was a hash table. If you write real code, that other human beings use, one of those humans will eventually use it in a way you didn't anticipiate. And in that use, N will suddenly be large! The user will expect your code to work, and with reasonable resource consumption.

What could be more math-y than that?"" (from the codinghorror post)<p>This topic seems to come up relatively frequently, and I appreciate Jeff's attempt to add to the conversation with some interestingly selected quotes. Still, the above quote to me highlights how many people, including Jeff, vastly oversimplify the math side of the equation. To put lbrandy's comment slightly differently, knowing a large number of mathematical facts will not make you a good programmer. But to me a basic explanation of “mathematical inclination” could be: a strong understanding of how a mathematical system is governed by rules, and how a problem can be parsed, compartmentalized, and addressed in pieces. It seems fairly self-evident to me that those skills would be shared by anyone whol could be described as even a competent programmer.",1238597165

Just to add a little more, people seem to get confused between the expression of mathematical thoughts and having mathematical thoughts. Mathematical symbols are abbreviations for ideas that, if expressed in natural language, would become tedious. Mathematical thinking is something people do everyday. For example, parents have to use combinatorial optimization everyday to figure out a best strategy for running errands. Few parents are schooled to a formal expression of the mental processes they go through in determining a solution but they weigh different goals and optimize nonetheless.<p>Oddly, a study that is all about exploration of ideas and abstraction has been narrowly defined in many people's minds. Hopefully mathematics educators can break these limited views in years to come.",1238596961

We haven’t committed to open conversations about our products or services because we haven’t signed Get Satisfaction’s pact on Get Satisfaction’s site which generates Get Satisfaction’s income? That’s awfully close to blackmail (or a shakedown or a mafioso protection scheme).</i><p>It doesn't matter whether Get Satisfaction wrote the false and insulting phrase about ""open conversations"" by accident or on purpose. It <i>was</i> insulting, and false, and if Jason's response came off as a bit angry nobody should be the least bit surprised. They asked for it; they got it.<p>It also doesn't matter whether Get Satisfaction was committing a shakedown through ""ignorance"" or out of ""malice"". A shakedown is a shakedown. Get Satisfaction created a problem [1], and then asked for something of value to make the problem go away [2]. That's a shakedown.<p>I'm perfectly willing to believe that Get Satisfaction didn't <i>mean</i> to wake up one day and discover themselves in a dubiously ethical line of work. [3] But they did. To their credit, they seem to be reacting with appropriate public displays of horror and remorse.<p>---<p>[1] The problem: A site that fooled me, and apparently more than a handful of other people, into thinking it was an official 37signals support site. One that was full of questions, but no answers.<p>[2] The value: A public endorsement from 37signals, in the form of a <i>publicly visible</i> signature on a ""Company-Customer pact"". Endorsements are valuable. (The pact itself seems to be a bunch of legally meaningless pledges, but then again I'm not a lawyer; if it contains any legally actionable language, then the mere act of signing it is a cost.)<p>Also: A public notice, on the Get Satisfaction page, that 37signals employees visit that page -- a notice which, once it is up, will tend to obligate 37signals to devote valuable employee time to answering questions on a third-party support system that's incompatible with their standard support system.
The cost of having to do tech support on two -- or three, or four, or seventeen -- different public sites is nontrivial. (Copying and pasting support tickets from site to site is inefficient. Hacking up RSS feeds to integrate trouble reports from <i>n</i> different sites is inefficient. Answering the FAQs <i>2n</i> times per week, rather than just <i>n</i> times per week, is inefficient.) More importantly, splitting your support effort across multiple venues dilutes your brand, dilutes your customer base, and confuses your customers (""where should I report this problem, again""?), and that's even <i>more</i> costly.<p>[3] I've had the experience of suddenly realizing that I'm working on an unethical project.
