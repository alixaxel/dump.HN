Most of the time, these kinds of arguments center around the disproportionate male/female ratios and talk about how we might correct them.  They never really say /why/ we need more females in tech.<p>The speaker in the video presents a real and compelling argument.  The female way of looking at technology, at how interactions occur, at how tech shapes the world and how the future will happen, all of this is different from the male perspective.  And it's a valuable perspective.  Having females in the tech workplace isn't just a matter of being politically correct.  It's a matter of not dismissing a fascinating and helpful way of looking at the world.",1240556097

You come with an idea, which is essentially worthless without the tech guy. So it's only fair that you pay him for the prototype. At that point, both of you will be more comfortable teaming up.<p>Also, I would make sure you have the tech guy assign any and all IP ahead of time.
