579531,comment,579391,579391,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I understand what Guido is saying to some extent.  I thought through it, and my logic seems to go as follows.<p>1.  Compilers are not perfect.  In fact, they are incredibly dumb and get things wrong all the time.  Add in the fact that the compiler often does not have enough information to properly make an optimization, the output goes from ""retarded"" to ""braindead.""<p>2.  If you make certain types of optimizations and tell people that it is fine to rely on them--even if those optimizations will not always work--performance on average will get worse.<p>Tail recursion seems like a classic case of an optimization which, if one relied on it but the optimization failed, would have catastrophic results (a crash due to running out of stack space).  In a very simple language like Scheme, relying on tail recursion is probably not a problem because of how simple such an optimization is.  But with something of the complexity of python, it might not be as safe.  Given the catastrophic number of regressions in compilers these days, imagine what would happen if your program was made for Python 2.5, which had tail recursion optimization, and then you updated to 2.6, and due to a change in optimization code, it failed to do tail recursion optimization on one particular function?  Your program would crash.<p>I think in general it is <i>never</i> safe to make the assumption that an optimizer <i>will</i> make a particular ""good decision"".  Compilers and optimizers are incredibly stupid, and relying on them to be smart is a sure way to end up with all sorts of problems.  Yet with something like a C compiler and loop unrolling, the consequences of such a thing can never be too bad: even in the worst case, you only lose performance.  But with tail recursion, a failure could mean an actual crash.",1240711136

579518,comment,579488,579488,0,0,mdasen,,,"It depends.  If HP is going to stay a commodity provider of regular items, then no.  Its current discipline is well suited to that.  If you're just making laptops and printers and monitors and whatnot that are generally interchangeable with Dell's or Acer's or whomever's, you need to be as lean as possible and as disciplined as possible.<p>And that's what HP is: a company whose products you can substitute with those from their competitors pretty easily.  But it's not just HP.  It's most PC makers.  Really, it's just that Apple is creating and defining new markets and distinguishing itself from others by making different things.  In my opinion Apple is making better things, but from an objective standard they're at least different - Mac OS X (whether you're a fan or not) is different; the iPhone was very different from PalmOS and Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices that came before it.<p>But it's really easy to screw that up - and Apple did for many years.  Let's face it, the Newton was different too - different in a way that people didn't like.  The classic Mac OS had its fans, but not like OS X does.<p>So, HP can continue to run a lean business providing essentially the same things that other companies provide or it can try to be Apple - to create something new and shoot the moon.  But the latter is risky.  They risk pouring money into things that are crap.  Very few companies succeed in this arena and I personally don't think HP has the vision to pull it off.  I'm not saying that they don't have talented people or that I'm any smarter or anything of that sort.  It really takes someone special to make markets like you need to in this situation - someone like Steve Jobs.<p>I'm not saying he's some sort of genius.  I'm saying that he's been undisturbed by past failures, willing to get up and say that he's just invented a better sliced bread when it's actually nothing special, willing to have the sort of ""I know better"" attitude that allows you to ignore all of the naysaying that comes along with doing what hasn't been done before.  Because every great thing looks stupid, impossible, unprofitable, etc. until it's been done.<p>And HP doesn't have the arrogance to make the stupid, impossible, unprofitable a reality.<p>/I used the word arrogance there.  I didn't mean it in a negative sense.  I just wanted to portray that it requires a certain chutzpah to believe that you can do something that so many brilliant people haven't thought of or haven't been able to pull off.",1240710559

579494,story,,,5,6,IsaacSchlueter,"Ask HN: What is the name for this pattern?",,"I've found myself using this pattern in Javascript a lot lately (simplified to show its essential characteristics.)<p><pre><code>    worker = function () {
        doSomeWork();
        if (isDone()) finishUp();
        else window.setTimeout(worker, 0);
    }
</code></pre>
The basic idea is to use window.setTimeout to schedule another execution of the worker function at the end of the current command queue.  While it's not threaded, per se, if your ""doSomeWork"" functions are small enough, it may as well be for many applications.  It allows you to write recursive operations in Javascript, without throwing the ""too much recursion"" error when the data gets big.  And, while it's generally not as fast as straight iteration, it will avoid the ""Script on this page is taking too long"" error, and it doesn't lock the browser, so it ""feels"" faster.<p>For operations that you can expect to be slow, or for doing a lot of different actions on a busy page, this pattern is great.<p>The only problem is that I don't know what it's called, or if it even has a name.  I saw a page by Douglas Crockford calling this ""eteration"", but I think that also means something else, and it never stuck anyhow.  It's <i>sort of</i> like tail recursion, in that it is a sort of recursion that doesn't tie up the call stack, but unlike tail recursion, it doesn't track a return value, and it doesn't block the program while it's running.  The closest analogy I can think of is putting sleep(0) in a loop so that the OS can step in.<p>Does it already have a name?  If not, got a suggestion?",1240708816
