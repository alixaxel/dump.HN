543708,comment,542336,543476,0,0,10ren,,,"<i>ACCESS</i> I was saying two things, one you saw a refined version of elsewhere: ""making it exciting is more important than making it easy to develop for"". Designing a great platform (in terms of the insides being usable for developers) doesn't matter if the platform does something great. Many sins are forgiven if you have this. I think there are probably many examples of horribly ugly technologies that became wildly successful because they enable access to something exciting (DOS? windows? netscape navigator?)<p><i>USABILITY</i> To elaborate on the other idea: it's much easier to make something usable if it has a specialized purpose. Fewer features, fewer interactions/interdependencies, fewer controls, fewer things to go wrong - it's gonna be simpler to use. e.g. ipod shuffle. That is, <i>not being able to do things</i> makes it easier to use.<p>The big problem with a platform is that you don't really know what the specific use will be, nor the exact nature and parameters of it. A <i>platform</i>, by definition, is general, and not specialized to one specific purpose. And you won't even know the nature of the <i>general</i> use. Except, perhaps, that it will want to be part of whatever the cool, exciting thing you have going is - that's a predictive organizing principle.<p>Therefore, for a platform, rather than trying to guess at the kinds of uses it will have, maybe just say: (1). what is the cool, exciting thing that we enable? (2). how can we let developers build something that has that cool, exciting thing? That is, an API that gives them access to whatever they need to do that. It doesn't need to be great access, they just need to be able to do it somehow.<p>This is ""overgeneral"" in the sense that you can not only do the things you want to do, but you can also do things you don't want to do. This looseness makes it harder to use - if it was an exact fit to the problem, it would be a delight to use. This extra power gives you ""enough rope to hang yourself"".<p><i>RAILS</i> On reflection, I think Rails is a much later stage in the development cycle: webapps are in a more mature stage, and by that I mean that people now know what kinds of things they want to do, and most importantly, what kind of defaults are useful.  At an earlier stage, we didn't have enough collective experience to know those things. This knowledge is to do with how webapps appear to users externally, as well as what architectures and internal approaches have been found to work. Webapps are becoming an understood art, when previously, it was a bit of a black art.<p>Rails represents a systemization of webapps; no longer ad hoc, many design decisions are now captured in a mechanical tool. It is specialized to the task.",1238694211

Ironically enough, I am working on a gaming startup myself - I understand that if there is a need, someone will supply it.<p>I still find it hard to believe that gaming has even become something considered a real profession.  Something just feels off about that.  Kids used to dream about becoming astronauts and doctors when I was in elementary school and I honestly don't want that to change.

543684,comment,543293,543386,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"It also corresponds to what I've read before, that a high-meat (not pure protein, but diets inclusive of bone marrows or organs like liver and stuff generally found in pâtés) and high animal fat diet can almost completely prevent the development of diabetes, and can actually get diabetics off of insulin.<p>I believe the theory is, is that the body uses insulin to convert glucose to glycogen, AKA 'animal starch', and every other effect (that I'm aware of) it has on the body is not considered good. Example: It promotes triglyceride production from fatty acids (high triglycerides are usually a big factor in heart disease), and decreases the metabolism of fats (I think everyone wants this one high), proteins and reduces gluconeogenesis, which can exacerbate lactose intolerance in some people.<p>Everything more complex than raw glucose doesn't require insulin. That's why the body largely doesn't react to fructose (which is a result of our ancestry, primates largely live in a symbiosis with the trees they feed off because larger animals like Elephants frequently kill the trees in the process of foraging, but shrieking monkeys tend to stop them) so that we do consume more of it. I think it also helps that foods high in fructose (IE fruits) are generally also high in vitamins. I mean some of the recommended RDA's for vitamin C are actually around 6,000-12,000 mg a day (30,000 mg if you're sick). Basically from what I understand, if you look at our close relatives diets (which are very similar to our ancestors diets) they essentially eat 1:1 ratio of vitamin C (in mg) to kcals. So an adult male should eat 2,500 mg of vitamin C and 2,500 kcals. Incidentally vitamin C is used in the body to produce carnitine, which moves fatty acids into the mitochondria to produce ATP.<p>Your average goat produces around 13,000 mg of vitamin C in normal health through biosynthesis, which has to make you wonder about WHO's RDA of 45 mg a day if a goat produces 290 times that amount. We, unfortunately don't biosynthesise vitamin C.",1238693535

Remind jury of step 3 (that stuff like 4 factors is actually only illustrative and not definitive) and that at the end of the day whether or not the defendant is making ""fair use"" is entirely up to the jury and the jury's conscience.<p>Step 5: argue from conscience that there's no way the current set of file-sharing penalties are in any sense ""fair"", and again remind that it is ultimately the jury's responsibility to make a decision as to what is or is not ""fair use"" and thereby ensure fairness.<p>This is a better strategy than it sounds in summary, though it only stands a chance of working if Nesson's hopes for a hollywood-type free-ranging trial come about; the threat of such a thing may be all he needs to get this case to settle, which counts as a win for his client, even if it's a sub-optimal way to win for Nesson himself.<p>The argument for ""illustrativeness"" is genius if fully developed; it's basically an attempt to transform the restrictions on the grant of authority to Congress to institute copyright and patent laws (""to promote the progress of science and useful arts"") from dead letters to the source of a notion of ""fair use"":<p>- on the one hand, if such-and-such a use is shown to promote the progress of science and useful arts then laws restricting such a use require scrutiny (to ensure the net effect of the restriction balances out to promotion of progress of science and useful arts)<p>- on the other hand, if a restriction on a particular use does nothing to promote science or useful arts, then it's perhaps consitutional<p>...and in this picture the ""4 factor"" test would just be a useful set of guidelines for determining when a law-as-written is unconstitutional as applied to a particular set of circumstances.<p>It's also clever for its effect on the judiciary: Nesson's hardest targets there will hail from the right-wing, who typically lean towards strict constructionism (supposedly, only considering the raw language of some law) or an originalist (supposedly only considering the original intent of the writers of some law). However, it'd be <i>difficult</i> for either of those two schools to straightfacedly argue that the constitutional language about the ""progress of science and useful arts"" is just decorative fluff -- it'd put them in the position of having to argue that ""yes, that language does mean something, we just disagree about what"", which is in-and-of-itself a huge win.<p>And, secondly, if he can get this to a jury all he has to do is get done with steps 2 and 3 and then he's converted the trial from a nitpicky study of specific statutes to a general debate on ""fairness"", and then he's on much stronger ground.<p>He could, from there, abstract from the specifics of the case at hand to arguing that from the position of someone who isn't that familiar with the law -- eg, a 10 y/o -- it literally would make <i>no sense</i> for copying a cd for a friend or downloading something from the internet to carry fines in the 6 figure range, using argumentation along the following:<p>- tv ads for isps are always emphasizing download speeds for downloading music and movies etc. and sending files, etc.<p>- tv ads for computers always talk about how easy it is to send files or burn cds and dvds, etc.<p>- blank cds and dvds are available at supermarkets and 7-11 and all that<p>- stuff like ipods or cellphones with music capacity are source-agnostic; even with the itunes store it doesn't stop you from loading mp3s from elsewhere<p>- youtube, etc is full of music videos and so on, often with hundreds of thousands of views and not uploaded by anyone ""official""<p>- tv and radio and internet radio stream free content over the air and it's legal to record it<p>- school projects often involve xeroxing stuff and making collages and so on<p>- there's libraries (run by the government) that loan stuff out for free, it's fine to let friends borrow stuff, and if you're going to loan to friends it's more convenient to just burn a copy than actually loan the disc<p>...but then wtf? I downloaded some tunes and now my parents are being sued for $150k+?<p>It's not an airtight argument, but on grounds of pure fairness it's not unconvincing.<p>I doubt Nesson'll get his day in court to argue this line of reasoning -- and if he does it'll probably be shut down earlier rather than later -- but the apparent strategy (once fleshed-out) is an inspired mix both of legal interpretation and lawyerly strategy.",1238692177
