Everyone's problem/skills(i.e. ability to understand & trust particular solution)/infrastructure(e.g. needs to run on cell phone vs we gots Big Table) are slightly or massively different.  We as a profession still struggle to abstract things correctly so they can be reused.<p>It's best to not to have a solution or have a partial solution and convince your industry to work on it together thus distributing the costs and benefits.  This is commonly practiced as standards and open source.<p>Another situation were it is good to release solution you paid to build is if there are high maintenance costs associated with that solution.  Others will be incentivized to use (and thus share maintenance costs) your solution.  You will have ""lost"" the initial development cost but save on maintenance and there are multiple fringe benefits (publicity, good will, control/influence).<p>It sounds like the ICD things have low maintenance costs, creates a barrier to entry for competitors and is fundamental to medical billing and thus seen as a core competitive advantage.

579175,comment,578257,578491,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Remember that the ""flat and lifeless"" digital experience that Fremer was talking about was a long time ago.. Yeah, he's a bit of a nut, and I'm sure that some of what he hears is as much psychological as physical (especially as it regards such things as power cords _sans_ isolating filters and so forth), but the man has a point where digital is concerned. Or rather, as far as digital _was_ concerned.<p>Remember the old days? When the digital recording involved brick-wall filtering of the analog source at 20KHz before digital sampling? I sure do. Sure, the clicks and pops were gone, but the filter introduced such distortion as to make the music nearly unlistenable for anyone who could hear anything over about 16KHz. High harmonics were so far out of phase with the fundamental that anything that has a percussive component (piano, xylophone, cymbals, etc.) would hurt my teeth. We've gotten past that problem with higher sampling rates during the recording phase, and digital processing can reduce the bitrate without inducing those phase errors.<p>Redbook CD still has one major problem, though. Nyquist says that a 2F+k (where k is some small value) sampling rate is sufficient to encode an analog waveform unambiguously. For audio, that means that the 22.1KHz rate that CDs use for each channel ought to be enough. And it would be, but for the fact that there is a hidden encoding in stereo audio, and that encoding is the temporal difference between the signal's arrival at each of our two ears (or our two microphones, as the case may be). While no component of the audio signal may exceed 20KHz, proper spatial encoding may require a temporal resolution that requires the sampling rate capable of resolving a difference in arrival times of less than 50us. And yes, I understand that that's getting really finicky, and that the phase errors in most output transducers (speakers) will be greater than that, but the best equipment can _just_ make the difference perceptible. And for smaller ensembles (chamber music, acoustic jazz, folk, and that sort of thing), that spatial accuracy can take the listening experience to a level most people are completely incapable of imagining.<p>SACD and DVD-A solve the fundamental problems of Redbook, but they came to the game just a little too late. People had already decided to settle for cassettes again. Not literally, mind you -- today's cassette is the MP3 file. Even at the highest bitrates (256 or 320Kbps), MP3s are audibly inferior even to Redbook, but damn they're handy, eh? They are Good Enough(TM) for most people, and you can carry a half a billion of the things on something smaller than the crappy pocket transistor radios we had when I was a kid.<p>The upshot is that now that we can readily and cheaply produce recordings that are light years beyond anything anybody dreamed of in the '60s, the mass market that would have supported it has become irrevokably attached to yet another great leap backwards. That's really a pity.",1240685320

579150,comment,578981,579026,0,0,halo,,,"I believe the argument is supposed to counter the prevalent viewpoint that global warming is automatically a bad thing that will cause huge catastrophes without critically examining these claims. This doesn't automatically follow, and that it even may actually have some unexpected positive impacts. It's not a simplistic case of climate change solely being 'bad'.<p>In my view, the global warming ""debate"" ultimately comes down to three core questions:<p>1. How large is the effect of global warming?<p>2. What effect will this have on the planet and its inhabitants?<p>3. What is the correct, proportional, response?<p>As you get further down the question becomes broader, more complex and more difficult to answer as it's reliant on the answers to the ones above.<p>One extreme is that the effect will be huge, it will have a devastating effect and threaten the human race, and so the proportional response is to focus and invest an almost infinite amount of resource on global warming as a threat.  The other extreme is that the effect is marginal, it will do little to change the planet, therefore few-to-no resources should be dedicated to it.<p>But there's actually a huge, largely forgotten, middle ground. What if the effect is quite large, but the effect is largely changing worldwide weather cycles, so the best investment is to attempt to limit against further climate change and divert resources towards the humanitarian aspect and industrial projects to mitigate the problems instead, while watching and re-evaluating how these things progress to get a better picture of the true scale of the problem? This seems the pragmatic 'solution' that the real word politicians are trying to take, but you don't hear much about it compared to the more extreme viewpoints, not least because it doesn't make for as good headlines as 'the destruction of the world'.",1240684024
