Never forget that.<p>I have a friend with an as-yet-unreleased application for studying Japanese.  I told him what I'll tell you: I wouldn't consider charging less than $30 but I would consider trying more than $100.  Yep, that is quite a range, and it all depends on what type of student you are targeting.  To be perhaps a little unfair to my friends' prospective customers, I would expect to see no anime-related vocabulary in the $100+ product.<p>Exactly how you present your choice to the user is up to you.  ($49 a semester, $80 if you buy a year at once should lead to an ARPU in excess of $100, hopefully.)",1239681552
560970,comment,560902,560902,0,0,durin42,,,"A good basic summary of this would be ""don't use anything other than basic ASCII in filenames."" There are two very common desktop platforms (OS X, Windows) that have outright broken filename handling (OS X in particular has really odd rules for storing Unicode in filenames compared to, oh, the world). Anything requiring character encoding in a filename, much like a source code file, is a bag of hurt waiting to happen. I know there have been bugs in Subversion related to filename encoding issues, and it's been controversial in the hg world as well, where the formal solution is to treat filenames as opaque bytes because anything else becomes painful rapidly.<p>(Unsurprisingly, this problem shows itself in other places. os.listdir() in Python 3 returned Unicode strings, which is full of suck because on a Linux system filenames are bags of bytes, so two files in a directory could very well be in different encodings. Until recently (at least, have not checked recently) os.listdir() would simply silently ignore any file whose name didn't properly decode into a Unicode from the on-disk bytes.)",1239681542

Plus, almost everybody is using the same set of language data, so it is difficult to differentiate. There are already tons of completely free hobbyist- and university- created tools available if you know where to look. Plus, textbook publishers generally provide a suite of (sometimes free) apps to complement their textbooks.<p>Luckily, I don't think there is any place for ad-financed products (ads are too distracting when you are trying to memorize stuff like this), so there won't be many free <i>commercial</i> systems.<p>I am building something very similar to this.

Dubai is just another fiefdom with oil that hired some good PR agencies and did a few things that pleased ""the West.""<p>Sure. However, Western patience only goes so far. They will ignore your crimes as long as it profits them, but as soon as they start to lose money they will notice how ""barbaric"" and ""backward"" you are.<p>Dubai is a victim of the economic crisis, and people have lost money there, including many Westerners. The people advocating for labor rights in Dubai are not friends of the working man. They're the same carpet-bagging finance parasites that got us into this mess. If their revolutionary spirit and humane conscious suddenly spring to life, it's only because Dubai represents the oriental Other, and with the collapse of its economy the last chord of Western loyalty to its petrodollar was cut and the Western Man is free to attack it, waving Human Rights as a banner. The Western Man can slap a Human Rights bumper sticker on a missile and sleep happy at night, knowing he is delivering his Way of Life to whoever is on the receiving end (the survivors can always accept democracy :-)<p>Read up on what they wrote on Hong Kong in the middle of last decade; the handover to China coincided with the Asian financial crisis and Western media went full out racist and sinophobic. A decade later they were all friends of China and singing its praises, until China crashed itself and now they're decrying China holding so much T-bills.<p>[Edit: Oh, silent disapproval ;-]",1239680913

Also, I was trying to control my hand for standard form/楷书, rather than everyday cursive, so that didn't help either. Had I started learning with a tool like this, my placement would be much better, just because I would have tried very hard to minimize repositioning. Maybe. I'm still trying to think through the implications.<p>You might try recognizing the strokes, but leaving them in the background in a lighter color?<p>[big edit here]<p>Maybe resize and reposition the model character around the input character as it is written, and then provide some sort of visual feedback at the end on the delta? eg, good proportions, but you are 25% too small and 30% off center.<p>I'm trying to think of some way to a) preserve feedback while b) reinforcing the rhythmic quality of writing. Rhythm is a mnemonic aid. If you can find some way to reinforce it, that would be a huge boon to students.<p>There's a rhythm to each stroke and a composite rhythm to each character. Combined with regular patterns like radicals and phonetic roots, rhythm is what allows you to memorize thousands of characters. To the point that sometimes you have to write a character to remember its stroke order.<p>[/edit]<p>Very cool site, though. I studied all through the 90s, and the pedagogy was just awful. If I knew then what I know now about language acquisition, I could have compressed my studies into 2 or 3 years, rather than 10.
