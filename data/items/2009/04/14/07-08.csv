561166,comment,561021,561131,0,0,patio11,,,"Yep.  I have sold more than a few licenses to homeschoolers over the years.  Beyond just curricular aids there are all sorts of, e.g., compliance needs, planning needs, record management needs, etc etc.<p>Take note: Homeschoolers are a very diverse bunch with disparate needs.  Obviously, an English workbook for a homeschooled 1st grader and an online study planner for a homeschooled 8th grader needing help in math are going to look pretty different.<p>On the plus side: single decisionmaker (mom, typically).  Purchase cycle resembles B2C far more than it does enterprise IT B2B, which is quite common at school districts.  Guaranteed to be strongly motivated about education and family time.  Less allergic to new technology than public schools (because if you make someone's job redundant, well... great!  That means mom is free to do something other than whatever busywork she was just doing.)<p>These are all nice things to have in a market when you're selling to them.",1239695710

I find my friends talking about things we did together and I can't participate because I don't remember very well.<p>However, I'm beginning to suspect it's because I spend too much time thinking to myself and not enough time paying attention to the outside world.

If I'm looking at someone's code and it's hardcoded to two space indentation, I'm screwed. But if it's using tabs, I can set it to whatever I want. Some people like 2, some 4, and some 8. I prefer to use tabs to denote logical indentation, and then space for formatting. But not many people agree with me, so I usually just use spaces.",1239695103

The reason is they increase drag unnecessarily at high motor rpms.  (But they also cost more).<p>I think this would be a logical way of making a car engine more efficient.

561146,comment,560728,560728,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I installed Windows 7 two weeks ago.  It's really, really nice.<p>I did have some stability problems right after the install:  One of my two video cards was a PCI graphics card that was over 4 years old, and NVidia isn't making 64bit Win7 drivers for it.  So, after a quick trip to Fry's, I updated the most recent NVidia drivers, and I'm golden.<p>The OS seems beautiful and well thought out.  It's nice to see MSFT get a little religion about design.  It ships with a lovely command line/scripting language called PowerShell 2.  I've been using Powershell 1.0 for a year or two, and I'm really happy with the updates.  The integrated Powershell IDE is actually quite nice.<p>Did I mention that the OS was free?  MSFT's Bizspark program for startups lets you have access to almost all MSFT's software library for 3 years at a cost of $100 at the end of the program.<p>It actually makes me think about doing Windows desktop development using IronPython + .NET.  At very least, I'm definitely going a desktop widget for my web app.",1239694332

This fact, given automation via a bug or not, means that the tactic could have been used more maliciously and more covertly to bring additional damage (say, by getting an author's book delisted).<p>At the end of the day, do I think Amazon really deserved to be ""taught a lesson""? No; he could have just contacted them with the exploit and been done with it. Could it have been worse? Most likely, yes. Plus, I found the resulting e-uproar to be quite hilarious.
