However, a significantly smaller population of <i>healthy</i> breeding adults can be used to get the population up to 500 before inbreeding becomes a problem.<p>If you look at pedigree dogs, certain breeds (the north american German Shepherd) are so disgustingly inbred it can be exceptionally difficult to get a healthy dog (I've seen a lot of breeders who've adopted dogs from Germany that have passed schutzhund so they can guarantee their dogs against hip displasia with some confidence). Then you look at another breed, like the Standard Schnauzer that it's very rare to get an unhealthy dog.<p>If you inbred a small group of NA German Shepherds it wouldn't take long before all puppies born would be virtually guaranteed to have displasia. If you inbred a small group of Standard Schnauzers it would take a long time before appreciable disease took hold of the line.

553424,comment,552764,553265,0,0,davidmathers,,,"Ok, my last crazy thought for the day:<p>With rails recipes the division of labor between programmers and ""editors"" has already begun. The granularity of the web framework has changed from the single monolithic option handed down by the programmers to the gem level. Now we get a default framework from the programmers and dozens or hundreds of remixed frameworks provided by people with specific configuration needs.<p>These people are doing the same job that the creators of linux distributions are doing. It's up to them to resolve compatibility issues and create any patches needed to make their distribution work. You find the custom framework that does exactly what you need or if it doesn't exist you create it and become an editor yourself.<p>Now take the component granularity down to the level of a single language extension or monkey patch. Gems might have gem recipes. The authors of the classifier gem would require  array#sum and identify a default version, but an editor could change that.<p>Right now you can create a recipe that replaces prototype with jquery. Maybe someone thinks that rails' #try sucks so they create a recipe that replaces it with raganwald's #try. It's then the job of the editor to make sure all the components of their recipe play nice with each other.<p>Just like there are more mutual funds than there are stocks you get an explosion of recipes, but that's exactly what you want. Mass customization. You look through the directory and find the package/distribution that does exactly what you need. The software that gets used gets used.<p>The key here is that no one needs to agree on anything. Coders code and editors edit. The producer->editor->consumer relationship is natural. The producer->consumer relationship is artificial. It's a bug in the system.",1239225131
