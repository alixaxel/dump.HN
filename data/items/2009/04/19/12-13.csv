569354,comment,568158,569110,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You're a new commenter to this thread, so I will try this again. Perhaps I've been poor at explaining it.<p>You're self employed. Let's say you sell services. It's the first week of the year.<p>The first week you did great. Let's say you made $5,000. Woo hoo! But wait, you say, part of that money isn't really yours. So what do you pay? Do you multiply 5K by 52 weeks in the year to assume an income? That's how most people's payroll taxes are done. So let's say you do that and immediately write a check for 1800 bucks for taxes.<p>Then you make nothing else the rest of the year. You've lost use of that money and you really needed it. Wrong answer.<p>Let's try again. Let's say you put it in the bank. Now you make another 5K. And another and another. After a month you've made 20K. 6K of that is in the bank.<p>Then there's no work for a month or two.<p>At the end of the quarter, you've got 6K in the bank for taxes. Do you write the check? Well -- what's your income going to be? You haven't made anything in two months. So you don't write the check. Then the next quarter you work every week. Wrong answer.<p>Or you write the check, and there's no more work for two months. Wrong answer.<p>Or you write the check and need a new server. Or you don't write the check and need the money. Or you get hit with another large business expense. Or somebody goes to the hospital. The randomness goes on and on, and without knowledge of just how your income is going to work for each week for the next year you're guessing at optimization strategies. Note that some of these unplanned expenses are tax-deductible events -- these are items you would take off from your income before taxes anyway. Some, of course, are not.<p>Allocating the money immediately doesn't work because <i>there's no set amount to allocate without a predictable tax bill to prorate</i>. Saving the money results in various scenarios where the savings conflict with other business realities and you've still got the prediction problem.<p>The most reasonable strategy that I can create is to pay some kind of guess and then catch up the following year -- after all, you always know what your taxes are for the previous year. But the fact remains that the tax system is made for people with predictable income where the employer takes the money out of their checks. And as the economy gets more diversified and more and more people run their own businesses, this assumption causes more and more problems.<p>I think calling all of that ""poor planning"" is a bit oversimplified.",1240144236

569352,comment,569338,569338,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Broadly speaking, there are two sets of questions you want to answer:<p>1. The ""really?"" set of questions: Is the cloud what you really need? If so, can you architect your system to exploit the advantages of the cloud?<p>2. The ""how?"" set of questions: do you outsource the cloud to AWS et al or do you build your own? The details of this are probably worth half a book, but there are many databases to choose from (CouchDB, MemcacheDB, Tokyo Products and LightCloud, thrudb, Project Voldemort, redis, and others) and build-or-manage-your-own cloud computing datacenter (EUCALYPTUS, AppScale, Enomaly, ELASTRA, 3tera, etc).<p>The answer to these questions starts with ""what are you trying to do?"" In many cases, the cheapest and fastest way to get going is to provision some virtual servers from Linode or Slicehost and have a go. If you grow too much, 1. congratulations and 2. look at the cloud options.",1240144138

569344,comment,569338,569338,0,0,rarestnews,,,"Are you sure you REQUIRE a cloud? Phrase ""Amazon is too expensive"" suggests that it might be not the solution you're looking for.<p>Maybe you could be a little more clear on what you need, because it's hard to imagine what are your requirements that fall in-between of ""Google App engine is too limited"" and ""Amazon is too expensive""?<p>Also the phrase ""I'm not much of an admin"" makes it all sound really confusing... Rarely the cloud is the solution for one person's needs. Typically something like dedicated server or vps should be the answer. VPSes can be 6$/m including server's control panel so that you dont have to be ""an admin"".",1240142619
569343,comment,566609,568237,0,0,kragen,,,"That's pretty impressive!  How much memory does it need per connection?  I think that's the primary metric I'd use to assess Cometworthiness (once all the basic stuff is taken care of, e.g. delivering 1000 outbound events per second takes the same amount of CPU regardless of whether there is only one outbound connection or 100 000 of them).<p>My main point was that it would be hard to tell if someone somewhere had an HTTP implementation that could handle 250 000 concurrent HTTP connections per 64MB of RAM while yours only handled, say, 5000 per 64MB.  (I suspect the former number is achievable; I know the latter is.)<p>I can confirm from experience that writing an HTTP server that scales well without eating memory or CPU is dramatically harder than just writing an HTTP server.  However, it's very easy to do better than apache-mpm-prefork.  (No need, though; lighttpd and nginx should both do better at that, I have heard that perlbal does too, and I suspect from experience that twisted.web does as well, although I haven't measured it.)",1240142569
