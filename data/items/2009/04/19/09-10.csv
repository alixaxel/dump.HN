There will always be browsers going out of life that you need to support.  That's just the way it works.<p>And yes, there will always be people like this author whining about it and blaming his users for the his problem.  That's the wrong way to go.<p>If you build web applications, you need to suck it up and support all the browsers out there.  Yes, it's harder and yes, you need to use a common subset of all the available tools.<p>It's been this way since 1995.  It's not going to change.  Please stop complaining about it.",1240134703

I can't find it online - anyone know the one I mean?<p>I found the argument fascinating: he claimed that the dramatic growth of the computing industry was fueled by more people having access to computers. Beginning with mainframes, through to minicomputers, workstations and PCs, each wave was cheaper and was affordable to a much larger number of people. This increasingly larger audience is what fueled the growth. But such growth can't continue forever; eventually everyone has one. At that point, they still buy upgrades and replacements, but the dramatic rate of sales must drop back.<p>I think that's where the first world is today, and developing nations aren't that far behind. Of course, we'll still have new devices (iPhones, kindles, and others-yet-to-be-invented), but the <i>computing industry as such</i> won't grow at the unsustainably dramatic rates of previous decades.",1240133636

With great effort (and risk) comes great reward.  It would be a huge cost, but I don't see why another company doesn't try to do the same thing.<p>The monopoly doesn't exist because Google is trying to force other people out; it exists because no other company is willing to take the expense/risk to do it themselves.",1240133509
