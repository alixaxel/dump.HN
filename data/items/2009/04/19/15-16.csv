There is a subtle but very distinct difference between ""What is out is not significantly better"" and ""What is out <i>is</i> significantly better but not cheap/prevalent/simple enough for me to buy it"". Because, yes, what exists now is more than good enough for people who don't particularly like or use tech.

569469,comment,569103,569412,0,0,bmelton,,,"Driving is fun, to be sure, but there are enough of us that would love to be done with it.  I currently commute an hour and a half each way in DC traffic.  I LOVE driving, but due to other people, all the fun is taken out of getting to work.  If I could hit a button and just 'get there' via auto-pilot while I finished work, that would be ideal (for me).<p>I could turn off auto-pilot, but then there wouldn't be any point.  I think that the magic in getting auto-pilot to work in cars is in enforcing that enough other cars on the road are using it too.  I truly believe that so long as there are any cars on the same road as you not on auto-pilot, that it will negate most of the benefits for everybody.<p>Regarding human error, I think that most of what you listed would count.  The car is a human operated machine, which means that most of the time, wrecks are our fault.  Unless the wheel falls off unexpectedly, or the brakes fail, you could pretty much always attribute a failure to the operator -- or the operator of the other car where applicable.<p>I would also not like to be rid of driving as a pastime, but until you do, I'm also not sure that there's any point in automating the driving experience.  So while I am sympathetic to your point, the pain of my daily commute is sympathetic to the other.",1240154392

569465,comment,569362,569430,0,0,pcc,,,"Could you clarify how you extrapolate from this article to ""pro-Apple kidiots are taking over HN?""<p>To me it seems the article is only talking about trends and survey results, is not espousing any particular ""Apple Love"" and is not aiming to delve into the mechanics of how Apple is bettering its brand -- its merely making observation.<p>Your comment to Apple lovers really applies to Linux as well, so I'm not sure why you need to make the distinction.<p>I guess corporate users would generally move their desktops (either to the next version, or to something else) because they feel it creates extra value (maybe better stability, easier management or whatever), and this outweighs the cost of the change.  Or, from fear that if they don't keep up, in future they may be stuck with a larger problem.<p>Corporate desktops that are sticking to XP aren't moving anywhere; not even to Vista/7.  Obviously nobody is creating sufficient incremental value - yet.  Thus, one really can infer nothing as to where they might end up migrating down the road.<p>Lack of ""proper exchange client"" or ""advanced active directory features"" (?) also probably doesn't mean much -- its not as if anyone has the ""One True Way (tm)"" of doing email, scheduling or ldap.
