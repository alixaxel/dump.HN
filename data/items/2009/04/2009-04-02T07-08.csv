They would use the alternative.<p>Hence, if you are providing a product (without lying), I think you are doing the world a service. And the magnitude of the goodness you are doing is measured by your profit.",1238658457

543035,comment,542947,542981,0,0,BobbyH,,,"Payday loans may have a high interest rate, but if the cost of a payday loan is less than the alternatives, then it seems ethical to me. For instance, say a payday loan for $200 costs $30. That's translates into a high interest rate, but it's worth it to you if it helps you avoid a $50 late fee on another bill that's due before your next payday. The trick to running a payday business ethically seems to be fee transparency and not charging excessive fees such that borrowers must borrow an ever-increasing amount. This article about a payday company in LA talks about these issues: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09nix-t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/magazine/09nix-t.html</a>",1238657689

Then you said ""we don't know what his firm's policies were, if any measures were taken to prevent payday loan abuse, etc.""  This is exactly the opposite sentiment: that we should take issue with him if his specific practices were predatory, but not with payday loans in general.",1238657578

You make a good point I hadn't properly considered.<p>This is so against the current mindset of how purpose comes way before profit is even considered but this guy is apparently very good at making money. It's contrarian to the  start up culture Google inflicted on all of us, but smart business is effective business. He is doing well even when times are very tough, he targeted potential growth and effectively switched from one business front to another.<p>maybe...",1238656318

543024,comment,542806,542806,0,0,cduan,,,"I'd say that it is less than ""terrifying"" to plot the national debt on a log scale. Most numbers in economics (and in nature) vary in an exponential manner. Consider, for example, inflation, interest rates, and population growth. Nature deals in ratios; it is only human afterthought that adds units to measurements.<p>One incidental result of the fact that numbers tend to vary exponentially is that the first digit of a measured number is most likely 1 and least likely 9.
