575998,comment,575966,575966,0,0,BobbyH,,,"Commissions work only if they influence behavior in the way you want. In this case, you're paying the same percentage commission to your salespeople no matter if they answer an inbound lead or make an outbound call. It's thus rational for them to just focus on inbound leads, because the commission/ounce-of-effort ratio is so much better.<p>If you want to change their behavior, you need to do one of three things:<p>1. Require that salespeople hit certain targets/quotas for desired activities or their commissions get a haircut (e.g. you get 15% commission if you hit your target, 10% if you don't). Some possible targets:<p>* Make at least X outbound calls a week<p>* Close at least Y sales generated from outbound leads<p>2. Pay a lower commission for inbound leads and a higher rate for outbound leads. This will require policing so that salespeople don't mark inbound leads as outbound leads.<p>3. Stop using commissions as a stick/carrot and hire good self-motivated people, like you do for other departments. Here's a great article on that: <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030501/25416.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030501/25416.html</a><p>P.S.

575979,comment,575641,575641,0,0,HSO,,,"I too thought there must be opportunities in ""disrupting"" finance. Then I realized people ""want"" to be taken advantage of. Of course, not literally. But in a weird sense, people do not want to take responsibility for their finances. Instead they prefer to have someone to blame whom they can replace when things go bad. It seems easier on their ego to say ""I trusted the wrong guy"" than to say ""I was wrong"". Of course, that gets exploited by the snakes. This basic mechanism (abrogate intellectual responsibility and substitute (blind?) trust for -- questionable and contradictory -- domain knowledge(s)) is very robust over cycles and will make it very, very hard if not impossible to disrupt the financial industry. Another factor is that for most people, at least in Europe and Asia, money is not a polite subject to obsess about. Instead, it would be easier for people to, again, just have a person who makes them feel good and trust things are in ""good hands"". Again, in a weird sense, they don't actually want to know all that much detail about what's happening with their money. Easier to say, I gave it to this guy at such-and-such brandname institution and how can that be wrong. Maybe I'm just too stupid to see a way around this. The fact is, though, that all these attempts to give investors/customers more power seem to go nowhere or remain insignificant. There is a reason for that and I think it's not an issue of making it easier. It's a question of do they really want what they say they want?",1240504984
