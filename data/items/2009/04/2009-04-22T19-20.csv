574448,comment,574117,574427,0,0,Confusion,,,"A CSS templating system, that is just CSS extended with the possibility of symbolic constants, adding an extra step to the build process. One implementation I've seen used is using ant to replace the constants by their values. It's not hard, but that's exactly the point: it's also simple for Microsoft, the Mozilla Foundation, the KDE project, Apple, etc. to implement. I agree you shouldn't start adding real variables whose value can change halfway the CSS, variable scoping or, god forbid, if-then constructs. That doesn't mean simple constants should also be ruled out. I think that's throwing out the baby with the bathwater.",1240430173

Supposedly, the advent of technology has made succeeding at your own company so easy that <i>anyone</i> can do it.  You don't need to write a business plan, get an MBA, or even have any experience.  Furthermore, you won't even need to work hard at it!<p>The problem is that the barriers to entry don't just drop for you...they drop for your competitors too.  So now it's even harder to compete within a given market because of the sheer volume of competition.  You may find cases at the edge (37signals' home and soapbox) where money, risk, hard work, a plan, education, experience, and connections didn't matter, but they're complete outliers.

If person A works 5 hours a week, and person B does 20, even if person B only gets twice as much done as A, there's still twice as much going into the business.

The 'why' is simple, even if we only look at colors: every stylesheet contains the same colorcode over and over again, because good design requires coherent use of colors. Now you could make a style class called 'green', but I don't think I should have to go into the reasons why you just do not <i>ever</i> bloody want that. A proper stylesheet is bound to repeat a colorcode. A second solution is generating your CSS, but then you need a new standard defining a proper way to tell your CSS generator which elements should have the same color, which pretty much ends up being CSS <i>with variables</i>.<p>If they, and Bos, have any clue about what they are doing, they should tell us how to solve this problem, instead if asking the inane question you put in their mouths.

There's also lots of alternatives to getting a college education.  As the cost to get an education continues to increase and as the benefits from it continue to decrease there's going to be a point where the tide starts flowing the other way.<p>It's also increasingly likely that small/smaller businesses will be the companies of the future instead of the giant corporations we have now.<p>In spite of all of that, colleges continue to do business as usual.  It's a really strange dynamic.  It appears to me that colleges have lost their goals of teaching people necessary skills and have begun to exist simply for themselves.",1240427798

Absolutely.  But in many cases it would affect the social experience (if you cut res life/student activities people), the ability of some students to attend (if you cut financial aid people), and so forth.  Some of these things scale pretty linearly with enrollment; some don't.  Still others scale linearly, but over 20 years colleges have just been <i>doing</i> more (e.g. college was cheaper, so you needed less of an infrastructure to help students deal with loans).<p>The phrase ""academic experience"" is a bit of a misnomer, too - certainly having a good IT help desk can contribute to the academic experience (let's consider the non-HN population that can't build their own routers), but those people aren't counted as ""academic staff"".<p>All that said, there are obviously useless positions, and like all large organizations, colleges are susceptible to waste, mis- and over-management.  Pointing out the unsustainability of the current rate of growth is fair game; but I'd be wary of a rush to purge non-academic staff as extraneous.",1240427698
