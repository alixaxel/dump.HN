(ok, I made this one up.)<p>- I think gaseous helium is just single atoms.<p>- One liter of helium produced by fusion came with 6.5x10^-13 * 2.6x10^22 joules of energy, call it 1.6 gigajoules.<p>- 1 joule = .24 calories ... 384 megacalories.<p>- Figure the thermal mass of the experiment was about like 1kg of water (desktop scale)... the experimental apparatus would be 384000 degrees celsius (not recommended for desktop scale).<p>I'm guessing I can detect the temperature first.<p>(Bonus calculation, 1 liter of helium production also matches the energy released by 382 kg of TNT.)",1240268323

The reason is because, 95% of the people that i know (include me), work much more effectively if you go full time. Your speed are just faster and you discover dead-end faster (and most of us definitely hit that wall). Beside those, i've seen again and again that if you don't jump on it full time, most people will have ""excuse"" to go back to their job / school. There is always excuse to drop the project especially when things get tough/rejected (your whole hypotheses about the business collape? rejection by Y Combinator?).<p>My experience is, when you put yourself on the line, you'll go extra mile to grab anything that are needed to be successful.

571535,comment,571447,571447,0,0,harpastum,,,"This is an interesting idea for discussion, but I think the author handles it very poorly.<p>Yes, it's entirely possible that high-end running shoes aren't helping us as much as we think they are. Yes, it's possible that there's a <i>correlation</i> between high priced running shoes and injuries. On the other hand, the author claims a lot of things that are simply ludicrous:<p>""Logically, that should be obvious - the impact on your legs from running can be up to 12 times your weight, so it's preposterous to believe a half-inch of rubber is going to make a difference.""<p>If my head was moving at 10mph towards brick wall, a half-inch of dense rubber would probably make a whole lot of difference. I don't see how it's ""preposterous"" to think that it might be a similar story for feet.<p>""Despite all their marketing suggestions to the contrary, no manufacturer has ever invented a shoe that is any help at all in injury prevention""<p>This is the sort of statement the author is especially prone to making. This is such a leaky assertion that it's difficult to address. Ignoring the obvious benefits of shoes in all-terrain situations, there are many medical conditions that are addressed by shoes that are undeniably helpful.<p>Basically, the author is claiming that with a bit of fairy dust and some marketing skills, the running shoe industry has hoodwinked everyone for thirty years. If the author provided more actual data and less statements like ""no matter who you are, no matter how much you run, your odds of getting hurt are the same"" with no source (how could it <i>possibly</i> be the same odds for everyone?), I'd be more willing to believe.<p>I dislike making personal comments, but this author simply seems to be a demagogue.",1240267570

It doesn't take long for us to realize that this whole thing is more of a marathon than sprint. Since then, i have been trying to adjust my life more.<p>It's still not balance though. I can relate to that constant thinking and working condition. Often, i got a friend ask me, ""so, tomorrow is weekend, what are you going to do?"" and my typical answer is ""work"".

All the places I interviewed at had a floor of about $20/hr.<p>Since the ad stated that they want students from very good universities, I can't imagine their prospects would be worse.<p>That said, if someone takes this position, they will get far more experience than working most other gigs.<p>It's not necessarily a bad offer, though the ability to obtain food and shelter are usually factors I consider in my job search.  However, I think the comparison to minimum wage or unpaid internships is invalid. We ain't Poli Sci students.",1240265612

571484,comment,571336,571452,0,0,banned_man,,,"I'm obviously joking, but those kinds of ""offers"" have been given (and presumably accepted) in the writing world. A common scenario is an offer (usually given by scummy, second-rate magazines) where the writer is required to use a pseudonym and forbidden by contract to disclose her relationship to that name. They don't want the writer to develop a reputation and suddenly demand a salary.<p>For a more serious analysis, here goes: a person who works for deferred or no salary is a <i>founder</i> and should be paid with some equity (a percentage of the whole company, <i>not</i> just a small percentage of what he produces) in the venture. Understandably, you don't want to give equity to interns. So you probably shouldn't have interns until you can pay wages.<p>In general, if you develop a platform and someone develops an app on it, the application writer gets more than a 50% share of the proceeds. I believe iPhone and Kindle developers get 70%.",1240265548

Even on seed level, i'm not sure if i want to invest in a company through social network. I would prefer something more personal if i want to pick a company. And, referral often is the key to that. If you can't connect yourself up to the investors, i would say, you haven't tried hard enough.\n3. As an entrepreneur, i don't think i feel comfortable to expose everything that i have in the arsenal to the social network (especially strategy etc). It's one thing to be paranoid, it's another to be totally open-source!
