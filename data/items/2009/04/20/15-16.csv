570878,comment,570073,570476,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>A theory is not needed for further investigation.</i><p>On the contrary. <i>Every</i> experiment is backed up by some sort of hypothesis. (Otherwise it's not an experiment. It's called ""divination"": You're noodling around with some equipment to see if something ""interesting"" turns up. And it always does. The human mind is very good at finding ""interesting"" patterns in random noise.)<p>Hypotheses don't always have to be in accord with the body of existing theory. When Planck invented quantum mechanics, it was essentially just a mathematical trick that made no sense in the context of Newtonian mechanics. It was a free-floating rule of thumb: Gosh, if we pretend that light comes in these ""packets"", we can compute the observed experimental result! And that experimental result was so solid, and the fit between quantum theory and the result so perfect, that eventually the rest of physics had to be unraveled like a sock and reknit around that one hypothesis.<p>But the hypotheses that are connected to theory are much stronger. (They gain strength from all the experiments that went into confirming the theory.) If one's hypothesis (e.g.: ""you can get fusion at room temperature because of mumble mumble catalysis mumble the influence of unknown impurities in the palladium mumble mumble"") doesn't manage to score a big experimental confirmation (e.g.: making enough heat, consistently, to boil one's tea) <i>or</i> to connect itself to the body of existing theory... it's very vulnerable. Because there's a much simpler, well established, experimentally-supported theory to explain these results: These folks have a hypothesis (""cold fusion exists""), they do the experiments, they cherry-pick the results which look good and they find reasons to discount the ones that look bad. They need not even be doing this consciously. (Believe me when I tell you: <i>This happens all the time.</i> In every lab I've ever seen.)<p>Finally, when you ask me to avoid ""derision"", it suggests that you don't understand how science really works. Derision is the pillar on which science is built. (Though we usually prefer the politer term, ""skepticism"".) The central principle is ""I don't believe anything which hasn't been replicated by a skeptic, because people are too trusting and hopeful and are blind to their own mistakes. Frankly, <i>your</i> equipment is probably broken and your students are probably ignorant; I only trust <i>myself</i>. And, come to think of it, I don't even trust <i>me</i> very much -- I should convince my skeptics to replicate my results so that I can believe me.""<p>Of course, the best scientists manage to think this way while also appearing as kindly, smiling, eternally optimistic sages. ;) You wouldn't think, to look at Einstein, that he had balls of steel, a big ego, and a vast reserve of skepticism, but he surely did.",1240242368

Yes, your jQuery loop looks different than the Javascript loop you might ""normally"" write... but it doesn't look all that different from <i>my</i> Javascript code that I was writing before jQuery was even a glint in Resig's eye.<p>jQuery uses Javascript more deeply than what you get out of a ""Learn Javascript in Ten Minutes!"" tutorial, but it's still just using the language. It is a library, not a language. If Javascript didn't have closure support, jQuery would be up a creek without a paddle. (We all would; without that feature JS programming would be an order of magnitude more nightmarish.)<p>And if you don't understand how it is using the language, you will not be able to use jQuery to its full advantage. There's no substitute for understanding.",1240240153

I suspected there might actually be some insight in this one since it got posted here, but it's as inane as the rest of them (deliciously ironic given most articles of this type scold twitter and it's users for their inanity). For once I'd like to read an article that at least muses on why folk tend to be confused when they first join twitter or why it seems to have a marmite effect (i.e. you either love it or you hate it). I'm getting quite tired of this sort of banality however.<p><i>goes off to check his twitter feed for something more interesting</i>",1240240039

(Minnesota has three ""major"" parties by state law, and all three are capable of winning statewide elections.) So it's a little unclear to me how a pure Franken versus Coleman match-up would have come out if a run-off had happened here in Minnesota at the same time as this election cycle's run-off election in Georgia. Georgia knows who its two United States Senators are. Minnesota is still in doubt, months after the general election. I now like run-offs in major statewide races like that, when the margin after the general election is very close.",1240239994

One of the main selling points for using software with an open source license is that you can get someone else to service/extend it for you even if the originator of the code goes out of business or shuts down development.<p>It will not be surprising if Oracle wants to take some of the Sun open technologies in a more proprietary direction or just show less interest in continuing development.  That will mean we will see whether or not the purported benefits of an open source license prove themselves or not.<p>The main challenge will be forking, assuming Oracle continues to develop MySQL, for example, but only in ways that do not encroach further on Oracle's existing DB market.  If people want features that Oracle does not want to provide, it looks like forking will be the only option.",1240239883
