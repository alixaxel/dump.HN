The open source community can produce those -- if anything, Eclipse/NetBeans could just be extended with more plugins.<p>Its about open specifications and standards. Sun had been hyping Java 7, but hasn't been going through the Java Community Process to ""debug"" the spec, and allow for OSS developers (like those at IBM) to develop spec-compliant tools of their own. If Oracle continues down that trend, it will see Java lose its most important asset: a community of developers who believe in open standards.",1240239591

The point he was trying to make was that if someone in the Amazon can buy radio equipment for less than $500 and use it to hack the U.S. Navy's satellites, then there's a problem here. These guys are looking for freebies, and they are most likely harmless. But just imagine what would happen if the U.S. goes to war and the enemy deliberately carries out a DoS attack against the U.S. Navy satellites?

570781,comment,570073,570360,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>That scientist went to that lab, looked closely at everything for 2 days...</i><p>Yeah, that also worked for Uri Geller. Scientists with Ph.Ds investigated his spoons! They found no gimmicks!<p>Of <i>course</i> there's nothing wrong with the equipment that anyone can find by staring at it for two days. Let's do a little math. Consider the guy from SRI. He has been working on cold fusion for twenty years. The experiment is always described as ""incredibly simple"", so he probably should have been running it daily all that time, just cranking it over and over with the goal of getting perfect reliability and repeatability. But let's assume that, instead, he thinks <i>really hard</i> every time he turns on the equipment, so his group has run it about once a week. Once a week for twenty years is about 20x50 = 1000 experiments. He reports approximately 50 non-reproducible positive results. That implies that he gets <i>negative</i> results about 95% of the time, maybe more.<p>So the instrument basically works. 95% of the time, the measurement shows that you get out exactly what you put in. That's pretty good! I've worked on lots of graduate-level experiments that have a far higher failure rate. (This isn't manufacturing. Your equipment is often <i>literally</i> held together with duct tape.)<p>Of course you're not going to find an intermittent problem in a 95%-accurate instrument by <i>staring</i> at the thing. You will have to work with it for a while. And even <i>working</i> experiments will yield a certain percentage of mysterious anomalies that you will <i>never</i> understand. There's a power surge. One of the instruments has an intermittent software bug. One of the sensors burns out slowly, spending several months giving erroneous readings before it finally fails. A solder joint starts to work loose. Some piece of metal contacts your thermocouple and creates a bimetallic junction. There's a ground loop. Static electricity. You misread a dial. You nudge a knob without noticing. Your materials come from different batches at the supplier. Some of your students use a different procedure than the others.<p>That's why irreproducible results have such a bad reputation. <i>Everyone</i> gets them. There are the stuff of legends (""gremlins"", ""Magic/More Magic"", etc.) precisely because everybody gets them, and because they often lead you astray. You cannot hope to explain them all, because they are irreproducible! If you hope to pull an actual observation out of the noise, you either need to design a cleaner experiment, or make <i>very</i> careful observations and use statistics to pull out correlations (""Hey, every anomaly has occurred between midnight and 3am!"" ""Hey, every bad chip has come from a wafer that was handled by the guy who was once cited for forgetting his gloves!""). Then you construct hypotheses, and then zero in on those hypotheses. (""Hmm, if we feed the grad students more coffee the anomalies at 3am go away."" ""We lectured the guy about wearing gloves and the failure rate dropped by 85%."")<p>If you can't reproduce the experiment after a lot of effort, you need to seriously consider the possibility that you're fooling yourself. I've seen a lot of scientists fail this test, temporarily or (sometimes) for entire careers.<p>The other point to make is that scientists fight like tigers in print, but are often very polite in person, and <i>exceedingly</i> polite on camera. Remember: Scientists are anonymously graded by each other. You have to appear to fight fair, or your colleagues will downgrade your reviews and your grants will get rejected. So to get a scientist to make fun of another scientist's <i>equipment</i> on camera is like convincing the Pope to smack a non-Christian with a mace on live television. We prefer to eviscerate each other's <i>manuscripts</i>... often anonymously. That's why so many of us prefer to wait for something to appear in print... and why the cold fusion guys are justly vilified for going to the press before getting their work accepted by a journal.",1240239154

The basic premise is to alternate between maximum effort (sprinting) and medium effort (jogging) at set intervals.  The key is that the sprints are anaerobic rather than aerobic.  This type of workout induces a state of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, thereby raising your resting metabolic rate for about 24 hours.<p>Hop on a treadmill (or bike, elliptical, whatever), warm up for 5 minutes, then go all-out for 30 seconds.  Jog for 60 seconds, then go all-out for another 30 seconds.  Repeat the cycle 6-8 times.  Cool down for 5 minutes.<p>Best bang for your 20 minutes.

With IBM it was a forgone conclusion that Solaris would have vanished, in case of Oracle there is a fair chance it will survive(look at Weblogic - Oracle is promoting Weblogic as their primary middleware). With this purchase, Oracle is in a position to provide(and own) the whole stack : hardware/os/app container(java)/app/database - look around the only other company which comes close to this is Microsoft(which does not have a big ERP portfolio). I think MySQL was just a small factor in this deal. I think this will be big loss to IBM(now that Oracle gets it).

They did win out by executing better than their competitors in the competition of the moment, but what I was trying to suggest was that, in all probability, no-one could have succeeded in trying to do those things at an earlier time. You couldn't go back to 1996 and start YouTube.<p>With YouTube you couldn't have survived the storage costs at an earlier time, and also there needed to be ubiquitous playback, in the form of Flash. Flickr similarly would have been financially onerous due to storage costs ealier on.<p>In 1996 our bandwidth was so tiny that you really could not have done YouTube at that point.<p>Wikipedia is a slightly different point. It was launched in 2001, so in 1996 you obviously could have gotten a lead on it, but if you look at the growth curve it wasn't until 2005/2006 that it really took off. I just don't think that the community of editors/users was broad enough until that point.<p>You are totally right that good execution counts for most of the success and going back in time would allow you to do that much better with the hindsight gained. My thought is just that there are constraints over what is achievable at any given time and the common thread that I see in wildly successful companies is that they managed to jump on those turning points just before they are there, first mover advantage and all that gumph.",1240236026
