I put my family on a $10k deductible plan, primarily to cover catastrophes.  This gave me two things: negotiated rates for health services (typically a 40-60% discount) and eligibility for an HSA.  The plan ran us $190/mo.<p>Now, $10k is kind of a scary number for something like that, but I felt comfortable with it given that we'd never have to write a $10k check. At the very worst we'd rack up a $10k debt to a hospital or something, which (given the current state of healthcare) we could reasonably expect to pay off over like 15 - 20years.  It seemed reasonable to me, for what we needed.<p>The HSA is helpful because it's effectively another IRA you can use for pretty much any medical expense.  So for normal health care, we ended up paying about 40% of the ""list"" costs for things, and pre-tax.<p>Doing this requires that you be a little aggressive about getting good deals on care, though.  My daughter broke her arm about three months in to this, so we took her to a minor emergency clinic.  I told them what was up and they ""coded"" the visit at a much lower rate than it would have been.  The next day, we actually called around to find out what people were going to charge us for a real cast to replace the splint the clinic put on. It worked out to be about $600 total, including the minor emergency clinic visit.<p>So in summary: get coverage for catastrophic health events with a ""cheap"" plan, abuse the negotiated rates that plan gets you, get an HSA, and be an intelligent consumer of health care.  Oh, and minor emergency clinics are your friend.",1239650787

560276,comment,560169,560169,0,0,philwelch,,,"For some reason the health insurance industry has settled on a model of ""pay your health insurance company scads of money and pay relatively little for the rationed routine care you get"". Since health insurance is a heavily regulated market, I doubt this is the most market-efficient solution. Maybe if you shop around for routine care and offer to pay with cash (or HSA) it won't end up costing as much, and I've seen informal studies done by friends that show, for instance, that certain prescription drugs cost hundreds of dollars less at different pharmacies (once you can coax the pharmacies to actually tell you the price, since they're so used to working within the insurance cartels).<p>It all depends on your health, too. If you have sleep apnea and want to get it treated, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars if you don't have insurance. Probably better to get a full time job for a few years until your apnea is treated. If you have hypothyroidism, you can take remarkably inexpensive prescription drugs and get an annual checkup for cash cheaper than you can get insurance to cover the thing.<p>My working hypothesis is that high-deductible catastrophic insurance is the best solution for broke, comparatively healthy adults. In this model, you're using health insurance as insurance qua insurance, to make sure you don't go bankrupt if a medical emergency costing more than $10,000 happens to you. (This of course requires you to be able to raise $10,000 if something DOES happen to you.) This does nothing for drugs or routine care, and needless to say there is no dental plan. I pay $40 a month for this. I don't get anything out of my $40 a month, but on the same token, insurance qua insurance is something you pay for but you hope you never have to use. An HSA is not a bad feature if you're going with this model.<p>Depending upon state law, you can leave out things like maternity coverage, or get further discounts if you're in good health. A good female friend of mine doesn't have maternity coverage but she is very aggressive about birth control and has no qualms about abortion, though, so I would carefully consider whether this also applies to you or your spouse. I would also hasten to add that if there's a possibility of having more children, the expense of health insurance is not your biggest problem here.<p>In fact, I don't know how well this model works if you have kids. Or how founding a startup works if you have kids, for that matter.",1239650341

You should take the transaction ID of the ebook purchase, use it to generate a steganographic image, and patch that somewhere into your PDF file. A good way to do this might be to use Least Significant Bit encryption. Directly quoted from Wikipedia:<p>>>>For example: a 24-bit bitmap will have 8 bits representing each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) at each pixel. If we consider just the blue there will be 28 different values of blue. The difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the least significant bit can be used (more or less undetectably) for something else other than color information. If we do it with the green and the red as well we can get one letter of ASCII text for every three pixels<p>Now, there are two main problems here, as I see:<p>1. The text can still be scraped from the ebook and redistributed as a .doc file. For this reason, you may also want to include some text steganography (e.g., draw some ASCII art with varying characters; change the order of people you thank on the ""dedication"" page).<p>2. The pirate-distributor could insert pixel noise randomly all over the file. Then, your trans-id information encrypted in the LSB-image would be lost. In my opinion, however, this is unlikely, because the security I've described is not (at least typically) used in practice (with eBooks, as far as I know).<p>These aren't preventative measures [1]. But if something does end up circulating on the net, you have a unique ID and can then probably sue their parents. Be sure to explicitly forbid them from circulating the PDF/consent to being sued if they do/what have you, in the terms of service.<p>[1] Unless you explain that each ebook is uniquely secured, which may prove something of a deterrent; unfortunately, one measure of security is to not let people know that the property is secured in the first place.
