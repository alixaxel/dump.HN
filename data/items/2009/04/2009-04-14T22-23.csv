Law school is largely concerned with abstract concepts that are important, but more difficult to test.<p>I sympathize with your frustration, but the reason for the prerequisites could just as easily be that they don't believe they can create a test which properly encompasses everything a lawyer should know.<p>Also, at least in San Francisco, the job market seems to be saturated with lawyers, even before the economy went south.",1239747075

I've noticed that most here people are depending on geocaching and user entry to develop their database. I was considering Wcities at the outset, though they were asking for an email for prices. Has anyone considered Wcities, and were the prices just way out of line? What experiences do people have with their system?",1239747016

It's nice to see what's happening in New York, but cafes, etc. are more dependent on location than Delicious bookmarks.

The way this plays out in the United States is that many entrepreneurs complain about the growing role of the federal government in regulation of business over the last two centuries, which plainly is a correct description of the historical trend. But only legal historians, with their specialized knowledge, notice that many state laws have become much less restrictive of business activity over time. It's actually rather difficult to figure out what the overall historical trend is at all levels of government in the United States. Some businesses may be easier than ever to form, while others are harder than ever to form.",1239746525

Its reasonable since I didn't really take initiative(quick enough, atleast) for it to be ""my"" project.<p>Technology is a weird thing; inspite of being unpredictable, there are milestones we know that will be reached; how they are reached, how soon they are reached or who does, is a matter of initiative, luck and money.<p>I would suggest that you look at it as an opportunity; get in touch with the guys who're onto the idea now and express how passionate you are about this; share your ideas, and any work you've done on it yet.<p>In short, try and jump into it with those guys! You may hit upon more than you were expecting: they're obviously people who got started and who think alike: Match made in heaven?<p>The rest is upto you, grasshopper!!
