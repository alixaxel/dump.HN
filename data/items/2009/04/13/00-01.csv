I ranked highish on an IQ test book, 130-150 (however reliable that is).<p>I love your hypothesis of what IQ measures, though unfortunately I don't think it's true. But do I think the ""skill of breaking down problems"" is one thing that actual accomplishment measures. It also seems to me that even a 230 IQ person is limited to what they can grasp instantly, if they lack this skill. Perhaps if their high IQ removes their motivation for acquiring this skill, it might explain why the accomplishments of some high IQ folk aren't commensurate with their IQ.<p>230 IQ sounds awesome, but just what can such a person grasp at once?<p>Is it like someone with very long legs, so a step for them is a giant leap for anyone else...? If so, it isn't much good if they can't string steps together. If they can't combine their steps, a crawling baby will effortlessly outdistance them.",1239580980

There is a 'Normalized Comparison' graph but the weights are right there for anyone to adjust. The authors are very honest about what this data is and what it means. It's just interesting, nothing more. They don't claim or even imply any of the things you say they do.",1239580928
