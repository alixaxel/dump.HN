The rise of oil certainly helped, but you can't explain eight years of growth starting in 1999 with four years of oil price rises starting in 2003.",1239177502

By 2005, the total fertility rate in the Russian Federation was up to about 1.3"".<p>Some of its conclusions require more evidence (the contention that Russian standard of living will decline, the attribution of increased accidental mortality to alcohol problems instead of more people driving, etc.)  But I'm not sure why you doubt the actual statistics.",1239176109

552406,comment,551532,552172,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well there are some solutions to those problems, #1 is simple, they do it with dog food. You just need a junior, adult, senior and light varieties (which may help in regards to #3 by being able to eat larger portion sizes if you're hungry).<p>#2 might be a little trickier, although if it's sold how it's shown in the show (literally as human dog food in giant bags) you could easily include a dozen flavor packets. If the food on its own was fairly flavorless, preferably with a meat-like quality to mix well with different flavor packs.<p>#3 is probably the trickiest. The solution is probably just like any food, moderation. However, when people receive adequate nutrition this behavior does tend to decrease, but evolution is a harsh mistress and like most animals we've evolved to build up fat reserves to try and survive.<p>Honestly #1 and #2 can easily be solved by standard market practices in both dog food and human pre-made meals. #3 is the stickler and aside from moderation I don't know what could help, except maybe a big sticker saying '<i>THREE MEALS IS ALL YOU NEED</i>' might subconsciously stop a few of the gullible people who respond easily to suggestion (read: the people who keep telemarketers rich).",1239174765
