Because when we use the word ""sexist,"" some people immediately go into ""i only care about the code, I don't care about the gender"" mode, which I think is sincere, but misses the point about the other, non-code-review behavior not being cool.<p>I believe it when people say they can impartially evaluate code and conference proposals without being distracted by gender. But that doesn't mean we can't be alienating with our behavior.<p>The blogger in this post is successfully putting Ruby code into the world, <i>and</i> co-chairing a new conference (raising eyebrow, maybe she <i>is</i> ""doing something about it"" :D ).  It's not necessarily about acceptance, which she has.  It's about wanting to really like your community, which she doesn't at the moment.<p>Speaking personally (am female)my problem with this is more the feeling of being repelled than excluded.<p>I regularly back away from IRC channels, user group meetings, BOF's, etc not because I think individuals are sexist by the definition of ""They think females are inferior coders,"" I don't think that's the problem. The sensation is more like, ""it seems like they'd have more fun if I weren't here.""<p>I think to myself, ""If they're talking about strippers and whores this much when I'm here, they probably would have more fun if I weren't.""  I don't call them out, it's their space as much as mine. I just leave.<p>It's not really about content, it's about context.  There are a million places where the t&a graphics from those slides wouldn't make me wince at all, but this place wasn't one of them. Ditto strippers. I'm not offended, I'm just pickin' up signals.<p>That said, I don't think anything should be censored or not allowed, (not that anybody, even the original blogger has suggested as much), We just can't be surprised when people who don't know us well interpret our subjective expressions a certain way.<p>Lot of people are talking whether the presenter ""meant to offend."" Of course he didn't. He seems really nice and smart. And NOT sexist. I feel bad for him, because this issue is bigger than him, and I'd probably love to hang out with him in a heartbeat, even though I don't think his slides were the right call.<p>But...<p>I'm reminded of this Jay Smooth video where he said you have separate ""if a person <i>is</i> racist* from ""is what the person <i>said</i> racist?""<p>(<a href=""http://www.illdoctrine.com/2008/07/how_to_tell_people_they_sound.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illdoctrine.com/2008/07/how_to_tell_people_they_s...</a>)<p>Personally, I'm willing to drop the word sexism altogether, and just say, bad (subjective, but may get us to focus the discussion more.)

An important target group for Python is beginners and non-programmers who do some programming in support of their primary work.  That's why Guido values stack traces over tail call optimization.  For Python, supporting beginners and amateurs is a higher goal than writing elegant functional code.  Even for problems with elegant recursive solutions, beginners seem to find it easier to cobble together a more complicated loop-based solution than to find the simple recursive one.  I know that makes everyone really sad :-( and maybe the long-term solution is to fix the school curriculum to teach programming earlier and better, but for now it's reality.",1240713378

Most of Python's library is written with sequences and iterators as fundamental building blocks (and dictionaries, of course), not linked lists, so you'd be locking yourself out of a lot of pre-defined functionality by not using lists or sequences."" Well, chained cons cells are lists, too, and recursive functions are good for much more than operating over recursive data structures.

The kindest thing that can be said about Matt Aimonetti is he simply has no class.  Or, apparently, a grownup relationship with women.<p>I was going to criticize the blog hugothefrog linked to for indicting the whole Ruby community because of one asshole, but then I thought about it a little more and really?  Nobody organizing the conference looked at his title and said hold on a minute?  Or asked to vet the slides beforehand?  Or in the audience stood up and said, ""Matt, you're an asshole.""<p>This might have been funny in 6th grade.  Now it's incredibly tasteless and probably actionable.",1240711911

What's needed are more code and talk proposals, not blog posts.<p>One poster referred to women being excluded, which is an interesting claim.  I've never heard another Rubyist make a comment to suggest that anyone should be excluded from any Ruby activity.  If anything, the people I know are on active lookout for anyone interested in Ruby.<p>One way to have more women at Ruby events is for more women to write more notable code and step up to give notable presentations.<p>If anyone thinks this is already going on, and women are being deliberately put aside in favor of men, I would love to see some evidence for this.<p>I was part of the advisory group for the recent Mt. West RubyConf, and out of the 50 or so talks proposed, I don't think a single one was from a woman.  So, who needs to step up to make things change?",1240711776
579535,comment,579460,579460,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"It also helps that such ""super-users"" are people who are <i>actually interested</i> in helping, rather than potentially a tech support person who can't wait to get home and see his family after a crappy day at work.  You're more likely to get good information and useful help from someone who is only helping you because <i>they want to</i>.<p>I find this sort of phenomenon also applies to support for open source projects.  Many companies I've worked with are very satisfied with the kind of support they got merely by dropping by on IRC--they could get information, assistance, explanations of code, and even patches in mere minutes or hours from people who actually want to help.  In a sense, open source is the merger of the two concepts: the ""developer"" and the ""volunteer"" are often the same person, meaning that you're talking to someone who both wants to help <i>and</i> knows the application backwards and forwards.",1240711718

They also limit the number of processors to 2. So basically installing software in the server version is identical to the consumer version.<p>But to answer your question briefly, setting up server programs in windows entails going to each of the websites and downloading the programs. Double click and install. This is a bit different than the *nix way of having a central repository where you can apt/yum/dpkg/etc... to your hearts content. Also, while it is of course possible to install software from source it is not really common on the windows side of the fence.<p>lightweight webserver: nginx(<a href=""http://wiki.nginx.org/Main"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.nginx.org/Main</a>), maybe apache if you configure it. I would steer clear of IIS(which is preinstalled in the server version usually)<p>I don't know of a good sftp server for windows but there should be plenty of them out there.",1240711513
