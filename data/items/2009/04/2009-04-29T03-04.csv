You don't have an 'account' on your laptop. (Well, technically you do, but most people just believe that is just a password) You simply save something in your documents for later. By making the user believe that they aren't tied to anything, but just saving data for later, you can make them more likely to store their data on your servers.",1240977494

People see the name Nielsen and think its gold because of their dominance in TV ratings.  But the reality is they put their numbers behind a pay wall so they aren’t scrutinized by enough people to determine just how accurate they are.  Combine that with the fact that their methodology doesn’t necessarily work at all when measuring web traffic and you have numbers that mean very little.<p>With that said, I can see a decent amount of people dropping Twitter soon after trying it.  Twitter’s usefulness isn’t immediately apparent which gives them a chicken-and-egg problem.

584468,comment,584293,584293,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"So, are people who rent vs. own their homes non-free because they are opting into the home-as-a-service trap?  Of course, they are at risk.  The landlord could kick you out, forget to pay the water bill, etc.  But, you accept those risks because you perhaps want the flexibility of renting, the extra time saved by not having a lawn to mow, or the financial benefits of living without a mortgage.<p>Why stop at owning a server?  If you rent rackspace in a datacenter, they own you too.  What if they lock the door and won't let you in?  They could even steal your server along with all your data.  What are you going to do then?  Perhaps you should build your own.  Then, you're still in trouble.  What if the monopolies that control the pipe into your datacenter decide that you don't deserve connectivity anymore?  Then, you're really screwed.  You should just go live in a cave or something.  Life is just too risky.<p>Seriously, business/life/whatever has inherent risk.  Often when faced with a binary choice, both options have non-trivial risks associated.  You either accept the risks or mitigate them.  Most importantly, you measure them.  Is Amazon willing to risk what must be its fastest growing business segment by holding someone's data hostage?
