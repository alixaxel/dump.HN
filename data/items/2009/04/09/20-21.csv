Here's a quick summary of some of the more interesting bits:<p>- Reznor explains that since music is essentially free due to downloads, he doesn't feel it's necessary to require payment.<p>- When they offered the option to pay, only 18% of people did so. But, offering limited edition physical products worked out well.<p>- His feeling is that it's more beneficial for a greater number people to hear his music, even if it's for free, because the result is more ticket sales / merchandise purchases.<p>- They're looking to build a platform for artists to distribute their music which will give power to the artists. They're still playing with potential business models that are fair for the artist and fan.<p>- NIN is developing an iPhone app to connect fans by location, and will hopefully create a ""live blog"" of concerts for those who can't physically be there.<p>- They're continuing to work on Year Zero with either a serial TV show or graphic novel, which will integrate the album and ARG [ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Zero_(alternate_reality_game)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Zero_(alternate_reality_ga...</a> ] that they produced.<p>- He has had some interest in live-streaming concerts, and is pushing for venues to have an open-camera policy so that fans all over the world can enjoy the experience, even if they can't physically be there.<p>I'm not a NIN fan personally, but it's nice to see a prominent figure in the music industry with their head on straight.",1239309892

We both followed it closely for about 6 months but eventually we decided it just wasn't convenient enough. There were certainly some benefits to it that I miss but I phrase these much more conservatively than what most gurus would have you believe. For example, I never felt any sort of natural high or extreme mental clarity - just comforted knowing that I wasn't poisoning my body with HFC etc. YMMV.<p>Here is my best argument for why a layperson should go raw: it forbids you anything that even resembles junk food. Raw may be flawed but clearly it's <i>way</i> healthier than how most people eat. You can say it's a crutch or psychosomatic or whatever but for me once I got into the mindset of it I just stopped noticing unhealthy food. Almost everything in the modern dining world is cooked.<p>The major downside - because it's so damn restrictive (plus we're practically vegan) is that raw gets to be time consuming. It's really impractical for people on-the-go. Sure you can always just eat an apple or some carrots but that gets boring and so you end up dehydrating your own bread etc and turning down practically every social dining opportunity. In a way that is a Good Thing because there is a lot of harmful junk in modern food, right? But it takes real dedication and eventually we decided a totally raw intake just wasn't worth all the effort.<p>A cooked food diet opens up the floodgates to all sorts of unhealthy temptations. But in the end it came down to priorities like <i>convenience</i>. If you're thinking of going raw your best friend is the blender: there are a million nutritious ways to mix a surprisingly delicious smoothie (secret ingredient: jalepeños).",1239308214

Yet a large number of people viscerally feel it's <i>wrong</i>.  I blame human irrationality - but then, programming languages are meant for humans, so shouldn't they accommodate our irrationality?  Otherwise, you get something like Haskell. ;-)<p>BTW, there are other cases where Python has gone the other way.  Multiline lambdas, for instance.  The case against multiline lambdas is essentially that they <i>look ugly</i> - they let you embed an indentation-sensitive block in what might be a parenthesized expression, which means you need some dangling delimiters.  But they're certainly useful, as Scheme/Lisp/Ocaml/etc. have shown.<p>It's similar to the compare-constants-from-the-left idiom in languages where assignment is a valid expression (notably C).  If you always write ""if (NULL == foo)"" instead of ""if (foo == NULL)"", you eliminate a whole class of bugs.
