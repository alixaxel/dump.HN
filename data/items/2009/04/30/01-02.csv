He shows it being set to an Anime Music video mash up of Vampire Hunter D Blood Lust. I can't seem to track down who would be the rights holder of this track but I'm guessing it's Warner.

586235,comment,586140,586140,0,0,Locke,,,"I've been working on my Z-Machine interpreter library again.  It basically started as a project to turn Frotz into a Ruby extension (Frotz, probably the most popular interpreter, is written in C).<p>The code has undergone quite a few transformations now.  Frotz uses a lot of static memory -- it's basically setup to run a single zcode program at a time.  Which makes sense, of course.<p>For my library, I wanted to be able to run more than one program (or multiple copies of the same program) at the same time.  So, I basically rewrote the core of Frotz.  All the memory for a Z-Machine is broken up into structs which are passed around.<p>There were some fun memory management issues related to running multiple programs.  The typical zcode program consists mostly of static memory (lots and lots of strings and code), so that static memory can be shared between programs.  I have a test where I load something like 100,000 copies of minizork into memory and the process size ""only"" jumps to 118MB.  Of course, normal code doesn't need that many simultaneous Z-Machine instances so garbage collection keeps memory pretty reasonable.<p>Last time I worked on dorothy, I setup a demo webapp here:<p><a href=""http://ifrotz.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ifrotz.org</a><p>Which illustrates why I wanted to be able to run multiple programs.  The demo runs minizork, dynamic memory is dumped and restored between requests.  The hints, exits, and history feature is possible because the server ""listens in"" on your game and the games others have played.<p>Lately I've been working on more memory inspection stuff, and now I have to work on some of the unfinished Z-Machine features (I've only implemented the v3 screen model).<p>The code is on Github:<p><a href=""http://github.com/eki/dorothy/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/eki/dorothy/tree/master</a>",1241055302

The Software Functional Specification that was handed to me provided a good background to the problem space.<p>When I wrote the Software Design Specification (100 pages, oof...), I easily solved 2/3 of the bugs before I touched a single line of C code.

Two things in play here: First, if your business is starting to make money, a good accountant should save you more than they cost.<p>Second, if you can get someone with a bit of business savvy to look at your basic operating agreement/terms with your partner before you get rolling, that can help a lot. You might not want to get a lawyer/accountant to review agreements early if you're cash strapped, but by God, you'll wish you did later when the inevitable difference of opinion strikes.<p>If it's not a primary source of income for either partner people will be more flexible, but it's the businesses that succeed and become quite profitable that you'll most wish you'd done better groundwork on. A bloody catch-22.<p>Quick advice: Interview a couple accountants now, skip the lawyers for now if you're dealing with a small amount of time/money. You can probably get a good accountant for $300-$700 for year 1, which should more than pay for itself later. Also, a good professional will teach you and explain things to you as they're doing it. I've spent a grand total of less than 20 hours of my life with accountants and lawyers I was paying, but I've learned a hell of a lot from those times. Seriously, one key business point you didn't know can be worth thousands to you later as you're becoming successful.

It's a great space. JWZ obviously tried to recreate a subculture that was never hugely popular but sort of maybe had its heyday and died in the 90s. The sort of only-in-SF cyber-industrial-goth thing. Front242, Throbbing Gristle and  Cabaret Voltaire remixes. Every guy looks like Robert Smith with a top hat, wearable computer, and zombie boots. Proto-burning-man meets blade runner sort of thing.<p>It's definitely not a favorite for hipsters. It only comes close on mashup night, and even those ""hipsters"" are all 38 years old. The whole hipster in SF thing is bit of a hoax. All those hipsters are really web designers who went to Stanford, which wasn't really hip ever, but certainly hasn't been hip since 1999. What is now known as hipster in SF was called ""yuppie"" 20 years ago. It's just different brands of shoes and alcohol - even the tight pants remain the same.",1241053483
