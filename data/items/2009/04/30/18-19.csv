He's saying that until you actually deal with someone in the workplace, you have no way of knowing how they will perform. He's saying that there is no way to effectively differentiate applicants.<p>This, to put it simply, is complete bullshit. It's clearly possible to remove the absolute worst applicants through interviews (i.e. can't put two lines of code together). Furthermore, how do you get absolutely <i>zero</i> idea of the work ethic and ability of the person you're interviewing? The only conclusion I can come to is that this author has no technical knowledge whatsoever, and therefore can't distinguish between applicants.<p>This author is suggesting the 'spray and pray' method of hiring: hire a new developers, fire those that don't perform in the workplace, rinse, repeat. This is pure insanity.<p>I really hope I'm missing something, but the author really is pretty clear: ""your skill as a manager is not based on your ability to get good people into your group, but on getting bad people out. The sooner you cull weaker players, the sooner you can replace them with stronger players...and improve the human composite of your firm.""",1241117993

587257,comment,586782,587220,0,0,benreesman,,,"My assertion that Java is displacing C++ is admittedly very anecdotal, this is a difficult claim to discuss in rigorous terms. My claim is based on personal experience, the experience of colleagues, and ""some people I've talked to on the interwebs"", so by all means take with a grain of salt and do some research yourself if you're skeptical.<p>For any long-running process the JIT is going to turn your Java (Clojure, Scala, ...) into extremely well-optimized machine code. In fact, the amount of knowledge that the JIT has about the actual run time behavior of the software allows it to do better optimizations than you ever could by hand in certain situations (an ever-growing number of situations).<p>GC is another point, the HotSpot GC is arguably faster at allocating small, short-lived objects than malloc is. It is reeeaaaaallllyyy good these days, probably the best GC that you'll find in production just about anywhere these days. The thing is a monster. And the new one, the G1 collector, was sent from the future by SkyNet to kill John Conner.<p>Add to this the fact that you can easily exploit common multiprocessing patterns (thread pool, consumer/producer) with almost no code, and that advanced multiprocessing code can be written in a platform independent way, and it's a pretty small subset of applications that still make sense to write in C++.<p>Add to all of that the fact that even Java (let alone all the other amazing JVM languages) are orders of magnitude more productive than C++ for your programming staff, and the set of situations in which it makes sense to use C++ rather than the JVM is looking pretty tiny.<p>Oh and then there's portability. C++ isn't even portable across compilers (versions of the same compiler!), and for all the early trouble with Java portability, it really is write-once-run-anywhere now. Really.",1241117694

The article says, ""Library functions that\nare opaque to the GC remain safe as long as they do not invoke callbacks or retain copies of pointers,"" which helps, but isn't a complete pass.  (Plus, even though C got void* before I entered elementary school, I still occasionally see library APIs that use int or long instead of void*.)<p>Also, the article says, ""Custom allocators, in contrast,\ntypically break these invariants permanently, because they allocate objects of statically unspecified shape in a block of primitively allocated memory.""  I'm not entirely sure, but it sounds like this means you can't use any library that uses a custom allocator.  Certainly you'll have to manage resources from such libraries by hand.

The Enterprise is even more ripe for this, as they have been trying to separate architectural components with SOA (which is a form of concurrency).

587178,comment,188489,188489,0,0,Dave-B,,,"This resonates with me pretty strongly, as does “Why Nerds Are Unpopular”. Both match my experience as a teen (back in the 1970s) and my observation since. While I’ve written a little about some of the same phenomena, these two essays do an astounding job of documenting and explaining what I had not processed as thoroughly.<p>One thing struck me, though. Several motivations for lying to teens about sex are cited, and I certainly agree that those motivations are important. However, I was surprised that an important one was overlooked, since it figures so prominently in “Why Nerds Are Unpopular”.<p>In that essay, the argument is made that teens are penned up in school because they no longer have a place in a modern economy. Since a teen can’t support a family, preventing sex, the biological purpose of which is to, well, start a family, becomes a priority. So there may be a pragmatic reason as well as sentimental ones for lying about sex.<p>NB: I’m not one of those “abstinence-only” types; I’m a firm believer in the old military adage that one should never give orders that will not be obeyed and cannot be enforced. (I agree with the prescription given in the essay, to give teens the straight dope, but to impress on them that their judgment may not always be trustworthy.) Abstinence certainly is effective at preventing conception, though, and when loaded with cultural and sentimental baggage to give it more power, the development of such a fundamental dissonance between society and biology makes perfect sense.",1241115267

587172,comment,586782,587138,0,0,benreesman,,,"As limited as the threading model of synchronization is, it can be used to fairly easily write programs that scale up to some reasonable number of threads (10-100). This is less to do with the convenience of having keywords like 'synchronized' and more to with the fact that modern Java has a proper memory model. The C++ people are trying to put together a memory model, but it's not here yet and there's some doubt about the ability to integrate it successfully with existing (pthreads etc.) code.<p>Without a memory model you're going to be writing more code that is less correct at a substantially higher cost. If you're interested in this google for a Google Tech Talk by Josh Bloch on 'Java Memory Model'. This basically comes down to my ability to get at architecture specific stuff (CAS, fencing) in a platform independent way and have it work. Cliff Click has a really neat tech talk on writing a lock-free hash table in Java, don't bother trying to write it in C++.<p>Ultimately we will need a better model for concurrency, which will be some combination of functional programming and lightweight processes (actors). Erlang/Scala/Clojure/Haskell are in the right neighborhood (maybe Gambit Scheme, don't know much about it), but Erlang and Haskell are really hard to teach to mere mortals like myself. I don't know enough category theory to understand 'hello world' in Haskell, but I can write Scala and Clojure programs that work (and leverage my existing investment in the JVM).<p>edit: i left off something imporant. if anything saves imperative programming it will be transactional memory, which is <i>exremely</i> hard. hardware TM and code written for TM are in a chicken-and-egg situation. the answer is hybrid hardware/software TM and the sun guys are way ahead on this too.",1241115081

A lot of people will eventually come up with their own base typography rules at some point as well.  And grids are extremely helpful in eliminating some headaches and speeding up development.  These are all components of most frameworks.<p>None of these ""frameworks"" do much of anything besides some routine stuff that saves your some start up time. Telling everyone that they don't need them is a bit ridiculous.  If it saves you time, makes your life easier, or have some other benefit to you, they are worth your time.   For example, 960 isn't a ""framework"" in the same magnitude that RoR or JQuery is a framework.  The problems that a CSS framework solves are much smaller than most other frameworks.  960 took all of 10 seconds to figure out and has been helpful in quickly tossing page layouts together.   It has shown itself to be very reliable across browsers and certainly beats having to test your CSS layouts on IE, Firefox and Safari.  The constant edit-save-refresh CSS testing cycle is a lot easier with a CSS reset and manageable grid system.  Also, with 960, you aren't running away from CSS.  You still need to know CSS to do anything useful with it, it just solves a few immediate issues with CSS and then gets out of your way.",1241114921
