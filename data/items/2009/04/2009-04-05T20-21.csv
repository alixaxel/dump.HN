547741,comment,547596,547721,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Say that the intel services say that <i>every</i> small craft is having missiles loaded onto it.  What do you do then?  Shoot every boat on sight, civilian or military, on the theory that it <i>might</i> have a cruise missile on board?<p>Many of these boats don't even show up on radar.  They're not a big enough target for you to hit with missiles.  Even if you could, the missile costs more than the boat.  So you'd need to dispatch a destroyer or a bunch of aircraft to strafe it with gunfire.<p>But then you leave your destroyers/aircraft open to counterattack from small boats.  At $30k a boat and $500k a cruise missile, how many of them do you have to sink to equal a $100M aircraft or a $1B destroyer?<p>Incidentally, Japan had a similar plan for defense of the home islands in WW2.  They produced nearly 6000 Shinyo, suicide motorboats with a crew of one and a massive explosive in the bow.  As the American invasion fleet entered home waters, the plan was for these to swarm the fleet and blow up as many vessels as possible.  I suspect this is a major reason why we dropped the A-bomb instead of going forward with an invasion of the Japanese home islands.",1238964999

547739,comment,544828,546497,0,0,stcredzero,,,"So long we we're saying, ""Look, no I am not talking about...""<p>My point is that VMs that have been around for <i>decades</i> capable of supporting languages of equivalent power, and that these are some silly multiplier faster than Ruby 1.8.  This is going to be something like halfway to two orders of magnitude for some silly benchmarks, and much less in real life.  Really, there's not much of a problem in practice, especially with the embarrassing wealth we have lying around in terms of processing power.<p>The real problem -- the thing I am making a point about -- is people going around saying that, ""Oh well, you have to give something up to get the power...""<p>No. You. Do. Not!<p>Ruby is not <i>that</i> advanced.  Yes, I would say that it's a lovely language.  It has everything I want, but it's not doing anything that hasn't been done before.  It's unique in that it combines lots of elements in a way that's really dandy, but there's nothing magic about it.  There's certainly nothing so esoteric, that it couldn't be made to run fast.  (There are a few things that were just bad design decisions, like making every Object behave like a little hashtable, which could've been left out and made it much easier to run faster without losing power and expressiveness.)<p>Oh, and people did implement OSes in Smalltalk and Lisp way back when.  Also, ever hear about something called Singularity?  That's a <i>recent</i> OS built on top of a VM.  In fact, I think that more people should be doing just that -- building OSes that are ""turtles all the way down"" and built to not only support a particular VM, but to have every single atom of it available to tweaking by a high-level language.  (Lua would be great for this.)  But this is a digression.<p>Again, going back to my original point -- the real ludicrous thing is that the <i>programmer community as a whole</i> is still in the thrall of expectations about speed vs. programming language power that <i>date from the 70s</i>.  And anyone who thinks you have to give up <i>as much</i> speed as Ruby has to get that power is very much in the thrall of such an idea.",1238964898

The author does only recommend exercising the options if the company is profitable, this is probably good advice. If the company is not self-sufficient consider the potential impact of a future financing with the present market. Here are two to factor in to your calculation:<p>- Reallocation of ownership between share classes (substantially diluting the existing common stock).<p>- Creation of new shares with a high senior liquidation preference.<p>You might see the reallocation of the pre-money value happen on a ""money-in"" basis. The valuation itself will obviously depend on how much the company needs the money. When it's all done the existing common stock (founders and employees) could well be worth less than 1% of the company. If you're still at the company you'll probably get new options issued but if you've left you'll just have the old ones worth approximately $0.00.<p>That said I would focus on whether you're having fun and doing/learning something you think is worthwhile rather than on how much your options might be worth.",1238964504

They certainly aren't obsolete because of ""ships have no defense against ballistic missiles.""<p>A ballistic missile is basically a bomb with a different delivery mechanism.  Instead of being dropped straight down from a plane (like dive bombers of WW2) or diagonally down (like laser-guided bombs of today), it's boosted to altitude with a rocket motor, and then gravity takes it back to earth.  The flight path at the end is basically the same, though.  That's what makes it ""ballistic"".<p>Carriers have <i>never</i> had a defense against bombs - they certainly didn't in WW2.  But y'know what - they usually didn't need one, because the bombs would often miss on their own.  Or if they hit, they wouldn't cause serious damage, instead being stopped by the carrier's armor plating.  The Harpoon doesn't pop-up to avoid CIWS (it's usually easier to hit something coming down at you from above than something skimming just over the waves - there's less radar glare from the water, and the angle of attack changes less as the missile moves in closer.)  It pops up so it can hit the more lightly-armored superstructure instead of the armored hull, potentially causing fires and knocking out critical electronic systems.<p>We moved to cruise missiles for a reason: they have a much higher chance of scoring a hit than ballistic weapons.  If 80% of your weapons will miss on their own, you don't need to worry about getting through the enemy's defenses, you need to worry about increasing your accuracy.  Cruise missiles aren't particularly easy to shoot down either.<p>As for nukes - yeah, they'll take everything out, as the U.S. found out at Bikini Atoll in 1946.  The defense against nukes is the knowledge that if you nuke a U.S. carrier battle group, you will have a few hundred incoming SLBMs within a couple minutes, ready to blow up every single major Chinese city.<p>Personally, I think the real threat to carriers is the cruise-missile swarm, coming from dozens of small fishing vessels.  Cruise missiles are cheap, they can be mounted on relatively small vessels, and if they come at you from all directions, they'll totally overload all your air defense systems.  It's not hard to find a couple hundred private boats and put 1-2 cruise missiles on each of them.",1238962122

UAVs serving as spotters? Well, worst-case scenario the U.S. carriers could release collosal amounts of smoke and create such a thick smoke-screen that no light or IR radiation would penetrate.<p>The Chinese could try to guide the missile remotely with a human operator being fed with ""real-time"" video, but good luck steering a missile at Mach 10 with a joystick, LOL.<p>Moreover, at Mach 10 the transmission delay could be a serious problem. After all, electromagnetic radiation takes some time to travel 2000 Km -- approx. 7 ms (to which one must add the processing delay) -- and controlling a missile with super-fast dynamics with a 10 ms delay is not trivial. A thought experiment: try driving your car on the highway at 200MPH, with your windshields covered and with no sensing other any ""real-time"" video of the road ahead which has a delay of 100 ms. Good luck!<p>If the enemy missiles use radar, they're giving away their position. Advanced high-speed anti-radiation missiles (HARM) could perhaps try to intercept them. A desperate counter-measure could be to release immense ammounts of metal strips to fool the missiles' radars.<p>If I remember right, the U.S. Navy had plans to equip carriers with super-mean machine guns capable of shooting 1 million bullets per minute, thus creating such a thick cloud of lead that no enemy missile would be able to pass through. Sounds low-tech, but it could work, right?",1238961811

One thing to keep in mind is that essentially the Twitter engineers are doing the software engineering equivalent of rebuilding a jet aircraft in midflight.<p>Part of the point of having a modular architecture is to try and set up API's that act as firebreaks for intra-module changes.  So if you need to switch out your message queue for performance reasons, rewriting a brand new one that conforms to the API the rest of your system expects might be the best solution at the moment.

If a client needs a short engagement to fix some set of specific problems, then they should get a specialist.  OTOH for a longer engagement or for a fulltime employee, get a generalist.  The problem with specialists is they tend see solutions only in their domain.  If you hire an Oracle specialist, you are going to get an Oracle solution.  If you hire a J2EE specialist, you are probably not going to get a Django or RoR solution.<p>Generalists are more expensive in the short run, but in the long run the solution is probably cheaper.<p>If you are a specialist, you get work quicker, but it is the same work over and over.  About a decade ago I was working at BEA and one of my coworkers was a CORBA specialist.  He quit when they transferred him to the WebLogic group.  He wanted to continue to be a CORBA specialist.

If you have the option, you should always get your undergraduate degree in Computer Science instead of Game Design or Security.  Even better would be an undergraduate degree in Philosophy or English, but let's not pursue that line of reasoning lest I say something controversial.  Suffice to say, programming (and Computer Science in general) is essentially a task concerned with representing ideas.  As the blog sphere proves, most people have absolutely no training on how to represent ideas, and the result is rather painful.  English and Philosophy are far older disciplines than Computer Science; consequently their methods of teaching students how to represent ideas are far more developed.  A major in English or Philosophy and a minor in Computer Science will make you a far better programmer than most of the pure bred Computer Scientists.  Indeed, if I was designing a Computer Science curriculum I would integrate English and Philosophy courses into at least the first year of study.<p>If you want an example of a success story for the above doctrine, do some reading about this man: <a href=""http://www.beckman.illinois.edu/directory/rpowers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beckman.illinois.edu/directory/rpowers</a>",1238961630
