They're more successful at this model than any website that I can think of.<p>They are the one traditional news outlet that isn't damaged by changes in distribution methods.  The only change might be that they need to spread their pledge drives out more broadly so that it's harder to skip or tune out.",1240772788

I'm in 10th grade right now, and here's the way I see it: I spend a few hours in school every day, where most of the time is wasted, come home, and spend the remaining 6-8 hours of free time I have learning whatever I want.<p>I used to be pretty annoyed about school in general, but once I realised how much free time I really have, it's amazing how much I started getting done in that same time.<p>(As for the actually interesting or difficult classes, which sometimes do exist, you can do the same thing; for instance, in the first few months of my calculus class, I bought a textbook and finished learning the material until the end of the year. Now that class is just as relaxing and as much of a breeze as any other.)",1240772724

It's not permanent, but having to sudo to get to it puts in a conscience filter.<p>HN is now the only aggregator I follow regularly, and even then I've become more disciplined about how much time I spend on here.<p>Become more conscious about what you're doing.

Crazy theatrical lectures, Spanish classes disguised as video games, etc. People will have really positive experiences with this stuff, and it will trickle down.<p>It's probably too scary for some people to just hand over the keys to their kids' ""real"" education at first.

With ibuprofen I can continue working, because it prevents the inflammation from being more painful than my actual injury.
