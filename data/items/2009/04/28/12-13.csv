The ones who’ll take ""How to I make a web site that people can join"" not as an admission of some guy who doesn’t care about the details but as a sign of weakness. I’ve seen responses to that question that range from ""You obviously aren’t ready"" to ""It depends on how you want the site to scale."" What bullshit!</i><p>No no no. That's me, but it's not because of anything to do with spotting ""a sign of weakness"".<p>Let me try to use a non-car analogy: Imagine I'm a carpenter (I'm not) and you come up to me and ask ""how do I build a staircase?"". The kinds of thoughts going through my head might be:<p>1) A staircase is obviously wood, cut to shape, then fixed together. It's also obviously quite a big thing. There's no need to answer with the low level ""obvious"" things like ""you will need a large workshop"", if you want to build a staircase you probably already have woodworking tools and experience and now want a bigger project, so an answer telling you basic outline steps would be insultingly patronising and unhelpful.<p>Also, an answer covering enough steps from scratch would take far too long for a forum post or discussion reply, so if I make the judgement that you don't have any of the experience and haven't considered it <i>at all</i> then you might get a dismissive ""with a lot of work"" reply.<p>(OK, maybe if we met informally and you asked, you might be just making conversation, but nobody goes to a technical forum and asks how to build a website just to make friends, do they, so that doesn't apply).<p>2) On the other hand, if you have spotted the obvious then you're asking one question but meaning another - maybe what kind of wood can I use to make it look nice, what building regs must it comply to, how can I reinforce it, what fireproofing treatments work well? What styles of bannister were popular in Victorian times?<p>There could be a lot of fun stuff, but again too many directions to go in all in one answer - this is where you get the ""it depends what style you want"" answer. It's not <i>bullshit</i>, it's better than that, it's skipping straight to acknowledgement, acceptance and directed at whichever obstacle or major design consideration comes to mind first.<p>So, ""how do you build a website that people can join"" leads me to think something like:<p>A website people can join means giving them a form to fill in, keeping their details, and providing a login prompt later. This is obvious to anyone who has used a couple of websites with signup forms.<p>So either you understand the steps of a site you can signup to and would have Googled until you found out more about those steps and asked a more specific question (What's HTML? What's a webhost? What happens to information in a form once I click submit? How can I keep it around?), or you're really asking for design and obstacle avoidance suggestions, e.g. scaling, security, server load, etc.<p>Hence the replies: You haven't Googled for the basics, that suggests you aren't ready for the amount of work involved, or you aren't really asking such a basic question so you don't get a basic answer.",1240923456

583036,comment,582786,583004,0,0,shiro,,,"Y combinator is not something that makes your daily engineering life easier.   Its main point in CS is that it allows to construct a Turing machine equivalent solely by lambdas---hence it allows reasoning of computation process based on very few axioms.   But that's not something programmers do every day.<p>I think what's important is knowing about the thinking process of Y combinators and alike.  That is, thinking about something that can be applied to itself, and taking advantage of it.<p>A ""first-order"" thinking is something like thinking about a function that works on values, or about a program that takes input data stream and emits output data stream.    In this mode, you tend to think the operator and what the operator works on are separate things.   Values aren't functions, or data isn't a program.<p>A ""higher-order"" thinking is like thinking about functions work on functions, or programs work on programs.   This mode of thinking opens up new source of ideas.  For example,  I did one thing for to improve program X, and another thing to improve program Y; can I write a program Z that does the same kind of improvement for X, Y, and other future programs?  If I feed Z itself to Z then, can I improve Z itself?    You have an interpreter P.   Can you write a program Q on P that, when interpreted, takes a source S and produce a program S' that's more efficient than S?   If you can, what if you feed Q itself to the program Q running on P?  Will that process converge?   If so, it's a sort of fixed point.   What will it be like?<p>I work as a programmer and frequently encounter this ""program generating programs"" pattern.   It is not some kind of tips that can be applied directly into everyday coding, but it allows me to climb one step higher in the abstraction ladder, giving wider vision on the program I'm working on.",1240922274
