I want to know what sites they're appearing on and how many impressions they're getting there.  The number of referrals would be great as well, but I don't think this information is gettable since the links are created in js.<p>Two approaches I thought of, neither seems adequate:<p>1.  Both widgets and buttons make use of an iframe.  I could embed Google Analytics code in the framed page that gets called so I can track these ""hits.""  This seems like it might hurt performance on the sites that run the widget/buttons though.<p>2.  Track requests made in the php logs to the image files used in the buttons and the widget.  My issue with this is that I'd  much prefer to track usage via Google Analytics so I can more easily compare the data and explore it.<p>Suggestions?",1240955943

Therefore it's not a stretch that there is a subset of people who are willing to pay money for these things online.<p>In the same way MySpace has proven that US social-network traffic can be monetized by ads, tencent has proven that Chinese social-network traffic can be monetized by virtual goods.

584102,comment,583159,583159,0,0,Lilith,,,"A friend directed me to this post, and here is what I have to say. The best decision I ever made was to quit high school when I was fifteen. I read Grace Llewellyn's ""The Teenage Liberation Handbook"" and, despite it being written a little simply, the ideas resonated with me. Compulsory schooling is about control, busy work, and, as Foucault points out, a type of discipline based on the penal system. School made me view education as an abominable chore, and it was only once I left that I was able to begin exploring academic disciplines in a comprehensive and meaningful way. If you love erudition for its own sake (as I truly believe most people are prone to do--it's only after years of schooling that we eschew the notion of pleasurable learning experiences), you have what it takes to educate yourself.<p>I recovered from the trauma of compulsory school, and I am now a college honors student with a 4.0 GPA. While there are still serious problems regarding ""education"" in the world of academia, college is significantly better than high school. A GED, well written essays, and outstanding SAT/ACT scores will get you into some of the most prestigious institutions without a diploma. Most people think that you have to be miserable for the next few years because they were forced to be miserable and they think it's the only way to find success in the future. I believe that they are entirely wrong about that. Research ""unschooling"", Paolo Freire, and Summerhill school and decide for yourself.",1240955456

It's not a professional platform. The stuff I do in my life I keep entirely separate from all the things I write.

It comes from the fact that my post, which is about as good as 20 minutes' worth of quick typing can get you, got put on Hacker News, which is a place where intelligent people discuss meaningful things, when this is a piece that deals in overgeneralities.<p>When I wrote this piece, my thought wasn't ""How can I capture the high school experience?""

Truth be told, one of the few problems I have with EC2 is the fact that I can't get it upgraded to the newest thing (at least in Windows)<p>But other than that I agree.  I think I've been pretty consistent in saying I don't consider services like Google App Engine or Microsoft's Azure usable unless there's some way to take your program off their servers without rewriting it.<p>But again, with EC2 it's just a matter of loading the OS on an actual web server and copying your app to that.",1240953509

My point is merely that you need to explain your reasons, not merely point out your skin color or gender, as if that itself were a reason.  Your Jewish friend, for example, has given a very good reason for why jokes about Jews by non-Jews are generally offensive.<p>In fact, there are cases where using that word in a presentation would be perfectly legitimate, i.e. in a presentation about racist epithets.

I felt like hs was to easy too at the time.  looking back I could've taken more AP's, but honestly, why would I have spent more time learning about things less useful to me when I had the option of learning about more useful things.<p>What I did was I just started bringing textbooks from any subject I was interested to all my classes and read them.  If you are getting good grades no one will care.  But really, unless your teacher is really awful they won't care anyway, because there are so many kids who do need help that they should be focusing on.  Who gives a shit about the kid who probably could've passed the exam without taking the class when so many kids don't understand basic algebra, especially with no child left behind.<p>hs sucks, try to learn social skills by observing others and practice thinking about being in other peoples shoes to learn better empathy.

The thing that has been bothering me the most is that for the first time, I have handed someone else the power to massively waste my time.<p>Let me explain. If I click ""upgrade"" on a kubuntu box right now, my KDE 3 turns into KDE 4. If I don't want KDE 4 (I don't like it, or I don't have time to set up and familiarise myself with a new desktop paradigm) <i>I can choose not to push the button</i>.<p>If Nintendo go bankrupt tomorrow and disappear off the face of the world, I can still play Age of Empires on my DS.<p>As a counterexample, after setting myself a nice little workflow using Google Notebook, Google decided they didn't care about Notebook anymore. I could not choose to keep using it. Google had a lovely iPhone specific interface to their iGoogle portal. I started using it as an RSS reader (something it did very well). Then Google decided they didn't want to provide it anymore. I didn't have the choice to keep using it as an old unsupported version; it was gone. Of course, I have the choice not to use iGoogle, but then I have to invest time to get used to netvibes, say.<p>The problem with the cloud is that while it gives you what you want, everything is rosy; but you have no control over your environment any more. In a away, free-to-the-user services are worse; when Netflix withdrew its multiple queue support and its paying customers protested, it brought them back. As a commercial service they felt they had to pay attention to their paying customers. When Google takes something away, or fails to improve a service because they are off on their next shiny-but-soon-to-languish beta, the user has no leverage at all.<p>I still like the Cloud; but I am nowhere as gung-ho about moving everything to it as I once was.",1240952865
