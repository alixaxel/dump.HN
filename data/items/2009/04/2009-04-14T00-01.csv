I'm annoyed with all of the constant Twitter hype -- I think it's overblown and that there's not much behind the fad. It seems like a case of everyone jumping on the bandwagon to me, especially in the cases of MSM; they're just desperate to be on the brink of the next big thing, and so everyone jumps all over Twitter not because they appreciate Twitter but because they're all trying to be cooler than each other. Twitter is pretty lame, and it's pretentious, and I don't like it, and I don't think that many other people do either. So, is Twitter really significant here or is this just another case of wannabe hipsters attempting to appear clairvoyant so that everyone will complement their impeccable fashion sense?",1239670333
