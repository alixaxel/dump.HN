That's quite possibly the biggest misconception about the BBB ever. It's a lot simpler to first ask the business, then go to the city/state/federal licensing and consumer affairs departments and directly file a complaint. Maybe the information doesn't become public, but businesses also tend to Start Caring when it's their license(s) or permits at stake, and it's not like the BBB is even close to acceptable in this regard.<p>I seem to be writing a lot about the BBB here (i.e. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=541244"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=541244</a>), but someone has to spread the word.",1240872989

So each week, I clocked 28 hours per week. The hours were choked full of coding effort.<p>Mostly, I encountered difficult obstacles that would slow me for a day or two. I couldn't just solve it siting around so I go around to coding different projects.<p>It was actually a little understatement. I did a programming session in the middle of the experiment when I tried to develop a game in 48 hours for a contest. By the time I finish the project, I have a hard time protoyping newer versions of the game so I got something like last place.<p>I did a the same thing for a week back in the beginning of April. I ended up releasing a new version of a game I made but I worked really late. Mostly it is because I procrastinate until the last minutes. So quality of life suffered due to that. So I learn to not only time-box but also schedule my time so I don't end up hacking at strange hours.<p>I got time management down to a few set of tools that allow me to do a lot of solid coding. I can't get much better than that.<p>The actual major hinderance is the fact that I am extremely slow in term of programming speed. Veteran hackers can complete trivial games even with unit tests in mere hours while it takes me days or even weeks to accomplish the same feat.",1240872717

It seems like more could be gained by simply learning how to use what's already available.  (And if a new command is necessary, make it something more general, like ""find project root"", and not limited to ""cd"".)<p>For instance, I'd probably tackle this by defining an environment variable to match my root directory, like $PROJROOT.  I could then ""cd $PROJROOT"" in my shell.  And if I really wanted the one-character command used by the solution above, I could say ""alias a 'cd $PROJROOT'"".<p>And this allows extensions.  For instance, now that I <i>have</i> a $PROJROOT variable, I'm not limited to using ""cd"" on it; I can pass it off to <i>anything</i> that might use the root (""pushd"", ""ls"", etc.).  Similarly, I can reapply the alias technique to add short-cuts for any of those additional actions.",1240871149

I didn't expect Adobe AIR and would prefer it didn't default to a desktop icon but overall I like it quite a lot. Can I remove the drop shadow from the default font?<p>An unexpected side effect is that I can finally tell what time it is in England (for football / soccer matches.  Go Arsenal!)<p>Edit - registered my copy.  Really enjoying it!<p>Edit 2 - The included version 1.0 of Adobe Air raised an alert (""very dangerous"") in Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009.  I went ahead and upgraded to version 1.5.1 of Air, as was suggested by Kaspersky.",1240869928

For applications that are inherently social or have a strong social component, it's going to be very valuable or necessary to live on the social graph. Until now, those companies have had to try to build their own, which is very difficult or impossible.<p>For now a lot of developers just see Facebook as a way to spread virally, which has led to a lot of annoying spam machines.",1240869887

On the one hand you suppose that the government's goal is to snoop on everyone, but on the other you ignore that they have already been caught doing that with the willing participation of private telcos.
