If you get front-page-slashdotted, you'll probably also get dugg and redditted at the same time.<p>For the record, danieltenner.com has had 50k visitors in a day from just reddit + HN...<p>The problem also usually comes up when comments start to add up (another reason why disqus rocks). <a href=""http://inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good...</a> had a couple of hundred comments within a day, and since Wordpress (it was on WP at the time) didn't cache them, the page load got excruciating.<p>That's not a problem for <a href=""http://danieltenner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com</a> anymore, since comments are now served by disqus, and the pages themselves are static html.

I tried to hint that we were of that mindset when we had applied, no cigar. I'm not really sure why YC continues to advance sites which seem to go against their own ""Derivative Idea"" rule for why startups fail (e.g. this round: a group bookmarking site, a themed video site which piggybacks on YouTube).
