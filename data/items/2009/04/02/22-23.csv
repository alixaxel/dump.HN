There are no huge technical or design hurdles to beating Facebook. The problems are social.<p>Only sites with a lot of users, like Myspace, could quickly become a threat to Myspace. Facebook has surpassed a critical mass of users, so they probably would have time to respond to any technical challenges.And Myspace seems to have a different and less successful focus than Facebook that would need to be changed. I don't really care about telling everyone who my top friends are, designing my page, or using Myspace as a blog. Basically, I just want to quickly and easily find out the major events in  my friend's lives. It does not matter how brilliantly designed a site is, I cannot adequately meet my needs with a site until it has a good portion of my friends as users.<p>So to go against Facebook successfully, a company would need to start in an extremely small niche and grow, or provide value unrelated to social networking. It is a lot easier to reach critical mass in a very small niche. And if you aren't solely in social networking, people are going to be using your network before it provides decent social value.",1238711437

544172,comment,543221,543661,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Main problem, electricity arcs to ground ASAP. This means that the system can basically only have two connections in range of each other, so 1 power plant to 1 user. The economics of this doesn't really work well.<p>Generally electricity only arcs once, and it requires 30kV/cm. This means to arc to two things at 10 cm you require about 600kV, but again this requires a small amount of energy to be transferred to ground.<p>Transferring through the ionosphere would likely resolve some of this problem, it's like dipping electrodes into salt water. It works, it's just omni-directional and subject to the environment. However, you basically have to build every antenna 50km high.<p>The technology I believe is credible, but the practicality of it isn't very high. Below the ionosphere this technology has the problem that the ground is usually much closer than the next persons house. This would work great above 100 ft, due to the fact that the whole ozone production would poison most people. Above 100 ft, I can only transmit power in a range of less than 100 ft, but generally only to one person. If I want to transmit to two people it has to be below 50 ft.<p>At 100 ft the voltage limit is 90 million volts before you're arcing directly to the ground. The safe limit would probably be 45 million volts as you'd be arcing to peoples heads at 90 million volts.<p>Basically how the system would end up breaking down is that you'd use hundreds of feet of cable to connect to your antenna, which we currently use less to connect to the one down the road. I believe mine is about 30 feet away. The substation would require a few thousand feet or so of cable to connect to the main transformer, again which we use considerably less to do today.<p>So the only practical usage I see is on the long distance scale, where you're using the ionosphere instead of arcing through the air. However, it would all have to be over 100km apart. Yet at such extremely high voltages to be practical we wouldn't have a strong enough insulator to stop the arcing anyway.<p>Unless we end up with like 2 power stations in North America and a super electrical insulator, I doubt this technology would ever become truly practical.",1238711388

The role of any Software Company CEO is to create a system that translates brain waves into dollars.<p>That's what software companies do. Creating software isn't like creating a car. It's about generating ""abstract ideas"" that can be understood by a computer and are useful to humans.<p>You take smart people, give them the environment they need to do great work, and say ""ok, now think me up some software"".<p>Discouraging dissent, in general, is equivalent to turning off brain waves.<p>The thing about smart people is that they have ideas. A lot of them. By definition, thinking is what smart people do best. In a software company those are the kind of people you want, because that's what you are selling: re-packaged thoughts.<p>When you say ""this is the way we are going to do things, because I'm the boss and I know best, so please don't come to me with reasons why this might not be good, instead just shut up and do what I so, or else go away"" you are explicitly encouraging people to not think.<p>Encouraging people in your software company not to think is stupid. It's encouraging them not to produce the one thing you need them to produce in order to make money.<p>I'm not saying you want a democracy. The CEO, at the end of the day, is responsible for the company's performance. He's the one who makes the decisions. But, being responsible for the company's performance means the ""burden of greatness"" is on you. If you hear a voice of dissent, it's not the dissenter's responsibility to prove her case. It's your responsibility to listen to what she has to say, and figure out if there's any hidden merit to it.<p>The goal is to build a profitable business, not to be a powerful executive. Leave your ego at the door. If the person who is suggesting ""maybe there is a better way"" had a perfect, well crafted message, that seemed obvious and completely brilliant, why on earth would she bring it to you. She could just take her perfectly formed product to the market and wipe the floor with you.<p>You are the boss precisely for one reason: because you can take other people's brain waves and convert them into money. Because of this, your goal should be to get the people who work with you to generate as much brain wave activity as possible. That means encouraging dissent.<p>If you aren't doing that, then you are not leading.<p>So, if this is happening at Facebook, then it's a shame.",1238711331

544159,comment,543865,543976,0,0,chops,,,"While that's kind of true (after reading a book which extols rationality and logic above all, seeing constant irrationality in daily life does tend to make someone a little apprehensive), I find another common symptom of the post-Shrug reading is a feeling of helplessness and even to some a sort of depression - you see how society crumbles around the heroes in the book, only to see many parallels in reality.  The feeling that society cannot be fixed is an overwhelming one to someone who takes Rand's ideas seriously, and does unquestionably lead to the feelings of anger (this feeling is not just isolated to Rand readers either, but to anyone who looks at the ""big pictures""). It usually takes a while for new Objectivists to shake that feeling and start focusing on the good things in life, rather than the bad.  But before that, the desire to ""Go Galt"" and abandon society for your own quasi-utopian refuge becomes very strong.<p>Personally, though, I find the ""selfish jerk"" thing more as a result of ""The Fountainhead"" than ""Atlas Shrugged,"" though at the same time, I think TF is the right book to read before AS.  TF prepares you for the ""self"", while AS applies all that to society.<p>All that said, while Atlas Shrugged can be an extremely depressing book (the constant feeling of ""How can this get worse"" coupled with the inevitable ""Oh, this is how""), it's also a very uplifting book.  After almost every reading session with AS, I found myself with a burning desire to work, to improve my business, to ""go get it"" and seize life.  The heroes resonate very well with those who absolutely love their work.<p>The only other book that has come close to as uplifting a feeling as Atlas Shrugged (for me) is Founders at Work, because many of the people interviewed in that book share the same passion for their work as the heroes in AS, and pull off monumental achievements.<p>Will the movie be any good?

544147,comment,543431,544118,0,0,geebee,,,"Some people actually need to lose, big, in order to gain introspection.<p>I remember Steven King on NPR talking about the guy who badly injured him in a car accident.  He was frustrated that the courts were lenient, because he said the guy continued to seem in denial about the connection between his actions and the damage he had caused.  Apparently, this guy had a history of reckless driving (Steven King had been walking on the side of the road when he was hit), but he continued to view these accidents as bad luck, circumstance, things happen, and so forth.  When asked what he wanted to see from the courts, Steven King said he wasn't looking for vengeance, but he wanted to see the guy placed into a situation where he'd be forced to finally confront his actions and fully acknowledge his role in the damage he had caused.<p>Now, obviously GetSatisfaction is not guilty of something as serious as physical harm.  But I still hear the same lack of introspection, the same denial, that I think Steve King was referring to.  They are still calling this a ""learning experience"", an ""error"", something to ""discuss and improve on.""  Their tone alternates between defensive, accusatory, and chirpy.<p>This shows a complete lack of introspection and self-awareness.
