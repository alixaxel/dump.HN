The R68-type[1] trains always had some seats fill faster than others.<p>For instance, the three seats lining the wall (see diagram), with the two seats perpendicular to the direction of travel always had the seat 3 fill faster than others (It's next to a window, has guaranteed leg space and you can put your feet on the radiator; it's pretty awesome). Seat 4 gets filled later since you have more leg space and can avoid person in seat 3 more effectively if you don't know them. Seats 0-2 have the potential to be squeezed awfully close to a stranger. Even closer if the train is operating is moving unpredictably.<p><pre><code>  [0][1][2]..[3].\n  ...........[4].\n</code></pre>\nThe pairs of seats on the edges of the train are nice if you have a bike or with 1 or 3 friends since you can take up that section of the train, be separated from everyone else, or lean on the wall to nap or rest.<p>Also, the side of the train that was closer to the side with majority of stations tended to be more popular.<p>And this post just went into <i>way</i> more detail than it had to.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/R68_Interior.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/R68_Interior.j...</a>",1238702362

543919,comment,543293,543730,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Actually they don't, carbs are broken down into glucose, fructose and galactose. Glucose, generally, requires insulin to be absorbed by the muscles, liver and fat cells. However Fructose doesn't, the cells then convert it into whatever form necessary, the liver usually converts it into glucose for storage. Yet muscles are capable of using fructose directly.<p>Glucose can directly be turned into ADP or ATP, or it is converted into Glucose-1-phosphate, which then can either be turned back into glucose or follow the path to be turned into Fructose-6-Phosphate (fructose incidentally directly turns into this). F6P is then converted into triose phosphate, a change that cannot be reversed, and can be directly converted into fat. Fats, when needed, are turned back into triose phosphate and can basically be directly converted into ATP.<p>Essentially fructose needs <i>less</i> processing than glucose to be readily stored. The aim of the human body is to increase its fat reserves for winter when food becomes scarce. Glucose is readily available and readily usable by the body, but all this depends directly on insulin to get it into cells to be useful. The notable cell that <i>doesn't</i> require insulin are brain cells, however these readily process fructose too.<p>So it's actually possible to completely remove glucose from the body, in the event it was ever needed then fructose can be back-stepped into glucose-1-phosphate. However, the body can more than adequately produce energy directly from fats, so it would seem extremely rare that the body would need glucose.",1238700919

If you only share a few hours per day, or not at all, the cycle times will be in terms of months instead of weeks.

Ph.D. students are also preferred for TA positions. On the other hand, depending on the school, she may be able to get other oncampus jobs that involve a tuition waiver. Through my first year at Georgia Tech, I worked as a programmer in a department and the position involved a tuition waiver and a stipend. As funds have run dry, this sort of thing has become harder to get but it's worth investigating. I had a friend whose job was to count the number of dead light bulbs in each building (she worked for Operations) and she got a tuition waiver for that!<p>This sort of thing also varies heavily from school to school and you really won't find out much unless you talk to people on the ground in the exact same program as you.<p>Finally google for merit based or application based scholarships from external institutions in her field. When my girlfriend went to gradschool I helped her apply for a ton of scholarships which were from institutions that had nothing to do with her school (eg Google's Anita Borg scholarship, one from the institute of information systems etc).
