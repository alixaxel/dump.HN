542890,comment,542716,542716,0,0,oomkiller,,,"I think anyone who has any depth of experience with Ruby can attest to the flaws it has data-intensive tasks.  Thats why many of us just drop down into another language when we need to get something done efficiently.  Ruby's clarity and conciseness make a lot of sense when writing views, controllers, and models, but don't have the same effectiveness in a background process that needs to be written and forgotten about.<p>Unless there are some major changes in Ruby (MORE than 1.9), I believe that it will be relegated to simple web applications, and never really be good at processing tons of data.<p>And honestly, isn't Ruby really just about prototyping?  I admit, its great for startups who have nil for cash that need to get something written QUICK (to get money from investors), but once you cross that threshold, why not write it over with a language designed for efficiency?",1238644538

If iPhone is so simple, why aren't other big companies as successful at creating new phones? Clearly, things are not as simple as some people would make you believe.<p>Also, a jump from Razr or Palm (for example) to iPhone is much bigger than that of iPhone 1.0 to 3.0.<p>Had Apple released a Razor-like iPhone and then iterated to iPhone 1.0 system over a year or two, I'd buy Gruber's argument.

What works for Apple probably won't work for the rest of us. Apple has hundreds of brilliant designers that create three different  <i>pixel perfect</i> designs for each piece of new UI. Three different teams (and all brilliant at what they do) working against each other...  how many of us can afford something like that?!<p>I still contend that Gruber's argument about Apple's secret being simplicity and evolution is bullshit.

542859,comment,542716,542842,0,0,rcoder,,,"First of all, I don't think it's fair to accuse the Twitter dev team of working without real experience and numbers to back up their decisions. They have a huge volume of data being generated by their service, and have weathered the whole ""Rails doesn't scale"" flame-fest with relative grace and good humor. IMHO, that entitles them to talk fairly freely about the relative scalability of different languages and frameworks.<p>Secondly, any ""ranting"" you hear in this article is the product of El Reg, not Alex. He mostly offered a calm, positive presentation about the improved speed (with relatively little, if any, tradeoff in developer productivity) that came from using Scala instead of Ruby for critical infrastructure services.<p>Regardless, most Java web applications' performance issues stem from framework-itis, not from the underlying runtime. By itself, Tomcat (or another modern Java servlet container) is capable of some pretty impressive throughput -- perhaps not on par with a lean, pure C server like nginx, but not nearly as limited in functionality and extensibility, either.<p>No matter what you think about Java the language, you at least have to admit that HotSpot blows MRI, YARV, the Python VM, and Parrot out of the water when it comes to raw performance on low-level code. That doesn't save you from bad implementation ideas, but it does at least give you the <i>possibility</i> of getting fast, efficient code, if you have a decent compiler and work fairly close to the metal.<p>Using Scala is one way to produce that sort of low-level implementation code without wanting to gouge your eyes out (which is how most Java source tends to make me feel, anyway).",1238642750

I'm sorry but that's hardly the case... In fact, we would happily pay ~$10k to publish to iTunes if it meant half the stuff on the store would not be there.<p>That said, I really wish Apple had let apps run wild. As an alternative, developers could apply for iTunes Publishing and give up 30% + extensive review process. This would let Apple pick and choose without criticism, while ""experimenters"" could keep the clutter off the store but in a true free market economy where if it was truly that great — it would be recognized with or without Apple's support.<p>My guess is the Blackberry market will be nerfed by  inconsistent hardware that will require extensive testing to ensure a consistent experience for all consumers. Have you developed a Blackberry web-app? Have fun, it's a nightmare... especially when almost all the user-agents report a unique browser specific to the phone. And that's when things were relatively simple.<p>It's in this regard (and others) that the iPhone wins, and while critics will find fault in a closed/commoditized hardware device — it's truly one of the primary reasons for so much interest in the iPhone (though possibly not recognized given the influx of 'new' software developers). If we had a thousand+ configurations to deal with like Windows Mobile or Blackberry, we would likely not be publishing  out of our apartment unless we had funding of some sort.<p>Look, I'm all about experimenting and hobbyist developers and  there's really not much stopping you now... build a few apps, install them on your phone and friends w/ ad hoc distros. But there's really no reason that many of these apps need to clutter a market place. It's like putting a .99 store in a respected city mall, which would never happen be/c there is a gatekeeper preventing crap from leasing space and degrading the shopping experience for customers who go to the mall with an expectation.<p>That said, I really wish Apple never let iFart on the store.

The Arab and Scholastic philosophers constructed a philosophical world-view, largely based on Aristotelian logic, which internally consistent fairly comprehensive. What resulted in its downfall, was not the failure of logic, but the desire for absolute truth. All forms of logic, whether mathematical or syllogistic, require argument from premises, which means that ultimately one must start with first premises that cannot be proved and must merely be agreed upon (making truth a matter of consensus.) Descartes tried to rectify this situation by assuming away all assumptions and proving first premises in a vacuum. He didn't get far (made too many logical fallacies) but he started a fad that overtook the philosophical realm and continues to this day.<p>My point being, that the problem wasn't the language (despite what the deconstructuralists might say,) which, if common and well defined presents no barrier, but changing ends in philosophical discourse.",1238641862
