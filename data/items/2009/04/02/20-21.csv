God help us if the ""Ayn Rand temporary jerk phenomenon"" is unleashed through movie theaters all at once.<p>It's a good book but like anything else people extrapolate the points beyond recognition and additionally interpret it to re-enforce their own views, regardless of how unreasonable those views might be.",1238703174

Back then, before the widespread availability of the 'Net, users would probably think a ""boot block"" virus was attacking their system or some other scary scenario was happening.<p>Of course, I was a Mac-only user back then, so we had auto-detect (and auto-eject!) drives and learned to take them for granted.  Part of me thinks the historical suckiness of DOS/Windows is less the fault of Microsoft and more the fault of the IT community of that era, who were tone deaf regarding end user satisfaction and empowerment.<p>(Even now, using Windows machines at work make me feel constrained compared to the relative freedom to do what I wanted with my classic era Macs.
