If the newspaper industry was doing well, we _probably_ would be hearing about how they're giving away news to drive eyeballs to sites -- much like how they operated as a newspaper, not a news organization who publishes to the web.<p>Craigslist and eBay are the two standouts who rang the knell.<p><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/Report-Craigslist-costing-newspapers-millions/2100-1024_3-5505076.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/Report-Craigslist-costing-newspapers-mi...</a><p>My understanding is for years, the newspapers gave news away for near free, subsidized by advertising and in the black because of it. Take out the classifieds and you've removed a valuable service to the community and a major revenue source. Now, they're reduced to news organizations. Their revenue has been declining. Aggregators are the current scapegoat and one of the potential revenue modes.<p>Fifteen years ago, I had five choices for daily print news. My two local papers, the USA Today, NYT and the Wall Street Journal. Today, each of them compete against themselves and a litany of other ""print"" news. CNN, ABC, CBS, and your local TV stations are now ""print"" publishers too. The competition is even more fierce.<p>The news industry as a whole changed with the internet. You no longer need presses and trucks or 100,000 watt transmitters to distribute news. The sour economy only expedites this shift. Some will come out as agents of change. Others will fight to maintain what they had. These are the ones who are trying to plug something that started long before aggregators.<p>edit: good read --

There are also bloggers who are much better than the vast majority of what you'll see in the papers.

Yes, code should be well-factored, <i>but it isn't</i>, so be careful.<p>I think type checks should absolutely remain in production code. (If you're considering removing them for efficiency purposes, measure if it matters.) The ambiguity that tends to creep in and cause nasty bugs isn't ""is this a polygon or a string?"" (I mean, duh), but rather, stuff like, ""is this measurement currently in meters or millimeters?"". Working in a dynamic language and putting checks in the few places where it really matters is good enough, but <i>it really matters</i>. It may help to think of type assertions as comments about expectations and intent that are automatically checked.<p>Also, languages with type inference can be a good compromise. You get the consistency checking of static typing without having to constantly remind the compiler that it's still dealing with an int or whatever. (I like OCaml, but it's not without its flaws. It takes a while to get the hang of working with, rather than against, its incredibly thorough type checking.)",1239051952
