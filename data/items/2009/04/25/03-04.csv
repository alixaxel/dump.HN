They can likely get memory management, and other crazy things, to fall through to the host OS.<p>I hope, though, that they're not trying to make XP applications as secure and trustworthy as W7 applications by wrapping them in a slow software condom; that, instead, they're just trying to ensure backwards-compatibility to the utmost extent possible. If something could crash XP, it should be able to crash W7 transparently through VXP—that's the level of entanglement where you start to see real performance. The users who need the old applications, that ran on XP but don't run on Vista, know what the bugs are; they'd rather have the <i>same</i> bugs, with the same symptoms, than <i>new</i> bugs. They know what they're getting into when they install something in XP-virtualization mode, so we don't have to <i>improve</i> the experience beyond what it was like in XP just for them. That's what releasing a W7 version is for.",1240631748

578564,comment,577298,577849,0,0,codeodor,,,"Does Amazon matter? As I recall, the article talks about taxing anyone who advertises on California-based web sites (servers?). How does one tell?<p>I was under the impression Amazon had warehouses that end up delivering in most states, since I (thought I) pay tax on purchases in my state. The point is, it's not just Amazon. Amazon is a minor part of it. They're talking about causing anyone who advertises on a California website to be a California taxpayer.<p>That's ridiculous. I'm sure I must be considered as one of the top few percent of people who pay attention to news. What happens with advertisers who are less in-tune with intra-state events? What happens with people who buy ads through an ad agency who puts their ads on California websites? What happens to direct buyers who don't know any better?<p>Do you see what I mean now by unwilling and unknowing?<p>And let's forget about the US Constitution. One comment here put it as ""clear."" It's not quite as clear as saying ""the US govt has power to tax interstate commerce,"" but anyone I've known as a constitutional ""scholar"" agrees with that:<p>The original constitution- article 1, section 8, says the US Congress has the duty and right:<p>""To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes; ""<p>Then later they mention that ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.""<p>Most people forget about that 10th amendment (and the 9th as well!)<p>You see, the power of regulating commerce among the several states was delegated by the Constitution to the United States. It's not up to California.<p>""Really, this needs a national solution...""<p>No, it doesn't. California charges an income AND sales tax. Plenty of states do fine without an income tax. Plenty of states do fine without a sales tax that over-reaches authority.<p>This is absurdity asked by a government who has no apparent concept of reality with the rest of the world.",1240631129

It is dead to me.<p>I think it's a symptom of small thinking for your current startup...the one that is succeeding.  Why would you distract yourself and your customers and your media coverage from a winner and direct it all back towards a loser?<p>I'm not saying it's impossible to have left behind something worth pursuing.  Maybe you did give up too soon, or maybe you had to choose an expedient path rather than pursuing something harder.  I don't know.

However, it's fully possible to create <i>semi</i>-random cyphertext to a set entropy, which means all your encrypted transmissions could just be filled with ""sparse"" or ""dense"" extra data to balance them out with your chosen ""inconspicuous"" entropy value.<p>Then again, I seem to recall that the cyphertext is compressed <i>before</i> encryption in PGP/GPG, likely in order to obviate exactly this problem. Then you would indeed just have to add white noise to the messages until their post-compression, pre-encryption filesizes match, as hopefully the encryption layer won't allow the compression ratio information to leak through.",1240630526

This may be growth, but it is still a small piece of the large pie. That is true.<p>However, I still think it is an example demonstrating something. In many cases (myself included), customers will probably prefer Amazon. After all, they solve the online book buying problem pretty well. You can match them for price, but can't really beat them unless you sell second hand. You probably can't match their delivery times, reliability or efficiencies.<p>But a strong social good incentive is a possible point of difference.",1240630254

So I buy the drives and just use the free 2 gig Dropbox for synchronizing smaller files.)<p>On the other hand, I had no problem paying $30/year for Flickr Pro.

The fact that many web hosts support it also means that hosting is cheaper for you go out and try something.<p>Since you are starting out I would suggest you to write a couple of small webapps before you go for the one you are into. I do this for every new language I learn and it's helped me a lot. Just reading thru a tutorial totally different from doing it and getting first-hand experience, especially if you are going to work with Python and Ruby for webapps.<p>I had a odd but great experience when I first learnt PHP, that was around 4yrs ago. Every time I did something, I found there was a better way to do it and the PHP documentation on the website is great (and the comments for every page on the docs)<p>And also learn Object Oriented stuff in PHP. Learn to use classes and objects. This opens up a whoile new shelf of resources for you. Coz then you can start using classes that others have created for specific tasks. phpclasses.org has a pretty huge database of classes. Also as you go, just get started with using an MVC. Use CakePHP (I use it and its good) or CodeIgniter or Kohana (as many here suggest often).<p>I suggested PHP coz it also saves you the pain of learning how to deploy your app. For PHP it's pretty straight forward, just upload the files and it works. Good for starters.<p>P.S: Don't listen to me. Just do it your own way. Coz that's what you'll do anyway. It's never possible to follow suggestions/rules, like a sworn monk.
