554855,comment,554305,554630,0,0,seertaak,,,"weavejester, having seen other comments I really appreciate you having an intellectually honest stab at my contention. But I think you're wide of the mark.<p>First off, musicians/songwriters don't expect their creative works to be a <i>perpetual</i> source of revenue. In the UK copyright expires after 50 years. Granted, that's not a short period of time, but nor is it perpetual.<p>And while I agree that the software business does entail continuing updates, and while I too applaud idSoftware's policies regarding open-sourcing old versions, there is a fundamental difference between music and software, namely that music is not amenable to small, incremental updates. I mean, what exactly do you propose, that musicians remaster their album every year (they do it every so often anyway, actually!), or add extra overdubs or tracks each year? Surely it's not difficult to see that this approach isn't workable, is it? Do you really want a session musician to go into the studio and overdub, say, trane's solo on So What?!!!<p>> When was the last time a prominent musician released their old works under a creative commons license?<p>I agree that that would be awesome. But musicians are taking steps in this direction. For example, Kanye West offers downloads of the stems to his music -- that's the music equivalent of providing the source code. So there is movement on this front. And most bands offer some portion of their music for free on their myspaces, so whether or not it's free as in freedom, it is freely available for those who want to listen.<p>Finally, is it your position that the hacker ethos considers it frivolous or morally wrong to collect revenue for patent royalties? It strikes me that this is quite similar to music royalties in that all the ""work"" is done up-front.",1239301098

The best a Brazilian friend and I could come up with was that it was like everyone got stuck in that very awkward phase when you're 12-13 and just switching from hating the other sex to being uncomfortably attracted to it.<p>It seemed to us that somehow Americans just never outgrew that uncomfortable phase, which Europeans and Brazilians outgrow by the time we're 16 at the latest.<p>Again, this is just personal and subjective evidence.<p>And I just remebered something much less subjective. Here's some empircal evidence.<p>I remember watching <i>The Abyss</i> on basic cable, this again shortly after I came to the US. And at one point Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character is out and needs a defibrillator and her boob falls out.<p>I distinctly remember being genuinely surprised that it was blurred, it was such a nothing!

554852,story,,,3,0,tialys,"Ask HN: Choosing a business model",,"Background: Some friends and I are getting together this summer to work on an idea we had for a web startup that is directly linked to universities.  (No we're not a blackboard clone, something different)<p>We think we've got a pretty solid service, but we're not sure which direction to take it.  We see it going one of two ways:<p># The 'Blackboard' Model:<p>I know everyone hates Blackboard, but no one can say their business model is poor.  From our perspective, selling directly to schools (SAAS) would be good for 2 reasons: First, a guaranteed revenue stream.  We sell to school A for $100/mo we KNOW we have that income. Second, the same as Blackboard, once you're in, it's hard to get pushed out.<p>The cons however, are very obvious:  It's not 'ours' anymore, and it's not going to be easy to innovate.  The business model is fixed, so if we have a smash hit, it's tough to cash in on it quickly.  Also, we're stuck working at the behest of the schools we sell to.  Not bad if we're making tons of money, but perhaps stifling to creativity, and annoying in cases of say... censorship.<p># The 'Facebook' Model:<p>Everyone* who is currently in college has an account with Facebook.  Facebook is HUGE and it doesn't answer to anyone but itself (and, sometimes it's users).  The freedom Facebook has seems nice.  We like this model because we keep control, and we can iterate quickly (we don't have to 'sell' new features).  Also, we have the option to change things if the need arises, so in the case of becoming an 'overnight success' we can keep the money rolling in without having to worry about contracts, budgets etc...<p>Obviously the downside is the upside -- If we are a huge success, we don't necessarily have the means to support ourselves (Look at Facebook... the ads aren't cutting it).  The freedom comes at the cost of security.<p>The reason we're looking at this is that we're considering some minor investments to get our company formed and to enable us to quit our day jobs (which don't make us much anyway as we're full time students too).  We want to get a firm direction to take the app in before we present to the investors though.<p>I guess what I'd like to hear is, what do you guys think of each business model, and if possible how has either fared for you?  I'm interested in any industry where similar setup exists, or perhaps even a hypothetical third model, apart from or combining the two above.  Any feedback at all is much appreciated.",1239301065
