581422,comment,580781,581027,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"In the Windows world? Yes. By no coincidence whatsoever: Windows customers have been <i>trained</i> to this behavior, over decades, by Microsoft and Moore's Law.<p>Microsoft thrives when people buy new PC hardware, because the easiest way to acquire a customer for a new Windows license is to bundle that license with every PC sold. [1] And Moore's Law provided great leaps in processing speed every year or so. So there was never any incentive to save on resources. Quite the contrary: A Windows release which pushed the envelope of compatibility with current hardware encouraged fence-sitting users to bite the bullet and buy a new PC -- with a new Windows license -- rather than watch their apps gradually slow down or become incompatible as app developers gradually introduced features of the new Windows into their codebases.<p>Among other things, think of it as a subtle form of copy protection. Back in 2001, you could buy one copy of Windows XP and install it on all of your Win98 boxes. But it would run like crap. Better to just buy some new boxes -- each of which comes bundled with a copy of XP.<p>Of course, once PCs and Windows became ""good enough"" the whole strategy fell apart. We seem to be in that world now. The new rage in consumer computing is netbooks and smartphones -- machines that <i>deliberately throw away</i> performance in exchange for other useful characteristics like ""cheapness"" or ""lightness"" or ""low power consumption"".<p>---<p>[1] For years it was nigh-impossible to get a company like Dell to sell you a PC without a Windows license included. Linux users complained and fought for years over this ""Microsoft tax"". For all I know, this is still a problem.",1240844357

The closest is the small software companies bought by Sun, Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Oracle and so on. But they always seem to buy the <i>company</i>; and the company always seems to have <i>customers</i>. There could be exceptions, but I know of none.<p>(1). System: No one buys software. They buy solutions to their problems - especially in the enterprise. That is, a ""whole product"": integration, support, maintenance, documentation, training, interoperability and so on. You might say they buy a ""system"". This partly explains why some enterprise software <i>products</i> can appear pretty crap. It's because the product itself isn't particularly critical - it's just a factor.<p>(2). Users: If you don't have users, how do you know it is usable in practice? Does it interoperate with their other systems? How does it cope with real world loads? Fred Brooks said that more users find more bugs. Will the very first user encounter a few show-stoppers? (Sorry to be so negative - maybe you have done many of these things; but without users, it's impossible). In a way, it is much easier to start with an absurdly trivial program, and grow it with a community of users (or customers). That's how most (not all) successful software seems to be built.<p>(3). Exception: If you aimed at plug-compatibility, so that your software can more-or-less invisibly and silently slot into an existing role, and it also is better by objective measures (such as speed, memory use, accuracy, reliability), and <i>these improvements matter to at least some customers</i>, then you might be able to sell it. For example, Sun publishes many of its specifications as standards, to deliberately create a marketplace for implementors like yourselves. If you pass the compatibility suite, it's a start (but the buyer would still need to be able to extend it themselves, support it, fix bugs and so on - the system again).<p>As someone else said: If you are exhausted, <i>please take a break</i> before making any decisions. It's impossible to see opportunities when you are too tired. Note that I don't know anything about what you've actually done, or your actual opportunities - so there may be many ways around them.<p>Could you elaborate on ""beats most commercial offerings in its field""?<p><i>Disclaimer: although I've written software and sold several licenses for it, a few to the enterprise, I haven't sold a company (or the software in the way you mean).</i>",1240841511
