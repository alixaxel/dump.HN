If you Google it, you'll see work I've done with Zimbra, Freenet, SQ7, and a dozen other projects.. The username certainly has a great deal of weight on it's own, without needing to link it to my resume.<p>How else do you think people could be encouraged to have ""weighty"" reputations, so they don't want to give them up?",1239328766

555554,comment,554940,554940,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I'd consider the issue of latency to be a switching cost vs. lock-in.  You could move all your stuff over to the new, shiny cloud.  Of course, if Cloud A is good for some stuff and Cloud B is good for other stuff, then you're stuck in the middle (without low-latency peering as some commenters have mentioned).<p>In general, I don't see why people are scared of Amazon EC2 lock-in.  You're still writing a regular 'ol app that runs on RedHat (or whatever).  How does switching over to your own datacenter require any re-writes (other than config changes, etc.)?<p>I understand the S3 issue, but you ought to be abstracting away the S3 details anyway with a code layer.  So, you could implement some sort of hybrid scheme (S3 + new way abstracted away) easily enough if you must avoid downtime  Or, if you don't have that much data, just write a script to move it all over.<p>Queuing: If you're relying on some specific feature of SQS, you're doing it wrong.<p>Payments: Ok, this gets interesting.  But, it's low volume compared to most computing activity, so you can afford the latency.  It's not like your DB is at Amazon and your app servers are somewhere else.<p>I'm more sympathetic to Google AppEngine lock-in.  However, I don't think it's too hard for someone to implement the limited set of interfaces provided by the cloud (at least in the Java case -- I haven't examined the Python one), so it's easily broken.<p>As Clouds become more abstracted away from hardware and the current ways of doing things, I think lock-in will become a real concern.  But, it doesn't matter right now.",1239328646

Give the members who have the highest karma a set number of invitations and they invite people they trust. To prevent people from gaming the system you could even display the user who ""vouched"" for a troll to join. This is essnetially the strategy private clubs and organizations have used to preserve their identifies for years. I'm not suggesting we turn HN into a social network or anything, but I do think we can use the notion of personal relationships to act as an anchor.

555538,comment,555136,555400,0,0,netcan,,,"I would like to hear a great public speaker put that in to the right words.<p>It seems perfectly natural to hear currently successful people recall the learning experience of running a business early in life. It's seems perfectly natural that if you meet a 21 year old that has been running a business for some time, you will expect future success from them. This is obviously due to the (a)educational value of these activities & (b) what personality traits these suggest (It is usually not because this business is especially successful). You can speculate about which one is dominant, but (a) is unlikely to be insignificant. Already this sounds like a discussion about the value of going to a top Uni.<p>Like I said, I think a good speaker could take a friendly audience through something like this thought process & come to the conclusions that spending time & money running a business early on is valuable.<p>But if it comes to making a practical decision based on the above it quickly starts to feel radical. A proactical decision could be to take the time & money it takes to attend University & spend it creating a business. If the educational & associated benefits are similar to a University education, there are two outcomes. (1) The business fails - Education is acquired (2) The business succeeds - Education is acquired + the business can be sold or operated.<p>The risk doesn't seem <i>that</i> big.<p>Where I live (Australia) International Undergraduates typical need  are: 20k-30k USD * 3-5 years. Students are often from Malaysia, Indonesia, China & India.<p>60k - 150k buys you a fairly substantial education business experience in these countries. But even some place like England, it is substantial.<p>In essays, PG implies ""risking"" about a year and little or nothing out-of-pocket. That is an order of magnitude less ""risky"" then University typically is.<p>The logical case is there. What's needed is the emotional resonance. I don't think it applies only to startups in the YC sense.",1239328013

Responding like this can be difficult, but it's very effective - and good for the soul.<p>A weakness of HN is that intelligent, articulate writing is sometimes used with harsh attitude and connotations. That is, it's just as nasty as elsewhere online, just elegantly phrased.

  - They grew close to 100% last month
  - I've gotten more business contacts over twitter than LinkedIn & Facebook combined
  - Twitter is much more conversational than Facebook when between strangers. That makes the business & celeb side of it stronger.<p>I expect Facebook to do more to let companies better engage with their users. One problem is the privacy. Facebook conversations are largely hidden from the public eye.

It just <i>looks</i> like it's barely restrained, waiting to leap forward: a kind of ""visual onomatopoeia"" I guess. I used to think everyone was like this when I was a kid, but asking a few people about it soon pointed out that I was just a weirdo :-)<p>I think the reason it's declined with age is that as a child I read constantly - I always had my nose in a book - so words became associated with mental pictures.

    product = foldl (*) 1
    and = foldl (&&) True
    or  = foldl (||) False
    any p = or . map p
    all p = and . map p
    concat = foldl (++) []
    unlines = concat . map (++ ""\n"")
</code></pre>
Google calls it ""reduce"" as well - this is what MapReduce is based upon.<p>(BTW, bad search query: [haskell unlines] gives me the Haskell prelude definition as the <i>last</i> result on the first page, even though that's the authoritative source.  It gives me the Zvon and Informatik mirrors as #1 and #2, and then lots of useless discussion.  Couldn't there be a way to boost ""authoritative"" sources up the rankings?)",1239325552

A lot of people have bones to pick with him, and he can certainly be a little brusque (speaking as a former TechCrunch intern), but he is one incredibly capable guy -- a consistently excellent writer, bitingly funny commentator, and, apparently, a mean product designer/manager.

There aren't. The vast majority of articles on politics say nothing new at all.<p>A quick and dirty solution would be just to delete any articles if someone can find a link to an earlier article saying essentially the same thing. This would get rid of more than just the junk stories on politics, it would get rid of all the rehashes of the ethics of nootropic drugs, or the link between race and IQ, or whatever.

Nothing you do is wrong, but if you read a bunch of Lisp code, you wouldn't see many people doing things the way you did.  OTOH, if you read a bunch of Scheme code, it would look exactly like yours.<p>Also, I don't think the use of loop is a point of contention.  LOOP is in the CL spec, tail recursion isn't.
