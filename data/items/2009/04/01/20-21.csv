542444,comment,542108,542341,0,0,nir,,,"I love Ruby. I love that code can be so short and yet easily readable. It might be slower and perhaps more memory-hungry than other languages, but for my needs that's usually not an issue.<p>What I do miss are good, <i>well documented</i>, stable libraries. For example, I currently process RSS/Atom feeds with FeedTools, whose own creator says he's tired of maintaining (I totally understand him and am extremely thankful for the time he put into it). I assume if there were more people coding Ruby, there would be a better chance someone would step up and take his place. So, having a community that is more welcoming to newcomers would eventually benefit us all.<p>By ""open to newcomers"" I don't mean that Ruby-celebs should stop posting snarky comments at each other in their blogs. This is pretty negilible. I mean stuff like having better documentation, for example, online, free, in googleable format (rather than screencasts or print books). IMHO PHP3 annotated online docs back in 1999 were significantly more usable than what Rails has to offer now.",1238619482

542441,comment,541753,541947,0,0,dkarl,,,"People don't view philosophy that way because philosophy never gets far from words.  Philosophy and math started to fork at the point where people realized that substituting words into logical schema and then using logical transformations to create new sentences doesn't work reliably, and in fact doesn't really aid thought at all except by suggesting possibilities.  At that point, logic became a philosophic failure, a dead end.  A curiosity at best.  There's still kind of a conceptual overlap; a philosopher might find it stimulating to think about the concept of N-value truth systems.  However, he wouldn't think that mathematical theorems about such systems have any strict philosophical consequences.  They would just be spurs for thought.",1238619327

It's not just that they are talking about different levels of competence – they aren't even talking about the same discipline.<p>Dijkstra may have meant something like ""doing meaningful work in computer science"" or ""solving algorithmic challenges"".  Jeff Atwood seems to mean something like ""gluing libraries together to accomplish a business objective"".<p>At the beginning of Jeff's post, it almost sounds like he has something interesting to say about the Dijkstra quote, but that's just because he confusingly uses the same word to mean something almost completely unrelated.  As he says ""the vast bulk of code that I've seen consists mostly of the 'balancing your checkbook' sort of math.""  I don't think that's quite what Dijkstra had in mind.

And the third leg is the business leg, the guy who gets us incorporated and pitches our idea to our customers.<p>We have no real, hardcore developer though.<p>I know the easy thing to say would be ""just learn to code!"" And yes, that's our current approach. But is there a better way? It's going to take a lot more time than we'd like to become proficient enough at either Django or Rails (which is what we're looking at) or even Cake, CodeIgniter, or Symphony (all of which are last resort, more for speed since I'm good with PHP right now and just need to learn more in the OOP/MVC area).<p>Is it possible to outsource our product (rentacoder, getafreelancer, etc)? The lingering question with this is, how do we call it our product if we had no hand in building it, or that's not even really the biggest problem -- without giving our hired coder equal equity stake in our startup? What's to stop the coder from just taking the finished product and running?<p>Is there a way to protect the code as proprietary intellectual property of the company?",1238616433

542375,comment,542173,542234,0,0,rgoddard,,,"You have to consider what being more productive translates to. In this case, since we are talking about software, lets assume that being more productive means that you can implement more features of a similar complexity at the same level of quality compared to the guy sitting next to you. Assuming everything else equal between you two, you would expect that you would be paid more. In Joel's model, the only way for this to be accounted for is scope. Since you can produce more features you are now responsible for more features. Assuming that this increase of scope is enough to move you up to the next grade, you would have a higher salary. Otherwise, it could be accounted for with your bonus.<p>But what if you could implement twice as much features, but you required additional over site to manage those features. You have just created additional work for someone else. Before your additional productivity can be utilized, someone else has to help you convert it to something more usable. Depending how needed that other person is, your increase in productivity could result in a net lose of productivity for the team as a whole.<p>When talking about productivity, you need to be specific in what you mean, because productivity is hard to measure and quantify.",1238616302
