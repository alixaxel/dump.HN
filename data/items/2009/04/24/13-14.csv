There's no gap between what they can do with their tools, and what I can do with a real programming toolset.  Also, I can't see one tool fitting everyone's needs.<p>I have also observed that most non-programmers have an allergic reaction to anything that looks like code, even something as basic as VBA.  They'll do acrobatics with all sorts of weird macros, but that's OK because it takes place in a GUI; there's very little syntax to get wrong, or structure to create.<p>I think programmers underestimate the learning/confidence people need to code even a simple program.",1240581529

They should be separately held funds that can survive beyond the lifetime of the company (like 401k plans). To make them company obligations is to invite disaster. It's analogous to the situation at GM where each current worker covers the health care of 10 other people.  If you want a pension plan because you trust and want to pay pension plan administrators to manage your assets, it needs to be a separate financial entity from the company itself.",1240578431

There have been weeks where I didn't want to look at the code and subsequently nothing got done. There are other times though I fired up the IDE only to tweaked little things like a CSS style or refactor a simple method, only to find I had built up momentum and got lots of little things done.<p>This however wasn't the point to the article. The point I was trying to get at (perhaps not well), is the importance of setting a penalty when we didn't make a self-imposed deadline. So instead of just spending 20 mins tweaking a CSS, perhaps my time was better spent on the tasks which would actually contribute to the completion of the task. This focus on the end goal I believe can be a powerful force in helping us finish.<p>I can attest to that as I am the perpetual tweaker. Everytime I look at a site I'm building, I get more and more tired of its look and feel. So before I finish a project, often I'd have switched styles 10 times! For me, having the penalty clause helps me keep in focus.<p>Thanks for the great comment.",1240578339

Anything besides a pension program that is funded as it goes and has market driven payouts has a high risk of turning into a Ponzi scheme.<p>The beauty of 401k is that the company gives you the money now, they don't just promise to give it to you in the future. As the pace of change continues to accelerate, it is a less and less likely that the company you work for today is going to exist in the same form at the time you retire.  Think of all of the newspaper pensions- who's going to be paying those in 30 years?<p>Even if the companies establish separate pension funds that that can survive beyond the life of the company, the payouts from that fund will be based on the performance of its investments and the lifespans of the people that receive funds from it.<p>In short, I'd much rather have a 401k that can be rolled over into the investment freedom of an IRA (some place I can own short contracts) than be depending on a pension plan run by a company that may or may not exist at the time I retire.",1240578137
