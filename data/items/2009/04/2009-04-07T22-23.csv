Tutorial D and all that.<p>Personally, I'm not doing anything at the moment for which Twitter-esque scalability is really a requirement (though hardly anyone is, honestly). Postgresql is a sufficient large RDBMS, for my purposes, SQLite works nicely as a smaller one, and below that, in-memory Lua tables, Python dicts, or Scheme sexps are fine. I'm mostly curious about what alternative database-like tools could be made for roughly the same domain as SQLite. To some extent, that could overlap with objects, but OOP is not in any way a requirement for me. (There may be some intersection with filesystems, too; they're databases, after all.)",1239144941

And, a third thanks, for ignoring the main argument in my last post, and continuing to nullify the types of e-mails that I pulled out of my ass, specifically, the ""close"" e-mail.<p>And, yet, I'm still at a loss as to why it is unreasonable to think that there could be different generic e-mails sent out to different groups.<p>>>If they're prepared to fund 1,000 companies they think are _really_ likely to make it, I think that implies there's no need for strata.<p>Only if <i>every</i> company not accepted was rejected for <i>precisely</i> the same reason, and this reason could not at all be broken down at all.  Do you think that is likely?<p>Perhaps somebody could list out all of the YC philosophies of acceptance, and every type of generic e-mail that wouldn't make sense to send; then we could use deduction to solve this mystery of no stratified rejection e-mails.<p>All I set out to do was test the hypothesis:  <i>Were there different rejection letters sent</i>, because it seems pretty reasonable that there would be.  Maybe some letters would contain feedback, albeit generic?  After all, they need to make a conscientious decision to accept/deny, why not have a few reasons for denying?  I even proposed a method to test out this hypothesis.<p>Thank you to everyone who did the MD5 to verify that there was only 1 type of e-mail sent.  That's what I was looking for.<p>But when I get in return, and not just on this thread, are people talking about the YC acceptance process as if they are part of YC, or (in this case) paraphrasing the fucking rejection letter or YC application notes, I find that to be really annoying.

I'm pretty sure my mom hated him for every hour and minute she had to live in that town.  If I picked up a wife or girlfriend in the hip, thriving city where I lived, would she follow me to Bumfuck, USA?  Would I let her if she wanted to?  I constantly obsessed over the fear of ending up teaching hopeless kids at a double-directional school in a little town at the end of the universe, watching my kids grow up alienated from their provincial peers and underserved by the school system, burdened with the knowledge that it was <i>my</i> failure that forced my family to live there.<p>So I quit and got a job as a programmer to keep myself afloat while I figured out what to do with my life.

This figure, which was based on actual bids for new reactors in the United States, caused considerable sticker shock.<p>Current prices for nuclear reactors shot up extremely over the past 5 years. This is because nuclear power became an option for a lot of countries (with global warming fears). The problem with this is that it increased costs significantly.<p>Being a very specialized field, construction of new nuclear power stations can not just be increased as demand increases.

551768,comment,550715,551337,0,0,larrywright,,,"It's completely subjective.<p>I don't develop for a living at the moment - I'm a program manager these days. At my day job, I do one off scripts, plus the occasional prototype. I do however work on a number of side projects, mostly in Ruby, where I try out the latest practices: TDD, BDD, etc.<p>I base my statement on my own perception of my abilities, and I certainly don't attribute it fully to my not using a debugger anymore. I've learned a lot, and gained experience. That experience enables me to solve problems more quickly, as it's much more likely that I've seen an error (or something like it) before. I've had more exposure to good code, both internally as well as many of the open source projects that I've looked at. Seeing how other people solve problems also makes you a better programmer. I've also seen a lot more bad code, and thus know which things to avoid.<p>My opinion on debuggers is also subjective. I just know that when I used one in the past, it tended to cause problems (though I didn't realize it at the time). You set a breakpoint, step through some things, find a problem and fix it. But this doesn't generally lead to an understanding of what caused the problem (simple logic errors aside), and in fact can insulate you from larger design issues that need to be addressed. You fix a bug here, modify a line of code there, without taking a step back and looking at what the code is doing, and whether or not it needs to be refactored.<p>This isn't to say that you can't do those things with a debugger. My point is that debuggers seem to enable certain bad habits, while skipping the debugger and relying on analysis, unit tests, and debug statements seems to encourage some good practices.<p>All I can say is give it a try - next time you want to reach for the debugger, write a unit test to recreate your problem, and use some debug statements to try and solve it. If it works for you, great. If not, go back to the debugger. YMMV.",1239141611

Sadly, no.<p>My parents were frugal to a point, but not cheap. Budgeting wasn't something I really learned the concept of in depth, until I went out into the cold. Avoiding credit wasn't something my parents did, though they never abused it or amassed huge amounts of debt, and could always pay everything off (I didn't know or care about this at the time).<p>The thing my parents gave me was a longing for independence, success, and the knowledge that if there is ever something I need to learn, nothing stops me from learning it.<p>Sometimes, no matter which route a person chooses, they will succeed just because of their willpower, hardwork, sacrifice and perseverance.<p>Consequently I think money is wasted on studies like this, each individual finds their own path to success, even if similar.",1239141606
