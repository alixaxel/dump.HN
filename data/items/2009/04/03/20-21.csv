As a result, calling yourself a ""hacker"" only works if (a) you only care about your reputation with other hackers, or (b) you are trying to cultivate an ambiguously dangerous persona. It is not a word I would put on my resume if I were applying at SAP, unless I were already well known for being Steve Wozniak.<p>So you're down to ""programmer"", ""developer"", or ""coder"". My impression is that most people use ""developer"" as a highfalutin synonym for ""programmer""... but in some environments it connotes ""a person who spends a lot of time talking about software but never uses the computer except for Outlook, Office, and Twitter"". So, if you want to emphasize that you actually spend the majority of your day in emacs, lean towards the other words.<p>Sometimes ""programmer"" carries too strong a connotation of ""code monkey"".

The old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" is especially true with developers/UI designers who are interested in startups. Without some sort of compensation, whether it be cash money or equity, I wonder if you are going to get the ""right"" kind of interest.<p>You have to ask yourself, who is their target talent here?<p>The real talented AND motivated developers/designers in Boulder and probably Boston (AKA ""The Gurus""), who have an affinity for startups and TechStars probably applied to the program themselves and didn't get in. Either way, they know the value of their time and are hard at work on their own startups.<p>The other talented and motivated people are probably consultants or working full time at a company. Despite this being a poor economy, I've found that there is no shortage of work for the ""right"" people.<p>And of course, there are a fair share of those that fit a combination of the above.<p>This leaves us with the last two groups. The people that are either talented and unmotivated, or lack talent, but have the motivation. My suspicion is that you will get people volunteering to the HackStars program who are TechStars fanboys at best. They like the idea of doing a startup, or being a part of the ""startup culture"" but in truth may not want to put in the work, or worse, are benched because no one wants to work with them.<p>I may be totally wrong. Either way, I don't fault the TechStars team for test driving an idea like this. But if I were a founder who made it in to the program, I would be very skeptical of the value of the volunteers.",1238789101

It's an artfully disguised form of class discrimination.<p>Lots of very smart and hardworking people cannot afford to work for free. Apparently those people are at a severe disadvantage when applying to work at your company. And it's not as if unpaid internships offer financial aid, like schools do.<p>I think it's fine to screen prospective employees as <i>paid</i> interns. I also think it's fine to try them out as consultants first, or even to have them perform a <i>few</i> hours of work for free, as a test. But in general work should be paid for. Unless, as I've said elsewhere, it is 100% free-software work.<p>Of course, just because it's unethical doesn't mean it doesn't happen or that you can do anything to change it.",1238788944
