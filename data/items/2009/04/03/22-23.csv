The beauty of paid search traffic is being able to target the RIGHT keywords for the RIGHT customer and the RIGHT time.<p>It is inherently wrong to say paid search traffic converts worse than organic search traffic because different variables will change the outcome (conversion rate). Those variables can be keywords, negative keywords, type of keyword matching, ad copy, time of day, landing page, geography, industry, product. I can change these variables and make the paid traffic convert poorly compared to the organic visitors. I can also tweak these variables and have my paid traffic converting much better than organic traffic!<p>What is my point? The data that you used to draw your conclusion, that organic is better than paid, was simply data from a poorly converting paid search campaign.

So, ultimately the cable companies are in control over distribution of video--including internet video from Hulu and similar sites.<p>Right now I can get all the TV content I want OTA (yes, using an antenna) or over the internet except for HBO. Accordingly, I don't subscribe to cable. But, that will change as soon as my ISP (a cable company) starts capping my internet access. Then I will have to start paying a cable company to get my favorite shows. For example, Time Warner is taking the lead with internet-video-killing caps of 40GB/month. That's less than 15 minutes of HD video a day.<p>So, regarldess of what you think of the cable technology, the cable companies seem to be firmly in control of residential video distribution. Whenever they want, they will crank up the price until cable looks cheap. That is exactly what the wireless phone companies did with text messaging; the price of a text message used to be borderline bearable; now, they are so expensive that $5+ messaging bundles are relatively affordable.",1238798165

545775,comment,545335,545719,0,0,medearis,,,"No -- you didn't say anything about education level, which is tangential to GPA.  What you said is ""judging on the basis of GPA alone is class discrimination. Poor people don't stand a fighting chance.""  In other words, if you're poor, you don't stand a chance of (i.e. are prevented from) being able to achieve a high GPA.  My experience says differently.<p>I've read one of Gladwell's other books, and I think he makes the same mistake you are making.  A correlation does not necessarily imply ""discrimination"" or that the odds can't be overcome.  For instance, women have higher GPAs than men, on average.  That doesn't mean that using GPA as an indicator of performance discriminates against males.  It might mean that males might need to work harder or do something a bit differently in order to get the same GPA.<p>In the end, my admittedly subjective take is that the biggest factor is individual motivation.  We all have our setbacks and obstacles to overcome, but that's just the craps of life.  I can verify, however, that it is indeed possible to go from moving out of your house at 16 with no money to graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford (not me, but someone very close to me).  Difficult, yes... but it shows that there is almost always a ""fighting chance.""",1238798107

You're not in a very strong negotiating position, after all.<p>This illustrates another reason why unpaid internship is pernicious: It doesn't teach <i>anyone</i> how well you add value. Because your time is unmetered and unpaid, you have no incentive to spend it wisely. And your employer certainly has no incentive to track it -- at least not out loud. (Imagine the conversation: ""Wow, last week you worked 10 hours for free and saved the company $100k. Have a muffin!"") What, exactly, is either of you learning? I guess your employer is learning how much value you can be coerced to add, for free, without you noticing or complaining. And you're learning how to look and act like a model employee.<p>Onward.

I don't know that I buy into the assertion of the late Richard Herrnstein that all employers of ALL kinds of workers would do well to screen job candidates by IQ tests, but the law now in the United States is that they can't. Absent a specific validation study for a specific job, employers have to take care about having hiring requirements with ""disparate impact"" by ethnicity. Requiring postsecondary education that is not strictly necessary for the job gets a free pass, legally, but requiring a threshold IQ test, even if the threshold is low, is legally suspect. So now indeed many young people who are barely college-ready have to go to some kind of diploma mill college, often at great personal expense, to maximize their likelihood of getting jobs that don't really even require a college education.",1238797039

That might not be a problem for Erlang given its write-once variables, but it is a problem for other languages.<p>We've been working on generating JVM bytecode for our in-house language, which does support a less-restricted version of closures, and we work around that by wrapping closed variables in one-element arrays, though you have to do for both the initial declaration and on every reference to that variable, even outside the closure, which gets really annoying when the closed variable is something passed onto the stack as a function argument, and probably in other cases I'm not thinking about right now.

That's why you shouldn't outsource an hourly project to someone you don't trust a <i>lot</i>.<p>The federal government (US, though I imagine it's the same everywhere) has forms and standardized time sheets that their contractors fill out, all employees on the job sign their timesheets, and there are big penalties for faking them and getting caught.  But, unless you want to spend hours dealing with the paperwork that your contractor produces, you probably don't want to go down this path.  And, of course, you almost certainly do not have the legal clout of the federal government, and so even if you ""catch"" your contractor in an overage, there's probably not much you can do about it.<p>I generally get per-job quotes (or at least estimates, with a requirement that they get my sign off on more than 10%-20% overage), rather than per-hour.
