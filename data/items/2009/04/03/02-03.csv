I remember a lot of companies at the time pushing cheap low end machines designed around internet access, but none really took off that I can recall.<p>I imagine that the idea might work better now.  For one thing, high speed internet has made web access much more integral to the average user than it was even in 1999.  And of course, even a low end computer is actually powerful enough to provide a good user experience for most people.  In my experience, that wasn't really true of the offerings in the late 90s.",1238727579

544408,comment,543955,544122,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>short an IPO</i><p>Buy put options on the underlying stock.  This gives you the right, but not the obligation, to force a sale of stock at the strike price.<p>Say you have a hot Internet IPO which debuts at $10.  People assume it will follow the Google trajectory and be worth hundreds within a few years.  You can buy puts at $10 for a year from now -- this would entitle you to sell any shares you held at $10, regardless of what the price is.  If a hypothetical counterparty believes that the price is going to increase, writing this option (promising to buy X shares from you at the price of $10 from you a year from now if you ask for it, in return for cash money today) is like printing free money: you'll probably let the option expire without acting on it, and otherwise they get the stock they want anyhow.<p>Now examine what happens if the stock tanks to, say, $2 over the year: your options entitled you to sell X shares at $10 apiece, regardless of the market price of the stock.  You can thus buy the stock on the open market ($2 per share) and exercise the option (selling at $10 per share), netting $8 a share minus commissions minus the premium you paid for the option in the first place.  (In actual practice, since you can SELL the put option and it has high ""intrinsic value"" near expiration in that scenario, you don't actually have to ever become an owner of the underlying stock.)<p>But what if the price balloons to $20?  Clearly, you don't want to buy at $20 and then sell the same day at $10.  That's the beauty of puts, though: you don't have to.  You just walk away from your options, which expire worthless.  You are never at risk, in this strategy, of losing more money than you spent on acquiring the puts in the first place.  This contrasts favorably to the standard short sale, which has unlimited downside risk.",1238726635

544397,comment,543955,544154,0,0,banned_man,,,"Shorting an IPO is actually stupid regardless of volatility.<p>Investment banks tend to underprice IPOs by about 10-15% on average, and intentionally so. This makes allocation a favor, because of the obvious expectancy in being in on one. However, the company ends up being undercapitalized for the amount of equity given up. It's utterly sleazy, but it's business as usual on Wall Street.<p>This also means that if you're not on a bank's favorite clients list, you don't want to be involved with IPOs, because you're only going to be able to get in on the crappy ones.<p>The concept of shorting Facebook is somewhat of a joke, because of that. I'm no fan of Mark Zuckerberg, but I wouldn't actually claim to know better than the market what the company's worth. That said, if there were a way to have shorted some share of the company at $15B when Microsoft bought in, that would have been awesome.",1238726175

Dagny, Rearden, Galt, etc) as real producers, who through their selfishness, were actually acting in the public interest (railroads, steel, etc).
