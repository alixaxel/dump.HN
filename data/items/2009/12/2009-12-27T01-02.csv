1016545,comment,1016519,1016519,0,0,vaksel,,,"it's a good idea, and has some decent traffic #s(i.e. ""sweet home alabama guitar lesson"" 14,800 searches/month) but it seems to be a little bit competitive. Go exact searching for ""sweet home alabama guitar lesson"" and you get 185,000 sites.<p>I think ""sweet home alabama guitar tutorial"" is a much better fit. Only 53,700 hits, and none are really an exact match for the search on page 1(which is probably true for all other searches). And that still gets you 6,600 searches a month.<p>So update your titles to be [SONG TITLE] guitar tutorial.<p>And you should be able to hit some decent traffic numbers with that.",1261878232

1016526,comment,1016355,1016509,0,0,Zev,,,"You misunderstood my second point a bit: By ""an umbrella corporation"", I don't just mean that Al Qaeda is made up of different cells. I mean that each of the cells is united by a group of people higher up. In this case, it primarily means Bin Laden and al-Zarqawi, but there are others (Azzam used to be on this list, for example). These guys still have their own goal - a global Islamic state.<p>bin Laden, al-Zarqawi, etc just view the rest of the groups under the umbrella as different pieces to helping them achieve their goal. That group x wants independence, while group y wants to maintain control (or whatever the case may be) is irrelevant to them. They want all the groups to succeed because if it does, then, thats one more area in the world where Islam rules, one step closer to <i>their</i> end-goal.<p>And <i>that</i> is why Al Qaeda having ties everywhere is such a problem. That Al Qaeda is an umbrella to bring all of these groups together to trade people and/or skillsets among groups is the problem. Not that Al Qaeda will go and blow up some building in some country. Because then, thats two more groups with information that can (potentially) be used in bad ways.",1261876974

1016520,comment,1016282,1016439,0,0,philwelch,,,"The Clinton ""surplus"" was created by raiding the Social Security trust fund. While every administration in the history of Social Security has raided the trust fund, nearly every administration in that period also ran a deficit, so the problem didn't really come up before. The president who continues running a surplus while leaving the trust fund alone (say, in a ""lock box"") would get full credit for running a true surplus. That may have been Gore, had he been elected. Or maybe he would have gone apeshit over 9/11 too and spent us into a deficit again.<p>In any case, the best we can reasonably hope for is kind of a seasonal surplus, where the government runs a surplus during boom times and a deficit during recessions. That might average out to a roughly balanced budget over the course of 10-20 years. What really happens is that in boom times, the government rushes for ways to spend all their new tax revenues, and in recessions, the government looks for ways to run up spending in order to fix the recession.",1261876638

One can argue about why. I tend to believe it's because we're still early in the history of the software: the closest analogy we have is the Industrial Revolution, and Ford and Taylor don't appear until well over a century into that.<p>The other side of the coin, of course, is that an irrational market represents major opportunity for anyone who figures out how to exploit it. So we all should stop complaining and start exploiting. Hopefully the hacker renaissance and startup wave of the last few years are the start of such a process, but it's too early to know for sure.",1261875988
