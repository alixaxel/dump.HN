Sure we have brilliant people who could do good by going faster, but with the advent of the internet and libraries, there's not much stopping them. Let's not forget about the majority of regular people who aren't getting a good value from the school system.<p>I would argue that most high school students find their studies meaningless, but not because they are bored by the triviality. They think it's meaningless because they don't comprehend the practicality of it all. They get stuff just to get it done, to avoid getting spanked for bad grades, or to satisfy their ego. So our school system shoves these topics down the students, with the hope that shoving hard enough and enough times will do the trick. But from personal experience, I've found that when I revisit something that I once learned, I usually look it up in reference either from the internet or from a book. The interesting difference is that this time, when I truly <i>comprehend</i> the importance or relevance of it all, I learn it in much less time.<p>Teaching kids what they aren't ready to learn yet is inefficient. Standardized pace, rigid curriculum impede students from learning what they want, and at their own pace (which will probably always be faster than the standard pace if the student is interested).<p>This problem extends into university education. I think all students should learn like that, at their own pace, and take some evaluation, not necessarily a test (I have ADHD, so I'm biased against tests), at the end. Then we can have quantifiable knowledge without forcing students to go through a rigid curriculum at a set pace. This hopefully would also mean no more banking on getting into good universities, rejections, and entrance exams determining education worthiness. Education would truly be open and accessible to all.",1259737198

971666,comment,971596,971596,0,0,ramanujan,,,"Here's what I don't get about this: the physical\nswipe is already obsolete.<p>You can just type in a credit card number, address, CCV, and expiration date <i>once</i> into say the Apple Store and then buy stuff from them with one click from that point on. The same is true for Amazon and Paypal and lots of other cos. And you can do it on your iPhone today.<p>So there is no reason why you can't just have a Paypal app\non your iPhone which has two fields: email of the person you want to pay and amount to send. Type that in and everything is done on the server. No hardware dongle or physical proximity needed, you can deploy everything in software.<p>Starbucks or the like could have a simple mobile web site ordering interface. Maybe use some geolocation to determine when you're in a store, but otherwise use their existing\ncorp website and ecommerce backend.<p>Some might argue that the dongle gives more security -- but it's weird that you would want MORE transactional security (physical card swipe) when you can see the person than when they are ordering over the web.<p>that said...I guess this might have some advantages for\npeople <i>receiving</i> payments, as a swipe is quicker than getting your customers to input their info. Also might be faster for payers who buy a lot of stuff online from different merchants and don't save their cc info with them. I guess one would have to know how cheap mobile credit card swipers are today.",1259737009

When you want to make a phone call, you can just open up your laptop and fire up Skype!<p>If that sounds like a really cumbersome and painful user experience for many situations in which you currently use your cell phone, people who read really really religiously feel the same way about using a laptop or smartphone instead of a Kindle (or printed media).<p>The Kindle is and will continue to be a more niche product than laptops or phones. Not many people are serious readers.  But for those who are, the user experience on a laptop, netbook, or smartphone can't compare, mostly because of form factor an eyestrain.<p>That's why I think only a tablet represents a serious threat to disrupt Kindle. Whether it's the mythical Apple tablet or the CrunchPad (RIP) or some other device that is actually built, if they manage to make a device that performs well in brightly-lit conditions, they can probably replace Kindle.<p>I suspect that in the next decade the average consumer will have three devices: One in a laptop form factor (with most having cheap netbooks running Chrome or another thin-client OS, and some power users having more traditional laptops), a phone, and a tablet or kindle-type device.   The tablet or Kindle is ideal for reading and consuming media, the phone perfect for making calls, and the physical keyboard of the laptop necessary to get real work done.<p>Perhaps you could see some combinations, like a tablet that attaches to or connects wirelessly to a keyboard which eliminates the need for the laptop, or the phone just becoming a wireless headset interfacing with one of the other devices (maybe my opening question wasn't so implausible after all!).  Frankly those combinations all sound pretty cumbersome and inelegant, so as long as all three devices are cheap and compact, having all three won't be a big deal.",1259735859

There's no way the lunch-and-how's-it-going process is going to scale to hundreds of customers.  My cofounder and I have sat down and basically have determined that we need to find someone with serious people skills who can go out and talk to potential customers, aggregate feedback, and give us some pulse on how to move forward.
