If you need to relocate or access equity quickly, you're stuck with an remarkable property but buyers looking for McMansions.  Buyers that do drop by out of curiosity comment with gems such as, ""We could never live here, the master bath needs to be as big as the bedroom.""<p>Seems as though the only way to move such a property is to offer it so far below market that people become willing to compromise and consider the more livable home instead of yet another generic ""keeping up with the Joneses"" colonial:<p><a href=""http://images.google.com/images?q=colonial%20house"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/images?q=colonial%20house</a> (exteriors)<p>It's galling, because such easily substitutable boxes have little intrinsic value beyond market.  The cost to build a colonial is quite low compared to the cost of building, for example, ""... varying ceiling heights between large and small rooms to create different degrees of intimacy.""<p>One eye-line in my home reveals 8 ceiling heights, correlating to the intimacy of the spaces below them.  It's extraordinary, but generic buyers want five bedrooms with full baths so what should be livable spaces end up the size of closets.<p>What's worse, when buyers today see the prices of McMansions plunging, they expect to see the price of a well patterned home (that may have cost 5x - 8x as much to build) also plunge, despite the more complex home already having a replacement cost higher than its asking price, price of materials and labor having risen.<p>(PS. Serious inquiries welcome for a well patterned home a commuter train ride from Manhattan.)",1259779907

If the startup and the founders are solid, and if there is a clear (and most importantly, fast) visa path like the one proposed, I don't think most investors would have a problem.  If anything, $250,000 is way too low for a VC, so you might have to find an angel investor instead.  Some countries would have an advantage over others, of course, but I don't think it's a showstopper - my first startup, based in Canada, received an offer for funding which would've put us over this threshold.<p><i>Even if the non-US startup will move to the US once they receive funding, the largely intangible advantages bestowed on a startup in the Valley (which I've witnessed in the month that I've lived here) give it a better chance.</i><p>Can you elaborate?  What is the difference, once both startups are in the Valley, and assuming there are no language issues?

You must first decide if you want to ride again. In another words, you must first make a binary decision, which is whether or not you want to try again. If you believe that being a successful entrepreneur is in your destiny, then there is no point of crying in the dirt (or even writing a post-mortem). But on the other hand, if you believe that you have had enough and don’t want to be an entrepreneur again, then you can do whatever you want and heck with what other people think.

Of course there are cases where list comprehensions are more convenient and more powerful (esp. if they are more like their ""real"" counterparts in Haskell and friends).

List comprehensions, on the other hand, are more like procedure code (conceptually), and it sucks to nest them. Nesting aside, it's the different level of abstraction that matters for FP-ers.<p>Plus, you get 5 mentions (3 y's and 2 x's) of some intermediate variables instead of 0 in your code, so both token-wise and char-wise, map/filter alternative is shorter, and less a mental burden (think about the ""succinct"" idea by PG).",1259777151
