They inevitably attempt to rationalize away our beliefs in an attempt to justify their own and in so doing, seem to make all sorts of assumptions of what believers (of all sorts) actually believe. This essay is no exception.<p>For example: The author says that people who believe in a here-after should be more willing to take risks (many are) but he doesn't take into account that many faiths consider unnecessary risks to be sinful in the same way that suicide is sinful, just to a much lesser degree. Also, regardless of what you believe about the after-life, death still signals the end of this one, which everyone is attached to in some way or another.<p>It's similar with lost loved-ones.

I agree with these ideas, the whole point of a large open economy (and one that is compounded by the internet) is that there's a market for everything and if you're really good at what you do then you'll get by. The point of meritocracy is to reward excellence.<p>And, you know, this lady excels in the field of <i>native american studies</i>. That might seem frivolous and useless to other people, but suppose we pursue your thought to its logical conclusion and let that field die off because the economic benefits are not clearly quantifiable.
