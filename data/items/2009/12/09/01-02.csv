985094,comment,984691,984991,0,0,using_ec2,,,"I think that you are missing the value of the opposite proposition - that you are able to turn it off and stop paying.  This is an obvious value to someone who needs to be able to scale sideways, but having essentially no cost for provisioning and de-provisioning allows you to do things for development, testing and operations you cannot do without great expense outside of it.  I worked at a number of banks 10 years ago and we can get the same functionality now for a few bucks that we did then by buying far too many spare E3500s.<p>We have a decent sized EC2 architecture right now and EBS snapshotting + provisioning on demand means that we can get all of the benefits of multiply redundant hardware at a fraction of the cost.<p>- We never need to upgrade software in place.  Software gets freshly installed on a new cluster that duplicates our existing cluster and gets a increasing portion of traffic.  Failover is as simple as a proxy cutover.  The freedom to do config changes or 3rd party software upgrades and be able to  just swap instances in and out enables us to experiment often and safely with production changes.<p>- Slave gets corrupted or falls out of sync with the master?  A machine suffers a degraded disk?  Bad net interface?  Don't fix, replace.<p>- We can spin up an entire test stack that precisely mirrors our prod stack to stress test with significant cash outlay.  Since this cost is low, we can stress test often and test the effect of s/w and config changes on performance easily.  Stress tests the H/W outlays associated with them are traditionally hugely expensive if you want to test exactly like you run.<p>- Significant database migrations can take place on a slave that is easily promoted, snapshotted and cloned without having to deal with any long term ping ponging between instances.<p>- Copies of databases can be instantly provisioned and destroyed for data analysis needs.  If analysis needs peak at 5x in a week, no one has to wait.  Run 5 copies and shut them all off when you're done.<p>These are just a few quick things that we do with regularity.  And I'm sure there are lots more opportunities to exploit these capabilities than we are thinking of.<p>Also - in terms of cost - don't forget to compare against reserved instance pricing.",1260323327

985092,story,,,4,4,gfodor,"Ask HN: Lala Land Grab?",,"I just had a thought. Apple bought Lala, and I've spent probably about $50-$100 on Lala for music. This is a pretty big music library since albums are so cheap. I've gotten in the flow of listening to Lala every day and I'm always adding more music. I love it.<p>Now, the speculation is that Apple is going to turn Lala into a streaming iTunes product. Knowing Apple's iTunes price points, I'm <i>very</i> skeptical that they will keep the prices where they are on Lala. With the inevitable iPhone app, Apple is surely going to position the iTunes streaming service as just as good, if not better than buying the music as it is now. To see them then offer a 10x price cut over buying the track in full would just cannibalize the iTunes store.<p>It seems clear Apple will be stuck grandfathering in everyone's Lala collection, otherwise they'll alienate all current Lala users from iTunes (myself included.) Nevermind the horrible press they'd get if suddenly hundreds of thousands of dollars of music is ripped from the hands of Lala users. But, they are going to almost certainly have higher prices for future purchases than Lala has now.<p>My conclusion: it might be time to buy as much cheap Lala music as you can until they can launch the iTunes streaming service. Worst case, you're out $100 or whatever you want to blow. (If its any consolation, if you lose this money because Apple screws everyone over, Apple will probably go down with you!) Best case, you end up with a nice music library you can listen to anywhere that will go up in value tenfold in a few weeks.<p>Also, if you haven't uploaded your music collection to Lala, you should probably do it now. I'd be shocked if Apple grandfathers in uploaded tracks too, but who knows!",1260323224

You can get 3-4x cheaper per megabit going dedicated.</i><p>Yes. But that does not normally matter. Bandwidth has become ridiculously cheap either way; a terabyte sets you back a measly hundred bucks on amazon. And if you're pushing more than a few dozen of them then most of it is very likely going over a CDN (or a set of separate dedicated servers) anyways.<p>Remember sites pushing 2-digit terabytes of dynamic html are very rare. And everything else can be trivially offloaded (e.g. to one of the isp's you advocate).<p><i>Servers are crazy expensive. Compare the most powerful machine they have vs something on 10tb / gigenet / theplanet for the price. You will definitely end up with a more powerful machine for half the price on either.</i><p>Well, I did and came back underwhelmed - as usual.\nYes, you can go cheaper for a comparable spec, sometimes as much as 50 bucks. But again - that only matters when you're a small shop with 1-3 servers, looking to cut the penny.<p>Once your business grows out of that the hosting fees turn into a rounding error either way, and the advantages EC2 offers are nothing to sneeze at (ever looked what an solution equal to EBS costs elsewhere?).<p><i>Its no more difficult to setup a normal dedicated server than it is a EC2 box.</i><p>That's a red herring. Provisioning is automated in any reasonable sized deployment and you face the exact same problems with dedicated hardware that you have with amazon. Plus the hassles of having to babysit said hardware...<p>There is exactly one argument against amazon today and that is when you need hosts with lots of memory. RAM is expensive in the cloud, for obvious reasons - to a degree where stuffing your own hardware with 64G starts to look like a bargain. But the thing about this argument is: Very few applications really need that amount of RAM in a single box.

Major points I've picked up so far:<p>* the contribution of IQ to success maxes out at around 120; beyond that, IQ points don't matter much, because you're smart enough to get by.<p>* What Robert Sternberg nicknames ""practical intelligence"" (<a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/practicalintelligence.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/practicalintelligence.shtml</a>) is extremely important to overall success. Affluent and middle-class parents tend to be much better at passing this sort of intelligence along to their kids than lower-income ones.<p>* Seemingly irrelevant details like birthdate play a major role too. He shows how the day you were born has >10% contribution to academic success, because if you don't make the cutoff date for going to school, you'll be one of the older, and thus more mentally mature individuals in your class. Consequently, these individuals are more likely to be selected for gifted programs. And because of the academic grooming, they end up being more likely to go to college. He also shows how, for example, professional Canadian hockey players are almost never born in the later months of the year for similar reasons; if you don't make the cutoff date, you'll be one of the older players on your team, and scouts will confuse your increased maturity for inborn talent and you'll move up the ranks and get better training as a result.<p>It's a somewhat disturbing book because it shows how success isn't a direct function of an individual's aptitude. But I think it's also important, because, by observing these factors, you can hack your way into success even if the factors are going against you.",1260320923

Blockbuster/Redbox is a good example. I can replace a 5000 sq ft store and 10 employees with a kiosk that takes up a few sq ft. Selection might not be as good, but it's good enough for most people.<p>Or take your typical restaurant. There's almost no reason that 95% of the waitstaff couldn't be replaced by ordering kiosks at each table. It would reduce errors and reduce costs. Or what about convenience stores? Figure out which items make up 90% of your sales, put them in an automated kiosk and put one on every street corner. You're now selling almost as much (or maybe even more) with dramatically lower costs.<p>I think it's a good thing overall, but there will definitely be some big losers economically from such a dramatic shift.",1260320776

This is where the average Joe Schmoe sends their paycheck.<p>Yes there are multiple agent principle conflicts associated with securities, but that is ok, because people that invest with securities should be able to know, understand and value the risks. This is not true of the average plumber, electrician or waiter. You cannot expect them to understand the complexities of international finance and all the byzantine securities banks sell and buy just to be able to judge whether an individual bank is safe to deposit your pay check in.<p>Thus, we can either have a system where some regulation exists that ensures that depositor's money is safe or we can say buyer beware, which means that after being burned a couple of times the average person will simply not trust and not use the banking system. This is actually what happened after the crash of 1929 and before Glass Steagall was passed and the FDIC was set up.<p>We know from that period that if ordinary people do not use the banking system, enormous amounts of capital are simply not put to work (i.e., they are stowed away under matresses, etc.) and the economy contracts greatly.<p>So that we have discovered that it is generally beneficial for the government to insure the bank deposits of ordinary people up to a certain amount. This is something that happens in pretty much every modern industrialized nation nowadays.<p>Now it is obvious that if the government is to insure certain banks, it should take steps to make sure that these banks are safe, and that is what the requirements of Glass Steagall are all about. Of course Glass Steagall allows for banks that do not take deposits (i.e., investment banks) to invest in as much securities as they want and to generally to engage in much riskier behaviour.",1260320471
