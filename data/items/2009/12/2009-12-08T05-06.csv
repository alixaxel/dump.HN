983152,comment,981597,982713,0,0,jmatt,,,"Ya thanks for linking the thread.<p>EvilTrout - Just to verify your previous statements - I remember when I took networks in the 90s my professor told us UDP was the way to go if reliability wasn't a requirement and performance was important. (less overhead, and of course better latency, etc.) That was the how Everquest successfully implemented it. Many of the EQ players were using 9600 baud dial-up and were very happy with network performance when it first came out. Not to say they didn't have problems at the beginning. But they have long had an awesome hybrid (UDP/TCP) solution that's been tested for a decade.<p>It's interesting that we've hit a turning point with WoW. I can only imagine how much more pleasant it must be to code using TCP instead of a custom UDP protocol. It also may explain some of the odd network behavior that was ""solved"" circa 2002 in Everquest but occasionally happens in WoW today.",1260251979

If it is prime, then P is a prime that was not in our list.  If P is not prime, then it is divisible by some prime, call it p.

However, it looks like they are powering the device with a separate AC supply.  Connecting one AC supply to another -- synchronizing voltage, frequency, and phase -- turns out to be difficult.<p>The most practical method of doing so is by first converting to DC before converting back to AC.  In fact, the interconnects that link the regional power grids in the US are high-voltage DC, because, among other reasons, that allows the grids to be unsynchronized.<p>The advantage of the simple sensor-and-switch approach is that one need not worry about synchronizing the replacement AC source with the original AC source.

If I work 60 hours a week and am highly motivated I can get a shitload done, but if I crank it up to 70, 80, 90, I start seeing diminishing returns no matter how motivated I am.  Maybe this is different on the business side where you spend more time on soft activities that don't require full-on brainpower for 6 hour stretches at a time.<p>Time off leads to renewed energy and fresh ideas.  It also keeps me more in touch with normal people, which is invaluable when trying to build a <i>product</i> where intuition of customer behavior is the biggest shortcut to success.",1260248520
