Depending on how they're effected, what margins do is perhaps make the page more attractive for those running their browser at fullscreen, while screwing over everyone doing the appropriate thing, which is to keep the window opened at the user's desired size for reading. This is because they are either implemented as a) a centered, fixed-width column that invokes horizontal scroll bars for those whose preferred size is smaller than required by the layout (usually no less than 850 pixels these days), or b) fixed margins so that, e.g., a 640 pixel wide viewport on a page with 200+ pixel margins reduces the effective column width to less than 250 pixels.<p>As for pretension, I agree, although it doesn't originate from the likes of Crockford, but instead those uncompromising fucks who find their ""artistic vision"" for a website to be of greater importance than their employers' content.",1260769951

993687,comment,993253,993253,0,0,Arun2009,,,"Haven't you ever had wordless thoughts?<p>I often find that wordless thoughts are much more efficient to work with mentally than wordy ones. When you need to communicate, or the thought is intricate or important enough to require a deliberate fleshing out, THEN you write.<p>Here's an example of a wordless thought: you see a figure that is almost symmetrical and you consider why it isn't exactly symmetrical. It's possible to do this consideration without wording your thought - the reason for asymmetry exists in a wordless form in your mind.<p>Here's another: you're sitting and you suddenly want to pee. You just get up, go to the bathroom, and pee. The idea of peeing is definitely in your mind when you go to the bathroom - it's rarely explicitly worded out.<p>Yet another: when you're doing minor re-factoring to your code, much of your thoughts are actually wordless.<p>I'll appropriate a term from psychology for the process of converting wordless thoughts to wordy ones: focusing (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing</a>). Wordless thoughts are basically purely experiential in nature. Wordy ones are deliberate, analytical, and well, wordy. Focusing is the process of converting the former to the latter. You hold the wordless thought in your mind's eye and deliberately covert it into a verbal form.<p>I am of the opinion that much of philosophy is simply converting wordless thoughts to wordy ones - just as artists are experts in drawing what they see, philosophers are experts in focusing.<p>My yet another hunch is that experts often think wordlessly about matters their field. It's just too inefficient to word out every thought process.",1260769083

Or make a subcritical blanket of U-238 and some of the longer-lived radioactive elements in spent fuel rods, and put them around a fusion reactor. The fusion reactor doesn't have to generate a net positive amount of usable energy; it just has to provide a lot of neutrons, which it does. This is the basis for fusion-fission hybrid systems, which can be marketed as nuclear-waste annihilation systems.",1260768998

993684,comment,992889,993040,0,0,sketerpot,,,"In the case of liquid fluoride thorium reactors, I don't think the xenon-135 is what you need to be worrying about; worry about the fluorine gas instead! It's very reactive. Xenon, on the other hand, is <i>chemically stable</i> because it's a noble gas. And it's larger than helium, so it's easier to contain.<p>Also, I'd like to point out that pebble-bed reactors, while usually cooled with helium, could also be cooled with nitrogen that we just pull out of the air. It's more reactive than helium and it forms carbon-14 when you expose it to neutron flux, but those issues are both fairly minor. I think they're going with helium now because they want to get something working as quickly as they can, and they don't want to go mucking with what works.",1260768855

993678,comment,992889,993553,0,0,sketerpot,,,"In the case of TMI, the steam formation <i>did</i> slow down the reaction -- just not enough to prevent damage to the fuel rods. Of course, the reactor's pressure vessel acted as a passive heat sink once the fuel melted and easily prevented the fuel from escaping, but it was still costly and scary, and the response of the operators at the time can only be called a ridiculous clusterfuck.<p>This sort of thing is why I really like pebble bed reactors: you can just shut off the coolant and walk away, and they'll sit tight. (The operators of China's HTR-10 research reactor actually do this.) Everything is designed to withstand the maximum temperatures they could possibly achieve. Light water reactors have an impressive safety record, and the modern versions aren't susceptible to the problems that led to TMI, but inherently self-moderating reactors are just really aesthetically pleasant.",1260768467

Twitter is a more suitable option for these people because it doesn't require any genuine social interaction.
