For example, just within the past year, I was asked to help find a good auditing firm by one closely held Silicon Valley startup with fewer than 50 employees and a few million in annual revenues - the cheapest estimate came in at the $60K-$80K range (and this was from regional firms, not Big Four).<p>Don't know exactly why this is, except that the auditors themselves kept referring to Sarbox-type requirements that had become standard practice for all audits, public and private. Also, I think many of the smaller players have been chased out of the auditing field by the new complexities injected by Sarbox and relating recent developments in the field. Whatever the cause, at least in and around Silicon Valley, it is no longer easy to find a small firm that will do a quickie audit for a modest sum.<p>[Edit: just saw reply by tptacek - he says it much better than I do.]",1261425396

I believe he attributed much of that to flexibility in the markets, which is probably related to the liquidity and efficiency that are provided by, for example, high-volume traders. Greenspan argues for deregulation of such activities since they make the markets so much more flexible, and able to withstand sudden shocks such as 9/11.<p>Of course, much of that was before the fall '08 crisis, so I don't know how he'd respond to that :)",1261425317

1008453,comment,1008410,1008410,0,0,lionhearted,,,"When I learned of Nash Equilibriums, it changed the way I saw a variety of fields - government, business, advertising, and so on.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium</a><p>> In game theory, Nash equilibrium (named after John Forbes Nash, who proposed it) is a solution concept of a game involving two or more players, in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his or her own strategy unilaterally.<p>It's fascinating stuff. Nash equilibriums are regarded as ""stable"" - no one will change what they do. Things tend to trend towards Nash Equilibriums and settle there until there's new technology.<p>Government legislation, including higher taxes, frequently breaks equilibrium. The new best solution for large players might be to divert earnings or leave the area they were doing business. Frequently, this results in the legislators getting angry and legislating more solutions.<p>One that immediately springs to mind is North Carolina and Amazon. North Carolina legislators were annoyed that Amazon customers in NC didn't pay sales tax because Amazon didn't have a presence there. They passed a law that made it so Amazon having affiliates there would count as them having a business presence, so Amazon would have to start charging their NC customers sales tax and remitting it to the NC government.<p>Amazon responded by canceling NC affiliates. This was the start of that email:<p>> We regret to inform you that the North Carolina state legislature (the General Assembly) appears ready to enact an unconstitutional tax collection scheme that would leave Amazon.com little choice but to end its relationships with North Carolina-based Associates. You are receiving this e-mail because our records indicate that you are an Amazon Associate and resident of North Carolina.<p>Now, that obviously wasn't an NC legislator's intention. But it turned out to be the new stable best solution for Amazon. They must've done some math and decided that not charging sales tax in NC is important than letting affiliates with a NC address continue to participate in earning referral fees.<p>Too often legislators think people will accept their legislation and things will go according to their planned scenario. They don't stop and think, ""How does this change people's incentives? What nasty secondary effects could come from this?"" When the nasty secondary effects come, they either try to shame the organization in line (which doesn't usually work), or they pass even harsher legislation. You can see where this leads - it's not pleasant. Disrupt Nash equilibriums if you must, but do it with your eyes open that there could be some really nasty secondary effects to the process.",1261424863

This completely breaks the buffering model inherent in modern video compression systems and basically only works properly at all if the users' connection is far higher than the bitrate of the video.<p>Until HTML5 has basic feature parity with Flash's video capabilities, it will probably not be used very widely.  This is of course ignoring the fact that Firefox doesn't support a video format that anyone actually uses, and the fact that IE (still unfortunately the most popular browser) doesn't support anything at all.<p>The sad reality is that a single system often has the advantage over a group of conflicting, incompatible systems; even if the single system is bad, one at least only has to compensate for its weaknesses, and not for everything else's.",1261424787

If you like Javascript, you could get into Processing, and achieve the same effect by sweeping a windowed fast-fourier transform across your audio sample (or doing a reverse FFT on vertical strips of an image). The weird digital quality of the sounds generated by a tool like this stem from harmonic juxtapositions that do not exist in nature (see below).<p>b) the big problem with this and all other spectrogram tools I've used over the years if that they treat the audible frequency spectrum as a flat geometrical (edit: cartesian, sorry) space. So if you look at a spectrogram of a sine wave, you'll see a single horizontal line; if you examine a saw wave (which includes all harmonics) you'll see a group of horizontal lines of decreasing intensity from bottom to top.<p>So far so good, because we can learn a lot from that, but an FFT/Spectrogram obscures the concept of pitch. For example, in conventional western tuning a 440 Hz tone is the note A, while tones of 220 or 880 Hz are the same note played an octave lower and higher, respectively. Our brains are 'wired' to pay particular attention to powers of 2; not just in pure tones, but even in distorted ones. People generally express a liking for the sound of second-harmonic distortion (at double the fundamental, the typical electric guitar sound) while exhibiting an intense dislike for third-harmonic distortion (bad transistor radio). My point here is that the sound spectrum, unlike that of light, encompasses multiple octaves and psychoacoustic research provides strong evidence for the idea that the brain evaluates sounds with multiple frequency components around a pitch spiral rather than a 2d cartesian space...but although we have the required computer power, there has been little progress in the development of tools to represent and manipulate sound this way. It's hard to find any kind of real-time tools that map the results of an FFT onto a polar coordinate system.<p>EDIT: there's some information about construction of the polar FFT here, but it's regrettably beyond my capacity to implement at present: <a href=""http://www.math.umn.edu/~focm/c_/Elad.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.umn.edu/~focm/c_/Elad.pdf</a>",1261423938

Hell, the rocket itself is asymmetrical and <i>rocks</i> back and forth before liftoff.<p>Contrast all this with the Soyuz and our very own Saturn V designs.
