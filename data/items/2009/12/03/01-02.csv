If the intent of the home backup law was to allow copying of any video/dvd at home, and the intent of the drm law was to stop any copying of videos/dvds, then it really depends what exactly the laws are, and whether a court case about intent can lead to those laws being changed/clarified.<p>Unfortunately we only have uninformed guesses, so I say wait on it for 3 months and see if the guy gets his day in court.
