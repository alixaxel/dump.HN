If you live in SF, for instance, Zipcar is most likely the cheapest way to rent a car to go to Tahoe.  On a trip last year my (Zip)car beat the other car by about $20 after all was said and done.  So the $75/day can be misleading at times.<p>Also, unrelated, Zipcar allows members who are under 25, which makes it much more expensive to rent a car from a traditional place like Enterprise.

And that's where the companies differ in their model. Zipcar is about $75/day, where most rental cars are significantly less than that. But you cant rent them by the hour. And Zipcar wont come pick you up. And Zipcar charges a membership fee.<p>There is a place for both of these companies in the market, so a comparison like this is kind of like comparing chartered flights to Southwest.

I always figured it'd land in the $500 range, and this isn't too far off.<p>The real carrot for me was the idea of a prepaid $29/mo data only plan, which I actually thought was believable.  T-Mobile already offers pretty much the exact same plan ($1/day) for prepaid Sidekick users (voice is 0.15/min.)  I barely use voice (~100 minutes/mo), and if I could drop my unlimited text/internet/450 voice plan for something that was only $29, I could definitely learn to live with the quirks of VOIP on a mobile handset and the loss of MMS.<p>Honestly, even if you threw me in a contract to get the phone at $199, as long as data was that cheap I'd gladly sign up for two years the same minute I was sending Verizon their $350 good-bye letter.<p>I don't use my phone as a phone and am sick of having to pay so much for minutes I just don't use.  The cost of my voice plan before data and text is around $40/mo, which works out to me paying .40/minute for what I use.

This results in the worker paying higher Federal taxes and (often) more Social Security taxes than the equivalent worker in another state (both of which drastically outweigh the amount paid in state taxes -- state and municipal taxes cover most of the ways that people interact with government).<p>All of these are somewhat tangential points...

Californians however at an individual level are subject to the same federal tax rules as people in other states (and if they were poorer I'm sure the pendulum would swing the other way).<p>This being the case, it is even more remarkable the financial straits that California finds itself in.  It has some of the biggest advantages geographically and started with and still generally has a wealthy and high income tax base.<p>The state of California also chooses to tax well above that of other states - stats here: <a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/15.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/15.html</a> - and still manages to run a massive deficit.",1262145746
