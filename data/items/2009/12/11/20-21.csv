990439,comment,989539,989539,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"OK. IANAL, but here's my opinion anyway, having read the suit and exhibits as filed:<p>FG had $500k in debt by end of June. To whom? We don't know. Chandra would have liked to sell FG to CP [crunchpad] and then pay off that debt in a subsequent round of capital-raising. Arrington and fellow investors did not want to buy a company with half a million in outstanding debt.<p>Another option was for TC to buy FG at a valuation of $3m and pay off the debt at the same time by converting it to equity, which was also undesirable since it would have diluted shareholding by 16%. We may infer that with 35% of CP shares going to FG and a further 16% converted from debt to equity, the upshot would have been that Arrington's investors would have only had a 49% stake, with the other 51% being held by FG's investors and creditors, obviously giving them control of the company.<p>So TC's offer was for FG to pay off its debt completely, in rturn for which its investors would get 35% of CP shares. Chandra indicated this was acceptable, but was unhappy about it as it would have meant giving up all of his personal equity in FG and $75,000 in cash (in order to satisfy FG creditors) and his only holding would be an option to acquire 11% of CP in a future round.<p>Chandra asked for a better deal but indicated that this option was acceptable to him if it was the only way. It is unclear from the emails (which are confusingly presented in reverse chronological order) what position, if any Arrington & co. took in response to this offer. Since TC did not go ahead and buy FG, we may infer that the matter was placed on hiatus. I guess but do not assume that this was pending on FG's satisfaction of its creditors and getting back to a clean balance sheet.<p>By November, the awesomely-named Bruce Lee and his 2 co-investors considered FG to be worth $10m in its own right and valued TC's contribution at 10% of that for the Crunchpad name and Arrington's marketing effort, with Lee noting that Chandra had commended an offer of 25% of the shares in CP as payment for FG. It's unclear whether Arrington lowered the equity offer in exchange for taking on the debt, or whether the ~28% discount to the earlier offer represented Chandra's personal equity in FG; I suspect the former, suggesting that that CP planned to put down $2.5m in cash and absorb any outstanding debt in exchange for 75% of the equity, which would be fairly consistent with the negotiations in June.<p>Whew. So the upshot here is that Dr Lee is basically saying that he disbelieves Arrington/Crunchpad has brought $5m worth of product development and marketing clout to the table, but instead values their contribution at $1m (out of $10m cash that he and fellow investors are willing to put on the table). Additionally, he seems to feel like he is being hustled, considering the lack of a formal offer letter for the merger.<p>Seems to me that Dr Lee has decided to see the color of Arrington's money by raising the cash stakes considerably; suddenly Fusion Garage [in the sense of its largest shareholder] is offering to gobble up Crunchpad and pay Arrington off with a job rather than the other way round. Arrington's blogged thoughts refer to FG's poor financial position, but gloss over the fact that its investors have $10m on hand (which appears to be about 4x what Arrington had lined up).<p>The plaintiffs seem to argue that Fusion Garage is only alive because of the good will invested by Arrington/Crunchpad and would have died otherwise; I presume the defendant's argument will be that this was never the case, that FG had entered into the project in a spirit of partnership rather than supplication, and that any monies advanced by Crunchpad to FG's creditors were a matter of mutual convenience. The case seems to turn on the degree of innovation provided to the project by Arrington/CP: and looking at some of their claims, they seem pretty thin (eg suggesting web pages are bettered rendered against white background, or the use of large icons to select favorite sites, both of which the defendant will claim to be obvious prior art).<p>Prediction: it won't go to trial, Fusion Garage will settle with Arrington for $1.5-2.5m and both sides will declare victory. Arrington will keep the name and claim moral high ground and return something to his investors, FG will end up free of encumbrances and with a commitment of future silence from TechCrunch about the company and its products.",1260564726
990438,comment,990326,990326,0,0,nroach,,,"""Ideas kept under lock and key are much less useful than those that are freely available.""<p>That's precisely the point of the patent system.  It is supposed to encourage disclosure so that after the protected period the knowledge is made fully available to society.<p>The alternative is trade secret protection whereby inventors remain secretive about their work product, never disclosing to the public at large how the device works and not allowing follow-ons to build upon their knowledge.<p>The two problems with the current system are 1) protection terms are too long and 2) the enablement requirements aren't enforced well enough.<p>Let's say that the protection term is reduced to one year.  And assume that the USPTO requires patents with sufficient detail to fully enable readers to replicate and practice the invention.<p>Under that scenario, I think that the patent system would be seen as an asset to society.  In exchange for a year's worth of protection the inventor has to tell society explicitly how to do exactly what he or she is doing.  I don't think most people would have a problem with that system.<p>If you go back to the Constitutional basis for the patent system, it was ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""<p>As long as ""limited time"" is a reasonable period, I don't know that abolition is required.",1260564684

Nobody knew what it was, then it happened, then it went away again and everyone was fine.<p>With technology that's largely not the case. What appear to be fads end up being evolutionary dead ends. [Possible HN heresy ahead] I'd put LISP business applicaiton development into this category. Prior to the AI craze, systems were developed in low level programming languages or mainframe business languages. Then LISP happened, but when the AI winter happened, did people go back to C/ASM/{the IBM languages}? No! C++, and later Java happened. For business Java will eventually superseded, but it's foolhardy to think people will regress to the languages of yesteryear -- time is marching forward.<p>Being too stodgy or unwilling to invest in maintaining the business applications in current mainstream languages can put you in a precarious support situation in a relatively short (say a decade) time when people that are willing to do work in your system language are very expensive and no longer the best people in the industry.<p>Obviously it's important to see through technology fads but starting from a position of skepticism may not play as well as it seems at first blush.",1260564219

990416,comment,989007,989417,0,0,samlittlewood,,,"In some ways WebGL is much less than VRML - WebGL is a set javascript bindings for OpenGL ES2.0. The great thing about OpenGL is that there has been considerable effort over teh years to only introduce concepts that have been found necessary for communicating with graphics hardware. Further, the ES2.0 subset removes a lot of historical cruft. The result is tha the API is pretty much concerted with shipping textures and data streams for the GPU, and managing the shaders to operate on them.<p>VRML brings a scene graph API, file formats, materials - and does not let you at the GPU. You wind up having to shoehorn your design into this fantasy view of how 3D graphics programs should be written. As soon as you stray away from the very limited design, you wind up implementing your own system, exporting it into the VRML data structures, ony for it to then extract it back out for stuffing into the GPU.<p>Having myself inflicted 3D scenegraph API's on other programmers, and felt at first hand the pain and horror, I would never endorse that as the lowest level of access to the graphics hardware.",1260564109

990351,comment,989506,989506,0,0,chubbard,,,"So I found this article very much with the way I see banks and financial systems.  Being that I never worked on financial IT system this was just my hunch.  But, hearing accounts of what was going on it sounded like people were making decisions on very little data, or that the data wasn't available to them.  When the crisis hit I kept thinking over and over that this could all have been avoided if things were more transparent.  The SEC is at best over burdened and probably more likely gamed.  The oversight we have doesn't work, and every time we talk about reform bankers moan and complain you'll ruin everything.    I call bullshit.<p>Given the proper financial data anyone could evaluate the risk of a company.  It's not rocket science.  It's all a bunch of electronic data.  We need to rethink regulation.  We need to transitions from auditors, committees and the SEC to financial transparency.  We should be able to see every trade, every position, every loan, CDOs, and derivatives a company owns, trades, etc.  Everything can be tracked and examined because it's just a bunch of electrons.  If this sort of system existed it would be virtually free to conduct an audit, or monitor for manipulation.  It benefits both the CEO and SEC.  CEO's have better insight into what's going on inside their companies, and the SEC can make sure they aren't manipulating markets or doing risky things at any moment.  Instead of sending out a fleet of auditors, relying on Sarbox, etc.<p>There's no excuse for bad loans being made.  I kept hearing of loan evaluators being told to pass bad loans just because Wallstreet wanted to securitize them.  That's ridiculous, and if they were doing that we should be able to see it in plain view.  Loan packages can be graded by a computer, the only thing a human should be doing is checking for fraud at the most.  And remember the bang up job Moody's did rating the pile of junk.  Their failings seemed like just total lack of knowledge about what they were doing.<p>Which got me thinking why can't we automate the stress test on banks?  If we had such a system then we could take all of the financial data from every institution into one big simulation.  Simulate future financial products and their impact before we create them.  Test out what could happen in the market if we introduce this.  Play out what if scenarios.  If we could do that then would we need an army of auditors, and more overhead the banks don't want.  Light weight bureaucracy not over burdened with check marks, auditors, committees, and SEC filings.",1260562167
