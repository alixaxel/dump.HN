1009383,comment,1008990,1009117,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Yeah, Princess Mononoke is really a lovely film. I thought when Spirited Away came out and became popular that people would naturally go back and check out Mononoke, but it didn't happen that much. Definitely worth a watch.<p>As for Avatar -<p>My two biggest complaints:<p>1. It paints it as black and white, good vs. evil. This is such a common source of human misery and brainwashing that I thought we'd started to move past in cinema. <i>Every</i> leader worth anything tries to play the underdog card. Ask yourself about every cause you sincerely respect and believe in - do any of your leaders not paint it as you vs. the world? The New York Yankees are the only organization I can think of that don't try to play the underdog external evil enemies card. All the world religions do, all political parties do, all nations do, and so on.<p>2. My housemate had a great quote - he said, ""They completed de-humanized the humans before doing all the violence to them."" It's quite right - the evil military industrial capitalist marines have no family members, loved ones, passions, or good about them. They exist to be eaten by dinosaurs, shot by arrows, crushed, beaten, and shredded. There's no marine who signed on for a security job, got a little freaked out what's happening, and died due to the complex violent decisions of the leaders. Nope, all the marines are not even human or worth sympathizing with at all - destroy the expoiters, make violence on them, and they deserve all the hells we can visit upon them.<p>When you take ""we're completely good and they're completely evil"" and mix it with ""our enemies aren't even human"", you get a recipe for horrible atrocities. I watched a documentary of what the Imperial Japanese Army soldiers was thinking at Nanking. They regarded their cause as God's work, and their Chinese enemies as not human.<p>Never mind the specific politics. Do we really want our epic, landmark art to assert that there is in fact pure good, pure evil, and the people with different views than us are pure evil and aren't even human? I kept trying to think of if I had a kid, how I'd talk to him or her after watching that to understand that the ""clear good and evil"" thinking leads to very bad places.",1261454386

1009335,comment,1009137,1009160,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"There are some language features that are just easier than their alternatives -- for example, written Finnish is phonetic. Compared to English, his has massive advantages both when first learning to read and when learning Finnish as a second language -- to learn to correctly pronounce Finnish, you need to learn 29 phonemes and their corresponding letters (One lacks a letter and is marked by ng/nk instead -- the guy who defined the written language missed it.), and the length of their long forms. After you've learned them, to correctly pronounce any Finnish word you just string together the sounds of the letters of the word.<p>That's not to say Finnish is an easier language than English -- even if our writing system is strictly superior, as a fenno-ugric language we've got boatloads of other crap that drags us down :).<p>There's plenty of interesting history in how Finnish got this way. In a nutshell, the protestant reformation hit Finland before there was a written Finnish language. Since everyone being able to read the bible on their own was kind of important for the Lutherans, this posed a problem for the clergy. So, to fix it, one particularly active scribe named Michael Agricola went and defined the basic form of written Finnish on his own. He wanted to make it easy to learn to read, and so made it very simple. However, as spoken Finnish was an old language, much of it didn't fit in the straightjacket of a language he had created. His solution? By then he had become the bishop of Turku, and could pretty much dictate anything church-related in Finland. He chose to simply ignore the parts of the language that didn't fit, and in a few decades spoken Finnish shed the features that couldn't be represented in writing. The end result is probably the simplest writing system anyone anywhere uses as their first language.",1261452302

1009326,comment,1008382,1009174,0,0,warfangle,,,"Why does the browser itself not implement its own buffering algorithm? I do not quite understand why this onus should be placed on the developer responsible for the video imbedding functionality of the hosted datum. Certainly allow the external developer the flexibility to override this functionality (easily enough done via language features of JavaScript). But why force all developers to implement competing but similar algorithms? (by example and anecdotal personal observations: netflix > hulu > CBS/tv.com, in terms of how buffering algos deal with potentially high but intermittent bandwidth [1]).<p>If this were abstracted to the browser level (discounting the fact that these long-format providers will likely never move away from their current flash/silverlight implementations), my choice of online tv watching would no longer be dependant on the competence of the content-providers buffering algorithm: currently, despite the fact that I enjoy several shows provided by CBS.com, I will not watch them online due to their shoddy buffering algos. I will not watch them via antenna, either (I watch on my own schedule, thanks).<p>Of course, as stated, these providers are hopelessly locked to their delivery platform due to DRM and contractual obligations. Ergo, most of this point is moot when it comes to long-format TV-oriented content distribution.<p>[1] in my experience, CBS does not buffer enough before playing, and does not buffer during the pause state. It also does not indicate how 'full' the buffer is during pause state, like hulu does. Netflix is, in my opinion, the best on this as it indicates on the seekbar the buffer level, and adjusts bitrate based on perceived bandwidth. When your bandwidth drops below the perceived bandwidth, it gives you an accurate status indication as to buffering activity. CBS, contrarily, simply buffers to the original perceived value and resumes play. This is problematic if you begin with high bandwidth but midway through stream something happens to negatively effect your bandwidth. If this situation occurs, you're likely to encounter a slideshow: video resumes for 5< seconds, whereupon it buffers once more. This results in >2s stutters every 3-10 seconds.

Has someone conducted a poll asking potential immigrants where they'd like to be, and found that these are the most likely states?<p>Regarding xenophobia, Texas has a significant immigrant population and is also anecdotaly considered a very xenophobic state. Can you resolve your claim that immigrants won't go to xenophobic areas with the reality that is Texas? How about Southern California, which has struggled with race and immigration fears for over a decade?<p>And what kind of person suggests that the entire inner corridor of the US is xenophobic anyway?

The only difference was that they were killing people instead of shaming and/or jailing them.<p>The same thing?  Killing millions is the same as some folks losing their jobs and a (relative) few jailed for a law that predated McCarthy?  Hint - that means that he had nothing to do with it.  (You didn't even honestly summarize Wikipedia.)<p>That law, fwiw, punished folks who ""knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the [...] desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association"".<p>I don't much like said law, but to equate it with SOP in communist countries is quite a stretch.<p>> But you have the SAME philosophy.<p>No, I don't.

Since we're mind-reading, I'll go with you really think that they're not evil but their opponents are.  You do realize that the killing thing looks bad, so you're trying to put that off on people you don't like who didn't do it, but it doesn't much bother you that communists do it.<p>> You are bordering on wanting to execute anyone that is ever an idealist in thinking that Communism in the Marxist sense (i.e. all humans working together towards a better world)<p>Marxism isn't ""all humans working together towards a better world"".  It's a very specific way of ""working together"" that leads to mass killing.<p>There are lots of ways to work together, the vast majority not being marxist.  (To be fair, there are some other ways of working together that also lead to mass killing, but they're not common.)<p>>  I doubt you're about to start arguing about the benefits of Fascism over Communism<p>Fascism was Communism with better clothes and a more efficient implementation.

Even as an Egyptian born in a semi-Arabic speaking house, and in the middle of trying to teach myself the language, I'm finding Arabic really difficult to learn. My two main problems are: a) Many words are not actually written as one word, and so you might have 2 or 3 separated strings of letters that are meant to be read altogether as one, which is ridiculously confusing - and - B) Arabic is commonly written with the vowels omitted. Most Arabic words have a set of unique root consonants, usually 3 or 4 consonants, that help you identify the word you're reading. So they'll eliminate the vowels because the root consonants and modifiers should be sufficient for word recognition. This probably makes reading script faster as there's less to process, and I'm sure it does, but as a beginner, it's tough.",1261451153
