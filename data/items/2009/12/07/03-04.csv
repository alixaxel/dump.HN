I don't see why showing it beside other languages helps at all either.<p>Maybe we could theorise about what's easier for programmers to understand. I'd suggest in that case that the more hierarchical systems are the hardest as the brain has more difficulty remembering small numbers of connections than a larger contextual web. But that's just an idea I would have looking at the images, I expect anyone who understands these well enough to draw conclusions from them would already be quite familiar with them.",1260158203

And, having previously been in the compiler business, I don't think very many compiler producers make any money at that game.  If you could see the internal cost numbers for what it takes to put Visual Studio together and to maintain it, it would be hard to see how they could anywhere near profit from it.  Back in the day, there was a report that they had 50 programmers on the C++ compiler alone.<p>Perhaps Walter Bright can make money writing compilers, but that would be an exception.

980651,comment,979501,980605,0,0,ewjordan,,,"Right, but that's more a statement about Java's quirky treatment of primitives than anything else - those are certainly passed by value, but nobody has ever argued anything else.  The only confusion/argument is over whether Object types are passed by value or by reference, and it's massively misleading to say they're passed by value, since if you don't know the rest of the story, you'll write code that doesn't run correctly.<p>The only reason that code won't work for Object is that you can't add a copy constructor or ""set"" method to Object, not because of any difference in reference semantics.  In a real-world implementation we might try to simulate duck-typing by accepting an Object and using reflection to check for the appropriate methods on the object, and though it would be a bit slow it would work for any object type that had the methods defined.<p>My main point was that for any type SomeType that lets the Java code compile, it will do exactly the same thing as the analogous code does in C++, assuming you've defined the class methods appropriately.  Which makes it a very poor illustration of the difference between reference semantics in Java and C++.",1260157056

These variants get compiled separately and are generated from 1 description of the page that includes conditionals that test what variant I'm generating/compiling.<p>I plan to make much heavier use of this feature in the future. For example, I'd want to have a new Proficiency dimension where I'd have a version for newbies with lots of inline help and hand-holding, a regular version for average users and maybe an expert version for people with advanced knowledge and needs.<p>And maybe another dimension which selects whether the page should be displayed with or without ""teasers"", for example if other features are available on that page with a premium account, the user might want to know what he's missing OR he might want to use the free version and not be bothered with upsells for the moment.<p>Since all these versions are generated from 1 template, drift is very minimal. I don't want to imagine what it would be like to maintain all these separate versions without this system, though I guess I just wouldn't bother with my more advanced ideas...<p>(Does this feature exist in other web-frameworks?

So men are more heavily represented in engineering, physics, mathematics, etc, but they're also more frequently mentally retarded, homeless, die of homicide, commit suicide, and wind up incarcerated - general ""failing"" type things.<p>One hypothesis is that for most of history, the difference in results between being ""above average"" and ""exceptional"" was very large for men, and a less so for women. So you've seen men go on dangerous trading journeys, fight for honor/prestige/titles/land, engage in duels and competitions, fight wars, break paradigms, take on establishments, and so on. Whereas for a woman - historically speaking - by simply being reasonably capable in all of the duties society expected of a woman, she could find a husband.

If the dispatch table is compiled down into an executable in exactly the same manner an if/else would be, then I can't think of a reasonable corruption vector that would corrupt a compiled-in dispatch table, but not a similarly compiled-in if/else block of code.<p>Without doing any actual experiments and assuming native code, the dispatch table is liable to go into the .data section of the binary with the rest of the globals/statics, which should be read/write (if you're lucky, you made it const and it's in .rdata which is read-only).
