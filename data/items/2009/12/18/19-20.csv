1003817,comment,1003366,1003388,0,0,dasht,,,"They are structured as a for-profit LLC.  They appear to rent (and also simply lend) storage space and studio space and equipment as well as host events.  They appear to have bootstrapped through a mix of self-funding, grants for the arts, and ""pay what you wish to pay"" donations.<p>There are many ways such a ""cultural"" business can make money.  A similar organization (""The Crucible"") elsewhere in the same city sells classes in things such as how to cut steel with a torch or how to run a milling machine.  They can sell commissioned works (which is not quite but is close to what NIMBY appears to do in relation to the Burningman festival).  They can produce recorded media (e.g., videos of events) and monetize those.<p>The Burningman connection is probably key.  As you probably know, Burningman is famous for all of the fancy art projects that show up each year.  Well, a lot of those - and a lot of the best ones - come via businesses like NIMBY.  For example, a talented but relatively poor artist or team won't have to, say, buy a router or rent a garage to build their project, or pay cash out of pocket for a structural engineer to go over their drawings - if they can just get in good with NIMBY or a similar place.   NIMBY gets back some of their operating expenses in the form of arts grants from Burningman.  It's a win-win-win-win: Burningman leverages their grants;  the NIMBY hackers have fun and gain influence;  the artists get opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have;  the ""public"" gets the art!<p>It may turn out to ultimately either fail or be simply a ""lifestyle business"" but I wouldn't be too surprised if it turns out bigger than that.<p>I think it must look very odd compared to the kinds of startup we usually hear about in Y Combinator land.  After all, they seek grants and plea for donations and there's not a price list or an (overt) 3rd party ad in sight anywhere on their site - right?  But, that's the nature of the modern, urban, ""punk""-ish art scene.  Most of their work-product is either temporary or ephemeral - not quite the kind of art where you go to a gallery and buy pieces off the wall.   They are unlikely to start running ticketed events because turning people away for lack of funds would diminish the value of the brand.<p>I would make an educated guess that the LLC itself won't ever be better than break-even, by design.   Any profit will likely go into capital investment or (pie in the sky, down the road) grant giving.   Note that two of the three listed ""uber-volunteers"" who run the show have day jobs (one with Burningman).   Not to be at all cynical about it but an artist / maker / creator / whatever who wants to invest blood, sweat, tears, and/or treasure into something like NIMBY <i>and</i> wants to see a return on investment is likely to take that return independently, leveraging their association with the brand, the (slow-depreciating) capital equipment and real estate resources of the LLC, and the social networking opportunities the LLC helps to foster.<p>So it's not a startup of the sort that will show an exponentially growing balance sheet and afford the investors huge payouts or an exit strategy.   In that sense, it is probably forever to be a ""small business"".  But it's a small business at the nexus of larger money flows.<p>(The idea goes very far back.  One famous example from the 1960s/1970s is Andy Warhol's ""Factory"".)<p>And now that I've explained all that (which is kind of ""common knowledge"" around here but I can see how it would be less obvious to many) -- it makes me wonder if a similar model wouldn't make some good sense for free software R&D of one sort or another....   The model doesn't <i>quite</i> translate directly (e.g., there is no Burningman raking in lots of money and issuing a lot of grants) but maybe there is something analogous enough...

If Android really takes off, and it starts supporting web apps that work really nicely - the way we are talking about, in ways that are similar to apps built in Obj-C or Java that are running natively on the phones - then if I were Apple, I'd ensure that web apps were just as slick on the iPhone as they are on any competitor's hardware.<p>Otherwise, for purely evil and competitive reasons, I'd probably ensure that web apps always had limitations compared to the native apps, unless I found a way to monetize the web apps too (for example, by creating an easy payment mechanism for use by web apps that ties in with iTunes, where I take a cut).<p>However, I think that Google is going to pile on the pressure to make web apps super slick (they are already doing so).",1261165532

As a general point, if you're an engineer and have or are contemplating a startup, attend such an event if you can - I found it a very empowering and educational experience - empowering to actually meet people out there who are actively looking to invest (there's a yawning social divide between the creative and financial communities in film) and educational in terms of hearing from investors about their needs and challenges.<p>Anyway, one person I met there - let's call him Mr X - was speaking a lot about new media, social networking and digital distribution, and mentioned investing in Y combinator. I pegged him for a member of this community, and sat down with him for a chat during  a break in the presentations. As soon as I mentioned YC he went off on a torrent of entrepeneurial excitement and investment possibilities - which I found a bit hard to keep up with, actually - but when I asked if he read HN it sailed right over his head. 'It's a discussion forum run by Paul Graham,' I added, which didn't seem to click with him either. So I assumed he was too busy and high-powered to deal with the hacking end of things.<p>But as time went on in the conversation, and in some other conversations I listened in on later, I began to wonder if he was for real - much talk of buzzwords and high multiples, and many interesting mentions, but after a while it sounded like a classic fast-talking hustle. I also noticed that the speakers who most impressed me with their insight, experience and businesslike demeanor all ended up backing themselves out of conversations with Mr X. After I got home I checked out Mr X's blog, which looked and read like he talked - lots of enthusiasm and connectivity to hot topics and projects, but little coherence.<p>I didn't dislike Mr X. He's a nice person who radiated enthusiasm, was full of ideas, and emphasized good karma and mutuality as a key part of successful business. He had insights and opinions on markets and companies that I know well, and which would find wide agreement here. But he also made me nervous, as if I were talking to someone on cocaine (which he wasn't, I hasten to add - he was just so fast and forceful in his conversation).  One instinct was telling me 'you should have a meeting with this guy', but another was telling me 'you should never, ever, bring someone like this to a meeting - you might get a deal, or you might get ejected...by force'.<p>I'll probably keep this relationship purely social, since it benefits neither party to get into any kind of a relationship if one side has misgivings. But I'm also considering the possibility that being pushed out of one's comfort zone can be scary, but is sometimes necessary.<p>Has anyone else had an experience like this, and how do you evaluate potential business partners or relationships? Are there any litmus tests you've found useful as part of your networking process?",1261165022

1003767,comment,1003404,1003637,0,0,KirinDave,,,"This isn't a particularly powerful or insightful article. The entire subject is blown out of proportion and distorted until hardly any of the actual facts remain.<p>1. Scientists ruin their careers by repeatedly attempting to discredit theories they cannot find the evidence to discredit (or proving claims they cannot find proof to claim). If a truly compelling set of studies discrediting global warming trends came out, you can be sure that <i>many</i> publications would be <i>eager</i> to publish it. This is how science works, and how it has worked historically. It's a surprisingly stable environment of meritocracy. Politics intrude, as in any human endeavor, but we'll get to that in:<p>2. Differences in opinion in the peer review process are as old as science. That is why there are multiple publications and multiple standards for entering into those publications. The whole notion of ""scientific consensus"" is built around assumptions like schisms such as this. If everyone agreed about the exact criterion for publication we'd only have a few (perhaps regional) scientific publications (and then we'd truly be in trouble).<p>3. Science is about <i>consensus</i>, but that implicitly accepts dissent. People argue for awhile, a consensus is formed, and then things blow over. Seldom are careers ruined. For an example, see Einstein's extremely controversial claims that eventually became the next major stepping stone for physics. People <i>violently</i> opposed his propositions at first, and now we look at him is one of the greatest minds in human history.<p>The difference here is that there are active sources of misinformation trying, for whatever non-scientific reasons, to drum up controversy around the global warming issue of anthropogenicity. This issue is still under active debate and research, but unlike many other subjects in a similar status (e.g., quantum physics) there are ""deniers"" who will not accept <i>any</i> positive evidence against their claim and will resort to any means, social or otherwise, to make their point of view supreme.<p>Some might argue this is warranted because climate science is making predictions that require us to radically restructure our industry and energy infrastructures to the tune of massive sums of money. To be honest, I think this complaint is shortsighted. Scientific predictions, even those in the limbo state between ""well-accepted"" and ""just a theory"" that we are calling ""consensus"", have always dictated the allocation of resources. Consider the exorbitant cost of the LHC, which is one of the single greatest achievements of human engineering and physics.",1261164793

This, I think, is the central problem in English instruction today. We try to teach arbitrary rules when what we need to teach is deliberateness.<p>Learning other languages certainly helps the user understand their own language more (nouns, subjects, objects, adverbs, etc.) in a nuts and bolts kind of way, but it doesn't really help with writing (well) or comprehending the more advanced forms of the language. Fitzgerald,  Hemingway, the writers of the King James Bible, Jefferson and Joyce are all vastly different from each other in their use of the language -- yet we hold all of them up as defining the flavor and character of the language in ways that are highly contrary to the thinking that produced S&W's Book and Lowth's Book.<p>Most of English grammar instruction, and particularly guidebooks like S&W and Lowth seek to define and tackle imaginary English language edge cases that simply don't exist in other languages. ""Don't split and infinitive"" is not an edge case useful for consideration in Latin-rooted languages because you simply can't. It's also not an edge case in German because infinitives are always split (like in English).<p>Other cases, like proscriptions to use ""whom"", fall flat because they are simply archaic or invented as a kind of shibboleth to demark persons with education from persons without. In modern usage, a person who uses ""whom"" is ultimately marking themselves as ignorant of the modern tongue.<p>Learning a bit of Latin is hugely useful for understanding individual English words with Latin roots, and for fudging your way around Romance speaking Europe (it's astounding how much French an well educated monolingual English speaker can translate). But so is learning a bit of Greek useful in a similar way, and again German in other similar ways.<p>Ultimately, the best way to learn about language is to study linguistics, not just another language. The very first thing you learn in linguistics is that there is none of this ""correct"" proscriptivist nonsense in a serious study of languages - at least not in the sense of the ignorant grade-school grammar guides we all grow up with.<p>The most salient point to all of this is that the authors of those guides could not even keep in agreement with their own rules within the same guide!",1261163155
