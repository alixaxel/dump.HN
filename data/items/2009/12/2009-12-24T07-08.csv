Content should be inextricably linked to how it is presented. This is what design means; it means taking content and displaying it in an understandable and pleasing way. Every piece of content desires to be presented differently.<p>This is exactly why CSS is such a horrible pile crap. It trains designers to separate content from presentation, and it's not designed for page layout. CSS is designed for forcing content into little boxes.<p>As long as people design for the web by separating content from presentation, we're never going to evolve into something better.<p>Just look at the end result of this article.

I remember reading about this in <i>The Science of the Discworld</i>, a hilarious yet informative book where the authors described these concepts in terms of ""memes"" (a word coined by Dawkins, I think, to refer to the mental analog of genes) and ""extelligence"" (knowledge that lives outside you head, like Wikipedia).<p>Even though we haven't evolved the ability to regrow eyes automatically, we've evolved enough intelligence to approach the level of civilization where, by playing with our own biology, we can <i>make</i> eyes regrow.

This would be a HUGE amount of completely unsorted data.  Sifting through all of this to find usable information would be very difficult.<p>The comparison to writing and the internet is false.

1013538,comment,1013024,1013024,0,0,ashley,,,"Perhaps you could clarify your definition of inflation.  As I have not read ""The Economist Numbers Guide"", I can't say in what context they meant by comparing the inflation rate to an annual compound interest rate.<p>We need not necessarily be suspicious of the Fed, however, in devaluing fiat currency.  It might be easier to think this if you think of interest rates and inflation differently.  Interest rates set by the Fed, like the federal funds rate or the discount rate, and inflation are actually negatively correlated.  That is, the lower the interest rate, the higher the rate of inflation that will ensue as the monetary supply expands and more goods/services are produced.  This is the rationale behind our low interest rate during the recent recession.  The interest rate is more  of a price on the available credit.  A low interest rate makes borrowing more attractive, and thus investing into a new project (rather than borrowing on consumer credit for mere consumption like jewelry or a mortgage for a house that you can't afford) will increase.  Instead of thinking of interest and inflation solely as finance charges, think of them as prices of credit/investing and controlling supply/demand of goods in the macroeconomy.<p>So making the comparison between the Fed and JP Morgan or any private bank in terms of interest rate charging and inflation is misleading.  Private, publicly traded banks have the sole goal of high returns to their shareholders.  It may help to understand the calculation of the inflation rate as an interest charge, but the intention of the inflation target and the federal funds rates is markedly different than that of private banks.  The Federal Reserve is trying to balance inflation with national economic growth and security, and it is a fine line to walk.<p>And in response to Rothschild, while monetary policy is a powerful tool to regulate the economy, we also have the mechanism of fiscal policy, i.e. government spending in infrastructure and national programs.  Fiscal policy is more of a clunker in terms of being slower, since it requires political will of a heterogeneous group of thinkers, but it does present an alternative to pure monetary policy. (When I say monetary policy, I mean anything a central bank does to regulate the amount of currency circulating outside the reserves).",1261639477

The front page seems more focussed on who uses it and how awesome they think it is than on <i>what</i> it is. I have a vague idea from your bulleted list, but no idea what differentiates this from all the other CRM systems. The companies you list might, but that is of no use to me. I'm not about to waste my time and contact them to tell me what you should have told me. The video might tell me, but I'm not compelled to watch the video. That combined with the odd and elongated layout would have the average customer uninterested in learning any more about the product.<p>Specific things:
* Please, <i>please</i> remove the scrolling images part of the way down. They are distracting and get annoying after more than a few seconds.
* Your page goes on below the fold on a 1024x768 monitor, and you have marketing content below that fold. This is <i>very</i> bad. I would honestly take the box of specific features and shove that near the top. In fact, that and a 2-3 sentence description of what the product does is <i>all</i> I could imagine being necessary on the front page. The client list and press hits could either sit at the bottom, or go on another page.
* The page flow is very odd. I'm having a hard time figuring out where my eyes ought to be going. There is that weird block of white space right below the press icons, and on either side of that irritated scrolling thing, which make it hard for me to keep track of where I am on the page. I get the sense that you could solve the page flow problem the need for scrolling at the same time, just by taking advantage of the space you haven't used yet.<p>I should add the disclaimer that I am not a professional designer, and so some of the things that bother me might be considered good practice by people in the know.<p>Hope this helps.",1261638283
