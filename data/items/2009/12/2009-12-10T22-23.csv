988770,comment,988520,988757,0,0,d4ft,,,"I disagree.  Outside of similar incentive alignments (agents and recruiters get paid more if you get paid more), the two are worlds apart.  An agent is often much more than just someone who shops around a resume looking for the best deal. Agents are often responsible for everything from transportation to financial management to legal advice. These are two VERY different jobs imo, especially when considering, as stated above, that recruiters almost never act as your advocate after the initial interview process has begun and may even give misleading information to try to close a deal.",1260485777

988766,comment,988538,988538,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"My own experience is that entrepreneurship is a character flaw. Entrepreneurship is not something that can be rationalized and easily explained away. Entrepreneurship is a deep desire to create and destroy at the same time. It requires simultaneous distain for authorities and respect for past artisans. In fact, if I thought there was a cure, I would have taken the blue pill. Therefore if one could accept entrepreneurship as what it really is, then there is a much less immediate need for acceptance and validation (except in the marketplace). The end result is that entrepreneurs would have a very different perspective on listening to unpleasant truth, that rejection is not an undesirable and unavoidable side product, but in fact part of the journey.",1260485679

I've been keeping a video diary of my startup on it, and I also used several to record my vacation to Australia and New Zealand in October.<p>I don't think you need super-high quality, even though the FlipCams are HD. Content counts more than style or featureset. What I like about the FlipCam is ease of use, portability, and connectivity to various video-sharing services.<p>The vacation was a bit of a testbed. Everybody in the family had a FlipCam, and we posted to the net a lot. After a few days, however, we realized that some sort of post-production really helped make the video much better. So I started using Camtasia Studio for basic titling, popups, splices, and transitions. It also allowed me to tweak the codec settings when I rendered the file, which was nice.<p>Another interesting lesson: the more you film, the better you get. At first everybody was stiff as a board the second you turned the cam on. Must be some kind of hangover from the still camera days. But after a dozen or so shots with us all watching the results, we realized that relaxing was the only way to go. The videos got a lot better at the end.<p>Here's a sample of the more relaxed video we got at the end of the trip instead of the start: <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/7121046"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vimeo.com/7121046</a><p>EDIT: I'm a bit of a movie buff, so this is a pet topic for me. I know that you're receiving conflicting advice, and I really can't emphasize enough how content trumps style. We found the the emotional context of a piece -- setting, reactions, flow, body language, vocal inflections, narrative -- win out so solidly over technical attributes that you can shoot a great video on the crappiest equipment imaginable and it will still be great video.<p>I could point to major motion pictures going the handy-cam way, like Cloverfield, or I could point to the popularity of amateur internet video, or even America's Funniest Home Videos.<p>But I won't.",1260485177

The other way to do it, if you feel that the order of the pictures represents some kind of progression, is to disable the ""Left"" button on the first picture and the ""Right"" button on the last picture.<p>A few other things I have noticed:<p>- The app doesn't tell me how many pictures there are and/or which picture I am on.  That would help in knowing how far into the pictures you are, and give me a way to easily find a picture again.<p>- The app always starts at that first picture.  It would be nice if it restarted where I left it.  If I wanted to show a particular picture to someone, I've got to start the app and then swipe my way through.<p>- If you start swiping very quickly to try to motor through the pictures, it looks like the phone can't keep up and you end up with a black background for a bit.<p>- The ""Random"" has some kind of a bug that I've only been able to produce once where, when pressing it rapidly, I got the spinner to come up and never go away.<p>- ""Random"" generally results in the spinner getting shown, and then the screen simply displaying the new image.  However, if the image is an image to the immediate left or right of the current image it does a swipe style animation to display it.  It should probably be consistent and just pop the image on screen.<p>- A way to get to the beginning or the end might also be useful.  Perhaps a double tap on the screen can alternate bouncing you between the first and last picture.  You could use the double tap to bounce between the first and last picture for now, and in the future change use it to display a tiled ""Camera Roll"" style view.",1260484853

This is unless you manage a number of clients where you are fed requirements, and then it's just the candidate part.<p>There is no way to escape it; the best thing to do is to shield yourself from the continuous onslaught.<p>•	Insist all communication is sent to a ""jobs"" email and have GMail filter it or poll it
•	Delete your phone number off CV's when sending them in or posting on the web. 
•	Make your most recent employer anonymous
•	You can also use an initial instead of your first name incase they have your details already, it may fool them ;-)
•	Make sure your CV is well written and updated
•	Insist on seeing a job spec before giving them your number, if you’re the perfect match they will take the time.
•	Do tell them your current status and salary<p>DO NOT tell them info on current company, manager until you trust them.<p>Remember they want to close candidates, clients, deals – it’s a sales job<p>Every call is a sales call; they will try to strip you for information, about colleagues, workplace, inside info, references for managers’ names<p>We would often misplace the truth or withhold information to close deals; this is common practice in the UK/Europe. The most common one telling people we had sent their CV to an employer when we hadn’t just to ensure they wouldn’t let other recruiters send it to the client and increasing the likeliness that our current candidates had a better chance.<p>I think Recruiters have a place in society, some are upstanding and honest, other aren’t. As I mentioned, it’s about distancing yourself from them until they have the ideal job for you.<p>P.S.

By choosing Javascript, Google automatically wins on the first two points and is making Javascript kick ass in the third.<p>Market penetration is a -huge- aspect of coding in the browser.  It's the reason Flash won't die; Adobe is really, really good at pushing the plugin on people.  If people can't run your code, your code doesn't matter.<p>Language usage is important to developers.  Javascript has the benefit of having lots of developers already using it, and requiring -nothing but a browser- to get started with it.  Adobe has noticed that being developer friendly is really important, and has been making strides with Flex, making Flash development seem more familiar to traditional devs.  Silverlight simply doesn't get it (<a href=""http://silverlight.net/getstarted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://silverlight.net/getstarted/</a>).  The platform doesn't matter if you don't have programmers building for it.<p>Speed is important, but only to a point.  Of course, Silverlight and Flash both beat the pants off of Javascript for practically every benchmark.  The important thing to remember is that Javascript doesn't need to beat them in a test, it simply needs to be fast enough.<p>You've mentioned that Silverlight's ""tech"" is better.  I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean.<p>Google's move to push Javascript makes a lot of sense.

What the systems analyst produced was very precise; it was pretty much a program written in a higher-level language than was then available.  The programmer's job was to translate this program into Fortran or Cobol.<p>So it's not only the female programmers of the 1960s who have disappeared, but the male ones as well.
