Practical ray tracers - those used for real-world applications such as rendering movies - have much in common with game engines. Both are large and complex systems of many, many modules and employ an array of cutting-edge algorithms (some modern game engines incorporate ray tracers, and today's renderers employ much more than ray tracing). Both are designed with a focus on performance and robustness, while incorporating the large toolbox of features demanded by content creators. They are machines that have gone through many, many revisions of architecture, and have decades of performance tuning and wisdom embedded in them. And they are beautiful in the sense that they have tamed a real problem and exposed its solution in a simple manner, in spite of the complexity they must encompass.",1260870680

996220,comment,993982,994841,0,0,lsc,,,"Yes, clearly I am exaggerating.    the 9290 doesn't even have EDGE, so there really isn't a comparison.  (I have one on my desk right now, actually.  I find the phone aesthetically appealing, which probably says a lot about why I don't ""get"" the iphone. [1] but without EDGE, at least, it's not particularly practical.  The intent of the designers was that you would do dialup, but something changed in the GSM protocol so dialup no longer works, making the phone nothing but a giant sms device and decent offline (and thus obsolete) PDA.<p>(as an aside, I think the newton is interesting because if it's handwriting recognition was good enough, we'd be seeing handwriting recognition as a dominant input method for PDAs today.   The thing is, it wasn't, and by now, even if someone comes up with absolutely perfect handwriting recognition software, too many of us have grown up not knowing how to write. the time when handwriting recognition could have worked is over.)<p>However, the 9500 was released in '04, and I think it can reasonably be argued that it is as 'advanced' as the first generation iphone.   It doesn't have 3g, but neither did the first iphone.  it does have wifi, edge, and a /keyboard/  making it a much more useful device, imho, than the iphone.  I understand that the keyboard vs. touchscreen debate is subjective, and probably has more to do with what you are used to than anything else, but aside from the touchscreen, I'm not sure how else the iphone is more 'advanced' than the communicator 9500.<p>Now, if you want to compare modern devices, check out the n900.  it's pretty slick.  it's got a touchscreen and a keyboard, and the screen is absolutely beautiful, even in full sunlight.  Under the covers, it's linux, and it's sold unlocked, so you can play with it.   The maemo linux stuff is pretty close to regular linux, so you have a chance of understanding it too.  Again, the apple software is better /if it does what you want/  while the nokia hardware is clearly superior, and the nokia software allows you to do exactly what you want /if you know how/.<p>I'm not saying the iphone is bad-  If you have the same needs that apple had in mind when they designed it, it's a really great phone.  But I think what they took out was probably more important to that than what they put in.  As far as I can tell, apple didn't do anything particularly innovative in terms of features or technology, but they certainly made a lot of users happy.  My belief is that part of their success was that they made the interface /just right/ for a certain class of users, by removing the sort of features those users don't want.   (unfortunately, I don't belong to that class of users.)<p>Now, previous nokia communicators were status symbols in other parts of the world, but here, they never were.  The iphone was the first smartphone to impact your image positively in the US.   I'm the last person you should ask as to why that is, but I will give you my opinion anyhow:  the Iphone was the first smart phone that cool people could effectively use.<p>[1] the thing is big and blocky. It looks as tough as it is. You can drop it, throw it, stick it in your pocket with your keys, and assuming your pockets are large enough to handle it, there's not a problem. I like clamshell designs for this reason.",1260870340

Yes, the body converts all carbohydrates to glucose, but it takes much longer for complex carbs to turn into straight glucose than it does simpler ones, spreading out the absorption.  It isn't about fructose vs glucose, but rather fast absorption vs slow absorption.",1260870195

996212,comment,995519,996157,0,0,azanar,,,"Honestly, it would serve more to guide my questions than it would to just flat dismiss someone as untalented or apathetic.<p>Curiosity and genuine interest develop at different times for different people depending on the circumstances of their life. They might have not discovered programming until later in their life, or they may have been soured by an bad experience early on and only came back later on.<p>For some people, they don't discover programming until university, but then find the absolutely love it and quickly develop a considerable talent. For these people, who do exist, the pre-university test is a false negative.<p>A lot of these tests people come up with are based on the concept that past performance indicates future potential. The thing about these tests is that they suck really bad, except that for certain things there are no other tests.<p>A meteorologist I once heard talking about weather phenomena in Alaska joked in his talk about how there are two possibilites for available weather data there: data sparse, or data void. It is much the same in finding good programmers. There are a lot of important considerations, and getting a feel on each depends on sparse data at best.\nThe best advice I can offer is don't take things like this too personally. Following advice from pg almost certainly applies to applying and interviewing for jobs as well.<p><i>Don't be put off if they say no. Rejection is almost always less personal than the rejectee imagines. Just move on to the next.

As I point out in my post, it's not just possible, it's likely that this is the case. Instead, every single one has claimed with the type of absolute certainty you can only achieve by having no data at all that it's due to CPAN, and some magical tendency towards completeness that it imparts to projects... Again, I think it's implausible, but I'm open to suggestions of ways to settle the matter with actual data.",1260869538

That's why computer languages resemble rather precise math language.<p>Reminds me about a nice summary of Lisp, which describes working with Lisp:<p>""Interactive means that programming is a dialog with Lisp. You enter an expression and Lisp computes the side effects (for example output) and the value.<p>So your programming session is like 'talking' with the Lisp system.

There's a very strong bias among CPAN contributors to building small, reusable tools.  I am the primary developer of some 30 of those Perl 5 projects.  My commit rate has followed the graph of several commits in the initial stages, then very few after a year or eighteen months because the projects entered bugfix-only maintenance mode.<p>> Perhaps a sign of a wee bit of defensiveness in the Perl community at the moment?<p>You made some flippant provocative statements apparently based on poor assumptions unsupported by any of the evidence you presented.
