995752,comment,995634,995685,0,0,paulgb,,,"I certainly get why a slower hash would curb brute force attacks, but when I'm talking about unique salts, slowing down the hash is not the purpose I have in mind.<p>If you have a table of 32 million hashed passwords with no salt (or they have the same salt and you know what it is), you can try a bunch of combinations, take the resulting hash, and look it up in the hashed password database. If you try the password ""foobar"" and any user has the password ""foobar"", you've found a username/password pair. Because there are 32 million potential matches, your chances are pretty good of eventually finding a bunch of matches by iterating over a bunch of potential passwords.<p>On the other hand, if you have a table of 32 million hashed passwords and salt combinations, where the salts are unique, you have to check the hash of ""foobar"" in combination with every user's salt before you can say that no user has the password ""foobar"". This is 32 million times slower, which is a significant difference regardless of the speed of the hashing algorithm.<p>If you want to brute force a particular user's password, the unique hash doesn't matter, but if you want to maximize the number of username/password pairs you can get, it seems to me like it would.",1260845980

""Salts"" do nothing to slow this attack down, because they add insignificant time (really, none) to a single hash iteration.<p>Hashes like MD5, SHA1, and even SHA256 are <i>designed to be fast</i>. To succeed, they need to be able to handle multi-gigabit per-packet hash rates. They are designed explicitly both to be fast on general-purpose hardware and to be straightforward to optimize in purpose-built hardware. This is a bad, bad property for a password hash.<p>BCrypt is ""optimized"" to be slow - tuneably slow. SCrypt improves on BCrypt by being both slow on general purpose hardware and resistant to simple hardware speedups. PBKDF and ""stretched"" SHA1 are very simple contructions that are weaker than BCrypt and SCrypt but more buzzword compliant. All of them make it difficult to recover hundreds of thousands of passwords from a database dump.<p>See:<p><a href=""http://www.matasano.com/log/958/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-secure-password-schemes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/log/958/enough-with-the-rainbow-tabl...</a>",1260843964
