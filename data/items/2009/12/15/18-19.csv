997108,comment,996789,996789,0,0,rudd,,,"I'm confused by some of these transliterations. For instance, they spell out ""pxasik"" and say it's pronounced ""puh –(lip smack) askik."" Where did that first [k] in the pronunciation come from? The author also types out that ""x"" to represent the ""lip smack"" and something he describes as a click (in ""skwawng""). While I imagine the lip smack is the bilabial click, ʘ, he clearly distinguishes between the two, so I wonder what's with using ""x"" for both. Though, it might be through assimilation. Or maybe he's mistaking clicks for ejectives?<p>With that title, I was hoping for a more in depth linguistic overview for those of us with knowledge of phonetics.",1260903487

997104,comment,996804,997008,0,0,ezy,,,"I was wondering about this.  It seems to me that the 10% conversion rate for junk mail is based on selling to a credulous consumer.  Hence the urgent tone.  Most people (the other 90%?) toss the shit out because they know even if the copy sounds vaguely interesting, you're most likely not going to get something for nothing.  Everything from the 4 (bright) color ad to the fake christmas card goes in the recycling immediately from the mailbox because you know you're going to be manipulated.<p>Are people more or less credulous on the web?  I dunno, that has to depend on the category.

After finding the best conversion rate, the rest of the campaign will go to the list that performs the best.

Also, elsewhere in this discussion you say ""Yet the iPhone costs more than twice that"" (ie >$400, [1]). iSuppli estimates the cost to be $180 including manufacturing and ""other"" parts[2]. This is very much in line with Apple's typical margins. Apple doesn't sell commodity products so it's no surprise that they could be netting 50% margins (see [3] for iPod cost information). I work in the electronic components industry. The component costs quoted by iSuppli are credible. Companies like Samsung and Apple are able to negotiate very low prices for components from their suppliers. The suppliers are willing to offer components at lower prices and hence sacrifice their profit margins for a couple of reasons: (a) Apple and Samsung buy in large volume (b) Apple and Samsung will always be around. Offering the best prices now is a foot in the door for future business with them<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=996710"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=996710</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gigaom.com/2009/12/09/who-is-getting-rich-off-the-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigaom.com/2009/12/09/who-is-getting-rich-off-the-iph...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2005/tc20050921_4557.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2005/tc200...</a>",1260901458
