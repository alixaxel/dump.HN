(approximation of a famous quote)<p>2. You should learn from other's successes, because it's cheaper than discovering what works by yourself. (simple variation)<p>3. Applying mutuality principle: how can we mutually benefit from our mistakes?<p>4. Why not conduct A/B testing and ad word campaigns together so that lessons learned can benefit the maximum number?<p>5. How to do this?<p>a) The easiest way is just to blog about your own findings and read others' blogs. This suffers from the free-rider problem: you end up doing research for others.<p>b) Another alternative is to form a club where each member spends a certain amount per month on ads, and they share their results.<p>c) Another way is to simply do a lot of Google searches (automatically?) and see what ads are displayed. You're letting Google and the free market do your work for you. This is the e-version of collecting junk mail.

997251,comment,996934,997210,0,0,tspiteri,,,"gofmt is not a function name, it does not appear in code, it is a command line tool. In many cases you type something like ""gofmt -w filename.go"", press Enter, and then it's gone, never to be read.<p>In the language itself, fmt (something completely different from gofmt) is used as a package identifier. In the Go style, package identifiers are typed repeatedly, the identifiers inside a package are not imported into the global namespace. So if code contains many calls to the Printf function, there will be many instances of fmt.Printf. In this case, fmt instead of format is a good decision too. It's a package name (not a function name) and it is typed repeatedly, so the shorter it is, the less visual noise.",1260907029

997217,comment,997060,997141,0,0,arohner,,,"At the day job, we commonly see situations where the customer has a bug they need fixed, and they're not willing to wait for the next scheduled release. We give them a one-off release containing only that fix. What do you label it? If you label it 1.0.1, then the next ""official"" release will be 1.0.2. Worse, what is the label for another release off the branch, after your trunk release of 1.0.2? I find this unsatisfactory because the two releases are not necessarily related to each other. AFAICT, all version systems that involve only numbers and dots will either fail to handle branches, or become horrifically complex.<p>I've seen products where releases were branches off branches. This happened because the customer is extremely risk adverse and we had new code in trunk that they didn't want to test; they wanted known-good code plus a subset of trunk. Management went along with it because the customer is several orders of magnitude larger. We strayed from trunk for so long that trunk got dropped, and one of the branches was designated the new trunk.<p>My general goals for a version system are:<p><pre><code>    1) provide a unique version for every build\n    2) Give an indication of where this code came from.\n</code></pre>\nI currently advocate a Git-like solution. I don't promise that this is 100% free of corner cases, but I believe it's better than everything else I've seen. Give every build a SHA1 / GUID. If you're running Git, this is just the SHA1 of the tree, when you build. That is the build's ""official version"". If you want to see where the build came from, git can draw you a pretty picture. When doing the build, allow the user to specify a human-friendly label, as a string. This can be anything, from ""v1.0.1"" to ""v1.0.0 + one-off fix for MegaCorp"" or ""Bob's developer build for testing foo"". In the product, display both versions.",1260906313

If you just set your headers to the far future, you'll be stuck with outdated content on the client that you can't control.
