I think you are assuming things that may not be true of all people, and then using that to draw very broad strokes which may have a steep rate of false predictions.<p>Forty hours a week is an theoretical standard; it says little about the actual hours put in by programmers. Urban lore suggests the accurate number is higher, sometimes much higher.<p>The free time a programmer isn't guaranteed to be available in large chunks for hacking. There are a number of things that can take up that time; some of them are bogus, but some are quite reasonable. Enough of that time gets chewed up, the programmer really doesn't have the kind of time they need to focus on deep, substantial projects. Some do find the time, but there are more factors involved than simply motivation.<p>As for primary and secondary school years, this too depends on a number of factors, not all of them matters of personal motivation and ability.<p>Assessment is hard enough when you don't have preconceived notions of the molds other people fit into; if you start assessing people already cherry-picking assumptions about them based on what societal fashion suggests is ""normal,"" then your ability to fairly assess them is already screwed.

Obviously there's a problem with that statement :)<p>That being said, I agree completely with your first paragraph. I was being half-satirical—not intending to find a <i>flaw</i> in your argument, so much as desiring to provoke you into strengthening your point by clarifying it (and trying to go one step beyond the common-sense assumption of ""our current society"" to see where this philosophy would take you.)<p>Do you think the world would be better if programmers could not transition into the workforce until they had created something that no one had <i>asked</i> them to create? The idea behind a company hiring you is that they need what you have, and so they pay you for it. If you're creating something and no one's paying you for it, then, presumably, either you aren't marketing it well enough, or it's something nobody needs (or you've made it as an act of goodwill, but the likelihood of Joe the Programmer writing FOSS as anything other than a prerequisite to a job—which, therefore, means that he really would rather have been paid, but just couldn't find a taker, again implying that he was underemployed—is slim to nil.)",1260866451

Larry and Sergey's personal niceness or lack thereof is irrelevant.<p>Most people who work for giant tech corporations aren't sociopaths -- far from it. The top American tech firms are filled with people that are almost painfully conscientious, in an upper-middle-class way. Don't even think about cancelling the recycling program or face a general uprising at the next assembly. This is true whether you work for Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Apple, Oracle, or whatever. I don't know the telecom or media industry, but I bet it's about the same there.<p>The sociopath angle makes sense to describe the behavior of the corporation itself. (viz. ""The Corporation"" film). Even if there's an opportunity you have qualms about (subprime mortgages, expanding into China), the shareholders will insist you get into that market as long as competitors are making money.<p>Google's corporate behavior is pretty ""evil"". To their competitors. And sometimes even their partners. Consider how they are bootstrapping off TeleAtlas' mapping data product to basically make that entire industry obsolete, once people are carrying around iPhones that constantly map everything.<p>But as long as they are ""evil"" to competitors in the service of making a better product, they are ""good"" for everyone else.<p>The traditional media monopolies stopped really competing a generation ago, and after the consolidation of the 80s and 90s it's all been about denying entry to competitors, and controlling access to markets. That's what makes them ""evil"".<p>Google isn't in any position where they can do that yet, except maybe online advertising (sort of). So for the most part Google is focused on breaking open markets. That might change if they ever start ""owning"" a consumer, like say with a Chrome-powered netbook. Just you wait.",1260865597
996148,comment,995519,995700,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>There is one sure-fire way to identify a good programmer: their work. In fact, it is by definition the way that we should evaluate programmers. It is the great equalizer, and with web technology, exposed for all to see.</i><p>Unless you are presuming a team of only a couple of developers doing their own thing, there is a real challenge in determining the extent of the programmer's responsibility for something that is exposed for all to see.<p>There are a number of other causes that might make a site a developer helped work on look or run like complete garbage. Organizational inertia might have forced the site into sucking, regardless of how good the programmers developing it were. The organization may have one or more bad programmers who were assigned to work on some critical component, screwing the whole site and all the good programmers.<p>We can wax on eternally about how the good programmers in this situation should've seen the writing on the wall and gotten out as soon as possible, but that's very easy to say seated in armchairs gazing from afar. Maybe they thought things were going better than they really were; maybe they saw things going bad, and thought they could motivate others to turn things around before things become a disaster -- and maybe they failed trying to do that[1]; maybe they have been trying to get out, but they are already tainted by the bad work of the organization that has become part of their image as well.<p>They could do work outside of their employer, for instance on an open source project, but these can succumb to the same sort of pressures that push profit-seeking organizations toward mediocrity. A single developer, even a really willful one, will have a hard time overcoming this inertia.<p>[1] At one of my prior employers, I was in this boat; I both tried and failed to get things turned around. I did quit, but probably not soon enough to convince people that the site was not a reflection of me and my standards. The site was absolutely shameful, and I'm sure anyone who used that site to infer things about my skill level would've sworn I had no skill or experience outside of a weekend PHP crash course. Granted, it would vet one organization I would probably not want to work at; but it would represent wasted potential based on presumption, which is a shame.<p>I really think the details matter, because they are a chance to determine if the work you are using to assess the programmer is spurious input, and reflect an influence largely made up of things <i>other</i> than that programmer.",1260865342
