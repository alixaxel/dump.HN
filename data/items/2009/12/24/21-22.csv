Firstly, the mantra that smaller is better is not valid anymore at this scale, because of a number of reasons; most prominently of which is that the electrodes which supply the charge carriers are now (as in the picture in the article) much bigger than the device itself, making further shrinking of the device itself useless.<p>Although the specific area of molecular electronics (meaning molecular transistors) is vastly overhyped (and the Wired article doesn't help), I still think there are incredible opportunities out there if we are able to harness the electronic (meaning in this case, relating to electrons) properties of molecular-scale systems. Examples could include designing our own catalysts, pharmaceutical molecules, light-harvesting systems, or industrial materials from scratch. Limiting the search for applications of these systems to the traditional three-terminal electronic switching device, while making the subject easier for laypeople to relate to, does a disservice to a whole spectrum of other exciting other options.",1261690264

They move to stabilize the body).  \nThe wings don't appear to be tracing any different pattern to imply a change in flight mechanics. \nAnd, it would be a huge stretch to call that a ""perfect landing"", as it's basically mimicing what helicopters already do (approach, lower gently until touching, and slowly throttle back instead of cutting power instantly).<p>Is it because it isn't a bird-like semi-crash (which make perfect sense, as they have more mass and kinetic energy)?
