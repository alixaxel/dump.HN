I work in web development, and I see every single day confusion and problems caused by a mismatch between what someone asked for and what someone else understood they wanted.<p>Coming from the same environment I also see how this confusions are avoided. And that is by direct fast two way communication that does not end too soon, talking, drawing pictures, pointing fingers and prototyping. I imagine same solutions should be incorporated in programming environments to make them more accessible.<p>When you don't get what someone said, you just say to him what you understood and sometimes what he might meant by saying that and he agrees or clarifies until you both are sure enough that you share the same idea.<p>That kind of dialog might have place in programming environments. Code completion and parameter hinting are very crude and silly attempts on making such dialog. Despite their silliness they are immensely useful.<p>> When you're writing computer code you should specify exactly what you want - architects don't design a house by drawing four walls and a roof and some rough, to-the-nearest-metre dimensions on the back of an envelope, because then houses would fall down and kill people.<p>I just think that architect should not necessarily need to be all human. Some technical details can be worked out in dialog between human and machine.<p>> The main problem is that people are lazy, and think in generalities.<p>That is the problem but thats just how humans are. Even programmers. It's not gonna change so things should be designed in such way that allows people to be lazy, still got the things done and not to hurt themselves.<p>> That's fine for socialising, but many things in life require precision (especially in our increasingly-complex society)... and lazy people used to relying on implication and inference find it a great effort to be as precise as is required.<p>This effort comes more easily if you can clarify things step by step and not have to be perfectly clear from moment zero. I think current programming environments seriously impede designing solutions to problems because they require precision too early and do not infer enough in proper way.<p>> it's for people to learn to request what they actually want, instead of asking computers to essentially ""do some stuff with a thing"".<p>It's not gonna happen. It lies in biology. Organisms always try to achieve goal with least possible effort.<p>Progress is not done by making slaves not lazy but by inventing steam engine that enables lazy people to do more.<p>> It's not a question of success of communication - it's a question of imprecise requirements, lossy communication methods and inescapable rules of information theory.<p>In my opinion programming is about forming exactly same idea in two places, programmers brain and computer hardware. Designing a program is part of programming and computer should play more active role in this part.",1261627178

The Federal Reserve is not privately ""owned"" in any capitalist sense of ownership, since the ""owners"" have no say over Fed policy and only a tiny slice of the profits. Almost all profit made by the Fed is returned to the Treasury, yet the system was deliberately designed to keep the Treasury from having power over the Fed.<p>The only conspiracy theory mentioned in the original post that survives this analysis is the idea that the Fed, somehow, is taxing people by inflating. Yet steady inflation is an essential ingredient of monetary policy, since it must be possible to have interest rates below the inflation rate. Almost all important economists, including those of the ardently anti-government Chicago school, agree on this point.<p>It's only fitting that you quoted George Carlin at the end of the post.

1013351,comment,1013155,1013320,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"In terms of what you can actually <i>do</i> if you set your mind to it, they're not terribly different. In terms of the default/conventional things recommended by their communities, they're fairly divergent.<p>Speaking as someone who's used both and prefers Mercurial:<p>* Git's branching philosophy (lots and lots of branches, only one active at a time) can be handy. But Mercurial's philosophy (not quite so many branches, and usually as separate clones so you can work on more than one side-by-side) is, I've found, usually better.<p>* Git's much more encouraging of editing history up to the point where you share code with someone else. Mercurial will let you do that if you really want to, but it's discouraged; the only ""easy"" way is limited to undoing the last commit. Git seems to encourage committing much, much more often and not particularly caring about the repository history until you're ready to share with someone else (at which point you just selectively rewrite the history to look sensible). Mercurial seems to encourage committing in logical chunks so the repo history is clear and sensible the whole time (but again, if you really really want to do the Git-style stuff, you can).<p>* Mercurial seems to me, personally, to be a bit more logical in terms of choosing good defaults and exposing abstractions. Git's choices for default behaviors have been criticized even by its fans, and it tends to throw a lot of its inner workings at you on a regular basis, even if you don't really care much.<p>But, again, this is only my own personal opinion; undoubtedly others will disagree with it.",1261626884

1013347,comment,1013155,1013320,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Here's my experience with each. I'm biased and stubborn here, but in ways that may or may not be relevant to you. Your circumstances <i>will</i> differ, so take any advice about this with a grain of salt.<p>I've used distributed VC systems for quite a while, at least in the small. I find VC systems, databases, and the like verrrry interesting (due to a past life working in libraries), and an acquaintance of mine was the primary author of Monotone. I had already been keeping my home directory and /etc in svn, but that sounded far more interesting (it was also a full backup!). I tried it, and found using repository-as-a-whole versions more convenient than per-file versions. Later, I tried out hg, and felt it had a nicer interface / was easier to set up for common operations. (mtn assumed you cared to set up strong crypto auth for everything.) I was quite happy with Mercurial - it's a good system.<p>After using hg for a while (nine months or so?) I tried out git. It was still rough around the edges (the interface and documentation have since gotten better), but it had one major feature that stuck out - its ability to nonchalantly create and shuffle between several local, topical working branches in the same repository. To my knowledge, Mercurial still doesn't have a comparable feature, since their decisions about the core data structures make it awkward -- git saves the repo in terms of data snapshots, while hg saves the diffs (or perhaps vice versa, I forget). There was a major release where the hg team introduced ""bookmarks"", which were an attempts to emulate the git branching model, but you still had to be careful about copying them from one repo to another, etc. It had different trade-offs. I stopped paying attention around then. (If hg has since gained these, it would be a major point in its favor.)<p>That sounds overly negative towards hg, though. A <i>major</i> con of git is that the system is heavily skewed towards running on Unix. If you install it on Windows, it uses vim as the default editor for comments, it assumes you're used to man pages, etc. As a whole, the native behavior of the platform is an afterthought. Lots of little Unix-isms. Now, I can't blame them - I use OpenBSD at home, and strongly prefer old-school Unix in general. Also, developing any kind of system with the niceties that Unix provides and then porting it to Windows later is a <i>big</i> pain. Still, Mercurial's releases have consistently seemed to more evenly support Windows. I develop for Windows at work (in a field involving high-performance graphics and associated hardware), and, for my own circumstances, would choose Mercurial over git. Again, I should stress they're <i>both</i> a landslide better than any other systems I've seen.<p>Also, mercurial seems to place more emphasis on being simple for basic use, yet having a clean foundation for adding extensions. I haven't written any, or looked at it in a while, but it seemed like a good example of the different design styles - git was more powerful but scruffy, while mercurial was clean and more concerned with usability. (Whether this is an emergent property of git being written in C and shell scripts vs mercurial in Python with hotspots in C would be an interesting debate.)<p>I still use git for my home directory and personal projects, though most systems' flaws aren't a big deal for smaller projects. Feel free to experiment. If you're doing research prior to committing to one or the other for a massive project, switching really isn't a big deal until you have branches with months of churn. Unless you're working on the Linux kernel or an equally massive project (unlikely), it'd be far easier (in isolation - not counting retraining) to just pick one, use it for a couple months, articulate pros and cons, then switch and compare. They have quite a bit in common, and either would be vastly preferable to svn (ack!) or perforce (ACK!!!). You can't make an informed decision without trying either, and they're both quite good.<p>I looked into Darcs as another system that had interesting features and a pretty nice interface, but given the problems with bootstrapping an even remotely recent version of GHC on BSD (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1346</a>), there's no way in hell I'd depend on Haskell for something as fundamental as VC.<p>Also, weird web2.0 juice nonwithstanding, it's a version control system, not a religion. <i>It's a means to an end.</i> You (everyone), you're using it because you're writing something, not because you're trying to be seen scribbling <i>deep thoughts</i> in a damn moleskine notebook.",1261626663

1013330,comment,1012472,1012924,0,0,elblanco,,,"Fine, I'll frame it in different language.<p><i></i><i></i><i>warning meta-comment, queasy people that can't handle introspection should stop here</i><i></i><i></i><p>There is a constant meta-discussion on HN, with HN being on top of course, that social news aggregation sites tend to devolve along the following lattice, HN->reddit->digg->4chan. Various signals are referenced that this is happening, typically in the form of people behaving outside of the established site or community guidelines. HN's guidelines for example state that this post <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1011258"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1011258</a> runs counter to the guideline:<p>>Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.<p>So not only was the post counter to guidelines and very clearly not a topical HN post, it was a repost, just a short while after appearing on reddit's main page. In addition, the title:<p>> <i>How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen deal? I was in the room</i><p>(while it <i>is</i> the original article title) blows threw at least half of the guidelines for submissions.<p>I added the meta-comment <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1011258"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1011258</a><p>which was immediately downvoted to something like -5 at one point and all of my subsequent comments, even topically related and without violating any HN guidelines were immediately hammered. Some additional people responded to my meta-comment, all non-trollish, one guy is now +8 and another is enjoying time at 0. This is schizophrenic.<p>The guidelines for voting on HN (at least at one time but I can't find any such guidelines anymore) clearly state(d) that upvotes should be for comments that create interesting discussions and should not be due to agreement with the poster. The converse should also be true, essentially, downvotes should be for trolls. But since I was <i>meta-commenting</i>, something that has been well documented and relatively cherished on this site as a way of maintaining quality and preventing the typical downtrend of other aggregator sites...my comments shouldn't have been downmodded to begin with. (I can almost guarantee that this comment will reach at least -3 at some point for example).<p>To make it worse, the downmodders aren't actually providing any interesting commentary either, they don't even post a rebuke or a comment chastising me for violating some imagined HN guideline because <i>they know that they have no grounds to do so and are only downvoting out of malice and disagreement.</i><p>So, on the same day that I meta-commented that non-topical-HN posts that show up on reddit and immediately show up on HN right after that and then got my ass handed to me for pointing that out (of course with no commentary), an actual <i>post</i> regarding reddit->HN posting shows up and even offers a technical solution to solve this problem shows up not only on HN in the new bin, but on the front page near the top.<p>So of <i>course</i> I meta-meta-meta-comment that this is rapidly becoming ridiculous. It's not the slide to reddit that the HN community should be worried about, it's the slide to schizophrenic insanity.<p>There, so that's the topical explanation since the pithier ones didn't satisfy you.<p>So as not to just complain about the problem, but to offer solutions:<p>HN is a news agreegator, but more importantly it tries to drive interesting and informative discussion. I believe that the modding system <i>as is</i> creates an environment where the HN community is slowly moving towards an echo-chamber-like groupthink a la reddit or digg or some other aggregator. The reasons for this are actually relatively few and are largely addressed in guidelines, but otherwise ignored by the community at large:<p>a. When people post otherwise interesting comments, their mod score is more a function of opinion popularity than a driver of further commentary.<p>b. When scores for a comment are absurdly high (anything over +10 in my book), it drives people to also post comments that are similar. Since comments with high scores appear to be a function of popularity and not discussion drivers, those are the types of comments we are starting to see, and the responses tend to be not sources of discussion and debate but rather ""yeah, that was a popular comment right there"" followed by more upmods.<p>c. When scores for a comment are absurdly low (anything below -3 in my book), it drives people to not want to post. <i>Even if they might otherwise provide an interesting viewpoint that drives further discussion, even discussion in absolute disagreement with the OP</i>.<p>The result is that the only people who are posting are people that craft comments that fit the group-think popularity metric and are not necessarily drivers of interesting discussion.<p>I'm not saying HN is there yet, but I'm certainly seeing the same signals I saw on /. and digg and reddit. They each tried to address the problem in different ways. /. uses a karma system where a poster can get a karma score, but also a comment meta-tag ""funny, insightful, etc."". This creates relative freedom for people to post a variety of comments that drive completely unique kinds of discussion depending on the meta-tag, it also addresses the severe lack of a sense of humor at HN. digg and reddit, on the other hand, tried to diversify topically, hoping that technical people would hang out in /r/technical and politically minded people would hang out in /r/politics etc.<p>In general, I'm not terribly satisfied with the commentary /. provides, and I think both digg and reddit's approaches have proven to not work once their respective communities grew too large.<p>My proposal is that HN institutes the following modding rules:<p>1. New posts are scored 0. The scoring seems to work this way anyway, so the +1 next to new posts isn't really correct anyway. I don't know off-hand what the algorithm is that determines when a post is counted towards karma, but it's not immediately clear to the user. This also encourages better comments that can earn points by driving discussion.<p>2. If a person is to be up-modded beyond some small number, say +3, then the new up-modder <i>must</i> post at least some comment. This provides insight into why people might find a particular comment good and worthy of praise. The number of times I've seen a 4 word snarky comment with a mod-score of +43 is <i>far</i> too common. If a comment deserves that many points, it better be <i>so</i> good that people can be bothered to at least say ""I agree with that, that's just like the time I..."". And write a sentence or two. This also prevents the reddit/digg effect of somebody making a statement they know is popular with the community just to get mod points. I've noticed this starting to happen on HN. It's the <i>unpopular</i> opinions that create the better discussion IMHO -- and these are just the kinds to receive copious down-mods.<p>3. If a person is to be down-modded below -1, then the down-modder <i>must</i> post a reason for their downvote. This provides insight into why people might find a particular comment poor and worthy of scorn. The number of times I've seen perfectly good, interesting and informative comments (and yes, I'm excluding myself from this) with a score of -11 or something is likewise far too common. If a comment is so poor that a -1 score doesn't clarify to the author that it was a poor comment, then I think the author deserves a reason why. This prevents downvotes on pure disagreement, or for interesting but otherwise unpopular opinions. And large numbers of downvotes will have appropriate commentary as to why that opinion was hit so hard. This prevents the inevitable ""why was I downvoted for my perfectly valid commentary?"" which the guidelines <i>do</i> admonish. Rather than some nebulous guideline though, I think this should be part of the logic of the site. Futhermore, if a comment is to get a very low score, say less than -10, then it should just be auto-flagged. Anything that poorly scored is likely to be offensive anyways.<p>4. As a general rule, meta-comments should be allowed and encouraged. This helps HN self-police, and also can provide it's own interesting meta-commentary and meta-discussion. Point of fact, both of my heavily down-modded comments received a number of replies in the form of serious meta-discussion that would have been interesting to flesh out and explore, but the down-mod frenzy drove possible discussion away like a case of bad B.O.. Yet I lost probably a dozen karma points for my troubles.<p>Rules 2 and 3 in particular are designed to force people to craft comments that drive discussion (which, as I understand it, is the point of HN) and not drive popularity. Combined they also prevent a different kind of social effect, one I like to call the wikipedia effect, that of people that feel it is their god-given right to arbitrate some self-selected rules of the community they inhabit and prevent all newcomers from playing in their playground. More than anything, I think this kind pf pathetic ""narcissistic-pseudo-moderator"" effect harms a site more than anything else and makes it an unwelcome place for new voices. Guidelines against such behavior are one thing, but simply making that philosophy part of the function of the site I believe would be far more useful.<p>There, that's my 2cents worth.",1261625083

All barriers were passed. But the same barriers that I've passed without noticing may effectively discourage someone else.<p>Programming language is just UI of the complex automation system. It should be as easy, clear and intuitive as it can be. In my opinion same general rules should apply to computer languages design as to UI design. Designing good language is not about how to enable programmer to use hashmap (or whatever) with fewer keystrokes but how to make a man that has never seen a hashmap before to know at first glance that it might be solution to his problem and how to use it.<p>> Therefore any attempt to turn a programming language into English is not going to address the real difficulties of programming<p>Turning words into English is not gonna help much. But finding metaphors for programming concepts (for example dictionary instead of map) that are less mathematical and more similar to concepts encountered in everyday life might improve accessibility of the programming world.<p>I also think that computer should try to guess what you mean by what you are writing not give you a finger over a missing semicolon or quote. If there is ambiguity in what you have written he should ask you additional questions to establish what you want.<p>> It's like making a bike easier to ride by gluing the rider to the seat - sure it's technically ""harder to fall off"", but the problem isn't usually the rider falling off the seat - it's the whole bike falling over, taking the rider with it.<p>I see simple programming languages and systems more as a training wheels that protect you from falling off with the bike and never trying again. They introduce you to concepts of pedaling and steering so you can get some fun out of this activity and eventually teaching you how to keep balance by not punishing you too severely for loosing it.<p>> Likewise, the hard part of programming isn't remembering precise and finicky syntax - it's making sure your own thinking is precise and finicky enough that you can accurately express it in such a finicky, precise language.<p>Right. Even if you know exactly what is the datatype that you want to define you may have a hard time expressing it properly in C even if you are pretty good novice programmer.<p>That is just anecdotal example of syntax that can be obstacle even for smart people. We might have no idea what syntax might be obstacle for less mathematically inclined.<p>> I'm not arguing in favour of long function names (I'm not entirely sure how you got that from my post) -<p>Sorry. I mentioned PHP and that particular function because PHP is often perceived as too easy language that enables people who don't get the programming concepts to program and make a mess. I strongly disagree with that notion. I think that PHP's popularity is due to some very good decisions simplifying design (like single datatype to express various lists, dictionaries, arrays, lack of need for conversions between strings and numbers, run and forget model without long lived server side entities) and it's security issues are due to some very bad design decisions (one of them being the one I mentioned).<p>> I'm arguing against people who think that by changing ""print('Hi there');"" to ""print 'Hi there'"" they've somehow solved the problem of ""programming being hard to do"".<p>Claiming that such operation solves the problem of ""programming being hard to do"" is just silly because making programming easier is much harder thing that involves some real research on how people learn how to program.<p>But I think that this improves things slightly. Every unnecessary operation that has nothing to with you goal and lies between you and your goal is bad. Same as in UI design. All this ( ) ; is strange crap for graphic designer who wants his Flash flick to go to given page after clicking on it.",1261624902

1013314,comment,1013024,1013165,0,0,bokonist,,,"Here is my broader case against monetary dilution ( what you call inflation):<p>1) In the modern U.S. dilution happens as follows: First banks loan out the same money multiple times. Eventually, years later, they get called on this and there is a bank run ( example, the run on the money markets a few months ago). The Fed then steps in and guarantees all deposits. A guarantee by the Fed to print out money to back a deposit is no different than actually printing money. Thus the whole cycle is equivalent to the government taxing savings and spending that money on subsidized loans to borrowers that have been approved by the nationally recognized rating agencies.<p>2) From 1995 to 2008, the money supply was diluting at ~9% a year. Just look at MZM ( <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MZM</a> ). This is an extraordinary rate of dilution. As a result, Americans trying to save lost a lot of money in real terms. An investor who ten years ago put their money in 50% CD's/50% stocks would have lost money over the past ten years. Even 100% CD's would have lost money. The only investment that can protect against that kind of dilution is gold. But investing in gold is hardly productive.<p>3) The actual loans the government printed money to fund, went to McMansions, leveraged buyouts, commodities speculation, and credit card debt. These were neither productive nor in either of our interests. They are the classic case of Austrian malinvestment.<p>4) The rapid dilution forced people to put their money in any place but dollars. However, this did not produce ""investment"". It produced massive asset bubbles. People were not carefully considering business fundamentals. They engaged in herd behavior, putting their money where everyone else was putting it. They turned everything from stocks to housing into psuedo-money (ie not valuable because of dividends, but because everyone else thinks it is valuable). Sure there were a few gems that came out of this process, like Google. But most of the money was burned up in Vegas real estate and companies like pets.com.<p>5) Since I define economic growth as ""producing more of what people want"", taxing people to pay for subsidized loans does not result in economic growth, even if it increases the GDP numbers. Subsidized loans might result in more oil pipelines being built. But if people wanted more oil pipelines, they could have signaled that to the market by buying more oil. Perhaps what people really wanted to was to retire early and spend more time with family and friends. Taxing their savings to fund oil pipelines would thus make it harder to retire and result in less of what they wanted - that's economic decline, not growth. The government does not know what the people want better than the people, so it should not tax their savings to force them to spend money in certain ways.<p>6) The asset bubbles have made the prices of everything more expensive, from housing and oil to bushels of wheat. Some of these prices are now starting to come down, but a return to dilution will send them right back up again. As a result, for the past 35 years real standard of living has been stagnant. While Moore's law has brought some new technological gadgets, higher housing and commodity prices have forced us to work longer hours just to make ends meet.<p>7) Investing is not something that just magically works for everyone. Investing takes skill. A stock market investor is an owner of that company. Most people are not smart enough to be owners of companies. They are not even smart enough to pick out a mutual fund that can properly manage a company. Thus the net effect of the mass entry into the stock market from 1980 to 2008 has been to almost completely destroy it. People make crappy investment decisions, then more regulations are put in place to protected them. These regulations then bring the stock market into a state of permanent stagnation. Just look at SarBox.<p>8) If a fiat currency could be run with a dilution rate of 2-3%, it would be acceptable to me. We came close to this before Bretton Woods ended. I'd prefer 0%, which would be even better than a gold standard. But I am skeptical that we will ever return to that kind of stable fiat currency. The political pressures to dilute are too great. The U.S. has come perilously close to destroying its currency twice in thirty years ( 1979 and early 2008).",1261624027
