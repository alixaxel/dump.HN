The upper\nlimit of a Dets table is 2 GB. This means the upper limit of a Mnesia table is 2 GB if the\nstorage type is disc-only copies. For other storage types the upper limit depends on the\nsystem architecture. In 32-bit systems the upper limit is 4 GB (4 * 109 bytes), and in\n64-bit systems it is 16 exabytes (16 * 1018 bytes).",1260287974

Everything else in here is fluff or misinformation. The author of this article clearly had a paucity of material at his disposal, because he almost immediately flies wildly off the rails and just starts paragraphs about any form of non-standard language he can find. Slang, argot, jargon, foreign loanwords, accents, dialects: all of these disparate topics she lumps under the umbrella of 'slang', and solicits 'experts' to just provide some sound bite, any sound bite, about any of the above, so she can fill out space.<p>The BBC, sadly, is consistently wretched when it comes to reporting about language.<p>I have to say, though, I do appreciate the subcurrent of racist fearmongering that she could slip in there. Even though the article is allegedly about the dangers of slang and its overuse, she manages to wend around to let us know that our beloved English Cockney (a non-standard variety, of course) is itself under threat by some barbarous cocktail of foreign influences.

Everyone has both traits in different amounts, and if you have a functioning team, they can be split up unevenly.<p>In this way of looking at things, I'll freely admit to being more of an implementer.  If someone asks for what they want, I'll do my best to make the software do it in a way that's efficient and delights the user.<p>Given vague instructions, I'll do my best, but with mixed results.<p>But when I team up with someone who always has new ideas - I can actually sort through them, figure out which ones will work, which ones will meet the goals, and synthesize them into great product.  Most people can't do that with their own ideas.<p>I think the original quote - and it's short, not a full essay, so this criticism is mildly unfair - elevates the innovator too much over the implementer.  When in reality, you win when you have both, that know their own strengths and limitations, and are grateful for the other.  I produce better work when I pair up with an innovator, and so does he or she.  And the two of us will dominate over a dual-innovator team.<p>Also, realize implicitly in everything Paul Graham says, you can add the words, ""For a startup technology company.""  That's what he knows, that's what he values.  There's a lot of work out there that needs implementers, and innovators would be frustrated, unsuccessful, and miserable at.  Don't feel threatened if you're not Paul Graham's Ideal Entrepreneur/Programmer.  I'm not.  I'll never be extremely rich, most likely, but I'm happy, good at my job, valued by my company.
