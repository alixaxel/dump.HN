Though SEO is a part of our work, the real money is in traffic. We achieve a better than 1/100th CPA cost with SMO as compared to PPC with Google.<p>Think about it. Someone who clicks through to your page from Twitter/Facebook/Linked In is a known quantity. What do you know about someone that clicks on a paid link in google. Nothing. What does it cost for that click? Only your monthly publishing cost per account divided by total clicks per month.<p>And when someone walks through the door from SMO, you got a @name, you can look up their bio, you got their thoughts in their tweets, and you know where they are from.<p>And it cost a fraction of the price you pay Google for an unqualified, anonymous click. And with Twitter you have zero click fraud.<p>I have cracked the code on CPA using Twitter and it begins with killer content. And I use staffing in the Philippines which cost 1/15th American dollars for same person, no taxation, no flooring cost, no legal issues.<p>If I were Google, I would definitely figure out how to buy Twitter before it eats their PPC lunch. There are a whole lot of us X-PPC guys who no longer pay ridiculous fees to the search engines.<p>As for the Turk, the cost is a little more than the PI and with your own staffing, you get the added bonus of continuity. You also get the benefits of knowing your staff, weekly quality review meetings, standardization of process, and a consistent quality that I found missing with Mechanical Turk.<p>I would still recommend MT though for anyone running a few sites who needs less than full time commitment for projects.",1261965200

1017945,comment,1017694,1017936,0,0,antirez,,,"Yes indeed, the plan with redis-cluster is to support multi-key operations only if all they keys hash the same (the user can enforce this by using the special key-tags, for instance 1234.{foo} and 4567.{foo} will be guaranteed to hash the same).<p>So it will be up to the application logic to make sure that all the keys that are required to be used with multi-keys operations will be on the same node.<p>But what I think is that if one wants to write a really distributed and scalable application that can use already some form of application-level partitioning, or that can will use redis-cluster in the future, the way to go is to just use Redis single-key atomic operations, and try to make the application resistent against minor inconsistencies that can be calculated before hand.<p>For instance in the email linked in the story we are talking about a very common pattern. Example: for X be put in category Y it's needed to have two sets, one is like X.categories where there is the Y category ID, and one is Y.objects where there is the X object ID. Writing a distributed application that is designed to scale with multiple nodes using redis-cluster or any other solution, the best thing to do is that the application itself is able to deal with the case of Y id being in X and X id not in Y or the contrary.",1261965005

1017940,comment,1017708,1017708,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>In the end all of their impressive designs are doing nothing but making more work for themselves and everyone around them. It’s as if their work is only designed for getting them their next job, rather than keeping them in their current one.</i><p>Given a particular frame of mind, though, this is perfect.<p>These complicated designs are about keeping their current jobs. They are making more work for themselves and those around them, and that is entirely the point. They aren't looking to their next job, they are looking to assure there will always be a next task. If they didn't create complexity that need to be constantly coralled, they might run the risk of the project being declared complete; yes, a risk.<p>The problem is their frame of mind about their professon. If the project is completed, one of two things will come true:<p>1. They will be moved to a new project.<p>2. They will be dismissed from the company, and have to find a new company and a new project to join.<p>So the second is really just a degenerate case of the first. They will be on a new project. There are a few reasons people would honestly be scared of this.<p>They might assume that there is a small number of projects left, and they are all near-fully staffed.  If they lose this current project, it may be the last project they ever find themselves on, because no one needs anything built anymore.<p>If they find a project, they can't coast. With their current project, they are applying design and refactoring patterns they already learned to a system they already understand. A new project means they'll be faced with an unfamiliar architecture and code, and their usual ways of looking busy aren't going to work until they learn the new system well enough. It means they have to start thinking about what they are doing and start working hard again, and there are a lot of programmers -- and people in general -- who are <i>really</i> averse to being forced out of a routine process they can perform without thinking.<p>A new project also means they might end up under competent leadership, who can tell when they are coasting, and will call them on it. This means, even if they learned the system well enough to know where to start blindly refactoring to patterns, they wouldn't get away with it, because the people supervising them would know they are just wasting time. Again, a lot of people won't like this.<p>Finally, a new project means someone might expose themselves as completely incompetent and faking it well the whole time. They picked up enough bits and pieces to sound intelligent to those who don't know how or what to judge, but just for the project they were on. The specialized jargon is now irrelevant, and the general understanding of concepts isn't there.<p>Even in my short journey so far as a developer, I have run into multiple examples of <i>each</i> of these, and they annoy me to no end. The ivory tower systems Zed is railing on about are just a symptom. The cause is people terrified of being forced into unfamiliar territory, and the risks involved.<p>The other part of the problem is that the people who judge the programmers are not listening to the masters -- as much as we have masters-- even when the masters kick the experts' ass. Perhaps this is part of our profession needing to grow up, but right now programmers are judged in most places by people who would be audience members at a martial arts tournament. They have no idea about the technical skill of what they are seeing, and so they can <i>only</i> judge things on aesthetics. To them, the experts look talented, because they are doing a tremendous amount of moving around, acting threatening, and expending energy; the masters look lazy and unskilled by comparison. It almost looks like the master has to be cheating when the expert gets slammed to the mat. I wonder if the audience to a master programmer might perceive the same thing.<p>A question which I am still uncertain of: is this reliance primarily on the aesthetic instinctual, or is it learned behavior? It seems to be responsible for a number of extremely poor judgments made, even in very recent history, and I think it is worth asking if such a reliance is inevitable. I'm not dismissing aesthetics entirely, just wondering why we seem to have it weighted wrong.",1261964630

1017928,comment,1016282,1017860,0,0,guelo,,,"I never said that tax increases are good in general, Republicans are the ones that claim that every tax increase is going to result in the end of the republic.  My personal belief is that at the margins taxes have little effect on overall economic growth, especially when they are targeted at the upper income levels, and they are generally a better way of paying for government than financing it with debt which seems to be Republican's preferred way of paying based on the trickle down theory that tax cuts to the rich will pay for themselves by stimulating the economy and thus increase tax receipts. When I look at the economy that resulted from Bush's tax cuts (i.e. a slow jobless recovery) vs Cliton's tax increase my conclusion is that there's very little correlation between taxes and growth and that we are very far on the left side of the Laffer curve.<p>On the housing issue, we disagree very much on the cause of the problem. I believe the problem was the deregulation that allowed the creation of entities like AIG Financial Products which was probably the major sink of risks that drove the bubble, and also there was a catastrophic market failure that allowed Wall Street to run their companies into the ground for short term gain.  But there's no way to deny that a LOT of private capital was directed at the building of useless condos.",1261964095

You need a way for someone like me to be able to see that product A is considered better than product B, and no, number of up votes doesn't do that. All it tells me is that more people purchased item A and thought is was not rubbish. This may mean the product has been on the market longer, or just has better marketing. Seeing that 50 people gave product A 3 stars, but 10 people gave 5 stars to product B carries more information<p>Being able to see the distribution of votes is also important. Some products are divisive, with some people loving them (5 stars) and others hating them (1 star), and other products are just uniformly considered average (3 stars). Showing this distribution also tells me more about the product than just showing me products C and D both average 3 stars<p>Reviews. No idea how you'll do this, but you absolutely need a means of encouraging people to write good informative reviews. Allowing users to rate reviews seems to work for some places, and productreview has some sort of rewards scheme based around reviews. Given that no product is perfect, it's a well written review that allows me to see what the faults are and figure out if they're likely to be an issue given the way I intend to use it. It's the reviews that flesh out <i>why</i> some users gave a product 2 stars and others gave it 5. If, for example, I wanted to buy a mobile phone and I could see that the people who rated it 1 star did so because the sole carrier in that country has lousy coverage I'd know that didn't affect me as I have (being in Aus) 5 different carriers from which I can purchase said phone.<p>Oh, I like the clean layout of the site. looks good.",1261963739
