When I was in high school (public HS in Converse, Texas, just outside of San Antonio), I was fortunate enough that most of my classes were AP or honours classes and we were highly intellectually competitive. Those classes that I didn't have AP for were, on the other hand, sheer torture (on many levels).<p>The introduction of AP and other advanced classes was a godsend for intelligent kids being able to be reaffirmed by their peers. But a lot of kids don't really want to be in school, and like to pick on kids who do. (Which was my experience as one of the ""smart kids"" at a private school in Charleston, South Carolina.)",1261580397

It might be readily solvable simply by moving those people who are affected.<p>For example, consider the Maldives, with 300,000 people making about $5k/year. Relocating every person in the Maldives to the US would probably be cheaper than most climate change solutions. This would also quadruple the standard of living of the average Maldivian, provided their income increases to the US poverty line.",1261580310

1012119,comment,1012007,1012007,0,0,Freebytes,,,"I have seen these issues first hand with my own family.  Last year and the year before that, my daughter was given 3 hours of homework each night.  The first year the massive homework began, I attributed it to the teacher and told her that it would be better the next year.  The next year came along, and it was even worse.  So, I talked to the teacher, and the amount of homework went down slightly, but in my opinion, it was still too much.  Other than math, I really do not think there is much benefit in home work.  This year, she has four different teachers and only about 30 minutes of homework per night, and interestingly, she is learning more now than she did in those previous two years.  I think homework burns out kids.  After a day of school, they should be able to come home and put those new abilities to use in play they consider fun.  I figure if the teachers cannot teach a kid when they have 7 hours per day to do it, they are doing something wrong.  Her current teachers are doing something right.
