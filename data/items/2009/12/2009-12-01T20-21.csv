They are super dim compared to other choices. For $35 dollars you can get something with the physical size of a regular light bulb (which matters because I want to screw them into an existing fixture) but they only put out 200 lumens (!) as compared to 800 lumens for a 60-watt bulb or its ~15 watt compact fluorescent equivalent.<p>Looking at the design of the unit, on the light-emitting side there was an enormous span of wasted black plastic, with fake plastic unneeded heat-dissipation fins taking a bunch of space, and with three LEDs arranged in the center. With better design, you could probably fit 12 or so LEDs in the same amount of space, and then it would be a product worth buying.<p>Anyone know the story about why LEDs are not subsidized by state energy programs as CF bulbs are in California?",1259700399

The most well-researched, insightful reporting is still just a recapitulation of something else, some a set of facts or opinions that exists independently of the reporting.  Journalists do not create content in the same way as authors, musicians, software developers, etc.  They go out, gather information of interest to their audience, filter it, repackage it, and distribute it to their readers.<p>Traditional journalism is effectively information retail.  The internet threatens it not by making content free - there is no copyright on reality; the content is already free - but by connecting audiences directly to primary sources. The main advantage that journalism still maintains - a critical and thorough filtering function - is now being challenged by new infrastructure developments, social networking platforms, Twitter, increasing maturity of the blogosphere, etc.  These factors diminish news reporting as a packaged product, and return it to the context of an open conversation.<p>What I think Murdoch and Hinton are really attacking is not news content being made available for free, but the internet revealing that news isn't actually ""content"" at all.

A good version of it is to be found in <i>Founders at Work</i>, as told by Max Levchin (the nerd who mostly solved fraud for PayPal).  Turns out the early story of PayPal is the story of solving the fraud problem...so it is extremely relevant to this discussion.  PayPal also started as a company doing security and payments on portable devices, so it's doubly relevant.<p>As far fraudulent devices, I think it's pretty safe to assume that people aren't going to be swiping their cards with random people; rather merchants and vendors that they already have a reasonable level of trust with, but in situations where sales would have been limited to cash only or more complicated and PO-based (trade shows, live events, sales guys in the field, etc.).  It won't stop the kinds of fraud that already happens; like your waiter at a restaurant keeping lists of card numbers for sale on the black market.  And, I guess it would make that kind of fraud easier, since the attacker would have more information.<p>But, people are, I think, pretty cagey with handing random people their credit card outside of the context of a reasonably trustworthy business.

Even a beggar can get in on the use of this currency.  People can easily give to a beggar with almost no overhead, and the recipient can spend the currency almost anywhere.<p>Credit isn't anywhere near that yet, especially since transaction fees are non-trivial.  However, there's been a pretty major barrier to receiving credit payments, and even if someone was willing to pay the fees, there hasn't been a good way to interface with it.<p>Let's say I pay for two coffees with credit, and a friend wants to pay me with credit for one of the coffees.  Even if I were willing to pay the transaction fee, I couldn't take their credit card, easily.  PayPal is close to that point, but square is closer.<p>Settling trivial, private debts with credit will be just as good as any currency that works for all debts, public and private.",1259698016

I'd like to see a test where they set the number of workers equal to the amount that fit within 512MB's of ram or something similar. I'd say using passenger + ree you'd be able to double or triple the number of workers for the same amount of memory and blow the rest of the stacks out of the water.",1259697885
