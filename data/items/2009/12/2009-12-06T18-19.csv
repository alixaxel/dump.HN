979957,comment,979905,979905,0,0,cstross,,,"Money shot: <i>In any event, in order for the e-reader market to thrive publishers must lower their wholesale prices so that distributors can turn a reasonable profit.  We believe that if the price is lowered enough publishers may earn less per unit, but could ultimately earn more in overall revenue and profit through a greater number of sales.</i><p>Except they can't.<p>I gather (can't cite my source) that amazon were leaning on British publishers to give them an 80-90% discount off list for Kindle books. Normal trade discounts are in the 40-55% range; anything over 60% is harsh, 70% has the publisher losing their shirt (making a loss). Remember, about 10% of the cover price of the book goes to the author, and the publisher takes another 10% to cover editorial/marketing/production costs, even if you don't include covering chunks of dead tree with ink (another 10%). (Unfortunately, the ""physical"" production costs don't go away if you switch from paper books to ebooks -- publishers still have to run a royalty accounting system for authors who expect to be paid a percentage cut per book sold.) The other 70% of the cover price goes to the supply chain, or is split between the supply chain (aka Amazon.com) and that nice 30% discount Amazon gives you, the customer, for shopping with them. If they're lucky, the publisher can keep 10-15% of it for themselves -- and that's the profit their shareholders dine out on.<p>The major publishers are between a rock and a hard place over the ebook discount setup. Relatively nimble small players and startups such as Baen's webscription subsidiary (www.webscription.net) can add new boilerplate to newly signed book contracts that free them to pursue more ebook-friendly business models, but how do Penguin re-negotiate every contract for a backlist of on the order of 40,000 titles?<p>Amazon have built a business model on disintermediation -- they've replaced wholesale distributors <i>and</i> the bookstores they feed with a single hybrid entity, and therefore take the tranche of profit that would formerly have fuelled both those earlier types of business. But there isn't enough slack left in the supply chain to let them cut prices further -- not without eating into the author's cut (long-term fallout: fewer books get written), the publisher's cut (long-term fallout: fewer books get published) or the reader's wallet (books cost more).<p>I bloviated about this back in 2007 ... much less has changed since then than most people seem to believe:<p><a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/03/why_the_commercial_ebook_marke.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/03/why_the_...</a>",1260125811

Worry about your customers.<p>Consider the possibility that a well-heeled competitor's launch of a competing product will be <i>great</i> for you. It all depends on the size and state of your market. Their effort will almost certainly grow the overall market, because they have so much more PR money than you. Their product will get reviewed in all sorts of places. Many of those reviews will compare the product to the existing alternatives. Provided you stay competitive and have a bunch of fans, one of those alternatives will be yours. You will then get lots of incoming links from people who are shopping around in this product category that they've never heard of before.<p>Your competitor's product won't be the same as yours. And if it is the same on day one, two months later it will be different again, because you will <i>change</i> your product in response. Surely the world of tabletop RPGs is big and variable enough to support two approaches to the same product.<p>An alternative way to look at my point: If the competition comes up with some kind of killer feature that your product lacks... you can add it. If they try some feature that nobody has tried before and it flops... you will know not to try it. They're doing R&D for you, at no cost to you.<p>If their product is better than yours, your customers might still stick with you. Every customer you land before the competition ships is fairly likely to stick. They're <i>invested</i> in your product. Who necessarily wants to cut and paste all their campaign materials into a new system?<p>And there is no guarantee that their product will be better than yours. It might be bad. Terrible things can happen, even to projects run by the very best of programmers. Wait and see.",1260124303

There are opinions in this article that I disagree with, however.<p>For example, I disagree with the statement that ""... classical Mendelian genetics based on family studies has identified far more disease-risk genes with larger effects than GWAS research has so far.""<p>First, under selection, one would not expect common variants to have tremendous, deleterious effects in general. Second, it is not true that Mendelian studies are superior to GWAS in, say, lipoprotein genetics. There, virtually all of the genes known from studies of Mendelian disorders have been re-discovered through GWAS, with many new findings that were previously unknown. Furthermore, a substantial portion of lipid heritability (~20%) could be explained by GWAS-identified loci as of January 2009. There there is little reason to believe that common variants (>=5% minor allele frequency) should explain all of heritability; so far, so good. The upcoming 100,000 individual lipids GWAS should do a pretty good job of sucking at the marrow for the remaining common variants.<p>We work with the tools that we have. SNP-chips enabled GWAS. Now that ""next-gen"" sequencing (worst buzzword ever) has brought down costs, the thousand genomes project will provide us with a list of nearly all variants with MAF>1%. Well-funded groups can afford to deep sequence their population of choice. These provide information that is <i>complementary</i> to the information obtained by GWAS.<p>In conclusion, GWAS is good for finding common variants. Imputation from thousand genomes should be good for finding low-frequency (>1% MAF) variants. And sequencing is good for finding rare variants. There is no crisis.",1260123196

Most available CPU cycles are wasted by the processor being idle.<p>I know these numbers come from VM people who are talking their book but the oft quoted number even for servers is 5% CPU utilization.<p>Due to the scoping rules in most imperative languages a look up table implemented in this manner will generally reduce the cyclomatic complexity of a method which is a major source of bugs, also you see this pattern implemented in most functional languages as a match statement.<p>Most statements about performance are by people talking their own book.<p>As for how this is different than a switch statement, you are failing to realize the importance of higher level concepts, do you use only NAND statements in your logic?

Stress takes years off your life. You will die early, probably of a heart attack, if you don't correct things.<p>2. It is possible for two different individuals to look at the same exact situation as insurmountable/overwhelming or, on the other hand, challenging and fun. It really is a perspective thing.<p>3. Without knowing the exact details of your situation it is impossible for the untrained folks (i'm assuming here) to know how much of your stress comes from you and how much comes from your current situation. Certainly it's a little of both--but the % is critical to understand.<p>4. You need to talk about these issues with a life coach, career coach or even therapist. They will give you  objective feedback on the state of affairs.<p>5. If this helps, when I was younger in my career (Silicon Alley Reproter days) I would sometimes internalize the bad situations my business was facing (i.e. ""What did I do to cause this?"" or ""Why didn't I see this problem coming?""). This made me anxious. As I got older, and hopefully a little wiser, I wouldn't internalize these things. In the Weblogs, Inc. days I would look at problems as challenges. My internal dialogue morphed to ""Oh, this is an interesting challenge... I wonder what ideas my team can come up with to overcome these roadblocks?"" and ""If we resolve this issue we're going to soar!"" This is called attribution theory in psychology and it's a very important concept to understand IMO.<p>6. Life is short and you get one shot at it. Don't be proud or stupid: get help and get out of bad situations as quickly as possible. Do not stay in a bad situation, like many smart people do, out of some ""tough it out"" philosophy.<p>Good luck with it and if you wanted to talk about it with someone ping me at jason at calacanis.com.
