The notion of ""iteration solves all problems"", in particular, comes from the leanstartup zealots who don't sit back and think before they launch into the iteration process.  Turns out, as do many things, that it ends up taking <i>longer</i> to get to product/market fit than if you are more disciplined early on.",1260806342

994324,comment,993632,993632,0,0,dpatru,,,"Khan did the obvious thing for someone trying to make good use of his time: he recorded his lectures so that he wouldn't have to repeat them. This allowed him to create lectures for most of the K-12 math and physics curriculum single-handedly and without government support in about five years. Khan is not a teacher by training nor, as far as I can tell, is he a member of the NEA (National Education Association.<p>How much would a government-backed program to deliver 35,000 lessons per day on any of 800 topics have cost? How much is government paying now to do the same thing? What would education be like if it was completely consumer driven with no government support? Khan is serving a market for free that is already being served by government for billions of  dollars. In other words, an entrepreneur would have a hard time in education because the government is already giving away so much for ""free"".<p>My intuition is that there are great efficiencies to be gained in any industry that ""benefits"" from government support. Besides education, other industries that could benefit from innovation would be transportation (especially roads and bridges), health care, courts, corrections, and police.<p>The reason why more innovation is not happening in these areas is that government support is removing the incentive to be more efficient. The people performing these services are not rewarded for drastically cutting costs.<p>It could be the case that these industries are already operating at peak efficiency, but the fact that there is no obviously better way is not proof of this. Innovation is sometimes only obvious after someone with the motivation to look for it has implemented it. If someone had asked the department of education to make instructional materials for the entire K-12 math curriculum and deliver it to tens of thousands of students a day for 5 man-years of work, the dept would have said it couldn't be done.",1260806200

Titanic was a terrible movie and should have been a dud.  It was not enjoyable to watch for me, and it was the first and only movie I walked out on.  (I returned around the time the boat started sinking.)  However, Aliens, Terminator, etc. are some of my favorite movies.  To see his talent is to compare his movies to their sequels by other directors.  Terminator 3 was terrible.  T4 was good, but it did not compare to T1 and T2.

However, even I can pick out a number of items in his lib that shouldn't have been handled the way they are:<p>- He declares $ in a global context without first checking for its existence;<p>- He uses RegExp objects <i>constantly</i> -- in 50 different places in his full ""mylib.js"" -- including in cases where a simple indexOf would be better, and, best yet, he doesn't bother to cache them in any of the dozen or so cases that I examined. Wasn't that one of his criticisms of someone else's code?<p>- His treatment of camelCase is truly embarrassing, relying on an ugly RegExp every time it's called. Try something like this instead:<p><pre><code>    _camelCases = {width:'width', height:'height'};
    _camelCaser = function (p) {
        return typeof _camelCases[p] != 'undefined' ? _camelCases[p] : _camelCases[p] = p.replace(/\-(.)/g, function(x, y){return y.toUpperCase()});
    }
</code></pre>
There, now you only need to camelCase the property for anything <i>once</i>. JavaScript's object handling makes caching this kind of stuff soooo easy. And, if you do have to have a camelCasing function, try to do it with as little overhead as possible -- use the tools that JavaScript gives you, instead of capturing the string parts in a match and then .join()ing them and all that other nonsense.<p>His library doesn't demonstrate any of the kind of specialized language knowledge that he accuses other library developers of lacking, and it has at least some of the same weaknesses that he criticizes others' works for.",1260804170

'It' being the awful call performance (data and apps were great).<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one...  So why DID I put up with it?  Part of it might be a love-affair with Apple due to their exceptional marketing and the near mythical status of Steve Jobs.<p>Consumers aren't stupid-- but I can't imagine how you could think that all of your decisions are rational... Or even most of them.  Ever done any A/B testing?  Why would an orange button perform 20% better than a blue one?<p>What about priming studies?<p>(more thoughts in an old blog post: <a href=""http://www.tonywright.com/2007/the-fuss-about-macs-priming-and-racism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tonywright.com/2007/the-fuss-about-macs-priming-a...</a> )<p>Here's the interesting bit:<p>Bargh and several colleagues chose a group of undergraduates as subjects and gave them two scrambled-sentence tests. The first test was sprinkled with rude words like “disturb,” “bother,” and “intrude.” The second test was sprinkled with polite words like “respect,” “considerate,” and “yield.”<p>In both cases, the tests were indiscreet. None of the subjects picked up on the word trend consciously. But it primed them subconsciously.<p>After taking the five-minute test, students were asked to walk down the hall and talk to the person running the experiment about their next assignment. An actor was strategically engaged in conversation with the experimenter when the students would arrive. And the goal was to see how long it would take students to interrupt.<p>""Bargh wanted to know if the subjects who were primed with polite words would take longer to interrupt the conversation than those primed with rude words. They thought the subconscious priming would have a slight affect. But the affect was pretty profound in quantitative terms.<p>The people primed with rude words interrupted, on average, after only five minutes. But 82% of the people primed with polite words never interrupted at all. Who knows how long they would have patiently and politely waited if the researchers hadn’t give the test a ten-minute time limit. [Note by Tony: Those damn ethics committees... Milgram would never be able to get away with his experiment today!]""",1260803456

For me, Clojure was/is easily one of the most exciting developing events in programming languages in 2009.<p>I started following the language around October 2008 and I've seen the mailing list go from 500 to close to 3K. Amid this growth both the mailing list and the IRC channel have remained helpful and friendly. Useful tools are popping up everywhere, and more and more people are using it as the secret sauce in their projects.<p>And even if you don't like the language (being a Lisp), it's hard to deny that Clojure's ubiquitous use of persistent data structures and rich variety of concurrency primitives have made what previously seemed academic and esoteric concepts practical and everyday.<p>If you're a Clojure fan or even an open source advocate, think about chipping in!<p>I have a feeling 2010 will be yet another great year for Clojure ;)",1260803241
