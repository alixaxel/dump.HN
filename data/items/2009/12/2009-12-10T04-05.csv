It could result in a down-mark.<p>It is really good to be confident, but in reality your undergrad work might be a lot less brilliant than you believe it to be.  Some universities will actually co-venture with you if your work is patentable, etc and although you end up sharing revenue, they might foot the up-front legal costs (which can be rather substantial) - again, research what applies in your particular case.<p>Good Luck with your project and subsequent ventures.",1260421148
987333,comment,987112,987299,0,0,anonjon,,,"Well I'm sure a lot of clubs open and fail. But one has to assume that if you are opening a club, you have already been successful somewhere else. There is a much greater portrayal of starving musicians than there are starving club owners.<p>It clearly follows that if you were not elsewise successful, and able to buy a club, your cousin Vinny has gifted this club to you in an offer that you simply could not pass up.<p>Failing as a club owner almost directly implies that you failed in a secondary, non-career pursuit. The only way you can really starve in that situation is if you are a complete moron and actually invested your own money.<p>Millions of guitarists, however, go hungry in the streets every day.<p>Besides if you've taken out a loan to get the club, are you really a club owner? It seems like you are a proprietor most.<p>Besides, the point of analogies is that they be based on easily falsifiable things that /seem to be/ true. An analogy is a metaphor. You know, literature fluff.<p>This comparison doesn't /seem/ to be true, whether it is or not.",1260420926

Everyone in the U.S. has access to emergency health care and many have access to quite a lot of non-emergency health care for free.  It is definitely not all or nothing currently.<p>I do care greatly for my fellow man, but, many of my fellow men are quite adept at taking advantage of the social welfare programs already in existence.  Due to her line of work, my wife has, on numerous occasions, visited the homes of people living off the government.  Far too often these people are capable of working, but find the trade off not worth it due to the implicit marginal tax rate.  The existence of the social welfare programs not only enables unemployment, it also encourages it.  Also, discouragingly, these same families often have greater luxuries than mine (nicer cars, house, tvs, gadgets, etc).  While anecdotal, this experience is VERY common in my neck of the U.S.<p>Just because I am responsible, work hard, and frugal with the money I make, I have to be paying to enable and encourage others to do the opposite?  How is that good in the long term for them or myself?  At what point should I stop working, because if I do work, the taxes will be so high I won't gain a better living standard than if I didn't?<p><a href=""http://mises.org/daily/3822"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/3822</a>",1260420728

987320,comment,986866,987111,0,0,ephermata,,,"Yes, you're right, 2001 was a tough year to graduate. That being said, von Ahn's focusing on PhD programs, where the time to finish may be as short as 3 years, but more likely is in the 5-7 range. While these programs do pay a stipend, if you stay in the program for the entire time (instead of dropping in, waiting out the recession, and then leaving), the total compensation over those 5-7 years is likely much less than you would make in industry if you'd gone to industry straight out, even taking timing into account.<p>One key thing is that a ""great"" EECS grad student stipend, say the one offered by the National Science Foundation fellowship, is (or was) $25K. Most tech salaries are 2x or 3x that or more. A lot of grad students make less. So if you made $0 for the first two years pursuing industry, then landed a job at $50K, you've made up those two years. (Not really, of course, due to tax issues and the fact you had to defer the money, many grad students make less, etc.)<p>Another key thing is that if you stay in a PhD program for the full 5-7 years, the economy may change radically around you. So if you stick with it, you forego the higher-paying jobs available at that time. Of course, you could always just drop out and start a company or something at that time...plenty of people do.",1260420512
