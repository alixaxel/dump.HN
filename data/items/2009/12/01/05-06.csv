Take my Garmin GPS for example, it's got a resistive screen that, coming from a daily iPhone user, just <i>doesn't work</i>. I have to practically stab it with a fingertip to get it to register, and even then it's pretty consistently wrong, and will often think I'm tapping the button next to it.<p>Argh.<p>The iPhone set the bar - and manufacturers have responded. I doubt you will find a single manufacturer now who is trying to peddle resistive touchscreen phones in their new products. Nokia, Moto, HTC, etc, appear to only have capacitive touchscreens on the roadmap - for good reason.<p>Most tablet PCs are feeling incredibly dated for the same reason - IMHO the next product to enter this field will need capacitive sensing, or die.",1259647107

969311,comment,968086,968727,0,0,aristoxenus,,,"I'd just throw in that if someone uses your code to try to reproduce what you've done, they may actually just be reproducing a bug -- or in the sinister case, reproducing a faked result.  So a more general point in this whole discussion would be that making the code available isn't always as important as making the mathematics or other theory behind the code available, and ""reproduction"" becomes ""reimplementation"", or some other corroborating element of the process as described by timr a few comments down (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=968456"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=968456</a>).<p>(Of course for large software endeavors that isn't practical either. So mattheww's point about trust unfortunately resonates.)<p>As for the proprietary issue, I think sometimes it might actually help reproducibility: if you can just drop a few lines of script into Matlab and examine them, it's potentially a much smaller task with a lot more battle-worn, common-ground code factored out than examining or re-implementing a full library of open code.",1259646468

String tries were roughly 10x slower than binary searching an array for a 20k word corpus, which is probably around the size you're dealing with here.  They have terrible cache locality - each character makes you follow a pointer, which is probably a cache miss, and the total size of the trie is on the order of 26 * 8 * 20k = 4M.  They become a bit better if the number of distinct words in the corpus is small (so that everything fits into cache) or if the number of words is huge (so that your hashtable or array blows the cache anyway).",1259646413

969304,comment,968502,969043,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Yeah, MRI is Ruby 1.8.<p>I imagine 1.9 would perform a great deal better.  Since we're scraping entirely on single-CPU machines, the GIL probably wouldn't hurt us much.  We rewrote the scheduler and our interface to the HTTP client using Scala, however, so now we're pretty wedded to the JVM.<p>However, if we were to use Ruby 1.9, we would have to spend more time investigating HTTP libraries.  From our experience, it's worth it to have workers threads NEVER block directly on IO.  We saw a huge increase in reliability by having worker threads (1) send a request to an event-based client, running in its own thread and (2) block on a future with a set timeout, waiting for the callback.  Having individual threads talk directly to the sockets, in either MRI or Java, wasn't a promising approach.  If sockets got wedged (and they do, even using very reputable HTTP libraries) the event-based approach keeps on humming, while the blocking approach grinds to a halt.<p>There exist several event-based HTTP clients for Java that all work well (though some significantly better than others).  Compare that with Ruby, where we couldn't find anything that mature.<p>That's not to mention all the concurrency primitives available in Scala, Clojure, and the underrated java.util.concurrent.<p>Even if Ruby 1.9 might look much more competitive to JRuby in synthetic tests of concurrent performance, in the real world the Java ecosystem features tons of libraries that helps one write reliable, predictable code quickly.",1259645968

969298,comment,968083,968696,0,0,paraschopra,,,"Doing the math here. A/B Tests with conversions are modeled as  binomial variables. So the standard error of the conversions here is sqrt(p<i>(1-p)/n) where p is conversion rate and n is number of hits (p</i>(1-p) is standard deviation of binomial distribution). Calculating standard error for both of your versions - sqrt(0.002*(1-0.002)/2834) = 0.0008 and for the other SE is 0.0017. Now since there are large number of trials, you can model the difference of two binomial distributions as a normal distribution, standard deviation of whose is sqrt(se_1^2 + se_2^2) = 0.0019.<p>Now the way significance is checked is by using single tailed  z score (we are testing if the difference in two distributions is statistically significant and greater than zero). Z score in this case is p_1 - p_2/std that is (0.008-0.002)/0.0019 = 3.1579 which is way larger than the critical value of 1.65 (which corresponds to 95% confidence).<p>So, the difference is indeed statistically significant. A note of caution is that some theory says that you cannot model a binomial distribution as a normal distribution until you have at least 10 successes or failures, which is the case here.",1259645666

I normally don't like to play the pundit on the side shouting ""I told you so,"" but in this case I think Arrington et al deserve the criticism.  They've had the hype machine running full blast for a year now.  The TechCrunch name alone guaranteed that early adopters would buy the things in massive numbers.  However they couldn't cross the finish line with the product.  The CrunchPad therefore doesn't deserve any more attention than any of failed consumer product ideas that never saw the light of day.",1259645658

If I was their age, I wish someone told me how frustrating it is to have not tried my hand at being an entrepreneur.<p>Do I tell these interns the frustration I feel and that they should think long and hard about whether they want to join to big corporate world?

However, I wonder if they will eventually start feeling frustration down the years and start thinking the same thoughts as I am now?<p>Anyways I've chosen my path.
