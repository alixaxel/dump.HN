1017695,comment,1017189,1017683,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> As for your contention that Python is not good for web apps, that's just straight retarded and doesn't deserve a further response.<p>Im not sure that contends a good reverse argument ;) but anyway... (I do stand by the statement somewhat though; it was never designed to be a web language but as a general purpose successor for ABC, any web implementations are incidental and I still contend that it cant beat purpose built ""for the web"" languages :))<p>It's a difficult call all round. I used to code PHP that way - but one good book (I forget which) and some experience with Frameworks cured me of it. It's probably similar for other languages; the person I know best who swears by Django does pretty much the same thing (horrible code)<p>Not good for web apps is perhaps not the point I was making (it got confused in trying to be concise). More Im saying that if the OP is sat there knowing some PHP and wondering where to go next if his aim is to make a web app I would say: go make a web app in PHP. There is no killer advantage that makes Python better for the web than PHP (for me PHP is better for the web - but that is a somewhat subjective choice).<p>if his prime aim is to learn a new language - and he also wants to make a web app RoR is a good choice. Again because it is tailored for the web.<p>If he wants to learn a language and wants something general purpose which also will do him for web work Python is a great choice.<p>To make things even less clear; if you want to do something specialist Python is probably your ""best foot forward"".<p>The problem with Web apps is that the web server is by far the greatest leveller. It removes any clear advantage Python has over PHP :)<p>I am mid/high experienced in Ruby, Python and PHP and I <i>personally</i> would say PHP was the best choice for a basic web app with Python bringing up a <i>very</i> close rear :)",1261950893

Hell, I didn't even know how to run a PHP script without loading an URL in the web browser.<p>That's not necessarily a fault of the language, but the books available for PHP taught me how to code that way.

What you saying is very true of stack-overflow and although I visit occasionally their whole karma formula does not appeal for the reason you mentioned. I was thinking in similar lines and have introduced the groups concept for example when you belong to the 'lisp circle' you will be able to earn additional points when you answer or solve lisp problems. My concern is not to let the users focus too narrowly, I was thinking that joining groups should be limited i.e, when you accumulate 100 points you can join a group and as you earn open up more groups...

But any time I deal with money people it always seems to seem like a heroic waste of time. Sometimes, as the article points out, it's almost comical.<p>For instance, I was interested in some grant money the state had available to high-tech startups who were pre-launch. Hey -- states need businesses to grow, and micro-investments at the pre-prototype stage looks like it makes a lot of sense. Their website bragged about the mission they had to encourage innovation, especially in the web and communication sectors (which I'm in)<p>So I get a referral from a couple of folks who know them (referral: check). I was introduced via email (personal introduction: check) Then they had me complete a form that took 3 hours which asked ridiculous questions like income projections for three years out. Finally I get a phone interview.<p>The interview lasted ten minutes, in which time I learned that a) the interviewer hadn't bothered to read my application before now, b) they were really interested in post-launch businesses with a growth record, c) really what they wanted to do was bigger-money investments, d) the interviewer had no experience in how to monetize the type of business I was in and didn't seem to want to hear anything I had to say about it, and e) no, the answer isn't no, just let's talk again in a month or so.<p>I mean come on. Let's get real. Until you respect my time as much as your own we're not going to get very far, whether you choose to invest or not.<p>From all I can see, something is deeply wrong in the way most all of these relationships are being created. I can see and understand that most companies fail and that most interviews are a waste of time from the interviewers standpoint, but that's the name of the game, folks.

If all the developers were as good as the senior developer added on later, I'm sure it would have went much better.<p>My main point remains the same though, and I think is one that we can both agree on - that hiring inexpensive labor with only focusing on the front end user experience, without any respect or idea of how well the back end is being constructed is a bad idea.
