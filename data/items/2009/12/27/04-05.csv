In general it leads to rent-seeking behavior and slow decay while the current owners try to wring every last possible nickel and dime out of users before reselling the husk down the line to someone else who thinks they can squeeze a few more pennies before the state eventually steps back in to clean up the mess.

At issue is generally some sort of asymptotic advantage, not a guarantee of ""language X will always be superior every time always"". In fact, for any pair of one easy and one hard problem, I'm pretty confident I could find (or invent, if necessary) two languages that each beat the other for solving one of the problems.<p>The claimed benefits of a more expressive language generally involve things like better management of application complexity, or greater ability to modify and restructure late in the project. Hammering out a program of a scale such that the programmer can keep an accurate model of the entire thing in mind at one time, and that is only written and never modified, would be more a measure of the programmer's typing speed and the sophistication of the IDE used than anything else.",1261889625

It would seem that to do infrastructure especially in the middle of a recession (when you might be able to get it done cheaper) is the time to do it.  That being said, you have to layer on the inevitable inefficiencies/corruption when such projects are rushed in order to have any impact to a recession.<p>I wonder if there are more creative ways to go about it like encouraging private firm participation through road privatization (which means that you get the same impacts without the government spend from private firms that are incentivized to be more efficient to maximize ROI).  There are also creative experiments like congestion pricing that have the potential to greatly recoup costs while improving productivity.<p>There also obviously environmental impacts though of cheap free roads which have also been blamed for enabling urban sprawl.  Again, it would just seem to me that yes, infrastructure is important (and much of the existing infrastructure is aging and needs to be replaced) but the way that we've gone about building it in the past and in how it's being proposed to build out now as stimulus, is less than optimal.",1261888313

The ideal study would need to be of a large and complex system that was recreated several times in several languages. You'd need to verify each system behaved the same, and that the teams on each version were nearly equally competent in their respective languages. Even that would be poor, since it would be a single data point. Perhaps a particular language was simply good at that problem!<p>Despite that complaint, the above is nearly impossible to do in practice. So you have to settle for smaller problems, which can be done in several months perhaps. Even at that, it would take some very difficult collaboration, and would still be a single data point.<p>Further complicating issues is the academic world vs. industry. Again, ideally you'd want to do the test in industry, with an appropriate team of programmers and managers. But industry doesn't want to waste time with such academic matters, nor does it want to open it's code for analysis.<p>In other words, it's a very difficult problem to address, despite being seemingly simple on the surface.",1261887983

(Excluding direct bribes.)<p>Outside of specific narrow areas our society is still more predicated on convincing people with power than those without it.  Elections tend to ride on a tiny number of issues like abortion and outside of major issues like Chinese trade and Iraq there is little point to convince a Midwestern voter that you are correct.",1261886795

However, he does use the U.S. major airline safety record as the standard (to which the cited foreign carriers fail to rise). U.S. major airlines conduct most of their operations with U.S. and Canadian pilots at U.S. and Canadian airports.<p>The error chain leading up to an accident is an old concept. The key to preventing accidents is to break the chain, which is typically best done by a pilot who has a lot of extra situational awareness. Sadly, situational awareness mostly comes with experience, so educating a 150-hour pilot about the error chain is not going to enable him or her to deal with a challenging situation as well as a 5000-hour pilot.",1261886622

I know in some states simply carrying lockpicks is illegal (probably MA too for all I know, but I do it anyway), let alone taking them on a plane. I was thinking, ""shit, shit, shit, shit"" but knew that if I played as sincere, naive and innocent (which to a degree I was all three) then I'd be fine.<p>I do know however, just as in any situation with any law enforcement (or quasi law enforcement) that you do not lie to them. You talk around the truth like an Aes Sedai if you must, but don't lie. If you are pulled into a room for more questioning and you're forced to reveal that you lied, it will be much worse to get out of.",1261886572
