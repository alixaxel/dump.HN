988965,comment,988479,988479,0,0,axod,,,"I've just completed implementing WebSocket support into our Mibbit webserver.<p>The interesting part is this:<p>Currently, we use XHR long polling, keep alive. Basically a raw socket with some HTTP header spam mixed in.<p>On the plus side, we can deflate/gzip the contents (unfortunately not across messages, but still does well). But on the negative, the HTTP headers are often about the same size or larger than the contents.<p>So, webSocket will improve the situation, in that there won't be HTTP header spam. Also we'll be able to use a single connection instead of two (One for sends, one for recvs). On the downside, there also won't be any deflate/gzip (Unless implemented in js etc).<p>The other big bonus with WebSocket is you can connect to a different port. Something that's not possible (For some idiotic reason) with XHR.<p>It'll be interesting to see which one wins :)<p>Pretty cool to see this in Chrome, I thought Firefox would be first to implement it.",1260492950

988958,comment,988762,988762,0,0,czstrong,,,"China has been buying the U.S.'s debt since the mid 90's, when they pegged their currency to the dollar, in order to maintain their peg and keep the yuan from appreciating.  From 2005-2008 they abandoned their peg for a managed float and let their currency appreciate about 21% due to pressures from the U.S. because their currency was artificially undervalued which negatively affects the global trade balance and the global economy.  In 2008, however, they went back to the peg to protect their export sector and to stabilize their economy and have remained with the peg since.<p>China has actually dug themselves into a large hole with their monetary policy.  The yuan is grossly undervalued and needs to appreciate, however, if they let it appreciate, their U.S. denominated holdings, mostly U.S. Treasury Securities, currently valued at $2.4 trillion, will lose value.  It is also in their interest to keep buying our debt because it allows us to keep interest rates down and consume more, and the U.S. is China's largest export market.  But on the other hand, if China tries to sell their securities, this will lead to increased supply in the market which will drive down the price of the securities, which will in turn decrease the value of their holdings.<p>The financial crisis has led to the depreciation of the dollar, and the yuan along with it since it's pegged, compared to most other currencies.  This has greatly impacted the emerging and developed countries' economies that rely on exports for growth because they simply cannot compete with China's artificially low export prices.<p>This is an interesting issue and it will be interesting to see how it plays out.  To get a great summary of the current situation, this is a great, quick read that sums it up nicely: <a href=""http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS21625.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS21625.pdf</a>",1260492689

988896,comment,988867,988867,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"To square a number, adjust it up and down by the same amount to get two numbers.  If you choose carefully, one of them will be easy to multiply by.  Multiply them, then add the square of the amount adjusted.<p>Ex: 53 x 53 converts to 50 x 56.  50 x 56 (using your methods) us 100 x 28, or 2800.  We adjusted by 3, so add 9 giving 2809.<p>I used this the other day to compute 3^10 in my head and stunned my work colleagues.<p>3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2.<p>243^2 = 200 x 286 + 43^2 = 57200 + (40x46+9) = 57200 + 1840 + 9 = 59049.<p>Alternatives:<p>240^2 + 6x240 + 9 = 57600 + 1440 + 9 which are all numbers geeks might know (although this is a completely different method)<p>243^2 = 236 x 250 + 49 = 118 x 500 + 49 = 59 x 1000 + 49<p>Finally, 3^10 is also 9 x 3^8, and you should all know 3^8 is 6561, because that's so close to 2^16/10, so the answer is also 65610-6561, but I can't do subtractions like that in my head.<p>As with most things, constant practice helps.",1260490068
