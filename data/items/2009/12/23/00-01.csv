It is also based on the assumption that novel inventions necessary mean it should be protected in the market place because of its presumed usefulness. It also mean that you believe an invention can be judged objectivity to be obvious or not.<p>You also forget the enormous difficulty for reforming the patent system to the economic benefits of the masses due to regulatory capture by special interest. If you want to reform the system, you have to reform the overlying political system that allow such regulatory capture in the first place.<p>Secondary, I would like to direct your attention to a book called <i>Against Intellectual Monopoly</i> by two economists, Michele Boldrin and David K.

What if one abbreviated compound situations using a single word or a phrase along with a separate file with expansions of the abbreviations into more detail. So, one can comment at a more abstract level and still be understandable (using say, a tool which displays the expansion when hovering over the abbreviation, or a separate window with expansions of all the abbrevs used nearby).\n Ideally, of course, the abstraction would be captured in the code itself, and the expansion would be the comment before the function or the macro defining the abstraction.

1011206,comment,1007202,1009771,0,0,Locke1689,,,"No I think that's a false comparison. Simply because I <i>favor</i> my computer science classes over others when they compete doesn't mean I don't receive a breadth education -- it simply means I'm a computer science major. Doing nothing but computer science would be treating college as vocational school, but that's not what I said. Instead I said that sometimes I sacrificed high grades in other courses for a high grade in computer science.<p>In addition, there's only a loose relationship between getting a very good grade in a course (as opposed to a good-mediocre one) and getting breadth knowledge out of the course. To believe otherwise would be to satisfy tendencies of grade inflation. For example, an A in a course was originally supposed to mean an excellent performance beyond expectation. To get an A in every single course should signal that you are either 1) extraordinarily dedicated to your school work and extremely bright or 2) the school is handing out an A not for extraordinary work, but only good work. In light of this, the most reasonable grade distribution for a bright, dedicated student would be a very strong (hopefully A level) grade distribution in their area of specialization with a good but not as extraordinary distribution in their breadth subjects.<p>It was interesting that you noted me as focusing on CS like vocational training when I actually take pride in my choice of courses as  true liberal arts education. For example, while I am an engineer CS major, I will have taken enough courses in the physics and philosophy departments to almost qualify for a minor in the fields. Simply because I am unable to dedicated my time to all of my varied classes at once does not mean that I do not participate in number of different liberal arts.",1261529450

1011167,comment,1010930,1010968,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I grew up in Taiwan, so I think I can shed some light on this. IMHO ""the average"" Taiwanese student will work harder than the average American student, but not by a supremely gross margin as this article would imply.<p>The bottom-barrel students never end up in American colleges, after all.<p>The chief difference is cultural - in Asia intellectualism is celebrated and demanded. Parents don't push their kids to football, they push them to academic achievement. Not being able to make it into college isn't worn as a badge of honor, it's downright shameful. I have personally known people who've shipped their kids away from home to some backwater third-rate academy, just so they can hide the fact that the kid couldn't get into any school locally.<p>Beyond parental pressure, peer pressure also largely pushes people to academic achievement. Having high marks won't get you beat up - in fact it commands respect (within reason). Having poor marks likewise isn't cool like it is here, but is similarly embarrassing.<p>Keep in mind though, that this has some consequences that academics who opine about the lack of American work ethic consistently fail to mention:<p>- Appreciation and participation in the arts, both as a college study, and as extracurriculars, is ridiculously low. People who study the humanities are looked down upon, I even know one guy who got disowned for it.<p>- Social integration takes a backseat, often to disastrous results later. In Taiwan is it not irregular for a middle school child (age 12 or so) to be at some form of school for 14 hours a day. There's literally only spare time to eat and sleep (and sometimes not even). Socialization is minimal, and add this onto the culture of living with your parents well into your 20s, it produces some seriously socially inept people.<p>Japan is already dealing with these consequences - look up ""hikkikomori"" if you're interested.",1261528114

1011144,comment,1010307,1010307,0,0,olliesaunders,,,"I've shared Yegge's disdain for static typing for quite some time. One of the best examples of how awful it can be is type hinting (optional type constraints on parameters) in PHP. Many times I've explained to people why type hints are awful thing deserving banishment to hell — along with Facebook suggestions and Microsoft product recommendations — but so many PHP programmers seem to love them! Now that I read this I can see why that sort of thinking is bound to exist for a language like PHP (read: noobs).<p>Recently, however, I've been getting into Haskell and in doing so I found my opinion on static typing left a little beaten in the legs and suffering some obvious facial wounds. Static typing works in Haskell, I'm pretty sure of that. The question I'm left with is, why?<p>I think it might have something to do with the fact that type checks in class-based OO languages don't even begin to insure the program correctness that novices are often foolish enough to think they do. Everyone else recognizes the need for all manner of testing, and that's how correctness is proved (albeit, approximately) in imperative languages. In Haskell, I've found that type checks go quite some way to proving correctness, no really! (They don't actually prove correctness but proofs of correctness would be impossible without them). Without even bothering to do any proofs or testing you get a much more rigorous check for correctness in Haskell than you do when a Java program successfully compiles.<p>I can't emphasize this difference enough. To me static typing in Java is an annoyance and a lie. And so when I program in a language that teeters between static and dynamic typing, such as PHP, I go out of my way to write libraries that make things more dynamic (I've got one GitHub) and I call men who advocate aforementioned type hinting, girls names. In Haskell, it's totally different; it actually works; it's actually useful. Not to mention the clever stuff that you can do with types which I couldn't begin to do justice here given my inexperience.",1261527197
