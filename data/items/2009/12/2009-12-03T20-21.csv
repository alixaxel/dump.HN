""Third, Google claims that this service is better because it has no ads or redirection. But you have to remember they are also the largest advertising and redirection company on the Internet. To think that Google’s DNS service is for the benefit of the Internet would be naive. They know there is value in controlling more of your Internet experience and I would expect them to explore that fully. And of course, we always have protected user privacy and have never sold our DNS data.

I know it's been discussed extensively around here but it seems like our use case might be slightly different than other typical web apps, either requiring an extra step or different solution than the average e-commerce transaction..<p>The basic concept: An e-commerce site with multiple vendors showcasing their products, company will take a % of each transaction (listing fee) before sending each vendor the remaining funds. (somewhat similar payment structure to http://www.kickstarter.com/)<p>I am looking for the best solution to allow users to checkout on the site using a credit card - I do not like what I've seen with either Amazon Web Pay or Paypal Adaptive Payments so far.. it looks like both of these require users to be redirected to their site for secure checkout.  Reading the development forums for Paypal, seems that there isn't any planned support for Website Payments Pro and Adaptive Payments together (unless I'm completely missing something).<p>Steps to Successful Transaction:
1. Customer visits site and makes a purchase using their credit card (without leaving our site)
2. For using our site the vendor is charged a % transaction fee
3. Remaining funds after fee deductions are sent to vendor<p><i></i> Need to think about the best way for these transactions to happen, and also look at all of the fees involved with moving the money each time.  Should funds move to vendors each time a transaction is complete? At the end of each day? Once every 30 days?  Without an elegant solution it seems like this could get messy rather quickly.<p>Many thanks for your help!",1259873773

The sets objects are not general enough to implement anything else than... sets (that's what IntSet's interface defines). So if TCO is that crucial in this case - let's go: no stack implementation in a no TCO language which doesn't violate the ""don't inspect the elements"" constraint. `contains(x)` is the main abstract function that initialises local `cf` with local `__contains(x)`, then does `cf = cf(x)` until the result is a boolean and not a closure. Now every object can construct whatever chain of calls it needs, there is no relaying on `cf` coming from an IntSet interface (or .contains() being available) and there is no call stack. `.adjoin()` can modify the local object's checking function in any way it needs. Still not really doable in java because it cannot return a ""closure or boolean"" type, but python will do just fine.<p>Edit: that article really bothers me for some reason... probably because I expected better from LtU - so I implemented <a href=""http://bitbucket.org/viraptor/ootr/src/tip/intset.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitbucket.org/viraptor/ootr/src/tip/intset.py</a>",1259872071
