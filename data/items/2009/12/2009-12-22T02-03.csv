The .mirror_include and .mirror_exclude files are just newline-delimited lists of file masks (they do what you would expect). I did it like this so each user can modify his own exclusion/inclusion lists (the file belongs to the user), and doesn't have to mess with the cron script (which belongs to root). Inclusion takes precedence. As an example, my exclude file:<p><pre><code>  .* # any file that starts with a period
  tv # my tv shows directory

Despite the similar usage, German complicates things further by splitting the primary and auxiliary verbs, with the primary being transported to the end of the clause:<p><i>Ich sollte nach Hause laufen.</i><p>Literally:<p><i>I should to home run.</i><p>This is no coincidence, since English grammar is basically a simplified version of German grammar.  There's a clear continuum from German to English via Frisian and Dutch where the grammar is continually simplified relative to its Germanic root.

1009271,comment,1008097,1008715,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Making the shareholders legally liable is a bad idea. To start, it defeats one of the primary purposes of incorporating (more companies would remain as private entities, and enjoy lower taxes and fewer reporting obligations). In order to justify shareholder liability, more individual control by the shareholders would be necessary. Think of what the decision process would be like if America were a pure democracy. If voters were responsible for what their elected officials did (think corruption by our officials), then we would demand more control over their actions - Why have them if we make all the decisions anyways? The same is true for corporations. Shareholders elect board members, who in turn elect managers who run the company.<p>The execs are responsible if they commit fraud via the company. I think that making the board of directors as responsible as the management is a good idea, since it requires the board to police the company, instead of turn a blind eye to the management team's fraud when it's producing positive returns. The individual shareholders though, should not be liable for the actions of an often distant management.",1261450327

Conjugating verbs is a good example: coming from a Latin language, English verbs are almost trivial, but I doubt that the reverse is true.  If you wanted, you could put together a list of criteria, such as complexity of grammar rules, how common exceptions are (very common in English, for example), whether the writing is phonetic or not, etc. etc., which should give a rough basis to compare languages.",1261448550

The movie industry (<i>qua</i> theaters) is not really about movies so much as it is a marketing operation for comfy chairs, sugary drinks, and popcorn.  Hence the big-budget movie emphasis on the 'wow' factor, best appreciated via a 75-foot screen.<p>To some extent, it's always been this way. Look at Shakespeare: most of his plays are set in foreign countries which would have been terribly exotic to his audience, or are concerned with battles, magic, or murder - it's all pretty sensationalist stuff.<p>With this sort of big-budget production story complexity takes a back seat to putting the audience 'into' the experience. <i>Gattaca</i> is a fine sci-fi movie that turns on a clever script and strong acting performances, but it wasn't exactly a box-office sensation. But it was pretty cheap to make. with something like <i>Avatar</i> you want a story that everyone can follow easily rather than one that risks alienating any segment of the audience. Epic stories generally try to minimize ambiguity and complexity: the payoff is emotional rather than intellectual.",1261448300

You are confusing  issues of corporate governance with issues of fraud. There are some important issues that the law should address about how much power shareholders should have over their officers, and how much information the officers should be compelled to share. I can think of a 100 reforms I'd like to see that would give more power to shareholders. A CEO is a hired hand, just like a janitor or an electrician, but CEOs have vastly more power to do harm to shareholders interest than any janitor or electrician. Enron is an outstanding example of this. But of the 100 reforms I'd like to see, none of them look anything like Sarbanes-Oxley.",1261448229
