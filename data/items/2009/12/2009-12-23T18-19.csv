1012582,comment,1012466,1012466,0,0,BobN,,,"It's a crap shoot. Just like starting a business is. I was the technical-guy (CTO)/co-founder with a ""business"" partner (CEO) many years ago. All went well for the first few years, but as we grew he was unable to move from the entrepreneurial role and let the organization grow. His micromanagement doomed an attempted expansion into a larger market and the company floundered because of it.<p>Getting a company off the ground takes very different skills than what is necessary for growing a management team and developing real business strategies. It’s kind of a catch-22 - you need the entrepreneur to get started, but once you get there he or she may not be the right person to get you to the next level.",1261594742

Some of us, like myself went and looked at it ( http://help.apple.com/iphone/3/mobile/ ) and then pulled it down and put it up on github so we can take a look at what they are doing and learn how we too could do some of the same  css transforms, transitions and ""flick"" scrolling like they do in their code.<p>Well, it looks like Apple is scared to death of that idea.  They want to make sure that the web-app experience on the iphone (except for their own help system) remains crippled and seemingly second class when you compare it to one of their native apps (even though their own help system shows the it <i>is</i> possible for it to be just as good).  It looks like they went straight to gitHub and forced them to take it down.  Here's the email I got from them.  Bummer!!<p>I'm writing to inform you that we have received a takedown notice from Apple regarding your repo, PastryKit.  We have made the repo and all forks private so that they are no longer publicly accessible.  If we do not receive a counter-notice from you within 10-14 days the repo will be deleted.<p>I would like to encourage you to read up on the DMCA takedown procedure and your rights here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act<p><pre><code>    Tekkub

It was a small project that engineers were just doing in their spare time. So that's one example. Facebook too from what I've read. Facebook was just a little stalking like tool Mark created with his friends for Harvard kids. I'm sure when they started they never saw a real scope outside of that. Both of these <i>small</i> projects grew into large projects, because of their success. What I'm trying to say is that you typically can't set out to create just a small project.<p>The nterface story was definitely just the next level of luck based co-founders. Although, we really did meet by chance. I probably should have gone into more detail that I did in fact hire Dave and Jason to design/program a small project that I was working on. I contracted them out rather than chose them to be my co-founders.

I imagine that they lead to a lobe in the brain that's able to both generate and process mind-to-mind communication.  Maybe something like our temporal lobes and Broca's area which handle hearing and language processing.<p>If this type of appendage evolved early enough, then all of the descendants with a common ancestry could maintain a common communication link.  This would have had to evolve very early to be shared between both plants and animals, but I suppose it's conceivable if you can imagine plants with a nervous system.  Another possibility is that there is a strong mechanism for genetic transfer between different species and kingdoms (maybe very flexible retroviruses or unseen genetic engineering), but then you might expect to see more shared features between plants and animals.<p>The part that I didn't understand why why the Na'vi would always be the ""masters"" in the link with the other animals (it seemed more peer-to-peer in the link with the trees).",1261593391

Agriculture, and later city-building, is all about destroying nature to build a new environment better suited to our needs. What if, because of the deeply interconnected nature of Pandora, the Na'vi evolved to include the surrounding nature in their in-group? That would imply that, for a Na'vi, morality would apply to a tree as much as another Na'vi. Clearing forests for crops would be tantamount to mass murder.<p>The Na'vi culture is definitely a ""Noble savage"" stereotype, but note that they have a warrior culture.

It happens slowly, starting with the use of naturally occurring tools, like chimpanzees do with sticks, or certain octopi do with coconut shells.  Some birds use rocks as tools.<p>Tool use evolves up from there, but if we look at our own species as an example, it probably doesn't ever really stop.<p>The Na'vi are probably more like echoes of human beings at an earlier point in our evolution, with the added property of having an intrinsic physical link to the environment around them.  If the ecosystem ties directly into your CNS, you're going to think real hard before engaging in widespread destructive behavior, because you know first-hand how painful the damage is.  So things like mining, which gave humans metal, would take the Na'vi longer, because they'd want to find a way to do it that won't cause them a ton of pain.<p>But they'd get there, and since Cameron is talking about sequels, the next installment may very likely show how contact with humans has pushed the Na'vi on to a more rapid path of technological development.<p>And your post really doesn't deserve to be downvoted, so it got a +1 from me.  Come on, we're discussing the science fiction in a movie. :)",1261591267

Let's talk about why a 60-democrat senate cannot pass this or other Progressive legislation.<p>Here it is: The country has gotten more liberal in the last 10 years. But it's not 60% liberal. Not even close.<p>Democratic gains have been easy gains, politically speaking. The party ran conservative Dems in conservative districts. All in all I'd rather have a conservative dem than a liberal republican -- at least a conservative dem will contribute to the Democrats having control over committees and procedure.<p>But what I really want -- and what I think this country needs -- is a progressive. Democratic, Green, Indy, whatever. But, a progressive.<p>Everybody acts like Democrats should be able to pass progressive legislation just because there's 60 Dems in the Senate. Count the number of Progressives.<p>The work that needs to be done -- the activism and organization -- is to promote the progressive agenda at the grassroots level. We need to attack on all fronts to move the country left, the same way the Conservative trio of the Reagan Admin, Think Tanks, and new Media (including direct mail and, say, Rush Limbaugh) moved the country right in the 80's and 90's.",1261591232
