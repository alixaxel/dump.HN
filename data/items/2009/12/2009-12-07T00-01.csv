From his Wikipedia page:<p><i>Crosby exerted an important influence on the development of the postwar recording industry. In 1947, he invested $50,000 in the Ampex company, which developed North America's first commercial reel-to-reel tape recorder, and Crosby became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings on magnetic tape. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 200 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of multitrack recording. Along with Frank Sinatra, he was one of the principal backers behind the famous United Western Recorders studio complex in Los Angeles.</i><p><i>Through the aegis of recording, Crosby developed the techniques of constructing his broadcast radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) that occurred in a theatrical motion picture production. This feat directly led the way to the use of the same techniques in the creation of all radio broadcast programming as well as later television programming.</i>",1260147384

980438,comment,979501,980055,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>So technically yes, you could get away with calling this pass-by-value. However, the spirit of pass-by-reference is maintained for any part of the data that most people care about.</i><p>And if there's any time you can afford to be loose about the spirit vs. the ""technical"" letter of the thing, it's when you're talking to a compiler.  Right?  I agree with the article.  If you don't like the meaning of a technical term with a clear meaning, or if you simply don't have any occasion to use it properly, that's no excuse for repurposing it <i>in the same context</i> to mean something different that leads to confusion.<p>It's worthwhile to remember that (true) pass by reference isn't just a curiosity from obsolete languages.  It's common for people entirely new to programming to expect that function parameters might, or actually do, work that way.  The terms are at least useful to explain things to new learners.<p><i>In my opinion, if you want to insist that Java strictly follows pass-by-value, then I think it has ceased to be a relevant distinction.</i><p>Even if you work only with pass by value languages, you should still respect the terminology.  Some mathematicians only work with continuous functions, but they don't say, ""Hey, this word 'continuous' would be a lot more useful if we redefined it to draw a useful distinction among the functions we actually work with.""  So ""pass by reference"" doesn't mean what you want it to mean and doesn't seem very useful to you.  Invent your own terminology.  Don't destroy existing terminology by sowing confusion.  And that's all you can accomplish -- there are too many people walking around who already know what ""pass by reference"" means for you to get away with redefining it.",1260146901
