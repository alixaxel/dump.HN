994218,comment,993939,994162,0,0,barrkel,,,"Fundamentally disagree with you on exceptions. Exceptions as implemented in e.g. Delphi or .NET work very well. In C++ the complexity of exception handling is deeply exacerbated by things like copy constructors - the bias in the language towards (what I call) value-oriented programming, rather than object orientation - and in Java exceptions are hobbled by the misguided notion that exceptions should be handled nearer the point of the throw rather than far away, in the relevant main loop of the app; hence the requirement to trace through annotations throughout the call graph from low-level throwing code to high-level catching loops, or basically avoid the bad design with RuntimeException.",1260802447

I don't know anyone who writes CGI code in C anymore. If we wrote compilers as often as we write shopping carts, or web forums, or wikis, there would be just as many tools available to make the job easy.

I'll write a shorter, clearer introduction soon, I promise.<p>The problems that occur when your JavaScript (jQuery) code starts piling up are nothing new. I've been finding ways to organize my code for ages.<p>The idea behind behaviors is simple really:<p>1. Encapsulate some type of functionality within a good old function.
2. ""Attach"" this function to some elements as their ""behavior"".
3. Methods and properties of all behaviors can be accessed from anywhere, which allows interaction.<p>It's a simple object-oriented philosophy and it's nothing new. I just think it would be nice to have a standard way of organizing huge piles of JavaScript without having to use some huge JS framework or moving too far away from the jQuery coding style.",1260801730

Amazon also, of course, pushes all their other products to help deal w/ this problem.<p>They do also mention that it is 'by the hour', which I'd double check that it doesn't include fractional hours, but after the instance has been up for ~55 minutes, you have your 5 minute warning.<p>You do, however have a really good point with the up-sell off the 5-minute warning. I wonder if that could be too easily gamed. When that 5 minute warning comes the spot instances tell the normal-instance key node, which then requests a bunch of spot instances at 2x the current spot-instance price to be able to finish the current 'set'. (But then also request a bunch more spot instances at below the current spot price, in an attempt to drive down spot instance pricing.)<p>The other thing is that it is region specific; which means that you could target the EU region from the US west coast to get work done on spot-instances during the day.",1260801391

But a thought that is unexpressed is equivalent to a business idea. ""Hey, let's deliver packages overnight!""<p>The value is in working out the details, in logically organizing things. Writing an actual business plan is <i>hard</i>, in most part because it forces you to think things through, to stop hand-waving. That's the big leap, from ""business idea"" to ""business plan."" In writing? In presentation form? As a speech?

Git 'forks' are just a more efficient means of doing patch management (you point out some of the benefits), rather than (hopefully), different, competing versions of the same codebase.  I say 'hopefully' because in <i>most</i> cases it's nicer for everyone involved if the code in question has one more or less authoritative source, rather than forcing the user to figure out which one of the 788 rails forks is the 'real' one.  Project forks are occasionally necessary, but they are also costly, which is why they should be rare, and only for situations where it is impossible to collaborate.  In some ways it's a pity that git/github use the 'fork' terminology: while it's technically a fork, in most cases it does not represent a genuine attempt to create a competing code and user base.",1260799460

Apologies if there was a brain freeze moment.<p>I've been thinking about how to best do this over the weekend and the approach I cam up with is this: Use Cloudfront (Amazon's CDN) and use custom CNAMES for S3 buckets. An S3 bucket would be an image library (say tango.stdicon.com) and so the subdirectories of this Cloudfront subdomain would be the images sizes (tango.stdicon.com/48/foo).<p>This sets up a nice CDN with proper headers and a scalable way to add more libraries (just add subdomains).<p>This also has the ""very advanced use-case"" advantage: website owners can CNAME to the same library subdomain multiple times (say assets1.mysite.com assets2.mysite.com and assets3.mysite.com) and let the browser download images in parallel.
