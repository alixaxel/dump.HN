For Al Qaeda, terror is only a means to an end. The end is more along the lines of restoring a worldwide Islamic state under Sharia law and a particular brand of Islam. Latter bit, particular brand of Islam, is pretty important (it <i>partially</i> explains why bin Laden had his Saudi citizenship revoked, despite Saudi Arabia being under Sharia law already)<p>The other mistake is that you're assuming that all the organizations under Al Qaeda (think of them as an umbrella corporation, really) or people within Al Qaeda want to fight against western nations. Abdullah Azzam (one of the initial founders of Al Qaeda) wanted to move into Israel after Al Qaeda's small part in pushing the Soviets out of Afghanistan, not the West (like al-Zawahiri wanted) or Saudi Arabia (like bin Laden wanted). And bin Laden - and Al Qaeda - have some pretty strong ties in Africa as well (see Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, for example).",1261875118

One is the LTV of the customer.  The second is the amount of money per customer that you need now.  The third is the interest that someone will charge you in return for the LTV of that customer.  The LTV and the interest rate tell you how much money that customer is actually worth now to you; it's the realizable NPV.  If it's greater than the CAC, great.  If it's less, you're hosed.<p>For most startups, the interest rate is pretty high, so a $200 LTV five years out isn't going to get you very much money.  For example, I doubt that many start ups can get $200 today for $300 in five years.",1261872745

1016442,comment,1016355,1016355,0,0,mixmax,,,"Actually there's a fairly good case to be made for the fact that Al Qaeda is winning the war on terror.<p>If you look at the amount of money the US government is spending on the war on terror proportionally to how much money Osama Bin Laden has at his disposal he is by far the best financed. The argument is made stronger if you look at the current state of US economics. The country is going broke, partly because of the war on terror which has been tremendously expensive. Particularly if you include effects on business, travel, etc.<p>Furthermore Al Qaeda isn't a military construction as we are used to, it's a series of loosely connected cells that share the same ideology and goals, namely terror carried out in the Western world. This makes it hard to fight in a traditional sense since you can't kill the soldiers or kill the people in command. When a terrorist is killed a new one will spring up to take the dead ones place. The US government doesn't seem to grasp this, and the fact that the best way to fight the war on terror is to give people in Afghanistan, Saudui Arabia, etc. a decent life so they have something to live for instead of running around blowing everybody up.",1261872445
