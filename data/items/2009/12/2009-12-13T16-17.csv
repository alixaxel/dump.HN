The Incompleteness Theorem shows that no first order axiomatic system is powerful enough to encapsulate all true statements in the second order Peano axioms for the natural numbers.<p>In fact, his Completeness Theorem proves the opposite of what you claim.  If you use as your axiom system all true statements of the model you are working in you will have a complete axiom system.  All true statements will be trivially provable.  The problem with this is that one will have a hard time determining if a given statement is an axiom or not.<p>If a statement can not be refuted - meaning no counterexample exists - then this is a proof that it is true.",1260721718
