1000147,comment,1000147,999740,0,0,evgen,,,"You keep conflating San Francisco with the greater Bay Area.  This mistake was my central point.  San Francisco proper is a small part of the Bay Area.  It has a more storied history and is the more widely-known, but it is far from being the most significant city when it comes to defining the culture and norms of the area.  SF gets the press, but Berkeley, San Jose, and numerous cities up and down the peninsula contribute just as much to this tech hub as San Francisco.",1261011551

1000145,comment,1000145,999142,0,0,hugh_,,,"That's a rather generous description of the downsides of San Francisco. Parking and traffic suck in a lot of places, and the one-way streets aren't so bad once you get used to them.<p>The two worst problems of San Francisco are still the filth (both the rubbish-in-the-streets form of filth and the human form of filth) and the ridiculously high cost of living. The first means that you can't walk down the street for more than a couple of minutes without some weirdo either pestering you for money or trying to sell you drugs. The second means that having a reasonably nice place to live (say, a three or four bedroom detached house with a backyard -- the kind of modest middle-class dwelling that most modest middle-class families inhabit) is completely out of reach for all but the super-rich.<p>San Francisco is a great place to be at a certain stage in your life, but unless you do become super-rich it's an awful place to stay.",1261011521

1000143,comment,1000083,1000083,0,0,neilk,,,"That's a weird way of looking at it.<p>1) The cost of living is still outrageous even for couples without children, and the gayest areas are among the most expensive. SF attracts homosexuals due to the culture and history.<p>2) What does raising a family have to do with ""looking down"" on anyone? All the parents I know in SF raise their kids to be as gay-friendly as they are.<p>Also: you are aware that some <i>kids</i> are gay, right? Most of them figure it out very early, it's only homophobia that makes them suppress it until university.<p>You're right that there is a political side effect of de-prioritizing children, since most gay or lesbian couples are childless. But that's also fueled by the high concentration of childless professionals in SF. It is a snowball effect that will accelerate until the city's unlivable for people with children.<p>I just don't think it's a conspiracy. One might argue that the real conspiracy is gentrification, where family-friendly neighborhoods are swept away to provide yuppie housing.",1261011430

First, please don't give German lessons if you don't speak German. The word is ""lumpenproletariat"" and it doesn't refer to anything like the ""underclass"" of which I was speaking.
