That's just the nature of the universe.  There's no accurate way to measure how much is incremental revenue versus cannibalized from another channel.<p>So is some of that 6.5 million cannibalized from another channel.  Yes.  Is all of it?  No.  Some of it is new (new customers or new sales due to reaching out to existing or potential customers).  It's also a dirt cheap channel, which is key.<p>For ANY company, driving $6.5 million in revenue via a new marketing channel which has close to zero cost, is a great win.",1260341270

985477,comment,984210,984751,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Not necessarily correct. As Plato writes in the <i>Crito</i>:<p>""Reflect now, Socrates,"" the laws might say, ""that if what we say is true, you are not treating us rightly by planning to do what you are planning. We have given you birth, nurtured you, educated you; we have given you and all other citizens a share of all the good things we could. Even so, by giving every Athenian the opportunity, once arrived at voting age and having observed the affairs of the city and us the laws, we proclaim that if we do not please him, he can take his possessions and go wherever he pleases. Not one of our laws raises any obstacle or forbids him, if he is not satisfied with us or the city, if one of you wants to go and live in a colony or wants to go anywhere else, and keep his property. We say, however, that whoever of you remains, when he sees how we conduct our trials and manage the city in other ways, has in fact come to an agreement with us to obey our instructions. We say that the one who disobeys does wrong in three ways, first because in us he disobeys his parents, also those who brought him up, and because, in spirit of his agreement, he neither obeys us nor, if we do something wrong, does he try to persuade us to do better. Yet we can only propose things, we do not issue savage commands to do whatever we order; we give two alternatives, either to persuade us or to do what we say. He does neighter. We do say that you too, Socrates, are open to those charges if you do what you have in mind; you would be among, not the least, but the most guilty of the Athenians."" And if I should say ""Why so?"" they might well be right to upbraid me and say that I am among the Athenians who most definitely came to that agreement with them. They might well say: ""Socrates, we have convincing proofs that we and the city were congenial to you. You would not have dwelt here most consistently of all the Athenians if the city had not been exceedingly pleasing to you. You have never left the city, even to see a festival, nor for any other reason except military service; you have never gone to stay in any other city, as people do; you have had no desire to know another city or other laws; we and our city satisfied you.""",1260341129

There is no rush like the rush of money, real, serious money.<p>Everyone you see programming is like a medieval craftsman, good at one thing and one thing only. As a salesman, you're the top dog, you have an eye for who is good and who is bad, you can choose whose products to sell, who to make rich, and who to work with. You're a phone wielding king-maker.<p>If you love thinking, that's all you will do. You will try to understand <i>everyone's</i> business, what they do, who they sell to, how much, how often, and under what restrictions. You take your work with you, to the pub, restaurant, street, gym and home. You will be taking notes when others are talking. You will go over your girlfriend's browser history to learn what she shops for. You will be opening your parent's credit card statements to see where the money goes. A day at the mall will be like heaven to you; you will get a rush from seeing people spend. Information will fucking nurture you.<p>You do that so often you can see trends before they hit the press :-)<p>Nothing like being able to give your friends and family business, real solid leads, and all others will have to contend for your attention and rolodex.<p>Sales makes bull-fighting look boring. It's as if the newspapers were published for your own amusement.
