1003180,comment,1003180,993240,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I'm no expert, and you may be right about my inaccuracies. From what I've read, part of the problem is that the system set up in 1913 was designed to be complicated and confusing to conceal exactly where the control lies. It's probably also overly complicated because it's designed by committee with many competing interests, just like all of our laws are.<p>One thing you said which I'm not so sure about is the dangers of inflation vs deflation. Inflation is bad for lenders because they money they get back isn't as valuable as the money they lent, but the interest they charge is supposed to cover that. Lenders are only really hurt when the inflation rate exceeds interest rates. For debtors, inflation helps them pay their debts with less valuable money, but only if their income keeps up with inflation. For most people that hasn't happened; I believe inflation-adjusted incomes peaked in the early 70s, and has held steady or dropped since then while debt has climbed dramatically. So, inflation has not been good for debtors.<p>Deflation is good for lenders because they get paid back with more valuable money then they lent, if they get paid back. Deflation could be bad for debtors because their debts are harder to pay, but the cost of other living expenses ought to drop in a deflationary environment which would leave more money available to pay debts off. It would probably be more difficult for employers to reduce salaries in a deflationary environment than it is for them to avoid raising salaries in an inflationary environment, so debtors are more likely to keep or increase their spending power during deflation. If we had a long-term deflationary environment, interest rates could drop to zero or even go negative without hurting lenders, so long as the rates are higher than the deflation rate, and this will help the debtors as well.<p>So overall, I think deflation is better for everybody, so long as it's gradual. Deflation means that the value of our money is increasing over time instead of decreasing, and that can benefit everyone. There is a potential problem with interest rates on existing debt, but if the deflation is low and consistent, lenders could be encouraged, or forced, to reduce rates accordingly. This wouldn't even have to be government-mandated; competition among the banks would bring back 0% loans that people would use to refinance their debt at lower rates.",1261148241

Let's say the last 9-12 months is when ACID3 became compliant in most browsers (I think it's actually less). That means, by definition, only apps written in that timeframe even had an opportunity to use whatever features were previously broken. This is a tiny percentage of code on the web.<p>Now, it could be that ACID3 is testing the 100 most useful things that previously did not work. Somehow, though, I doubt that's really the case. And even if it was, there are without a doubt 100 more important bugs in IE to fix.<p>So, yes, ACID3 compliance is pretty low on my wishlist for IE bugs to fix. If they were fixing ACID3 bugs and letting more important things fall through the crack, I would be even more displeased with IE.",1261147821

1003151,comment,1002400,1003048,0,0,elblanco,,,"I was talking about software in general -- not the specific case of google maps and wayfinding. In terms of rapid development and iteration to improve a product to suit the end-user. Monolithic design concepts are rapidly going the way of the dinosaur. Small iterations of ""good enough for..."" building up to ""98% of what the user needs"" (with copious feedback to every part of the iteration cycle) is proving itself to be the better way of building software over older, waterfall style approaches.<p>People often lament that ""software engineering does not produce the kind of reliable engineering as does traditional engineer, if bridges were built like applications, nobody could use the bridges because they might fall down"". But this misses one the core unique point of software. It's cheaper to tear parts of it out and ""renovate"" it to make it better than a bridge. The marginal cost of software is <i>almost</i> entirely labor. While a bridge is likely worth far more in materials cost than labor cost (what's the cost of 2 million tons of high-grade steel on the market?). Thus the analogy (and the subsequent lament) don't really work. You are going to keep your F/T staff employed anyways, why not have them rev. the software and make it better?<p>And as it turns (at least in my experience), greater time spent in software design before implementation rarely leads to a perfect product -- the fact that pretty much every piece of software ever written, no matter how small or utilitarian, reinforces that concept.<p>But spend a little time designing (which usually results in a little design), with an eye towards future revisions, build a minimal version, solicit user feedback, push feedback into the next iteration of minimal design and repeat ad infinitum seems to result in the following:<p>- The software begins to better fit the users' needs quicker.<p>- Fast release cycles build relevance to the users, if they thought your software was 10% relevant on v1, it might be 70% relevant by v3 and 90% by v4. And you can go from v1-v4 in 12 months if you release quarterly.<p>- Your software will be wrong. Get over it. Instead of lamenting it, take it as an opportunity to turn users into stake holders.<p>- The users feel that they are participating in the software design (since they are), it makes them implicit stake holders. And it also can foster a sense of partnership. If you do it right, the users are basically contracting you for your services without having to go through the hassle of setting up a formal agreement that they probably wouldn't have set up in the first place. The danger is that when something goes wrong, you try and leverage blame on the user for not knowing how to design software. I've found that simply going back and saying ""well, what can we do to fix this by the next iteration?"" seems to work miracles.<p>- Happy users spread happiness through your user community. A happy user community grows. A growing user community means your business is growing. Before we adopted this philosophy, our user community was shrinking at about a 10% rate/year following another development philosophy. We are currently growing at around %200 <i>as soon as we switched development philosophies</i>.<p>- Changing the development philosophy also implies changes to the rest of the business, for example it gives sales and marketing more reason to touch the users, and gives them better product to show. It also implies a different sales model, rather than charging $x per rev, charge $x+y dollars for new customers, and each rev is $x-z dollars. Or charge $x/years and $x*.40 per year after to build lock-in.<p>- Waiting 2 years for an overwrought design to produce something that maps poorly onto most users' requirements does not usually result in happy users, the post release exercise turns into damage control and not maintenance. For example, which is the better software, Windows Vista or Windows 7? Vista was a monolithic design that developed in the rarefied vacuum over the better part of a decade and the result was rubbish. 7 was a rather fast (for Microsoft) iteration based on user's requirements and people find it rather unobjectionable. The better product was the one that followed this model.<p>- Faster releases tend to be smaller releases, which tends to make testing the software easier which tends to produce more solid software.<p>- Bigger features can wait. Users see delta in software, if you delay your release by 6 months to push out one big feature, your users may loose interest. If you push out a smaller, feature packed release, full of small features and bits of polish, every 90 days, your big feature can come out in 2-3 release cycles and nobody will be wiser to it.<p>- If you slip a release date, it's better to be 2 weeks late on a 90 day release schedule than 6 months late on a 24 months release schedule.<p>This may sound like more the Rapid Development Lifecycles that are current coming into vogue, but it's really just common sense coming from lessons learned seeing lots of projects not pan out and burn through lots of investment and contract money to produce substandard product. It's more a manifesto than a development model. Google has largely internalized this kind of model as well, which is why their software seems to sit in beta forever, and they never seem to have big new releases -- going from chrome v2 to v3 was about as dramatic as loading another web page. Big features, like plugins, have been delayed for several release cycles while they push out smaller releases quickly.",1261147157

1003148,comment,1002971,1003114,0,0,DougWebb,,,"That's basically the same reasoning that applies to any server-side scripting language: high level scripting languages are much more efficient to develop with than more structured lower-level languages, and the web-application model lets you use HTML as your GUI which is quick, easy, and flexible (though not as rich or stable as client-side GUIs can be.)<p>My personal preference for server-side development is Modern Perl, because it lets you develop anywhere along the ""highly structured"" to ""rough scripting"" line that you please. Other server-side languages are fine if they suit your development style, but I like to adjust my style to suit the project, and to use a language that can adapt to whatever style I need.<p>Client-side, Javascript is great especially with jQuery.

This is really good stuff :)<p>Second, I haven't used a Nook, but I own a Kindle 2, and I freaking love it. I carry it everywhere and I often find myself wanting to stop whatever I'm working on and go sit in a coffeeshop and just read. The device isn't perfect, but I don't have any major complaints at all. Most importantly, when I'm using it, it disappears in my hands. I'm not reading a Kindle, I'm just reading.<p>Also, I had an MP3 player before the iPod and it was a painful experience. It was clear that there were large opportunities to improve the experience, but I would argue that the biggest one that the iPod solved was making it easy to get content on the device, which wasn't the iPod at all, it was iTunes. This is similar to how I see the Kindle. The device is good enough (just like the gen-1 iPod, which was fugly but functional) but the really killer feature is how <i>incredibly easy</i> it is to get books onto the device. I browse Amazon all the time on my laptop and when I see a book I'm interested in, 1 click and I have a free sample on the device waiting for me. If I want to buy after reading the sample, just 1 more click. Easy. I buy probably 3-5x as many books as I used to, and it takes me 10% of the hassle and I'm not paying much more in total even though I read way more. The device is only one piece of the puzzle here; the overall Kindle business model is what's really amazing, imo.",1261146857

If you want to try an algorithm, you sit down, write an astonishly small quantity of code and it just works. That's just one of the reason why I use javascript.<p>Another is, that it's a fantastic language to use for hobby projects, because you don't need to think too much beforehand, thanks to the dynamically typed variables, methods and objects.<p>And last but not least, you don't have any GUI to manage. HTML does it for you, which simplifies matters a bit. You want to dynamically create HTML? No problem. You prefer to prepare the HTML beforehand? No problem at all.<p>So to answer your question, I use it because it's refreshingly easy to use, more so than richer languages who are sometimes simply too heavy.",1261145443

Also, if the proper name of the subject is unknown then it would be impossible for the prestige to be evident.<p><i>> 2) If I want you to think it's prestigious, I should show, not tell.

If the use of the word 'prestige' and its subject are secondary to the point of the sentence or paragraph, elaborating may distract from the main point.  Such is the case with many abstract words that people interpret differently.  If it's the main point then I agree.<p><i>> edit: not to mention, prestige is subjective. Some people think a glowing writeup in a particular publication is prestigious. Others think it's noise. It's hard to claim either group is wrong.</i><p>Many abstract words are subjective.  I think that finding the balance between detail and abstraction is a core writing skill.  Too much detail can be tedious, condescending, unnecessary and can obscure or confuse the main point.

The main differences: (0) perhaps most importantly it’s not immediately obvious how to send messages that aren’t XML-based over BOSH, because the protocol is defined in terms of XML payloads, meaning that if you have some protocol that wants to send arbitrary messages you’ll have to do something like putting your messages inside a CDATA block or escaping special characters, and your server-side code will need to come up with some way to do that, (1) Orbited’s design is a bit more general, accommodating transports other than long-polling, (2) Orbited has a bit less overhead, even in long polling mode, because it doesn't include a bunch of extra XML, (3) everything on the client end related to the particularities of Comet communication is designed to be treated as a black box by client-side JavaScript, which can just load Orbited’s JavaScript and then deal with its API – your in-browser code can roughly pretend it has a TCP socket, (4) Orbited operates as a proxy, speaking actual TCP out the back end, which means that your server code can just be written against a TCP socket and doesn’t need to implement anything special to communicate with browsers, or import any libraries, etc.",1261145119

If you haven't seen it, you should take a look at the lua source code. It's beautiful.<p>Essentially, you are making a nice internal API to your engine objects that you can manipulate, and experiment with, on a higher level without recompiling your application all the time. Python is also nice for this purpose (see OGRE 3D), but it's not as lightweight as Lua.<p>So in a sense, it's better to use Lua for parts of your engine that will change a lot, depending on what aspect of the engine you are a focusing on at the moment (like tweaking how the enemy A.I. works, for example). This is especially useful at the prototype stage of your application.<p>Is that what you had in mind, or am I mistaken?",1261144813
