Much of Greenspun's theory is based on male irrationality (men are more likely to pursue science Ph.D's because they are less likely to make sensible decisions than women).  However, the legions of women in lit PhD programs proves that they, too, can be incredibly irrational by this standard.<p>A few possible differences... Greenspun does include ""quantitative ability"" in his agument that ""Adjusted for IQ, quantitative skills, and working hours, jobs in science are the lowest paid in the United States.""  This wouldn't include lit students.  However, women who purse lit Ph.D's could still do law school, and perhaps B-school.<p>Another factor is that nobody is trying to trick women into lit PhD's by claiming that there's a shortage, whereas many people in high positions in the US government and corporations do promote the notion that there's a critical shortage of Americans pursuing PhDs in math, physical science, and engineering... though still, this doesn't really address the ""irrationality"" of lit PhDs - it just means that there isn't an industry of pushing people into degrees that don't pay in the humanities.<p>Anyway, this is a good observation, definitely a potential weakness in Greenspun's argument.",1260741387

993164,comment,992663,992972,0,0,foldr,,,">Fundamental goals are neither rational nor irrational.<p>That's a rather controversial statement. You have to bear in mind that the very idea that there's a clean split between issues of fact and issues of ""values"" or ""goals"" is a very controversial one. Hillary Putnam's book on this issue is a great read (""The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy"").<p>Of course, there are also issues with the notion of ""observation"" used in Bayesian statistics. Since any observation which isn't actually just a direct report of a sense experience (e.g. ""I see red in the top left corner of my visual field"") involves the application of some theory, it's not clear what should count as an observation for a rational agent or group of rational agents. For example, did John observe that a car drove past? Or did he observe that something which looks like a car drove past? Can John observe that Bill was being petulant, or is that a value judgment? Did John observe that the current is 0.5A? Or did he observe that the ammeter <i>reported</i> that the current is 0.5A? Etc. etc.<p>The Bayesian framework is an idealization, resting on an ideal notion of ""observation"". I personally think that it's crazy to take this framework to be a model for rationality itself. We are not able to make observations in the Bayesian sense.",1260741255

993146,comment,992945,993086,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Shady maybe, but not grey. The Federal Reserve Bank is a privately owned and operated corporation. It is not in any way a part of the US government; it is given special rights by our government to manage our banking system as a monopoly. The Fed Chairman is appointed by the CEOs of the regional Fed banks, and the CEOs are appointed by the shareholders of those banks. There are no elected representatives running the Fed, nor any political appointees selected by the Executive branch.<p>There /is/ a lot of oversight, and the Fed chairman is required to spend a lot of time dealing with the president and congress. However, all Fed meetings, particularly policy-setting meetings, are private and hidden from the public and US government. No government agency is allowed to do that; even the most top-secret black projects of the CIA and DoD are ultimately overseen by someone in Congress, at least to some extent. (Congress could stop funding these projects, as a final control. They can't do that to the Fed.)<p>The government agency you're thinking of is the Treasury. It is the Treasury's job to produce and manage US currency, as directed by Congress. Congress had done a lousy job of setting economic policy, so back in 1913 Congress decided to outsource the job to a private corporation: the Fed. The Treasury still makes all of our coins, but the paper money and 'accounting' money were given to the Fed. This wouldn't necessarily be bad, except the Fed effectively charges the government a fee for every dollar put into circulation; $1 of circulating currency is added to the economy, but $1.05 in debt is added at the same time. That doesn't balance, so the currency has to be inflated to make it balance; the value of $1.05 has to be reduced to the value of $1 in order for the originally created $1 to be sufficient to pay it back. Except that $1 is now worth only $0.95 if used for any other purpose.<p>This is a very, very rough and inaccurate description of the situation, but the basic premise is correct: the Fed is a private company that makes a profit by lending money into the US economy at a rate that can't be paid for using the money that's been lent into the economy. This allows the Fed and its shareholders to slowly draw all of the wealth out of the US economy, leading to the highly concentrated wealth in the hands of very few very rich people we have today.",1260740670

993139,comment,993026,993026,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I've just been reading an autobiographical sketch that my paternal grandmother wrote in 1926, after her third year of college. She wrote quite a lot about what she did to maintain her good health--which she remembered as being very good throughout childhood. She acknowledged health benefits of physical exercise and considered it an advantage that she walked from home two miles to her college and then two miles back home each day. She also noted that she liked eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, and not too much meat. She even reports her height (five feet and three inches) and weight (one hundred and fourteen pounds) at that age. It is apparent that in her milieu there were plenty of Minnesotans living in county seat college towns who knew exercise and good diet were good for health.<p>Alas, she was the only one of my four grandparents who didn't live into my lifetime. She died about twenty-five years later while driving across Minnesota in the winter to pick up my dad from the same college. Before she arrived at her destination, her car slipped on the icy highway and crashed head-on with another car, killing both drivers. Epidemiologically, there is no doubt that exercise is beneficial for health. But of course it is not a cure-all. My dad was paralyzed for six years before he died when he slipped and fell on the ice on a different Minnesota winter day while going out shopping for a condolence card for a friend's funeral. That kind of concern is what keeps some people in their cars.<p>After edit:<p>I agree with the other person who just commented that this is a particularly striking paragraph in the submitted article:<p>""And yet Morris sat on his data for years. If there were flaws in his theory, he was determined to find them before anyone else could. 'We set about destroying this observation,' he says. 'We brought in outside people with no blood in their veins, no interest, to destroy it.' But they couldn’t.""<p>That, of course, is just what Richard Feynman recommended that a true scientist should do. ""But there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science. That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in school--we never say explicitly what this is, but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly. It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty--a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked--to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.""<p><a href=""http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf</a>",1260740364

I've already explained why.<p>>Now there is a only one model of the second order Peano axioms (up to isomorphism). This model is the natural numbers we all know and love.

A statement is true if and only if there is no counterexample to it in any model of the axiomatic system you are dealing with. That's what the Completeness result is. So, if you have a statement for which there is no counterexample in any model then it's true. This is what the Completeness result is all about.<p>That is correct although completely irrelevant to everything else, and uses bad terminology. Logicians usually use ""true"" to mean ""true in a particular model"", and ""valid"" or ""logically valid"" to mean ""true in all models of a given system"" or ""true in all models"".<p>The thing is, you're still not clear on the difference between the two meanings of ""complete"". Think it through. It's an important distinction because not understanding it leads to confusion.<p>In one meaning, the first-order logic is called complete because every logically valid statement is provable from the logical axioms. Or, more broadly, every statement valid in an axiomatic system T (meaning, it's true in any possible model in which axioms of T are true) can be proved in T. That's one meaning of ""complete"", and it's not changing from one axiomatic system to another, as long as we stay in first-order logic. It's been proved for this logic once and for all by Godel.<p>In another meaning of ""complete"", a particular axiomatic system T is complete if it proves either X or not-X for any statement X whatsoever. This meaning of ""complete"" is true for some axiomatic systems T and false for others.<p>Now, let's go back again to my statement about the Incompleteness Theorem: ""It says that in any sufficiently complex axiom system there will be statements that it can neither prove nor refute, ""undecidable"" statements."" Among some very confused statements, you pointed out correctly that this has a trivial counterexample: take all true statements about natural numbers and call them axioms - that'll be a complete system. This is true, because I glossed over the ""recursively enumerable"" requirement on purpose - and then, replying to your previous comment, tried to simplify it by saying that such a counterexample is not a ""manageable"" axiomatic system. The reason is that I'm trying to use as few technical words as possible while avoiding dumbing down the content to the Liar paradox. I'm trying to make the content interesting to the passers-by rather than lead a flame war (which is why if my next comment would just have to rehash the same material again, you can count on me not posting it).<p>Sometimes the ""manageability"" of the axiomatic system - what's technically called ""recursive enumerability"", and really means that we have a reasonable way of checking what our axioms are - is baked into the very definition of what ""an axiomatic system"" is. Sometimes it isn't and needs to be mentioned additionally. It doesn't really matter because everyone who understands the Incompleteness Theorems technically knows about this requirement.<p>Anyway, yes, this requirement is important and necessary. But pointing it out doesn't refute in any way (as you said it did) my original point you replied to, which is that the Incompleteness Theorems is syntactic in nature, not semantic, and doesn't require any notion of ""true"" or ""false"" statements in its statement or proof. And, again, the Completeness Theorem, which you mentioned as supporting your counterexample, is a complete red herring and doesn't have to do anything with any of that. In fact, if first-order logic were incomplete (say if you removed a crucial logical axiom from it) and the Completeness Theorem wouldn't hold, it would <i>still</i> be true that you could take all true statements about the integers, call them axioms, and get a complete axiomatic system in the <i>other</i> meaning of ""complete"". Because it'd still be true that either X or not-X would be provable for any X - it'd be an axiom [1]. The Completeness Theorem doesn't enter into that counterexample of yours in any way.<p>[1] This is almost true, but technically speaking, you'd still need to require that the underlying logic, while incomplete, would be powerful enough to prove the equivalence of not-not-X and X, for any X.",1260739615

For database gateways, it may be the last-update time stamp of the record. For virtual objects, it may be the last time the internal state changed.<p>An origin server MUST NOT send a Last-Modified date which is later than the server's time of message origination.

This allows a recipient to make an accurate assessment of the entity's modification time, especially if the entity changes near the time that the response is generated.
