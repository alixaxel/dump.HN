992797,comment,992410,992429,0,0,awwx,,,"Here's the thing with call/cc: it's a powerful but low-level operator.  It can be used for example to implement throwing and catching exceptions, or generators like Python's yield.  However, once you've implemented generators or exception handling, then you'd use ""throw"" and ""catch"" and ""yield"" directly instead of calling call/cc to do those things.  So when you say ""when would I use call/cc in a program"", it would be for some situation that doesn't already have an implementation for it, which is probably pretty rare when most of the things that you'd use call/cc for are already implemented.<p>If you're interested in web programming with Scheme, I suggest taking a look at Arc (<a href=""http://arclanguage.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/</a>) which is (I find) a very pleasant language to program in and useful for basic web apps.<p>For the first iteration of your application, keep it as simple as you can.  Don't use a complicated framework if you don't need to.  Don't store your data in a database if you can simply store it in files.  There's plenty of time later to say ""ah, this piece needs to be faster"" and move that bit into a database or whatever.  By then you'll know what you actually need, instead of vaguely guessing and spending a lot of time to store <i>all</i> your data in a database in the hope that it will turn out to what you need.<p>While I suggest taking a look at Arc since it sounds like you'd be interested, I'm also guessing that Python is <i>most likely</i> going to be your best choice because it <i>is</i> a lot more mature, it <i>does</i> have a lot more libraries, and you already know it.  But look for a way to do your project simply.  Don't go off and use a complicated framework that has object-relational mapping and templates and junk if you don't need that stuff now.<p>I hope this helps... :-)",1260719229

Free-reign extensions inevitably lead to instability and support is a nightmare because you can never be certain of what is going on in your own app.<p>However, the sandboxing is severely limiting. Extensions get a separate JS environment for each tab and they can only communicate through async messaging. This makes global state, like user settings, a pain in the arse. I think they can do better than this while remaining secure.<p>And of course, you can only extend the browser using the specific hooks it provides, which currently doesn't include much in the way of user interface modification. I'm sure that more hooks will be provided in the future.<p>They did a great job of keeping it simple though. Nearly everything is done through standard JS/HTML/DOM.

992782,comment,992231,992325,0,0,Goladus,,,"Actually, I think the issue is that music is a very broad term and it is not clear exactly how narrow use of it is in this case.<p>22 pieces in 140 characters sounds amazing, because people imagine that the result is a selection of existing recognizable music from across different genres, when it fact these are pieces written in a such a way that take advantage of supercollider's strengths.<p>Number 6, for example, appears to be a minimalist phase-shift piece[1].  There are two or three small musical ideas that are of slightly different lengths and repeated for several minutes.  The result is the musical equivalent of watching windshield wipers that are slightly out of sync.  It can be hypnotic and interesting.  It's also incredibly difficult to PERFORM, and part of the enjoyment of hearing a piece like Steve Reich's ""Violin Phase"" is knowing that these are real humans with real violins doing this[2].<p>But it's known as minimalist for a reason-- it's music created with an extreme economy of musical ideas.  That nearly 10 minutes of Violin Phasing can be described succinctly (in English) with much greater technical accuracy than one could describe the final movement of Brahms Piano Concerto Number 1 [3], which is only slightly longer.<p>Thus, minimalist music lends itself very well to a succinct description in code as well.  So, while ""music"" is a term that includes everything from Brahms and Reich to Miley Cyrus, it's not clear whether supercollider could actually describe pieces like that so succinctly without obvious cheating [4].<p>[1] Wiki article on phasing in music:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasing</a><p>[2] Live performance of Reich's Violin Phase: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1OvwR3wB4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1OvwR3wB4</a><p>[3] Brahms Piano cto #1 mvt 3: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfs1X2-lEhU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfs1X2-lEhU</a> (pt 1) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF5IyHls560"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF5IyHls560</a> (pt 2)<p>[4] eg something like Buffer.read(""brahms.wav"").play.",1260718360

A coherent ""local"" history is very useful not just for the up key but also for referring to history items by number (like ""!123"").<p>My solution for my laptop has helped me on <i>countless</i> occasions.  I've been doing this for about three years.<p>1. Compile bash with the syslogger patch. Each command will generate one line with timestamp, username, terminal PID, and command.<p>2. Configure syslog to pipe all bash commands to a special file.<p>3. Run a cronjob every night that takes all the bash commands from the day and saves them off to a day specific file.<p>4. Need to find that command you ran 6 months ago to get package XYZ to work in way ABC?  Use ""grep -R"" to find every single invocation you ever made to that program.  If you actually needs a particular shell's local history, pipe grep through a grep for the PID (I find I almost never need that).<p>I work with so many different technologies for such brief times that this is just absolutely invaluable.

992770,comment,992478,992550,0,0,camccann,,,"No, the problem is the dual-license strategy combined with changing business models. If it had been pure GPL from the start, anyone who couldn't work with that would never have used it in the first place. But because they sold licenses for closed source use, now there are customers using it who may be stuck choosing from three unpleasant options--keep using unmaintained code (if the license even allows that), find a way to use GPLed code, or find a new database.<p>It's not really any different from what would happen if a proprietary software vendor went out of business or killed a product, since that's effectively exactly what happened. The fact that the code also exists in GPL form is largely irrelevant and I don't know why you're focusing on it.<p>Without the dual-license strategy available, BSD software doesn't really HAVE an economic model other than charity (nor does pure GPL of course--just look at RMS--but at least GPL gives you the warm feeling of knowing that no one will be purely freeloading off your generosity).",1260717863
