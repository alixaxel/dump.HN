So the prior odds for likes/hates are:<p>4:6<p>Then it turns out that, of the 40 items the user liked, 4 of these or 10% are tagged ""green"", and of the 60 items the user hated, 12 of these or 20% are marked ""green"".  So the likelihood ratio for ""green"" is:<p>0.1:0.2  (Given that an item is hated, the user is twice as likely to tag it ""green"" than if the item is liked.)<p>Then it turns out that of the 40 items the user liked, 8 or 1/5 are tagged ""red"", and of the 60 items the user hated, 3 or 1/20 are tagged ""red.

I still have that paperback book, now almost thirty years old. And I’m sure I have that old list somewhere buried in my papers, though I can’t find it. However, I do remember the A list.

1023650,comment,1023441,1023441,0,0,grellas,,,"Liability exposure is much increased today for several reasons:<p>1.  Legal second-guessing: Here, Apple used a particular design for its ear buds. The second-guessing comes in where courts say, ""yes, we know that you made these design decisions but, were you to use some alternative design, or to include an additional warning, you could meet all the legitimate goals of your product while at the same time reducing the number of potential injuries to your customers at no appreciable added cost."" The law then defines this deficit (or lack of warning) as a product ""defect,"" not because the product can't be used in a safe way but because the second-guessers have proclaimed that there is a safer way that might be used that still achieves the product's goals at no significant additional cost. Experts are then trotted out to say, ""I am an authority on ear buds and the design used by Apple creates avoidable risks and hence needless injuries to customers."" The matter is then tossed to a jury for a crap-shoot outcome. Welcome to the modern world of product liability law.<p>2.  Class actions: The above approach to product-liability law is made far more pernicious when the class-action vehicle givers the second-guessers the opportunity to multiply their damages for every product sold, whether or not it ever caused any injury to anyone specific. When combined with potentially surprise sources of liability (e.g., ear buds that harm no one physically in 99.999% of cases suddenly becoming ""defective"" because a theoretical argument might be made about how they might be safer), the class-action vehicle turns law from a sleepy-time industry where individual practitioners wait around for individual clients with real injuries to retain them to sue for compensation into a mega-industry where creative lawyers can find nearly infinite ways of creating potentially massive liability risks for manufacturers. Welcome to the world of jackpot justice.<p>3.  Pleading rules: Modern pleading rules make this stew even more lethal. In essence, the modern world is governed by what is called ""notice pleading."" The idea is that all one normally has to do is state in broad terms what happened to give rise to a legal claim and the case is set on a path to get to a jury. In recent years, some of this excess has been cut back as these rules have been modified to a degree. Nonetheless, modern judges tend to have very few tools with which to hack away at frivolous claims and to dismiss them before they can reach a jury. The result is that defendants facing even the most bizarre-sounding of legal claims are forced to run up major legal bills dealing with such claims through an expensive process of pretrial discovery and trial. It is not unusual for a modest case involving middle-class parties to go for one to two or more years in such cases and to cost each side six figures in legal fees. In the case involving Apple and the ear buds, the legal costs would easily have run $10M and up if the case were allowed to go forward for a year or so.<p>4.  Absence of personal responsibility: The modern trend in law sees courts as being protective of citizens in ways that used to be regarded as unnecessary - hence, courts today routinely come up with new or expanded theories of liability that they see as taking on the big companies for the benefit of the larger society. One can debate this either way on the merits but it is a fact of life and it does lead to ever-wider bases upon which defendants can be held liable.<p>Put all the above together and it is no wonder that common sense goes out the window. It is no longer an issue of ""did this party use this product and injure himself in the process and, if he did, did the manufacturer do something negligent or did the product itself not get manufactured properly or safely such as to cause an injury."" Instead, it is: ""has this party alleged broad claims that show that all purchasers of this product might be subjected to risks that could be avoided with simple warnings or with simple alternative designs and, if so, how will a jury decide that question after hearing all the experts hypothesize about the various alternatives and after hearing experts speculate about how this manufacturer is causing hundreds of millions of dollars of injuries to a broad class of people who might be using this product.""<p>Thus, the law moves from individual cases involving provable cause and effect to group cases involving battles of experts and juries being given enormous power to impose liabilities on product manufacturers.<p>In this context, it is quite unusual that this case got tossed at the first stage and even more so for the appeals court to uphold the trial judge in that action. Of course, with open forum shopping being the norm in today's world of litigation, other cases can easily be brought in more receptive venues with outcomes that are far from predictable. This unfortunately is how modern litigation works.",1262223920

1023648,comment,1023232,1023232,0,0,tensor,,,"I don't claim to be very experienced in functional programming, but doesn't his whole argument simplify to ""State is hard in a pure functional setting"" ?<p>I was under the impression that this was a simple and fairly well understood problem. Either use a functional abstraction for state, a reduce with state or perhaps a monad if the state needs to be carried through many types of operations, or manage it in an impure way, using STM with a global state perhaps.<p>I don't see how this is any knock against the functional programming paradigm. I always understood the rule of thumb to be ""use purity as much as possible, and be impure only when it's explicitly needed.""

1023647,comment,1023257,1023257,0,0,dpatru,,,"One common scenario for government action is that some problem isn't being solved well by market-based solutions, so a solution needs to be imposed by force. A communication technology would be of use here to help determine if a coercive solution is necessary and if so, which solution would be best.<p>For example in the early 2000s, Enron's bankruptcy and other corporate scandals illuminated a problem with corporate accounting. The Sarbanes-Oxley law was passed to fix this problem. Now it seems generally recognized that the law was flawed.<p>The problem could probably have been addressed better if there had been more deliberate and open discussion.<p>Hacker News has a Feature Request page (see the footer). I imagine if there were a feature request that had overwhelming upvotes and no significant negative discussion, then pg could feel confident that such a feature would be good to implement.<p>Something similar could be done with legislation. If there is a particular piece of legislation that has overwhelming ""upvotes"" over a sustained period of time, and no significant counter-arguments, such legislation could probably be safely passed with the confidence that it has been thoroughly vetted.<p>Legislation that doesn't have these overwhelming upvotes for a long period of time, or has significant counter-arguments, probably shouldn't be passed.<p>So it seems to me that collaboration software could be used to select good legislation for passage.",1262223754

My primary interest by far here happens to be serious (preferably very stuffy) programming language and computer science discussion.  (I'm interested in many other things, but I have other communities with which I prefer to discuss them; HN seems like kind of an echo chamber personality-wise.)  My upvoted submissions are a good list of the things I like to read here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/saved?id=mquander"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/saved?id=mquander</a><p>I also personally have absolutely zero interest in startup and business discussion, which puts me far outside the target audience for very many articles here, although I leave them alone since that's the stated purpose of the site.  So I recognize that my tastes may not represent HN any better than yours, if such a thing can be measured.<p>Is it ethical, then, for me to flag articles which I think are not worthwhile posts?  I'm not sure.  Your comments make me reflect on whether that's an OK thing to do or not.  I do wish there were a downvote button on posts, that means ""I don't think this should be highly rated, but I don't think it should be killed either.""  I would prefer to use that.<p>One thing, however.  Your stated policy is:  ""If something doesn't fit your areas of interest, feel free to not participate, don't penalize us that do want to participate.""  That seems like a principled and friendly approach.  But I'm not sure it scales.  The front page (and the comment threads) only have so much bandwidth.  Taking a ""tolerant"" approach without a big redesign to allow some kind of filtering means that the result will be simple majority rule, leading to a lot of very general interest posts about politics, current events, business, and technology.  I know that many posts which would interest me greatly would then be buried on page N; judge for yourself whether this is the case for you.<p>Now, it would be awfully judgmental to say that's a bad thing for a website; after all, it's providing a whole lot of people with the sort of thing they want to read.

Tom acts an appointed general purpose advisor  to the Tory party in a private capacity, which is substantially different.<p>Consider this case: If a defence company CEO advised a political party on defence spending, and recommended they invest in particular types of projects that happened to be his company's expertise, and his company ended up wining the contracts. Would you be happy with this situation ?<p>I'm not say Tom/mySociety are bad guys, far from it they are  awesome guys and they've done great work. But we can't hold those we like to a lesser standard than those we dislike.",1262221551

In reality a ""v-team"" is made up of ""vendors"" who are not full-time employees but unlike agency temps they don't have a limit on how long they can work at Microsoft without a break. They do very much work on campus, though often they tend not to have their own offices (instead they work in bays or are doubled up with others).",1262221509

I know these criticisms sound like sour grapes. All I can say is that I know for a fact that putting together teams with great execution intelligence can happen in a lot of ways. Simply because it happens naturally in one way in the valley doesn't mean at all that's it's an optimum solution.<p>EDIT: I don't want to come across as criticizing all things SV. There is a huge convenience factor when working near so many startups and Angel funds. I just also think that there are problems associated with the current setup there as well.",1262221257
