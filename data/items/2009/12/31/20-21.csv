I posted it mostly as a sort of very dry, tongue-firmly-in-cheek public memo to various people I know who are always telling me why I really need to ""get with cloud computing"". The idea was to prompt said people into seeing that those of us who don't immediately respond with excitement when told about online services like Google Docs and hurriedly jump on the bandwagon might actually have some relatively sound reasons for it. Lots of people I know seem to get very excited about stuff because it's new, and seem to be on automatic optimism mode about all new technology. The attitude I think is much healthier is a bit of guarded scepticism or realism. The Luddite would refuse new technology flatly - they want the world to stop so they can get off.

I'm not advocating using a typewriter instead of Eclipse or instead of whatever you use for word processing.

Nobody is denying that you can still fashion a shiv, of some kind - but the amount of damage you can do with a roughly fashioned hand weapon, versus something designed to kill lots of people at close range, is enough to deter people from trying to do so.  Note - one of the principal reasons for banning box cutters and their like is so that the _other_ passengers on the plane have a pretty straightforward mechanism for subduing a malevolent passenger.<p>o Banning Large amounts of liquids, in the face of Liquid Bombs being _actually designed_ just makes good sense.   Likewise banning powdered substances (PETN) from being brought onto planes makes sense now that we know that there are active attempts to use this vector.<p>Focusing on tactics is actually a very effective proposition - It's actually pretty damn difficult to bring down a plane these days from inside - not impossible, I'm sure there are a lot of vectors still left, but they are getting pretty few and far between.

If Apple do think in this direction, I think it's more practical for them to have 2 equal size screens, an iPhone-like touchscreen for videos, games, and dynamic web browsing and an e-ink screen for reading books, magazine, and static web contents. The touchscreen can be used to control and navigate the e-ink screen (think of your laptop monitor being the eink screen and the keyboard being the touchscreen). It can be folded in like a laptop to protect the 2 screens or fold out (with both screens on the outside) when in used.<p>Now that is one way Apple will convince me to drop updwards of $600 despite owning a Macbook, iPhone, and a Kindle.",1262291277

If we multiply this matrix A with an arbitrary unit vector (considering just the direction in the given dimensions) B, then we'll have a certain set of possible resulting vectors (A X B). The eigenvectors are whenever the same unit vector B lines up in direction with (A X B)--where both vectors are dependent on B, and the eigenvalues are the corresponding scalars which must multiply the unit eigenvector to match the resulting A X B vector. The eigenvector does not have to be a unit vector, but since any multiple of the eigenvector can still be a valid eigenvector, you probably just want the unit vector or at least the lowest whole number reduction. If you reduce the eigenvector, the eigenvalue must be changed too.<p>In equation form: Ax=Ωx\nWhere A is a matrix you are trying to transform, and x is the possible eigenvector, and Ω is the eigenvalue.<p>In graphical form (this was what really did the trick): <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/Tools/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/Tools...</a> (Demo #1)<p>And the matrices are simply a different form of a set of equations while still preserving their relative properties. The matrix form allows you to easily manipulate the original set of data with matrix operations. I guess the matrix can also just represent a set of column vectors (which are just a direction in a space with a magnitude) too.<p>Let me know if I got anything wrong.",1262291248

Building a CMS is trivial. For us, we found that we could take our designer's deliverable site and just serve the pages up in Sinatra verbatim as Erb instead of HTML. Done!<p>2. Once your static site is nominally dynamic, you can easily improve it. Trivial things, like integrating analytics, are truly trivial, but even ""significant"" things are easier in your own code. For instance, screenshots are just a template substitution for us; a tiny piece of markup in any static page, and fwoosh a fully functional lightboxed captioned screenshot.<p>3. A ""real"" CMS comes with many hundreds of developer hours put into making admin and workflow ""pretty"". <i>Wow</i> is our admin/workflow not pretty. Who cares? Your CMS is more agile than a general-purpose CMS because you don't have to put a penny into stuff that doesn't matter.<p>4. Once you have a dynamic site, you are now in a position to come up with ""marketing features"", which you won't really think about until you are in that position. Customer lifecycle + Mailchimp? User-generated content? Live-chat based beta product support? Web versions of downloadable products? These are things that are <i>quarterly</i> objectives when you don't have your own CMS, and are <i>weekly</i> objectives when you do.<p>One thing I forgot to mention in my sprawling parent comment:<p><i>You do not know how to do any of this stuff until you start doing it.</i><p>Content generation and SEO are a perfect example. You have no idea what you need to do until you get <i>something</i> out there, so you can start monitoring how it gets used. For us, we wrote a page template we thought was nominally effective, and bugged it with Google Analytics. Within days of it getting spidered, the keyword logs had 10+ <i>obvious, trivial changes</i> to make the pages more effective; we literally just had to include a couple more words (""permit"" instead of ""allow"", for instance).<p>But given that we know this is true (intellectually, if not viscerally) about product development, and we can plainly see that it's true for content generation, it seems fair to suggest that it's axiomatic.
