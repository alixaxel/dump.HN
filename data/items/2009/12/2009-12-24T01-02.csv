To me, ""would of"" is not a typo such as ""mroe"" instead of ""more"" caused by a slip of the fingers, or skipping over a word because you are hurrying, and it's not a minor mental slip such as continuing a short-term pattern of apostrophe use, e.g. ""the cat's over here, the cat's over there, the cat's everywhere and the pigeon's are in a state"", and it is not in the same category as the mixup between ""your"" and ""you're"", because both are in very common use - ""would've"" is in very common use but ""would of"" is not (500M Google results for would've plus would have, only 5M for would of).<p>""Would of"" gives me the impression of someone who either doesn't read much (where do you ever see 'would of' in a formal published paper or book outside quotations/dialogue?), or doesn't pronounce what they say clearly (because if they did it would reinforce that 've and of are different), or doesn't pay enough attention to what they are writing to think 'oh that's not right'.<p>It was also because it was in the midst of a post about how the author was great at a foreign language and should have been allowed to finish schooling sooner, even though this is the sort of mistake that seems to be made more by uneducated people which would counter the idea that leaving school sooner would have been a good plan.<p>I was trying to draw attention to it by butchering a famous speech to make it stand out, and because I don't just want to say ""dumbass ha ha"", but wonder whether it is in a different class of mistake to the usual mistakes seen on the internet (possibly along with ""if I would have known"" - how can people say that instead of ""if I had known"" without realising that it means something completely different?).<p>Also, interesting how as soon as I posted it it was voted down, then over a day or two it climbed back to +4 or so, and now has been knocked down again.

It seems like chef is a set of great core tools, but putting them all together and getting an environment going is still more work than it should be.<p>The two times I've used chef (first chef-solo, then setting up a chef-server) ended up being far more work than just setting up a server manually (haven't had to scale out tons of servers yet, which I assume makes the current chef setup time worthwhile).<p>I'd like to see chef evolve into something more like Heroku, where I setup a few config files and then run a simple command line script.<p>The benefit of Chef Platform is that it would (hopefully) be a simple monthly fee (like say $10/month) instead of fee on top of every server resource I use.

1013221,comment,1011258,1011624,0,0,mambamamba,,,">>But I've not found any primary or objective secondary sources on how this went<p>It's definitely true. Progressivism is the memetic leftover of north-eastern US Mainline Protestantism. The poster above you makes the mistake of comparing it to actual religions, when progressivism has evolved to drop the religious components, which still makes its followers the cultural descendants of creepy religious maniacs even though they don't believe in a God (also, as a side note, consider that this makes progressives not ""anti-American"" as right wingers make them about to be, but ""ultra-American"" in the sense of trying to make the US progress into a more 'pure' and ethical state, as the Puritans wanted it to be. Edit: also consider that this might make the right/left 'culture war' more of a religious war between two protestant-influenced sects). This was mainly done for political power. Think about it, there is supposed to be a disconnect in the US between the state and religion, what better way for a memeplex to adapt to its environment then to drop the supernatural bits, and focus on propagating the values, mores, and aspirations of its believers through political power.<p>You asked for evidence, here is a number of excellent sources:<p>The main book you should read is ""The Puritan Origins of AMerican Patriotism."" That pretty much lays out the argument.<p>Also check out ""The Making of An American Thinking Class: Intellectuals and Intelligentsia in Puritan Massachusetts."" It makes the case that Puritans are the forefathers of American radicalism.<p>I also recommend these:<p>God's New Israel: Religious Interpretation of American Destiny.<p>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Authoritarianism.<p>Hellfire Nation: The politics of sin in America.<p>Also check out Michael Burleigh's two books on political religions (Earthly Powers and Sacred Causes). This isn't an aberration of history. Religious movements often drop their supernatural components under the guise of 'reason' and 'rationality' so as to adapt to the culture and politics.<p>And if you are still not convinced, here is a large list by an American urban historian: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/A-History-of-American-Radicalism/lm/R20ZCIY17VJA5T/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/A-History-of-American-Radicalism/lm/R2...</a><p>Edit: I also forgot to mention there is a blogger that writes about this topic often.

If inflation increases, so do your wages, prices at stores, and interest rates (savings rate, loans rate, etc).<p>> <i>Think of the Fed... charging you interest on every dollar in your pocket every second of every day, without your permission or consent.</i><p>Like I said before: <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the real value of your money remains the same. A dollar may be worth less, but that is compensated with higher interest rates, wages, etc.<p>> <i>At any time, the central bank has the power to increase the interest rate...</i><p>Yes, and that is part of their monetary policy. HOWEVER, interest rates are used as a <i>signal</i> for the macro economy, not a cause. Let's say there is a sudden upward shift of the demand of money (because of a speculative bubble, for our example; a sudden explosion of investing). This shift in demand would therefore change where the supply of money intersects the demand of money. This point is higher. As I've said before, the interest rate (price level) is a response variable. With this situation, the theoretical price level would increase to where this new intersection takes place. <i>The FED</i> can, as a response, increase the supply of money, shifting the supply to the right, hopefully returning the intersection of the (new) demand and (new) supply curve to a level where the interest rate is constant. That way, a constant price level (might) be maintained.<p>One aspect you've neglected to mention is the breadth of our <i>global</i> economy. The dollar is <i>the</i> global currency (or so I've heard). Let's say that our currency is weakening (becoming less valuable) compared to the euro. The Europeans would then take their money out of the market for dollars, thus decreasing the supply of dollars (a leftward supply shift). This shift would then cause our <i>signal</i> price level (interest rate) to increase. The change in interest rate is not our doing (partially).<p>There is a way around inflation. If we back our currency with gold/silver/something whose value is stable and makes good commodity money, then the value of money is much more stable. However, the US won't do that.",1261618490

I think Starship Troopers explored this idea very well: there were planets humans were not even aware they were bug colonies. All weapons are designed making certain assumptions about their target. If all assumptions are wrong, the weapon is very ineffective. You can't use a torpedo to sink a mountain.<p>I didn't watch the movie, but from what I saw, I gather human technology can barely function there due to the magnetic fields of the gas giant and/or its moon.

I learned programming with BASIC myself in that same timeframe.<p>But today we have languages that are superior and don't have the hang ups that BASIC has. I don't see why we should be devoting resources towards new (and mutually incompatible) implementations of BASIC. Python is easy to learn and can scale to any level of sophistication (but it doesn't require you to know the advanced stuff to write little games, like Java requires you to learn OOP).",1261617254

Evolution doesn't work like that!  Rattlesnakes do not grow rattles for your benefit!  I'm afraid that yon astrophysicist knows rather a bit more about physics than about evolutionary biology if the <i>inter-species universal complex adaptations</i> didn't jump out at him.<p>As for the planetary tree-mind being able to <i>read out human brain networks using its own standardized equipment</i>, who are they kidding?<p>Yes, the whole plot would have worked without it!  The central tree could have been providing a vital nutrient without which the local ecosystem would fail, or something that their women needed to reproduce.  There's no reason you need telepathy to ride a horse.  The final stampede could have been started by one or more heroes, rather than being magic.  And the final body-swap wasn't really necessary (just keep using the old equipment), but it could have been an effect of running the interface for a sufficiently long time (the alien brain gets reprogrammed).<p>And then it would have been <i>hard science fiction</i>, which would have made a visually-awesome, okay-plot movie into one of the greatest SF movies of all time.<p>Also, I will accept pretty alien ladies for the sake of plot, but having them cry tears is going too far, and it's not necessary.  That really jumped out at me.<p>Avatar was good, but it could have been so much more if they'd spent five minutes thinking about how to get the plot effect they wanted via science instead of magic.",1261617198

It is also true that any government administering debts denominated in the country's on currency are tempted to inflate them away, indirectly taxing the citizenry.<p>On the other hand, ownership of specie (hard currency), although a useful hedge, is no guarantee against economic hardship. In addition to deflation and the resulting economic distortions, at numerous times through history those with large holdings have seen it confiscated by fiat, or quasi-inflation can result from debasement/ seignorage and coin clipping. The Bank of England had a currency crisis back when Isaac Newton was master of the Mint due to disparities between the perceived relative values of gold and silver. I could go on, but my basic point is that you can abuse a hard currency almost as easily as a fiat one.<p>besides, if central banks issuing fiat currency are so evil as to steal from the pockets of the citizenry via inflation, why do all the largest and most powerful central banks fight against inflation using their control over interest rates? I'm honestly confused by your apparent ideological slant.",1261617118

Winamp had a lot of audio tweaking/editing-like features also.  By taking his investment of knowledge about audio programming, he saved a significant amount of time in recreating something similar with his pro tools v0.0.1. I wouldn't be surprised if he copied a good chunk of code from winamp too.<p>Also he was starting from square one.
