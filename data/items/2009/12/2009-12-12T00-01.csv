If my cursor is on the g, I can say ctOcreate<esc> (change the text between the cursor up to the character before the next O to read ""create"").  outside of vim, I have to move my cursor over to the O, backspace out the ""getNew"" and then type ""create"".<p>a nine character difference (or three if you have a delete-character command) doesn't sound like much, but it adds up & also breaks you out of your flow a little bit.

This is my first post [0] for a couple of years. But there was a time when I lived here. I remember when /. was sold & CmdrTaco said all he wanted to do was run it I'm sure I for one didn't believe he'd still be at it now. The sig/noise is still bad if you trawl below the +2 level. But at +5 it's readable. I think the combination of moderation, ability to filter comments (text, best comments at top), culture and relationships have helped shape the site into something still readable. HackerNews exhibits all of the same sorts of growing pains /. had to go through.<p>[0] <a href=""http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1475404&cid=30409194"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1475404&cid=30409194</a>",1260579547

It seems that in general as a social news site ages, matures, and grows, the comment quality follows an inverse pattern. Or more simply, as the number of users approaches infinity, the comment quality approaches 4chan. Digg used to be a decent site for discussion; now you'd be laughed at for even suggesting that the comments might be notable. Reddit is quickly getting there. Slashdot though seems to best this pattern. While I'm well aware that someone will reply to this with ""In soviet russia 4chan approaches you!"" or something similar in a successful attempt to disprove my point, but I think it still holds true in some respect.
