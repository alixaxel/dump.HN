This discourages savings and encourages debt. So even though there are massive amounts of money to be made with a bank, I think that it's pretty hard to come up with the capital needed to open a bank. In this sense being a banker is like being a drug dealer. You can make a lot of money, but you can't consume what you sell. If you do, you end up being just another customer, a buyer not a seller.",1260733130

Someone decided that using a fast-food metaphor might yield insight into the future of the publishing business -- hence, this essay. But that's an inane metaphor. The food business is very, very different from the publishing business. Fast food joints like McDonald's succeed because, among other things, great chefs do not scale: I can't click a button and eat a meal made by Jamie Oliver, because the guy lives in another country and food can't travel over TCP/IP; even if it could it can't be copied using rsync; the guy only has two hands and there's a line out the door for tables; the quality depends on ingredients which cost a lot; and even if I have a great meal on Tuesday there's no guarantee that Jamie's Wednesday meal will be great -- maybe Wednesday's special is made with basil, but I'm allergic to basil.<p>But none of this is a problem with publishing in the age of the Internet.",1260732887

In a perfect world, I'd like to rank for that query, rather than having to pay eHow for an AdSense click about it.<p>I have, nonetheless, paid over $20 over the past year for clicks on ads on this page:<p><a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_2120747_make-bingo-cards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/how_2120747_make-bingo-cards.html</a><p>Demand Media's entire business model is that that page cost them $4 to create.  They keep half of what I pay Google, so they're ahead quite a bit on that page -- and there are other advertisers than me with ads there.<p>My strategy for competing with this, such that it is, is to go for depth over breadth, do a bit of the outsourcing thing myself, and compensate for my comparative lack of scale with focused use of programming.  I pretty much can't outrank eHow for ""How to X"" questions in a systematically economic manner.  I can, however, outpublish them regarding actual bingo cards which, since it is what the customer <i>actually wants</i>, tend to get the links and build the self-reinforcing authority.<p>For those of us who are at least partially in the publishing business (and I really am at least partially in the publishing business by dint of my SEO strategy), you have to have some idea of how you're going to compete on the long tail versus mass amounts of textually unique garbage backed up by impressive domain authority.  At least until Google brings the hammer down on them.  (Honestly, that Wired piece would have made me very uneasy if I were working for them.  Google doesn't mind people doing SEO, but SEO which scales algorithmically pisses them off like you wouldn't believe.  That is practically their working definition for black hat.)",1260732054
