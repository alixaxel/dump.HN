1019570,comment,1018796,1018796,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I enjoyed the article very much and I have the same experience.  The reason that my previous startup was successful was the fact that all of my co-Founders had been long-time veterans of their own industry (which they help built in the past 20+ years). No one couldn’t have gotten that important product insight by just talking to customers. Customers know what to object and what to improve when you present them with an imperfect product but not when you present them with a perfect PowerPoint. Henry Ford had said that if he had listened to his customers, he would have built a faster horse because that was what his customers wanted. Similarly, Steve Jobs could not have designed his iPod (and iPhone) had he not been a music fanatic. Entrepreneurs must learn to listen to our hearts if we believe that we are the perfect ""surrogate"" customer. Good luck, everyone.",1262041033

The biggest problem we had with taking calls on the air wasn't so much that we couldn't afford the phone lines, but that we couldn't afford the call-screener. If you had a system that could simulate let's say 10 lines, whereby people call in, it plays an automated screening message asking them their name and purpose of their call, and then it transcribed that onto the DJ's computer screen and allowed them to pick which calls to answer while the rest remain on hold, that would be awesome!<p>I don't doubt this could probably be done with some combination of Google Voice and Grasshopper.

The downside of continuous deployment is that you see more problems in production than you would with a fully regressed build.  The advantage is that those problems cost 1/10th as much to fix, releases occur much more frequently, and you have a tight feedback chain between your customer and the product.<p>The argument for Continuous Deployment is that you _always_ see problems in production, and that all you are injecting from moving from a staged-release cycle to CD is that you are now seeing 10-15% more issues (Let's say 60 P2 or greater Issues instead of 50 P2 or greater Issues), but the cost of fixing everything has dropped significantly, fixes occur much, much more quickly (sometimes same day instead of multiple months), and you are able to enjoy the productivity advantages of your software that is finely tuned to the users needs much, much more quickly.   CD can (and usually does) result in less downtime than stages releases - mostly because of the rapid cycle from coding -> error detection -> problem resolution.<p>The _only_ problem as I see it, is that you don't have as much control over the probability of a P1 issue hitting your system.  That's fine in the case of something like Amazon.com, where a P1 issue might cost the organization $10 million dollars, but they've received $50 million dollars in value from using CD.  It's not the case where a P1 issue might result in a catastrophic loss measured in 10s of Billions of dollars (Power Grid, Shuttle Launch, Nuclear Systems) - for those, you need to stage ensure 100% coverage/regression/code review.  In fact, you need 100% coverage/review of your _development techniques_, not just the code produced.",1262038316

Claire Cranton.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>We have been asked about this a number of times and the industry position is below. A5/1 has been in existence for a long time and so we have developed A5/3 as a migratory strategy for operators. However what I'd like to stress is that this activity is highly illegal and in the UK would be a serious RIPA offence as it probably is in most countries, it is likely also to contravene IPR. The GSMA heads up a security working group which looks at all issues re security and this isn't something that we take lightly at all.<p>Best wishes
Claire<p>STATEMENT ON GSM ENCRYPTION
GSM networks use encryption technology to make it difficult for criminals to intercept and eavesdrop on calls. On most GSM networks, the communications link between the handset and the radio base station uses the A5/1 privacy algorithm to scramble the signal.<p>Over the past few years, a number of academic papers setting out, in theory, how the A5/1 algorithm could be compromised have been published. However, none to date have led to a practical attack capability being developed against A5/1 that can be used on live, commercial GSM networks.<p>Reports of an imminent GSM eavesdropping capability are common. The GSMA, which welcomes research designed to improve the security of communications networks, routinely monitors the work of groups in this area. In 2007-8, a hacking group claimed to be building an attack on A5/1 by constructing a large look-up table1 of approximately 2 Terabytes - this is equivalent to the amount of data contained in a 20 kilometre high pile of books. In theory, someone with access to the data in such a table could use it to analyse an encrypted call and recover the encryption key.<p>Another group has announced similar plans in 2009. However, before a practical attack could be attempted, the GSM call has to be identified and recorded from the radio interface. So far, this aspect of the methodology has not been explained in any detail and we strongly suspect that the teams attempting to develop an intercept capability have underestimated its practical complexity. A hacker would need a radio receiver system and the signal processing software necessary to process the raw radio data. The complex knowledge required to develop such software is subject to intellectual property rights, making it difficult to turn into a commercial product.<p>Today, mobile networks are typically configured to optimise call set-up times, capacity and other aspects related to operational efficiency. But mobile operators could, if it ever proved necessary, quickly alter these configurations to make the 1 A definition of a lookup table is available at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table</a> interception and deciphering of calls considerably harder. Moreover, intercepting a mobile call is likely to constitute a criminal offence in most jurisdictions.<p>All in all, we consider this research, which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations, to be a long way from being a practical attack on GSM. More broadly, A5/1 has proven to be a very effective and resilient privacy mechanism. By comparison, inexpensive and readily available radio scanners could be used to intercept calls on the analogue cellular networks that pre-dated GSM and which did not use encryption.<p>The mobile industry is committed to maintaining the integrity of GSM services and the protection and privacy of customer communications is at the forefront of operators' concerns. The GSMA has been working to further enhance privacy protection on GSM networks and has developed a new high-strength algorithm, A5/3. Over the past decade, export control agencies have removed many of the traditional barriers to the sale of cryptographic technologies enabling the development and use of A5/3. This new privacy algorithm is being phased in to replace A5/1.
