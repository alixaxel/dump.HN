The key is not to over-compensate. It is similar to riding a bike. Just because you fell on the left last time doesn’t mean you will fall on the left again. Sometimes entrepreneurs over-compensate by learning their mistakes all too well. If they failed because they had too much money, they will try to do the next one bootstrapping. If they failed because there wasn’t enough understanding of the market, they will try to do the next one with a bunch of salesmen. We need to learn from our past but we need to keep in mind that every opportunity is different. Time does not stand still and the rest of the world does not wait. Don’t be a victim of your own experience.",1261335458

In a big city you can't possibly acknowledge everybody you pass, so you acknowledge nobody. There's one exception: people who go for walks early in the morning are often keen to greet one another; partly because you might be the first person they've seen today, and partly because early risers are somewhat of a secret sub-society within the city.<p>Combine the ""small town"" thing with the ""early morning"" thing and you've got trouble, though. In a small town in Maine at six in the morning I encountered a guy who thought it was incredibly rude that I wouldn't stop and discuss (a) the weather and (b) where I was from as I walked past his house.

In bignum territory, addition isn't free, but is still pretty cheap.<p>The closed form solution involves computing something raised to the power of n, so would be O(log n) assuming nonintegral multiplication is O(1), which is... not so much the case. Given that the (sqrt 5) factors will always be eliminated by the end you can manipulate things to work with only integers, at the expense of complicating the algorithm.<p>The matrix-based solution, which I had forgotten, is also of the form x^n, so is probably isomorphic to a sufficiently clever handling of Binet's formula that completely avoids the (sqrt 5) terms.<p>So, yes, good call, the matrix approach is better--you win this round.<p>[0] The naive un-memoized recursive algorithm, such as the recursive solution in the linked article, is not only not tail-recursive, but manages to have <i>time complexity of precisely O(fib(n))</i>.

The morphology system are similar, they have the same word order, are both tonal in a similar way, and there are even parallels that can be drawn in terms of their phonology; some words are even phonemically identical.  However, their core inventory of phonemes is quite different: there are sounds in Korean that just do not occur in Japanese.  Like Japanese, the categorization of Korean is debated; Wikipedia is helpful here if you want to know more.<p>Now, Mandarin Chinese is entirely different.  The tonal system is different, it lacks an overt inflection system, word order is different, and the phoneme inventory is, again, different.  While there is vocabulary sharing going on, it's hard to see any technical relationships between them.<p>I've heard a number of different stories on how the Korean peninsula and Japanese archipelago were settled by the Chinese, from the Chinese, but it just doesn't seem plausible considering the linguistics of the regions.

Since you asked, let me see:<p>A bunch of various throwaway programs or clones of small utilities I had already written in other languages. An utility to update metadata in my oggs, a command that finds similar files, a little solver to answer questions about a given set of different relations (I actually needed such a solver to make some decisions at work so I programmed myself one), bunch of other file/text based unixish tools. Conclusion: 1) Java's I/O APIs are from hell. 2) Clojure can do a lot in only a few words of code.<p>Some GTK applications via libjava-gnome-java. Works much better than AWT/Swing used in many sample applications, and is much Linux friendly. Lots of Java interop training there :) Will try out LWJGL soon, in an attempt to port a small OpenGL game to Clojure: the game is mostly about experimenting some gameplay ideas so the OpenGL implementation is rather straight-forward and anything but time-critical, thus, the OpenGL backend is great candidate for porting to a new language. I've already learned that Clojure is a great help in transforming my thoughts into code so I prefer to do any prototyping in it these days.<p>A simple gravity simulation: a friendly way for experimenting with parallel features and transactional memory, agents etc. as you have lots of dependent things moving independently, and I got to ""optimize"" some Clojure number-crunching as well. And there's ants.clj and other parallel sample programs already so I could compare myself to others.<p>An evolutionary algorithm aimed at the travelling salesman problem, one of the very first Clojure programs I wrote that introduced me nicely to basic data structures and abstractions in Clojure such as the ubiquitous seqs. I used Swing for the GUI -- crap.<p>A small Reddit clone. I actually wanted to prototype a few nice ideas I had with regard to news aggregators like HN and Reddit in general so it was mostly not about Clojure. But it offered me a very welcome chance to experiment maintaining global state in an efficient and functional way (server application), got to think about how would I create a live disk-backed database hopefully mostly in Clojure, wrote some basic html generator macros in Clojure, and got some taste of Java interop by hooking the thing up to Java's http server. Excellent project and still ongoing whenever I feel like it.<p>A simple attempt at Casino (the card game) AI. I probably wrote a sudoku solver too although the most recent I can recall was in Haskell. But I always write a sudoku solver in a new language so I probably did one in Clojure as well.<p>Oh, and a small layout library for GUIs. I have a thing for those. It's rather incomplete as it was one of the very first Clojure programs I ever wrote; I could rewrite it now and make it much more shorter, faster and idiomatic should I actually come up with a _need_ to have a layout library of my own :)<p>That's about it, more or less.

Mainly, they were just big and hard to change. The OO aspects didn't help, mainly because of their tendency to object-graph spaghetti.<p>There was an inaccuracy in what I said (mainly for brevity). It's not true that you <i>can't</i> refactor such systems to solve their design problems. Technically, you can refactor anything into anything. What I mean by ""can't be refactored"" is ""can't be refactored at a cost less than writing a whole new program"". Even then, that's too strong, since you can't prove that.
