1013053,comment,1012112,1012981,0,0,timwiseman,,,"While you have an interesting point, it is an invalid analogy:<p>After the fall of the Roman Empire that part of the world involuntarily fell into a dark age, that is very different from intentionally eschewing technology.  And those societies did rediscover most of the lost knowledge and began progressing again.<p>Presumably a society with advanced technology that did something as drastic as getting rid of all of it would have left behind reasons so that their ancestors would also avoid it, or at least be able to make an informed choice.  It would not be hard to ensure that endured (barring a major catastrophe) for many generations.<p>It could have taken the form of oral histories which can be preserved (at least in general intent, even if details change) for very long stretches, or maintaining writing even if it was restricted to their spiritual leader caste, or even one remaining piece of technology in the form of an extremely durable recording that speaks to them on set anniversaries.<p>Giving up technology is very different to losing it as a society collapses into a dark age from a combination of corruption, war, and other factors.<p>Also, the Roman Empire did not have anything to function as an ancestral memory.  While it has been mentioned several times before that the limits of the Soul Trees function as an ancestral memory were left vague, it seems likely that something as fundamental as deliberately eschewing technology would show up at least as echoes of an aversion to technology.",1261609085

1013041,comment,1012871,1012871,0,0,lionhearted,,,"If this sort of thing is fascinating to you, and you consume caffeine, you absolutely <i>must</i> spend the short time to learn about antagonistic and reinforcing caffeine usage. I've read a few papers on it, but I'm not finding any of the best ones by googling. This link has a short overview though:<p><a href=""http://arvindn.livejournal.com/57651.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arvindn.livejournal.com/57651.html</a><p>> What is common to these tasks is that progress happens in spurts, due to the fact that they involve frequent cognitive bottlenecks. A cognitive bottleneck can only be overcome when attention level exceeds a task dependent, typically very high threshold. Clearly, then, antagonistic caffeine consumption results in worse-than-normal productivity, because it flattens the attention level curve and decreases the fraction of time spent at peak attention level. Instead, reinforcing consumption helps maximize productivity (the red line). According to this strategy, the best time to drink coffee is when you are already very alert.<p>Basically, caffeine gives you a boost, then withdrawal. If you're doing creative work, time your caffeine consumption to your high energy periods, then rest during the withdrawal. If you're doing rote, repetitious work, take caffeine during your low periods to smooth your energy out.<p>This is <i>incredible</i> for your productivity, especially if you're doing creative work that you can't brute force yourself to finish. Highly recommended, almost should be mandatory for any anyone who consumes caffeine and does creative work.",1261608591

I might be uber-productive in a particular domain (Java programming), however put me in an environment that does Groovy programming and I will stink as much as the next newbie. However good programmers develop techniques for meta-uber-productivity. They know what it takes to get uber-productive in another domain in a short time and what works for them. 
My way to try and me more productive in any environment is to get my hands dirty, start soon and make changes often. Practice makes perfect.
As an individual you can be uber productive, just practice more of what you want to be productive at. Want to be productive at running a business, start your own and practice it. Want to be uber productive at programming, write code lots of it, and so on and so forth.",1261608060

1013024,story,,,41,45,joshkaufman,"Inflation as a Compound Annual Interest Rate",,"I was just browsing through ""The Economist Numbers Guide,"" and read the part on inflation. Here's the part that jumped out at me, which I thought the econ geeks here would find thought-provoking:<p>""Accounting for inflation is easy in a numerical sense. The ugly dragon is nothing more than an interest charge. The annual rate of inflation is compounded yearly."" (p.51)<p>I've heard inflation referred to as a ""hidden tax"" (which it is), but framing it as compound interest charged to all dollars circulating in an economy is new to me. The beneficiary of this ""interest"" is the monetary issuer (the central bank) and the member banks that receive the use of this new money first, before the money is devalued due to the increase in supply.<p>Think of the Fed (or your respective central bank) as the equivalent of a big JP Morgan Chase / MBNA / Bank of America credit card, charging you interest on every dollar in your pocket every second of every day, without your permission or consent. At any time, the central bank has the power to increase the interest rate (by printing more money), and there's no way you can opt-out outside of reverting to bartering for goods directly.<p>They don't even have to bill you: your money simply becomes less valuable over time, so it takes more currency to buy the same goods. If you're like 99.999% of the human population that holds some form of fiat currency, you're paying compound annual interest to the central bank in exchange for nothing. Eventually, the currency becomes worthless - historically, every fiat currency ever created as eventually lost 100% of its value. It's less a question of ""if"" and more a question of ""when"".<p>Now I have a better idea of what Mayer Amschel Rothschild meant when he said, ""Give me control of a nation's money supply, and I care not who makes its laws.""",1261607699

I hate to be the guy who is arguing for mystical innate ability. However, it seems naive to claim that it doesn't exist.<p>To end this comment on a useful note, the one thing I noticed both with the good skateboarders and the good programmers I know, is that they would 'go big' when practicing. the skaters would try something hard and figure it out until they got it. They wouldn't just sit around and do the same kickflip in a parking lot over and over again.<p>Likewise, the good programmers I knew would always be seriously challenging themselves. For practice programs, they wouldn't just write a dumb fibonacci generator. They'd write a full blown throttling distributed network file copier, or a scheme compiler in postscript. Serious, hard projects for practice. Most programming is mundane and you can go for years without getting any better. The best guys I know are never complacent with doing the same boring shit all day - they'd always challenge themselves.",1261606145

I had never heard it before (I'd be interested if you have a reference that goes into more detail), but it certainly seem like there is a historical correalation and thinking about it you do seem to need at least a minimum population size (enough to allow people to specialize in careers instead of everyone being generalists with food production their prime concern) to develop advanced technology.<p>At least offhand, I am not certain how well that causitive factor holds after that threshold has been reached.  And that <i>All other things being equal</i> caveat is likely to be of significant importance here.  I am speculating, but I would guess that after the minimum threshold is passed than the amount of value the culture places on education and technology itself will likely swamp out size or growth rates in terms of encouraging technological advance.  In other words, after the minimum is reached, you would increase technological development faster by affecting the culture of the people than by increasing the population, and that affect is likely to be so great to mask differences in population size.<p><i>I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm guessing the Na'vi did not have very large or dense populations.</i>
The total planetary population is never stated but the population for the region the movie focuses on is said to be in the neighborhood of 200,000 very roughly.<p><i>As for their global Gaia network, does the movie explain if it actually transfer chunks of knowledge (memes) or experiential patterns, or is it 'lower level' and works more like sharing emotions?</i><p>This is ambiguous.  At one point it is shown that at least under certain conditions absolutely everything can be shared and transferred, but that was under exceptional circumstances.  How it operates under normal conditions is left quite vague.<p>The movie is well worth seeing if you haven't.",1261605793
