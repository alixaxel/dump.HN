That's exactly what Treacherous Computing advocates have in mind for PCs.<p>> There is a limit to how secure you can make a modern PC without hardware support for security<p>You have bought into the Big Lie of treacherous computing. None of it has <i>anything</i> to do with protecting you against what most people would recognize as malware. That would require writing robust and non-porous operating systems - an option which simply isn't on the table. The ""malware"" you will be protected against is, for instance: DVD rippers; P2P clients; TOR clients; and, eventually, compilers (for with an unrestricted compiler one might create any of the above.)<p>> any hardware support that protects your machine can also be opted in to protect the interests of someone else<p>Can I lock you in your house using the lock presently installed in your front door? How about the one in your car?<p>Every security technology has a clearly delineated ""outside"" and ""inside."" The ""outside"" is where the keyed side of the lock faces. Another ""outside"" of this kind is the inside of a cage. Treacherous computing leaves users on the outside, no doubt about it. And the ""keys"" are in the hands of people who would like to dictate which bits in the machines you bought and paid for you are allowed to view or flip.<p>I ought to point out that I believe that evil will triumph.

Yes, they <i>are</i> terrible at long term planning, because humans are <i>really terrible</i> at predicting the future, e.g., predicting the size and magnitude of AGW.<p>It's simply not true that preventing a worst case scenario is worth any price.

The fact that the west decided to outright ban the stuff isn't that big of a deal given the fact that there aren't terribly many Malaria deaths in the United States or Norway.<p>And those restrictions were put in place for good reason: For DDT to be effective in wide areas (rather than targeted spraying indoors) you essentially need something potent enough to disrupt the entire Entomological portion of the eco-system, which works its way up to small mammals, which can eventually impact certain key predators.<p>One infamous example this occurred in Borneo in the 1950s. The WHO responded to a malaria outbreak on the island by spraying DDT.  It abated the malaria problem but completely disrupted insect life which lead to numerous problems culminating in roofs collapsing from an overpopulation of thatch-eating caterpillars, along with killing of mammalian predators that ate lizards (which ate DDT-laden insects). This caused an overpopulation of rats which started spreading typhoid and plague.  The rat problem was ultimately solved by airdropping cats.",1260926001

Covert channels are a <i>fundamental</i> problem in systems security, and that's been well-known since Salzer-Schroeder.<p>In the real world, the arms race of encoding and detecting extends to the horizon of our understanding of computer science and, most importantly, software engineering. Nobody knows all the mistakes that humans will make attempting to engineer systems to do perfect cover channels. For the forseeable future, both sides of this problem need to come to grips with the fact that they're armed imperfectly.<p>However, in the data leak scenario, the incentives are lined up to favor the monitors and not the leakers. The monitors have budget, continuous practice, access to all company communications to derive norms, and roughly the same access to equipment as the leakers. Meanwhile, if the leakers are caught just once, they're liable for extreme civil and (in some cases) criminal penalties.",1260925989
