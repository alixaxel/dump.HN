992610,comment,990523,991831,0,0,chrischen,,,"From personal experience, I feel reduced amounts of gratification from doing mundane things. Mental stimulation is reduced, therefore I'm driven, in some cases like a motor, to find more stimulation. Activity in the brain , in the form of thoughts, is one way to increase stimulation. Stimulant drugs satisfies this need for stimulation, so we don't need to keep on thinking about stuff, like the meaning of life. My theory is that this need to race through thoughts is the mechanism for bad short term memory. Running through more thoughts means old thoughts are forgotten.<p>There are also different types of Adhd by the way. There's inattentive and hyperactive. My explanation probably fits inattentive ADHD since that's where my personal experience lies.",1260697783

Another guy wanted to snap a picture of something and send it to me, but was hesitant to take his iPhone out of his pocket, not knowing who might be around to see him using it.<p>I'm sure some of it is joking, some of it is half-joking, but there is some anxiety around being seen internally using a competitor's winning product.",1260696428

I can't really figure out what this actually means.<p><i>Many countries, including the United States, are developing weapons for use on computer networks that are ever more integral to the operations of everything from banks to electrical power systems to government offices. They include ""logic bombs"" that can be hidden in computers to halt them at crucial times or damage circuitry; ""botnets"" that can disable or spy on Web sites and networks; or microwave radiation devices that can burn out computer circuits miles away.</i><p>Next thing you know, they'll talk about outlawing war.",1260696361

If you make it easier for many people to find something, what do they do with the aggregate free time they now have on their hands? If you make it cheaper, what do they do with the aggregate 'unused' money? If the time and money enables yet another 'simple' contribution to freeing up time and money, then how far does this snowball roll? Perhaps it will end up freeing us to do humanitarian work, because there is really nothing else that requires our time and money?<p>It's a similar question to: ""What most reduces human suffering? If Eliezer keeps doing what he is doing or if he goes to Africa and helps people survive in a refugee camp?"" It may turn out you are wrong about everything and helping in a camp would have been better for humanity.

The ability to say ""tacos"" and have it bring back the nearest places to get tacos, and the ability to take pictures of things and have them explained (Goggles), a <i>much</i> better GPS than the iPhone or any other phone I'm aware of, and an extremely high res screen, pretty much had her convinced within minutes of firing it up for the first time.<p>It is a very nice device.

992588,comment,992023,992023,0,0,erikstarck,,,"There is a similar line of thought in how tech people always seem to think their startup idea has to be something completely new. It usually goes like this...<p>Person A: I got this great idea! If you do X to Y you will get Z which is of huge value for people working in M. Great, huh?<p>Person B: Yawn. Company SomeCorp did that in 1974.<p>Person A (spirit broken): Darn...<p>The idea that a new company has to come up with something completely new must be unique to our business. Even so, the number of successful web companies that did not have a unique idea when they started should be enough to kill the argument, but it lives on.<p>Probably because of the reason mentioned in this post: smart people just don't think it's smart enough to do something someone else has already done.",1260695439

Better tooling - IDE refactoring when I need to change things. Red squigglies when I make a typo or reference something thats not there. A real debugger with breakpoints for finding bugs. Auto completion and auto style formatting so I dont have to type so goddamn much.<p>2. Compiler optimizations - Your code gets faster and smaller. Write maintainable code, have it turned into performant code.<p>3. API's and libraries - easy client server RPC, discoverable wrappers for the DOM APIs. Reuseable widgets that have predictable structure/side effects!<p>4. Maintainable code base - If you worked with more than 4 engineers on a non-trivial product, you would understand the appeal of a Java code base. UIBinder lets me not worry about CSS name collisions.<p>I would go on, but you seem like a TLDR type of person, so it would probably be a waste of my time.",1260695112

It sounds like the guy sold MySQL for a billion dollars, and now wants to be handed the rights to use the code in a closed source program while denying Oracle (who paid for Sun who paid for MySQL) the ability to do the same.",1260694931
