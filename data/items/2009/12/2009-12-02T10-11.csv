971862,comment,970423,971193,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Let’s take Twitter as an example then.<p>The only reason that Twitter is possible, at any kind of scale, is because decades of research have been put into the algorithms that route messages inside big computer systems. Do you remember that first year or two of Twitter when it was the laughing stock of the internet for its constant interruptions and crashes? Well, eventually they had enough money to hire someone who was familiar with the latest CS research, and could actually make the thing keep up with their user base. That's not considering all of the further decades of effort put into all of the implemented infrastructure on which modern computers and networks run, into compilers, kernels, network stacks, security, etc. etc. And of course the computer software prerequisites to Twitter are just the tip of the iceberg, the whole thing built on that marvelous edifice of millennia of scientific and mathematical investigations.<p>I'm told Twitter is neat (I really have no interest in using it myself).... but it’s both utterly dependent on Science, and also not that scientifically interesting, as an idea. (Topics related to Twitter might be interesting; for instance, the social networks could be interesting for sociologists, the use by dissidents might be interesting for political scientists, the details of the network stack might be interesting to computer scientists, etc.)",1259751379

971837,comment,971785,971785,0,0,Maro,,,"""Some readers have discovered they can avoid paying subscription fees to newspaper websites by calling up their pages via Google.""<p>This is absurd on so many levels. People find the article with Google, but it's the newspaper who puts it up for free. Yes, there is a question here, but this article is confused. The question is simple: newspapers produce content, Google indexes it, how do they split the ad revenues? I would think that both parties are free to put up ads on their pages, and they do, but newspapers are trying to cut into Google's ad revenue. I'm sure they're also willing to chip in to help pay for Google's cost of maintaining their index, after all, it's driving traffic to them...<p>If we're talking about a subscription article, then Google shouldn't (can't?) index it anyways?",1259749887

As for me, these people have done nothing but watch my back. I purchased one way back in January and it still runs smooth as silk. I had all my cords and memory and whatnot from my previous and busted 360. and in my opinion, it ran better. When I went to buy another as a gift for a friend, the first thing that happened was they asked me if it was because the last one I bought was busted already. They gave me instructions that were not only beneficial but very kind. These people look out for their customers unlike the rest of of the customer services I dealt with. I for one have never once made a regret of buying this. But for those who just rush shop and not pay attention, then, yeah, let the buyer beware.",1259749608

Looking back, that was actually kinda stupid of me...<p>But we're not talking about time or opportunity cost, we're talking about hard expenditure right?<p>In that case, probably about $3000.  Got spent on a bunch of things - hosting, buying software licenses, SSL certs, icon sets etc etc.<p>My biggest expenditure was on hosting.  I went with a dedicated Rackspace server and I signed up way too early.  2 months into my contract I still hadn't launched and was, of course, paying a flat fee per month (not cheap!).  This is precisely the situation I could avoid by using cloud solutions, but at the time there wasn't a cloud service out there I was comfortable with using.
