It's an article about pulse shaping, which is used to, well, change the shape of an ultra-short pulse. Not generate it.<p>What you want to look for is mode-locking. Essentially it's based on interference. You have a lot of standing waves in a laser cavity and lock them so that they all have the same phase. Then they'll interfere destructively except at a regular interval where they add up to make a powerful but very short pulse.

Note that this only happens with local variables (rather than instance, class or global variables) according to David Black's <i>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</i>, page 153 (""Assignment syntax in condition bodies and tests"" - everything that follows, including emphasis is from the book):<p>Ruby doesn't draw as clear a line as compiled languages do between ""compile time"" and ""run time,"" but the interpreter does parse your code before running it, and certain decisions are made during that process. An important one is the recognition and allocation of local variables.<p>When the Ruby parser sees the sequence <i>identifier, equal-sign, value</i>, as in this expression<p><pre><code>    x = 1
</code></pre>
it allocates space for a local variable called <i>x</i>. The creation of the variable - not the assignment to it, but the internal creation of a variable - always takes place as a result of this kind of expression, <i>even if the code isn't executed</i>!<p>Consider this example:<p><pre><code>    if false
      x = 1
    end

    p x # Output: nil
    p y # Fatal error: y is unknown
</code></pre>
The assignment to x isn't executed, because it's wrapped in a failing conditional test. But the Ruby parser sees the sequence x = 1, from which it deduces that the program involves a local variable x. The parser doesn't care whether x is ever assigned a value. It's job is just to scour the code for local variables for which space needs to be allocated.<p>The result is that x inhabits a strange kind of variable limbo. It has been brought into being and initialized to nil.",1262026092

1019096,comment,1018851,1019048,0,0,pvg,,,"Depends what you are astonished by, I suppose. As far as I can tell the Ruby behaviour has to do with the fact that Ruby variable definition appears to take place sometime before evaluation, maybe during parsing. So as long as the statement parses and looks like a variable definition/assignment, you get your variable. On evaluation, undefined variables cause barfage but in the case above, the a got defined before the statement was actually executed.",1262025902

1019091,comment,1018639,1019006,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I agree with everything you say, except for ""Family Planning & Birth Control"". The last thing we want is government enforcement of birth rates; prosperity takes care of that without taking away anyone's freedom. Most prosperous nations have lower-than-replacement birth rates among the wealthy citizens, and that's actually going to become a serious problem unless we can make more poor people wealthy.<p>By 'wealth', I don't mean just money, I mean everything that goes into a better quality of life: Freedom, food, water, housing, education, and energy. In my opinion the first and last are the keys: people must be free to pursue activities which will improve their lot in life, and energy must be abundant and inexpensive to enable people to act on their freedom. With plentiful energy, food can be produced with minimal labor, water can be cleaned, materials for housing can be produced cheaply, and all of the above can raise people up from struggling for subsistance so that they have the time to devote to education.<p>Finally, in a world full of industrious, well-educated, and free people who have plenty of energy at their disposal, the problems caused by global warming can be tackled and solved whatever they may be. Dikes can be built, farms can be moved, even whole populations can be relocated.",1262025734

And wind resistance is still v^2 so it'll still go as v^2 only slower.<p>The brake limit is an interesting one, though. Apparently brakes are not providing a constant brake <i>torque</i> as one would naively expect, but instead a constant dissipation power. This is why everyone can lock their brakes going slowly, but it's normally quite hard to do if you're going 80mph. (For a normal ""family"" car.)",1262023218
