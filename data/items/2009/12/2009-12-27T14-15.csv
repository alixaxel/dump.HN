1017110,comment,1016946,1016946,0,0,j_baker,,,"Personally, I think the point of view is that hacker-friendly jobs are hard to find, and thus founding a startup is almost a necessary evil for a good deal of hackers.  I mean, let's face it:  starting your own company so you can do whatever you want is the <i>ultimate</i> hack.<p>Now, I'm not necessarily saying that I agree with this point of view.  But the point of this kind of social news site is that the readers get to choose what is and isn't relevant to them.<p>That said, I personally would like to see more hacker-oriented type stuff.  My advice:  submit more hacker-related content and vote it up when someone else submits it.  Remember that it usually just takes one vote to move things to the front page if you catch it early enough.  So your one vote can make all the difference.",1261925773
