Calling attention to the false dichotomy between pure TDD and test-last development especially spoke to me.<p>In the real world, everything is a shade of grey, and the same is true with software testing. Puritanical pursuit of theories and practices is silly. TDD is useful in some instances and not in others.

Backups are supposed to be a tool for mitigating damage — not a potential vulnerability to worry about!<p>Flexibility: Backups should be flexible and convenient. When you decide you want to create an archive, you should be able to store in it whatever files you want; if you decide that you want to delete an archive, you should be able to do it whenever you want, without impacting other archives; and there should be no arbitrary limits on how many archives you have stored, how often you can create new archives, or how long you can keep them for.<p>Efficiency: Backups should be efficient, using a minimal amount of storage and bandwidth. If you archive the same file twice, it should still only be uploaded and stored once; likewise, if you move, rename, copy, or make small changes to a file (e.g., adding a small amount of new data to the end of a log file or mail spool) you should never need to re-upload the entire file.<p>Utility: Backups should be provided as a utility, with linear (i.e., per-GB) pricing. Forcing people to figure out ahead of time how much data they want to back up so that they can sign up for the right ""plan"" is dumb, and having some customers subsidize other customers is inherently unfair.",1262101634

There's much more feedback; keystrokes make a nice subdued ""schlock"" noise. The backspace key sounds like the sound from Mario games where he does that spinning landing thing on a baddie.<p>* Easily swappable keys; my WASD are swapped for the purple arrow keys they come with, and my Esc key is a nice dangerous-looking red.<p>* LEDs are built into the keys they're for. Not a killer feature, but pretty slick.<p>* Flexibility; there are dip switches in the back for various tweaks such as swapping Ctrl and Caps Lock on a hardware level - they even provide keys to switch out so that the new Caps Lock key gets its LED.<p>For something I'll be typing on for many hours a day it's a worthy investment.",1262099081

The act of solving a problem gives me insight into the actual requirements, and the API results from that knowledge.<p>Another issue I have with unit testing is that the cases which, for me at least, identify the most bugs pre-production are more integration-ish.  Does the timeout setting for the HTTP API work as expected?  Does this transaction really roll-back against an Oracle DB with the ""thin"" driver on JBoss?  These are cases which are really hard to catch with traditional, use-the-UI testing, either manual or automated.  I should read more about what others are doing for these semi-integration cases.<p>A couple of years ago, I committed a test case called TestHowDatabasesWork because of a team argument about how Oracle handled concurrency and locking.  It got a good laugh, but it also documented a few behaviors specific to the problem at hand.",1262098869
