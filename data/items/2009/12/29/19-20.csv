Unfortunately a unified human government is not in the near future, but having one whole country, especially one as well connected as the United States, secure itself can cut into the power of botnets or viruses. The US can also set an example, for other countries to adopt. (This is all assuming that distributing anti-viral software by the gov't can keep up with self-propagating viruses).<p>2) My point is that such a structure can be created for my proposal too. Simply letting the government contract out to multiple private corporations, or providing subsidies for antiviral software, is one way to prevent ""big brother"" from controlling computers.",1262116792

And Medicare provides a different set of services.<p>It would be as if the government mandated that 1) instead of  buying meals, you had to buy the right to eat at a restaurant--but the restaurant could not charge different people different amounts based on how hungry they were or what they liked to eat, and 2) companies could buy food for employees at a tax-advantaged rate.

1021070,comment,1020130,1020231,0,0,kscaldef,,,"> The question becomes, though, why are A and B suddenly interlinked? Why was this context not already in place?<p>Here's an example, roughly taken from a project I did not too long ago (in an imperative language, not a functional language). Suppose you have an e-commerce system. One day, the business decides to start giving out coupons, say for 10% off.  Any order can have a 10% off coupon applied to it. All is fine and good, orders now have an optional coupon attribute, you compute order totals in an obvious way, coupons are nicely orthogonal to the rest of the system.<p>Then some time later, we decide to add free shipping coupons. But, there's a wrinkle: they only apply to ground shipping. Now, you can only add a free shipping coupon to an order with ground shipping; and, also, if the user changes their shipping method, you have to go look to see if they have a discount which now must be removed from the order. Now, two previously independent aspects of order placement and processing are coupled together.<p>Because this was written in an imperative language and backed with a stateful database store, it was mostly trivial to make the changes required. This scenario is not actually as bad as the situation the OP described, but my feeling is that it would be more difficult to have dealt with in a pure functional environment.<p>(BTW, this is actually a fairly mild example of the sort of complicated, non-orthogonal rules which come up in e-commerce systems. I picked it not because it was the hardest to translate to a functional paradigm, but because it was easy to explain in a couple paragraphs.)",1262114580
