702566,comment,702086,702476,0,0,wooby,,,"Hi, I've been there, and seen more than one up close.<p>You're right - there are a number of triggering methods in use, to include IR, GPRS/""family band"" radio, and cell.  More sophisticated devices use a combination, like cell arming and IR/pressure plate/trip cord detonation.  Simple command-wire detonation begat command-wire with a stand-off cell phone arming unit.  This was so we couldn't follow wires to the bomber.  For a time fake command wires were set up and boobytrapped.  When we stopped following wires, they'd do it again.  Or use something really simple like a washing machine timer for a regularly scheduled convoy.<p>In Afghanistan (at least 5 years ago), ""long range cordless"" was a popular option in remote areas without cell grids.  These are Chinese-made cordless phones operating in the 20-40mhz frequencies with ranges of 10 miles or more.  These are also popular in areas of Iraq without cell infrastructure.<p>It is a cat and mouse game of trigger mechanisms versus detection/deterrent.  New detonation methods would show up all the time, with various techniques being popular in different regions at any given time (in both Iraq and Afghanistan).  New methods are analyzed, equipment is designed to counter, companies bid on devices, and the countermeasures are pushed into the warzone as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, in my experience, these devices are always behind the curve.<p>It wouldn't be a good idea for me to go into detail about what these detection and deterrence methods do specifically.  Sufficed to say I browsed this article's responses and didn't run into any suggestions or techniques that I hadn't personally used or seen implemented.<p>There's a wide variety of communications equipment insurgents have access to, because there aren't Iraqi or Afghan equivalents of the FCC.  There is access to consumer radios and devices of all frequencies and outputs in these countries.  The entire spectrum is game.  I don't think there's a magic deterrent or detection method here.<p>Our best bet was always to schedule movements and map routes as erratically and randomly as possible.  If we could, we would mix vehicle movements with foot and air movement.  Keeping a good relationship with locals and randomizing movement as much as possible proved much more valuable than using the hottest new gizmo.  Pulling over and buying a soda from a street vendor and chatting with the local police generally yielded better information about the road ahead than sitting sealed in an armored vehicle staring at computer displays.",1247521752

But, I'll post it here anyway because it relates a scenario that a founder needs to be concerned about when taking on a competitor with more resources than they have.<p>Beware of opening yourself up to any kind of legal attack. Many well funded companies will sue a competitor they know has limited resources just to force them out of business.  They view the legal expenses that they incur from such an attack as a cost of doing business.<p>Many years ago (~15) I had a friend who had started a successful start-up in SFBA that provided specialized HA clustering software for large *nix machines.  The start-ups funding rounds totaled ~$12MM IIRC, and the company had about ~50 employees, was cash positive, and growing quickly.  After a couple years of nice growth, the company reached a size that caused it to be noticed by one of the large players in the HA space.  The large player knew that the start-up, even with a multimillion dollar annual cash flow, did not have the resources to fend off a significant legal attack.  They also knew that one of the start-ups' employees (not a key employee in product development or a founder) had worked as a software engineer on their HA product offerings before resigning to join the start-up.  They sued.  They claimed that the employee had walked out of their shop with IP that was used in the start-ups' products.<p>My friend flat out denied this, and I believe him.  But, there was no way for him to prove it. The start-up did the only thing that they could - have their corporate council counter sue and fight back as much as was possible.  After a few months in court and seeing the burn rate associated with such a legal battle, the founders realized that they were pretty much done.  They didn't have the money to win, even if they were in the right.  They laid off most of their staff and directed all of their remaining resources into the legal fight.  They found it impossible to get new funding or customers because of the IP dispute. Then, they started to lose existing customers because of the dispute and the doubt those customers had about their ability to survive it.  After all the cash on hand was burned through with legal costs, the company closed up and shut down completely.<p>The moral I got from the story is to be very careful about IP.  VC's and Angels (and usually founders) are very good about doing due diligence on IP that is used to start the company.  But, you have to maintain vigilance in regard to having clean IP and avoiding any liabilities.",1247521166
