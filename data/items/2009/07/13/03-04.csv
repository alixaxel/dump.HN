It's mainly aimed at distributing copies for testing or reviewing before an app hits the app store, and I think there's a limit to how many copies you can distribute this way (100 different devices? Don't remember 100%, I'd have to look it up).<p>You can also physically install the app yourself from your development machine if you get their device (again, there might be a limit on the number of devices, since you have to register each one).<p>As rdouble mentioned, there's also the enterprise program.<p>And, of course, there are jailbroken devices with third party app ""stores"".

To wit, on the subject of Microsoft stores:<p><pre><code>  Why even do it, then?  Why have these stores? \n\n  Propaganda.\n\n  Phil Schiller of Apple made the point back in January\n  when he explained that Apple stores had 400,000 visitors\n  per day or the equivalent of 20 Macworld shows EVERY DAY.\n  Microsoft wants the same thing.  They want to bypass the\n  press machine that they feel has tainted users against\n  Windows Vista, making sure the same thing doesn’t happen\n  to Windows 7.\n\n  If Microsoft can achieve that one goal – just that one –\n  then the Microsoft stores will have been worth doing even\n  if they never have a dollar of retail sales.\n</code></pre>\nVista failed partially because of poor development (and all the other usual reasons proclaimed a thousandfold), but also because Microsoft lost control of its perception to bloggers. The pundits were able to set the perception of the software, and they said it was crap. I'm not arguing that it wasn't crap, I'm just saying it was <i>perceived</i> as crap from the get-go by people who'd never tried it.<p>Not so with Windows 7. After reading Cringely's article I became attuned to signs that Microsoft might be tweaking the perception of the OS through its gloved hands. Not by ghosting outright shills (this failed notoriously with Vista), but through more subtler means.<p>Like what? Like the perception that the Windows 7 experience on netbooks will be similar to the desktop experience. Although this has never been proclaimed outright (Microsoft said Windows 7 'will be designed to work with' netbooks), the murmur from the great unwashed that I'm getting is that Windows 7 will be the snappy because they've 'sunk the bloat' and made it work on netbooks.<p>Well hang on a moment and let's see. The only thing of which I'm convinced is that Microsoft has done a <i>far</i> better job of managing the perception of Windows 7 this time around, and I expect to see more of these types of articles ('Microsoft has finally become insanely OK again!') leading up to the release of Windows 7. (Please note these are merely my observations and I'm not implying 'mini-microsoft' is a shill, see your doctor if pain persists).",1247457174

Why can't the OS just do all of this for us? Linux and the BSDs have package managers, but there's a solution just as easy for the rest/majority:<p>Both Microsoft Update and Apple Software Update could be modified, very simply, to read updates for additional software from signed RSS feeds, and queue them into a background downloading service (on Windows it's called BITS, I'm sure OSX has an equivalent) when they see them. There would need be no central repository; each software package installed would simply install a subscription, and a public key for checking against it. The updates would all be installed in the operating system's ""update mode"" that starts after shutdown, negating any worry of updating a running program. It wouldn't even need to trouble the download centers themselves—the RSS subscriptions could be torrent containers, and every PC could be configured to serve as a peer.<p>Now, if it were <i>me</i>, I'd move the Mobile App Store from iTunes to Software Update on OSX and make it into a Multi-platform App Store, and create a similar store for Windows in their own update service... but that's perhaps, as they say on the Internets, ""too much win.""",1247456447

A month ago I started a routine of doing a few math problems each day, and reading a Japanese article every day that contains at least 10 new kanji characters. I'm testing the tip I heard somewhere that instead of doing huge chunks and then forget about your goals for a while, it's better to do a bit every day. At least it feels nice, as if I'm traveling on a road that will lead to a nice place. Looking forward to reading books and playing games in Japanese, if not earlier then at least during my retirement days =)",1247454688

You can download unencombered content from third-parties (like feedbooks.com) just as easily as from Amazon itself; in fact the unencumbered content is arguably more convenient since it can be backed up to your PC and read elsewhere. For public-domain (classics) or friendly-licensed books it's awesome.<p>Plus this would work in any country (just pop in a SIM card) rather than being limited to North America due to the Kindle's unfortunate use of CDMA. If my Kindle had been this much cheaper and worked like this instead of tying in with Amazon's store, I'd be thrilled.",1247454476
