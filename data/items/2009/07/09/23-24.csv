Californians embrace it, which probably results from the selection bias of having a state where the largest population centers are all <i>centered on an active fault-line</i>.  Texans do their best to avoid it.<p>When times are good, people who take risks flourish, because most risks turn out well.  But when times are bad, they get hurt much worse than people who play it safe.  That's almost by definition: ""good times"" are those when most risks pan out, while ""bad times"" are those when most risks fail miserably.  It's not surprising that California is doing worse than Texas now - they took on far more risk during the boom years.<p>People have short memories.  I remember that at the first Startup School, one venture capitalist summed up the history of business in four words: ""Boom.  Bust.  Boom.  Bust.""  I think that was probably the truest thing said at the whole event.",1247183991

696866,story,,,3,3,DanielBMarkham,"Ask HN: SEO Question -- What's up with Google?",,"I have a question I think others might be interested in -- anybody who is self-promoting their websites.<p>I've been developing a few microsites. The idea is to put together 5 or 10 pages on small topics to provide as much help to the reader as possible on that topic. You find a small topic, promote the site over many months, and slowly make a little bit of money.<p>So I have this site, NeuropathyInFeet.us It took about a week for my wife and I to make. I asked some friends to promote it on their blogs, but as far as I know none of them have linked to the site yet.<p>After I submitted the site to Google I started getting hits. One of the pages, TreatingNeuropathyInFeet.html, started getting a few hits per day, growing to about 30-40 earlier this week. Looks like it was a long tail combination of keywords that didn't have a lot of competition. When I checked Google results, I found this combination of terms ranked me in the top 4 results or so. Very cool, right? The plan was already starting to work. Yay!<p>But when Tuesday rolled around -- nothing. No traffic at all. So I check Google rankings, and guess what? I'm gone. Or at least I'm not in the first dozen pages or so.<p>Hey if I did something wrong I want to fix it and not do it again, but heck if I can figure out what I did. So how do I go about contacting Google and figuring out what happened to my site? I mean I run a clean business. I have no desire to scam or cheat anybody out of anything. I only want to provide good content in return for traffic.<p>Is you have a site that is getting traffic and suddenly it stops, what do you do to figure out what happened? Is there some kind of test you run? Some email contacts or forms to complete with the search providers? I can understand if some new site came along and knocked us off the first page or something, but damn, we're just _gone_. That smells like something we screwed up on our end.<p>Is it possible that a competitor could have submitted my site to some kind of spam engine that would then make Google kill the site? If so, what the f*ck kind of recourse does a person have in that case? That's pretty dirty pool.<p>I know a lot of HN'ers have their own sites that they promote, and I know this problem is vexing me, so hopefully this applies to more folks than just me and some of you out there can help figure out what went wrong.",1247183673

A lot of people simply don't want to get out their wallet and go through the sign up process, so they won't.<p>A lot of their news is available everywhere else.  Why would I need the NYT.com website to read about Obama winning when MSNBC.com had it for free?  So the question should be ""Are our op-ed's and in depth reporting worth $5/mo?""  And if the in depth reporting is big (e.g. CIA eavesdropping scandal) it will be covered elsewhere shortly after it breaks.<p>So the number of page views they lose to $5 kills their advertising dollars.

You can drive a Mack truck through that over-generalization.<p><i>Some</i> kind of collective enforcement of property rights and contract law might be required, but that's so far from a modern state it's not funny.<p>It's one thing for a European to shake down some rubes who didn't know enough be cautious and weren't part of his peer group. But we have lots of examples of property and contracts being respected where very, very little government exists. Venice merchants and the silk road, the western United States during the period between 1776 and 1787, Roman traders operating deep inside ""primitive"" lands, modern mafia bosses and their business deals, Ebay shoppers and reputation-supported transactions. I can go on -- at length.<p>There's such a little need for government that social mores seem to do just fine in most cases. If there is some role for government at all (and I think there is), it's nowhere near the intrusive monstrosity we have today. Just because the door is open a crack doesn't mean that a herd of elephants can run through. I think that anarcho-capitalism won't work, don't get me wrong. But the degree of community control required for business to flourish is very, very minimal.

696850,comment,696263,696570,0,0,philwelch,,,"Depending on the rate of globalization and how sustainable our use of natural resources are by then, we may indeed be facing a population decline by the time life extension comes out. This seems incredible, but rich countries have much lower birthrates than poor countries. So if globalization turns poor countries into rich countries, it will solve the overpopulation problem and move the world below replacement rate.<p>The economic benefit to life extension is that you can work longer. If life extension works the way we think it will (by reducing the aging process), then it will also extend physical youth, giving us more productive years without the loss of productivity over time that comes with age (but <i>with</i> the gain in productivity over time that comes with experience and wisdom!)<p>Finally, it won't mean immortality, because it'll only fix <i>old age</i>. People will still die from suicide, homicide, and accident. Since there is a non-zero probability of these things happening to someone, the life expectancy will be more of an expected value than an expiration date, with some people dying at 1, some at 100, and some at 1000. It'll still be possible for people to have kids.<p>This will probably lead people to adopt an extremely risk-averse culture, and things like casual sex and automobiles will be the first to go. (The risk of dying in childbirth may be high enough to reduce birth rate in such a culture.) That, combined with a slower rate of generational replacement, will cause a very conservative culture in total.",1247182681

696848,comment,696652,696693,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"This is exactly the reason, as a general rule of thumb, why I don't like end-user software packages that are designed to be cross-platform. While I find Firefox 3.5 on OS X to be way faster than Firefox 3.0, it still doesn't hold a candle to Safari. It may as well be written in Java. For something as fundamental as a web browser, which I'm using all day long, it can't take 30 seconds to open a new window, freeze up and start thrashing halfway through rendering a page, or crash twice a day. (All of which Firefox 3.0 did, and which made me decide to move to Safari.) On top of the performance, the fact that Firefox uses a fake skinned XUL look-alike interface on each platform is the straw that breaks the camel's back, at least for me.<p>Port the renderer cross-platform, and write separate native apps for each target platform. The amount of complication and cruft that must be in the codebase for making a massively complex software package like Firefox work cross-platform, and the amount of basic OS-level functionality that must have to be reimplemented from scratch because it isn't available on some particular target platform, is probably no small contributor to its performance woes.",1247182651

But the fake interview was spot on in some points. There's just way too damn much stuff in it for one language, and on many projects, some of its features are used when they were completely unnecessary, only adding complexity and tangled mess.  It takes a lot of time and effort to master all of its features, and in many cases is bad for productivity.  Also, it is a nightmare reading through a large codebase, unless the project is very well designed and heavily commented.",1247180735

Half the time they're not even colour. It would take specialised equipment. I was thinking more like thieves going to some rich person's house, finding a computer screen near a window, attaching a high-res camera and waiting for them to log on to internet banking, or something. Sure, in that situation, very bad risk. But geeze, if you're sitting in the Chinese embassy and logging on to the CIA web site using your fingers on a keyboard, tiny coloured graphs of your password hash are the least of your problems.<p>It is an interesting idea though. I don't like how much information is in the graph, but if it was reduced to just, say, a block of 16-bit colour, that might still be a useful hint to users. Probably more useful actually; the detailed graph is just confusing. And I don't think even tptacek would claim 16 bits of colour is much of a hint brute-forcing a 256 bit hash.<p>Taking that idea and running with it a little - you could even ""salt"" the colour randomly for each user, feeding the salt value into the JS. In fact, implementing a per-user salt for the system as proposed would eliminate all of tptacek's concerns. It wouldn't be the same across sites, but it would be consistent per site. I might suggest this as an improvement.<p>update: duh, the system wouldn't know which salt to load before the user logged in .. forget that idea. Unless it was stored in a cookie of course. Or could be loaded via AJAX when focus shifted out of the username field.",1247180611
