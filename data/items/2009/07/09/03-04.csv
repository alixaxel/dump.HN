When I was doing scientific programming I would have killed for unicode source support. There isn’t always an obvious way to transform a math variable into ASCII. Consider,β for example, which can mean “the ratio of the thermal energy density to the magnetic energy density of a plasma”. In conversation people generally pronounce that as just “beta”. You could spell “beta” out in code, of course, but what if you have a β sub σ and a β sub s to juggle? And what if you have a prime or a superscript on those variables too?<p>The hairier equations can juggle several similar variables and carry on for several lines of code. It isn’t always obvious how to break them apart into smaller functions like you would in a normal application. Using income literals instead of spelling variables out can save a lot of space.

Eventually I got down to the weight I wanted (normal weight for my height) and was running 5 miles a day. I couldn't take the diet any more. I'm a fellow with tremendous willpower. But it was the strangest thing -- I couldn't force myself to stay on an <i>easy</i> 2100 calorie a day diet even though that was what I thought about every day, nearly every moment of the day. Even though I had managed 900 a day for more than a year.<p>Anyway, while running 5 miles a day still, I immediately began gaining 15 pounds a month. Eventually I couldn't run anymore.<p>I'm sorry, but the argument from thermodynamics is as bankrupt at explaining fat gain as it is in explaining height gain for adolescents. For height gain, the fact that energy in equals energy out is a true statement, but the explanation is growth hormone. If you calorie limit a growing child, the child will be somewhat (not very though) stunted, but will make up the energy difference through lethargy and by consuming all sorts of internal tissues.<p>For obesity, the explanation is insulin. I cut carbohydrates almost completely from my diet in January. Otherwise I ate what I wanted when I wanted (I measure my consumption in pounds of red meat per day). I'm amazingly healthier. I've lost 50 pounds. I've gained so much muscle that I can do pull-ups. Fucking pull-ups at my weight. With low-calorie dieting, I couldn't do pull-ups until I had lost another 70 pounds past that point. I'm putting on muscle and losing fat, and I'm eating huge quantities at every meal. Plus I have a desk job and barely exercise.<p>The argument from thermodynamics assumes that the fat tissue is a trash can and that weight homeostasis doesn't exist. It's a bankrupt theory that can't explain diseases like progressive lipodystrophy (a disease which makes people obese and emaciated at the same time). It can't explain why people who starve the calories off are not the same at the end as normal thin people and almost inevitably gain the pounds back. It can't explain why 1950s treatment to get anorexics to gain weight was through injecting them with insulin and not feeding them any more than they had been (during treatment).<p>In summary, you're seeking a psychological explanation of a physiological problem. Kind of like the discredited quack Sigmund Freud often did, eh? A physiological explanation might lead to the suggestion that we eat the way we evolved to eat -- no refined carbohydrate.",1247109439

For many people, programs like web browsers and iTunes are now opened frequently, whereas a decade ago those apps either didn't exist or weren't nearly as relevant.  So who is to say that 2 decades of Windows software adds up to much these days?<p>Then there's the fact that many desktop apps were not written to coexist, so a legacy on Windows means something much different than on, say, Unix.  Unlike Unix, where very old programs are still part of the ecosystem of utilities, Windows apps are just too random and fleeting.<p>Then there's the fact that desktop programs have grown and grown, and most users don't seem to adopt even a fraction of the features.  What took two decades to <i>develop</i> will <i>not</i> take two decades to ""replace"", because only a fraction of the features will really be required for most people to make the jump.<p>And most of those huge apps should have been stopped at version 2.0.  After awhile, big version numbers are meaningless; even for Apple, what on Earth makes the latest iTunes worthy of a version <i>8</i>?  They're still over-hyping the software, but not much is being added, so these old apps are not really as sophisticated as they appear to be.",1247108407
