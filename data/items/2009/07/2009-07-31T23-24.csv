Even as a staunch java supporter, I wouldn't try to argue Java is in and of itself as good as C#.  I'm more interested in how the 2nd generation JVM languages (Scala, Groovy, etc) compare with C# or the other options on .NET, and on the pros and cons of the whole platform and ecosystem.<p>For my money, no matter how good C# is, I'm not willing to be tied to an environment where the only full, modern implementation is tied to a single platform.",1249084746

Gold as <i>currency</i> is just as susceptible to instability as anything else, as a simple thought experiment can show.<p>Consider that the supply of gold, though growing, grows extremely slowly. The supply of goods and services which are exchanged in economic transactions (and for which currency acts as a proxy), however, goes through great spurts of growth which the supply of gold cannot hope to match. Thus, a gold standard during such a spurt can only lead to widespread deflation (as would any currency which failed to keep pace with the quantity of goods and services it must stand in for).<p>I really don't know why people harbor this mystical belief that a shiny piece of metal is somehow immune to well-understood economic principles.",1249083338

Even better than saying ""measure"" would be to say ""estimate of rank order,"" but indeed it has been well known for a long time that IQ tests have their greatest error of estimation at the high end of the IQ scale. Lewis Terman, the developer of the first widely used school IQ test in the United States, the Stanford-Binet, noted that error of estimation in IQ scores increases as IQ scores are above the mean.<p>""The reader should not lose sight of the fact that a test with even a high reliability yields scores which have an appreciable probable error. The probable error in terms of mental age is of course larger with older than with young children because of the increasing spread of mental age as we go from younger to older groups. For this reason it has been customary to express the P.E. [probable error] of a Binet score in terms of I.Q., since the spread of Binet I.Q.'s is fairly constant from age to age. However, when our correlation arrays [between Form L and Form M] were plotted for separate age groups they were all discovered to be distinctly fan-shaped. Figure 3 is typical of the arrays at every age level.<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/Terman%201937%20Figure%203.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/Terman%201937%20Figure%203.gif</a><p>""From Figure 3 it becomes clear that the probable error of an I.Q. score is not a constant amount, but a variable which increases as I.Q. increases. It has frequently been noted in the literature that gifted subjects show greater I.Q. fluctuation than do clinical cases with low I.Q.'s . . . . we now see that this trend is inherent in the I.Q. technique itself, and might have been predicted on logical grounds.""

I have found that certain topics online tend to attract bright people.  If you are genuinely interested in the topic and are there for that reason, it is one of the better means to find folks you have a good shot at hitting it off with socially.

""How can they not know how botnets work""--everyone knows that botnets ""work"" by collecting hundreds or thousands of other people's computers and controlling them remotely to do your 3V1L bidding. We also know that the human brain works by moving electrical impulses through neurons, but that doesn't help you predict what somebody is thinking. This simulated bodnet basically means they have a botnet in a bottle, and a big one at that. That should allow them to look into interactions among computers as the botnet does stuff and allow them to test possible countermeasures at will. As for ""when in doubt use brute force"", brute force would have been buying 1,000,000 Dells and stacking them in a warehouse.<p>Re: grinich
