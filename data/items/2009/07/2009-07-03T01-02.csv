685512,comment,685441,685441,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"It strikes me that environmentalists should want to tax land improvements and/or the procurement of physical goods.  Imagine if a new toaster cost $100 after taxes but the toaster repairman only charged $30/hour because he was able to keep 100% of his earnings.  Today, if you can buy a new toaster for $60 and toaster repair costs $50/hour, you're a lot more likely to buy a new one and put the old one out on the curb for the trash man.  Would people buy houses so large if property tax rates were twice what they are today?<p>The problem with radical changes to taxation schemes is that they have to be made slowly to avoid chaos.  Ignore for a moment the last ten years of US housing history.  If property taxes doubled tomorrow, the prices of houses would drop by some percentage as the marginal cost of a bigger house increased.  And, we now know what happens when housing prices drop :)  Slow changes could allow for gradual adjustment.",1246586373

685509,comment,685441,685492,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"All costs are transferable. So, whether you rent or own, you will pay property tax -- just like today.  In my hometown, one prominent landlord sent out letters to his tenants telling them that, if an upcoming school levy passed, their rents would be raised.  The same transfer goes for commercial property as well.  If the ""single tax"" was levied, one conceivably could compute the portion of the cost of a gallon of milk attributable to the cumulative taxation through the supply chain.<p>My issue with property taxes is that the government gets into the estimation business. I'd prefer a sales tax because it seems less likely to distort market behaviors and is less susceptible to political manipulation.",1246586026

The processor dies are huge and costly, and throwing out non-perfect dies is undesirable.  Due to the intricacies of silicon manufacturing, the same design can have different maximum speeds on different dies, and due to defects, the same design can have different operational sections on different dies.  This leads to speed grading and the disabling of cores/caches, and hence a whole line of chips from one design.",1246584645

685477,comment,684718,685341,0,0,makecheck,,,"One thing that I consider fundamentally broken is throw-lists: if a C++ function <i>ever</i> throws an exception that is not in its throw-list, the program <i>terminates</i>.  (The only way to avoid this is to omit the throw-list entirely, so I always omit it.)<p>There are of course a few things wrong with this design.<p>One is that <i>even deeply nested exceptions</i> count; so if you've vetted your code and listed every exception that <i>you</i> throw, you're still screwed if you call a function that eventually throws something else.<p>This of course leads to the next problem: code evolves.  Suppose you did somehow review all possible code that your function will touch, and wrote an accurate throw-list.  Then next week, Jim goes into one of those buried routines and makes it throw something new; boom, you are once again at risk of terminating.<p>Yet another problem: suppose the messed-up throw list is in a library.  Not only does this mean a library is responsible for exiting your program at a completely inappropriate point, but it might be a library that you can't easily change.  So you're forced to declare implementation-specific exceptions that have no meaning to your callers.  (Or just don't declare, as I do.)<p>The real issue of course is that terminating is a stupid behavior, <i>even though</i> they define terminate() to give you a point of interception.  There are all kinds of reasons why you might accidentally mess up a throw-list, and since all you really gain for ""fixing"" this is a little code purity, it hardly seems worth dealing with severe runtime errors.",1246583852

It's purely for business reasons. This limitation seems artificial, but it's no different from any other software product that comes in multiple editions:<p>A software company (e.g. Adobe, IBM, Oracle, Apple, Microsoft) develops a software product; when the product is ready to ship, they call it ""[Product Name] Professional Edition"". Then the company cripples the product a bit (sometimes by deleting a few lines of code that enable important functionality) and calls that version ""Standard Edition"". Then they cripple it even more and call that version ""Starter Edition"".<p>All they are doing is manipulating bits to give people an incentive to pay top dollar, just as Microsoft did. Giving everyone the full functionality wouldn't cost them any more, since it's all just extra bits, which cost the company $0 to copy (actually, they need to spend millions of dollars building, testing and maintaining these crippled editions, so they would actually save on costs if they didn't cripple the software).
