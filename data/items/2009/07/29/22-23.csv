OK, he has a cool software company, but for a guy who wanted to revolutionize Physics, that's a meager accomplishment.<p>I can think of tens of Caltech alumni who accomplished much more than Wolfram, but who are less inclined to publicize themselves. Some examples:<p>- Arnold Beckman: invented the pH meter, founded Beckman Instruments, and funded tons of great research. Has two buildings at Caltech named after him.<p>- Linus Pauling: revolutionized Chemistry, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Won 2 Nobel prizes.<p>- Charles Townes: invented the maser, won the Nobel prize.<p>- Bill Shockley: co-invented the transistor, won the Nobel prize.<p>- Donald Knuth: invented TeX, wrote TAOCP.<p>- Gordon Moore: founded Intel, started the microprocessor revolution, changed the world.<p>- Irving Reed: made important contributions to the field of error-correcting codes.<p>- Carver Mead: revolutionized electronics, founded tons of companies. He's one of the greatest technologists of the last 50 years, and yet few people know of him.<p>- Bill Gross: started IdeaLab and founded tons of cool startups.<p>So.. what is it that Wolfram has achieved? His papers on Cellular Automata are cute, but not earth-shattering. ANKOS is a recreational book with more artistic value than scientific value. <i>Mathematica</i> is great, but we could do well without it as there are tons of other CAS'es out there. <i>Alpha</i> is still hype.

Accordingly, I do not want to pollute the libraries with GPL restrictions, and thus avoid all GPL and LGPL code (even the LGPL restricts how I can link against the code, requiring dynamic libraries, and how I distribute the code).<p>I don't consider this irrational; the paycheck that allows me to devote many many hours of my life to open source software comes entirely from software sales.<p>Consumers don't purchase ""services"" for desktop software, and the enterprise services I do provide are purchased by companies who ... sell software.",1248905873

People make that comparison alot, but it's really not valid.<p>A closer comparison is a scooter or moped type of device.  Those will fit through some doorways, but being gas-powered they are generally excluded from use or storage in most indoor areas.  Cost is comparable, although the scooter would win out on distance and top speed.  Most scooters are also too heavy for a single operator to pick up and move, and they also don't generally break down to fit easily in the trunk of a vehicle.<p>Segway's, even the non off-road models do quite well on dirt/trails, so that isn't an advantage for the bike.

Let's not get distracted by that.<p>The reason I like Google is that things they make are well done.  They don't have jingly-bobs popping up all over the place and lots of new ""features"" that actually make things worse.  Their stuff has generally started simple and good, and gotten better.  I don't find myself resenting using Google's stuff, cursing at the stupid bugs all the time.  Their products have lots of nice little touches, like the way Google search will evaluate a mathematical expression or look up the time in a given location, and it searches PDF and PPT files and renders them decently in HTML.  Google Groups now searches bulletin boards and discussion lists as well as Usenet groups.  Google Maps does a really nice job of finding bus routes in San Francisco.  It often just does what you want it to, without your having to ask, and without getting in the way.<p>When using most Microsoft products, I usually have the feeling that some ""manager"" has decided that there's no money in making things work nicely, but there is money in ""shipping it"".
