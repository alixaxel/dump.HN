I'm not really a cloud advocate but I do like the idea of having access to my data everywhere and not having to worry about my own personal server going down.  That's a killer feature for me.  So if you want to talk me into a home server and desktop apps you have to be able to do something impressive that a cloud soution can't.<p>I don't see that here.  Moreover, the tone of the ""pro"" part of this piece really turned me off.  I won't blame the company because I don't know who chose the tone but to me this was fear mongering to sell a product (and for the record the one seems to be emulating their website).  ""All these evil big companies shouldn't have control of your data so you should fear them and run your own server""<p>Well, I don't fear the power of one company's cloud.  If they abuse me I'll just move to another.  Beyond that I'm an IT manager so I know servers occasionally go down and at home I don't want to deal with that.<p>Again, I'm open to desktop apps and local servers.  But they have to use the power a local soultion provides to impress me.  This doesn't seem to do anything a cloud solution couldn't and that makes it a no-go for me.",1248839966
729415,comment,728286,729321,0,0,dejb,,,"OK. firstly I don't have any particular belief in EM-sensitivity. I am just as much a believer is science as you. What I objected to was the clear bias you demonstrated in your post. The readiness to declare the 'total failure of anyone to demonstrate ""sensitivity""' rather than to provide any references suggested an extreme partisanship on one side of the argument.<p>The link that you finally provided has some useful information. To me it reads that suggest mixed results but mostly favouring no effect. If I where a betting person I'd say maybe there is a 10% chance that the effect does exist in some form based on my reading of that information. Maybe your interpretation of the probabilities implied by the studies is different to mine. But it leads me to agree with the conclusions of the authors of the meta study that ""more research into this phenomenon is required"".",1248839950

729413,comment,727207,727720,0,0,rs,,,"I don't think it's ""having to know what to set it to up front"" - its more experimentation and seeing what has the best performance. Too big heap and poor code, you might end up having really, really long GC pauses. Too small heap and you'll be out of heap space.<p>I like it as there's only so much physical memory on a server, and there's only so much virtual memory a kernel can provide. Swapping is not a good idea if you're looking into performance, and hence limiting the heap size can turn out to be a good strategy to ensure that your application does perform within expected boundries.",1248839796

Many niches in our industry/industries tolerate frequent changes of employment well.  What is to say that instead of taking continuous employment at an annualized salary of X you tolerate working for an annualized salary of 2/3 X and spend a third of your life between jobs?  (Heck, after doing that for a while, wouldn't it be more appropriate to say that you spend two thirds of your life between periods of intense concentration on things which matter to you?)<p>Where is it written that the one acceptable business model for individuals is selling precisely 40 hours a week of your services to one company, with the contract to continue for many years at a time?

A site that was full of unique icons would be interesting.<p>Basically, I have no idea who would use the majority of those icons. Most look completely useless as a set, and that's the problem.

729393,comment,728075,728075,0,0,weirdwes,,,"This may be somewhat off topic, but it's also somewhat on topic. A former co-worker of mine recently posted a status update on Facebook claiming that her former boss ""was the devil"". The bosses name was not mentioned in the status update, but could be inferred by other co-workers, employees and etc.<p>Her former boss emailed her and sarcastically thanked her for the kind words, to which she replied ""you're welcome"". This, in effect, confirmed who she was speaking about - though it was not in a public forum for anyone else to read. He quickly threatened to file a lawsuit against her for slander, though I do not know if anything has come of it.<p>I'm no lawyer, but based on what I've read here and in some of the linked articles, he has no case. Obviously this is libel and not slander as it's written word and not spoken, so my assumption is the ""boss"" was just using scare tactics on here as had he gotten the advice of a lawyer, he would've known this. Not to mention, there is no way to prove that someone is or is not the devil, therefore the remark can't be used in case citing deformation of character, correct?<p>Just curious if anyone wanted to weigh in on this.<p>On topic: I'm curious to see if this lawsuit pans out. I'm honestly hoping it doesn't, but it will be interesting to see the outcome. Personally, I agree with most that the company should be trying to make their customers happy, not suing them over something like this.",1248838629

I don't remember exactly where I saw it but I'll update if I think of it.<p>The second issue is having LCD or LED flat panels without the border. It is technically possible. You cant just take the border off. Some sort of surrounding protection is needed or else you will end up with dead pixels all around which makes it look like an ugly border. The screen won't survive long either.<p>It's possible to wrap it up in plexi-glass or a similar material. I don''t know how you can avoid any refraction at the edges. Even the slightest oddity ruins the point of piecing screens together.<p>The real question is why do you want to do this? It will be much more expensive to piece together screens to make one large screen than it would be to buy the large screen. Big screens are pretty darn cheap now. I don't know how much room there is for the price to go any lower. It is still a manufacturing process that is based on preciseness - so there will be wasted units that add to the overall cost.<p>I'm not sure if that answers your questions or if you specific technical details.
