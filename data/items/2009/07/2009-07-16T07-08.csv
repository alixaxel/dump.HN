707516,comment,707321,707321,0,0,esonica,,,"There are some valid points in this article, but the overtones of someone whinging about a free product ""grinds my gears""<p>At some point did we come to expect perfection from a company that largely offers unprecedented services for free?<p>Take twitter as an example, its new and full of problems, no where near perfect. Yet all their issues are blindly written off as teething issues, even though we pay the same amount to use it as google.<p>Personally, I applaud googles efforts. There is a reason the tech savvy choose their products over others, because they are the best of the bunch, especially in the free arena.",1247731125

I myself have a 512kbps connection.<p>Since broadband penetration here is not very good, people who travel a lot and need to be online most of the time use mobile Internet, which is much slower and costs much much more.<p>So, what do you mean by ""today's Internet""?",1247730532

707507,comment,706343,707383,0,0,enneff,,,"Oh come on. I've been using laptops for 15 years, and all of the screens have been fine for programming work. (even the monochrome ones) The 6-bit display on my MacBook is clearer and crisper than the machine I had before that, and that machine was better than the one before it. Yes, it's not a patch on my twin Dell 2408WFP's (which are 8-bit), but so what?! It's not ""fuzzy and washed out"" by comparison - that's a ridiculously hyperbolic statement! No, I don't do colour-accurate work on my laptop, and nor would I expect to.<p>I do agree with the sentiment that it is disingenuous of Apple (and almost everyone else in the industry) not to list the bit depth of their displays, though.",1247730296

707499,comment,706842,706875,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Not so sure about that. It was rather obvious that the discussions about ""Silverlight only"" would overshadow the release of the video at least in all the technical circles. Offering the videos in more than one format - so people with Silverlight could have gotten advanced features while others still could have watched it would have been a lot better marketing.",1247729407

707497,comment,705618,705618,0,0,bravura,,,"""The reported accuracy is simply the cumulative total number of errors divided by the number of steps.""<p>Use a moving average.
I use:
   m <-- m - (2/t) (m - x_t)
when estimating the current training error.<p>1/t would be the exact historical average. 2/t gives more weight to recent events, which is good when your distribution is non-stationary (as is the case when your model is changing). With a constant learning rate (independent of t) you get an exponential moving average.",1247729262

707494,comment,707099,707479,0,0,Zak,,,"Not really. If I had a Pre and was using it with iTunes, Apple intentionally crippling it would make me less likely to consider Apple products in the future. Come to think of it, it's having that effect on me anyway, even though I'm not affected at all.<p>Apple is certainly within their rights to cripple their consumer applications in any way they want, but it does not make me think they're looking out for my best interests as a user.",1247728974
707493,comment,705976,705976,0,0,pg,,,"For Google, Twitter, and Facebook, the main reason is that there are fewer and more conservative investors in the UK.  Google and Facebook in particular seemed super risky at first, and were only able to raise money from angels, even in the Valley.<p>Microsoft is a different case.  They're a generation older, and didn't rely on investors.  They were in the US because the microcomputer revolution happened mainly in the US.  The reasons for that are complicated, including the fact that the British government interfered with (in both the British and American senses) the British computer industry, and that getting rich was effectively banned in the UK at the time the startup was being invented in the US.",1247728913
