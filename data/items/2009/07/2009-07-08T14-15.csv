Nothing ad hoc here.

I think where it breaks down is that the browser itself is the choke point for any internet based strategy as it is the gateway to the web for 99.9% of the users out there.<p>To evolve the browser into something that is closer to the server would eliminate the roadblock of which you speak.  I don't think you need to create an OS to do that.  IE has a decided advantage for Microsoft as it comes pre-installed and is prominently showcased within the OS itself.  The fact that you have to download and then install either Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera presents a roadblock for users.  Switching operating systems is an even bigger roadblock.",1247064669

693971,comment,693786,693786,0,0,jeresig,,,"The BBC's Glow effort has always confused me. They were using jQuery on the main BBC web site a few years back and I ended up chatting with them about it. They mentioned that they were working on their own library since they needed support for Safari 1.3 (if you've ever had to support that browser version, it's miserable - I'm not even sure it could be described as 'functional'). This was a little bit odd since they hadn't actually submitted any tickets or patches requesting that Safari 1.3-related bugs be fixed.<p>Now, I should take a step back and mention that some people are just set to be framework authors. They see a problem and want to write their own framework that matches their mental model. This isn't a bad thing - I certainly did that when I wrote jQuery (decided not to use Prototype back in 2005 and wrote my own instead) and the BBC guys are of the same ilk. It's important to realize that the BBC's Glow effort is less about filling a specific void in the market and more about them wanting to write and run their own framework. In an organization as large as the BBC this scale does tend to make its own brand of sense.<p>If you look through the timeline for when changes were made to the level of browser support, v3.3 shows when support for Safari 1.3 was dropped to ""Level 2"" (a.k.a. ""The web page must be functional in a gracefully degraded state."") - this was in September of 2008 (long before the public release of the library, today).<p>Timeline: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml#history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browse...</a><p>If you look at the support table for which browsers they support (the important ones are Level 1) it's interesting to note that they actually support <i>less</i> browsers on less platforms than most other libraries. For example, jQuery supports Firefox 3.5 (on Windows, OSX, Linux), Chrome 2 (on Windows), Opera 10 (on Windows and OSX), and Safari 4 (on Windows and OSX) in addition to the browsers listed in Glow's Level 1.<p>Support Table: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml#support_table"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browse...</a><p>In the end I think some seriously short-sighted planning went into the creation of Glow. When I was talking with some of the guys at the BBC who were working on it (before they were using it internally) I asked them: ""Don't you think that you will have dropped support for Safari 1.3 before you end up finishing and releasing the library? Writing a framework isn't trivial, it's going to take a while and Safari 1.3 is already effectively dead."" (At the time Safari 1.3 had a 0% marketshare.)<p>And now, sure enough, here we have yet another JavaScript library that does similar, but not quite the same, things as every other library - with worse browser support, less uptake, less documentation, and more fracturing of the community.",1247064399

693958,comment,693071,693071,0,0,tokenadult,,,"My comment from another online that I have FAQified because the issue comes up from time to time:<p>I'm a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I'm a good bit older than most people who post on HN. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the ""long hot summer"" and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern ""white"" parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was ""Negroes""), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn't all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn't shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term ""affirmative action"" still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don't.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term ""Negro"" or ""Afro-American"" or ""black"" was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, ""What do you want to be called, 'black' or 'Afro-American'?"" His answer was, ""I'd rather be called Henry."" Henry's answer to my classmate's innocent question really got me thinking.<p>So to me, the astounding thing about today is that people still regard ""race"" categories at all. I agree that the trend line in the United States is for people to get along better in general, but we still have painfully far to go to get the categories out of our brains and meet new individuals as individuals.",1247064015
