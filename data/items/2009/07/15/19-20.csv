I am not yet sold on the idea that all shared state is evil (since I think there are problems that are easier to deal with when using shared memory)<p>There absolutely are problems that are easier to deal with using shared memory. Clojure takes a middle ground here, and recognizes that shared state is sometimes necessary, but is often overused, mainly because the language makes it easier to make something mutable than immutable.<p>Just as you mention about Erlang, ""With a process, you have to think about where you draw the 'error boundaries'"", in Clojure you can paraphrase that as 'With refs, you have to think about where you use shared state'.<p>To create a local, immutable variable, you would write<p><pre><code>    (let [x 42] ...)</code></pre>\nIf you wanted to make that mutable, it would be<p><pre><code>    (let [x (ref 42)]...)</code></pre>\nYou have to explicitly say the variable is mutable. This change in defaults alone goes a long way in making Clojure a more correct and loosely coupled language.",1247687957

With barriers to interstate insurance removed, the industry is also free to concentrate itself through M&A.<p>While that's happening, the adverse selection problem with health insurance continues to fester, as our ""free market"", in enabling ""the pursuit of happiness"" for everyone, especially 20-something bachelors, cons the whole consumer market into believing they can free-ride into their 40s (or their first child) and then get reasonable insurance, while draining the entire risk pool of all the low-risk patients.<p>Those same 20-something bachelors show up in emergency rooms, bankrupting themselves over broken bones --- but no problem, by the time they're old enough to care about their credit rating, the only people who will care about this health event are the hospitals and doctors, who will raise rates on everyone else to cover.<p>At the same time, nothing is done to address the fundamental problem that even in the most consumer-friendly venues, tens of thousands of totally normal families are unable to obtain private insurance coverage at any rate because of preexisting condition coverage.<p>I'm totally sold.",1247687905

And, we used MemCached to bridge the replication lag.  For better or worse, all writes auto-committed independently.  What strategies should Keyspace users employ to counteract similar replication delay issues?<p>I presume Keyspace would offer much better performance because it doesn't have to worry about 95% of the stuff a SQL db does. Drizzle seems like it falls somewhere in the middle of the solution in the above paragraph and Keyspace.  Is that a fair assessment?<p>One thing I wanted (among many) with our solution was the ability to specify async disk forcing (an oxymoron?).  I'm willing to allow a database to return control to me before writing if it thinks it will be able to write something to disk within N seconds.  The increase in performance for most non-transactional systems (meaning that a few seconds of data loss occurring once a year wouldn't hurt too badly) would more than make up for the risk.

Direct air in the racks rather than the room can also be more effective. Since in the evenings air is normally cooler, this can also be used effectively by adding more 'mass' in the room. Anyone thought of having these datacenters on mountains?",1247685648

And the problem I have is the blatant hypocrisy of Arrington et al in the handling of this story.<p>The first post he made about this attempted to make the case that this was standard operating procedure, and really isn't anything out of line with the way things are normally handled. If that's the case, then why write a story talking about the fact that you've been given stolen documents containing large amounts of previously secret information.  Then go on to say you won't post the personal information,  and you're only posting the parts you find newsworthy.<p>If it's so normal, wouldn't you just post the stories, and mention that your source was some leaked documents you'd been given?  You only do that if you feel you have something to justify, something to explain.  In otherwords, you think you might be wrong.<p>So instead of handling this like they would any other source, for any other article, they've justified the source <i>well</i> in advance of actually using it.  It's hypocritical and proves that all of this was just another stunt to drum up traffic.<p>Personally I'm done with TechCrunch.  I won't follow links there, if I end up there by mistake, I'm closing quickly.  I won't support this sort of blatant hypocrisy and grandstanding.  It's not professional.  It's not needed.",1247684639

He shows insecure code that no one should use (unvalidated input through Request[]) and then solves it with an extremely kludgey solution. Same with the redirect problem he states. If you validate that the redirect is valid before making it, that problem is solved. The point being, as always, validate all input. Adding layers of complexity as a security ""solution"" compared to simple validation is a pretty crazy idea and a lot of unneeded complexity.",1247684417
