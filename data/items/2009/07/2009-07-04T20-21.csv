Redrawing of European national boundaries along ethnic lines was offered as a justificiation for much of the aggression resulting in World War 2. Strangely, Europe seems not to have fallen into inter-ethnic confusion following the implementation of the Schengen agreement, which did not abolish Europe's internal borders but basically made them fully porous, such that Europeans can now live and work wherever they see fit.<p>As for your distress over the multi-cultural stew that is modern London, don't you think that just might have something to do with UK's past history of traveling the world, meeting exotic people, and conquering them?

In fact if anything, im suprised that he went so lightly on the 20% Peter-principle-bucket folks.<p>While I agree on the breakdown, my personal feeling is that the lame 20% is the reason why the other 60% exist. They allow it, and through incentivizing the wrong behavior grow it.
If they stamped it out (and they are the people in the position to do it) n% of the 60 will up their game (because it now becomes the strategy closely allied to their own self interests) and n% will leave, which I think is an ok result n the long run anyway..",1246739567
