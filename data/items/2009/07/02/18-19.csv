Yes, counterfeiters are being crooked, but they can not simply compete on merit because they don't have a branding and advertising machine available to them.<p>I'm not talking about the existing brand strength Apple has a result of their past efforts, but about the resources available with which to launch a product, which can eclipse the development costs. I would buy a phone from Obscuro Corp if the price was right and the physical quality felt good, I'm willing to take a risk on a new market entrant if it won't cost too much. But Obscuro Corp doesn't have the resources to tell me about their smartphone, get equal display space in retailers etc, so it's easier to surf on an existing brand instead.<p>I have a friend that used to sell handbags, both knockoffs and original designs (usually from the same manufacturer). The quality of the knockoffs was very very good, as was the quality of the originals, and of course the price for the latter was much lower. But his customers almost exclusively wanted the knockoffs - and although it went unspoken, they knew perfectly well that they weren't <i>real</i> Louis Vuitton or Coach handbags. People are generally not that stupid as to think you can get a real Rolex or LV purse for $50 from some guy on the street.<p>In cases like this, the desire to make a powerful social statement by carrying something which is superficially indistinguishable from the expensive brand is more important to the buyer than the actual value. Some buyers are victims of deception, to be sure. But a great many would rather pay $200 for a low-functioning fake iPhone than $150 for the exact same device minus the branding (even if it's good value at that price).<p>So if you have the equipment, skills and capital to make a 'miPhone' but nobody is interested because you're a nonentity, what other options do you have? I'm not endorsing the practice, but I do think it's an inevitable response to the power of the branding industry. This kind of thing happens in nature all the time, look at the angler fish.",1246560156

684896,comment,684251,684827,0,0,Keyframe,,,"Yes, you are absolutely right. The best way to have a low budget production is to find a film and drama school in a place where there is no union. You can get a crew for next to nothing. They get screen credits which matter more than you think, and you can provide food. You can rent a cheap digital camera like Red One with lenses for about 600 Euros per day, a set of HMI lights and electricity for another 1,000 or so - clothes and props... you can make a movie for 50,000 Euro if you want (typical shooting schedule is about 20-25 days).<p>However, that wont bring your movie nowhere. You can seek a distributor, which get tons of proposals and probably wont even look at your film (NDAs and lots of proposals mostly). Think of distributors as VC companies and each movie as a startup, because it is. Distributor has enough money to market the film.<p>Another option, which almost every indie production takes is festival run. Festivals are great because if you win an award, distributor hears about you, distributor might see you there with your movie and there are usually market palces associated with festivals where distributors and TV houses shop for movies and series (I work in animation and biggest is Annecy in France).<p>Some of you might think, why not go viral with the movie? Why not let it go on the internet, market it around reddit, digg, whatnot - it could be a festival like cycle, no? Well, no. You see, I would be the first one to do so, but if you want your flick to be eligible for any kind of festival award (from Annecy to Sundance to Oscars) it works in a funny kind of way. In order to make your flick run in a festival, requirements to do so usually mean that it had to already run on several festivals (Oscar eligibility for example) and almost always there is a strict rule that your film is not publicly available (online or distribution), which gives festivals a sort of premiere in their region.<p>Movie business is a strict business with a lot of rules and even more egos. Each and every movie is run exactly like a startup that operates on milestones and further funding.",1246559797

You build loyalty; rewarding it is a byproduct of building it.<p>Back in the early days of Starbucks in Chicago, regulars were recognized by the staff.  There'd be some chitchat.  Apparently, cost accounting was not yet so anal retentive, and a staff member would occasionally comp you your drink or something else.  If there was a dispute, ""the customer is always right"".<p>Regulars really seemed to respond to that.  Starbucks was not just about the coffee (or the mocha and sugar).  It was a daily social experience.<p>You might call the comping rewarding loyalty.  I'd call the social interaction and comping <i>building</i> loyalty.  It made Starbucks a place customers wanted to be.  Not just for the coffee; for the larger experience.<p>In a technical world, I think building loyalty has to do with offering a quality product and making product and knowledge acquisition as easy and streamlined as possible.

Don't make me solicit a friend in order to get a benefit.  If I truly value your site, I'm going to tell my friend about it, regardless.  What are you offering?  Do that as well as possible.  I'll keep coming back.  And make sure you understand what you are offering.  E.g. Are you just selling coffee?  Or are you giving your customers a daily social routine?<p>Another example:  Amazon, NewEgg, and some of the other, better online retailers.  Is it just the product, price, shipping?  Or is it also all the peer reviews and tips?  Also, for me Amazon means worrying less about my credit card information.  Their inclusion of third party sellers works well for me in this regard, in that I can order while having trust in the payment system.<p>In this case, I'd argue they are selling security (and convenience in ordering) as much as the product itself.<p>Free shipping is a nice perk (and I know shipping is just merged into the price, anyway).  But it's the previous things that keep my coming back to Amazon.<p>It's not about rewards; it's about the original product.  Really understanding what that is, and delivering it as well as possible.",1246559080
