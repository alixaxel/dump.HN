For example, a container class in the STL may require that the contained type be less-than comparable. Concepts would provide a way to express this restriction in a way that makes compiler error messages more understandable. As one would expect, a type may include a ""requirements list""   composed of orthogonal concepts (e.g. a class must be less-than comparable AND copyable). For more advanced uses, see the Wikipedia article or Bjarne's latest proposal.<p>Additionally, a number of proposed additions to the standard relied on concepts being included. These will need to be either reworked or dropped as well.",1248109181

By this I mean that your setup creates continual knowledge gaps and then fills them in the pairing session.  That seems much less valuable than actually distributing the knowledge throughout the team by pairing all of the time.<p>I recommend you keep an open mind about the other major benefits of pairing and that you actively seek good pairing opportunities.  It is worth it and you will know it when you experience good pairing.",1248109066

With obvious results. I'm not totally happy with the last 2 operations, another solution might be to GET /q/start or /q/end and DELETE the returned queue element URL. If the delete succeeds, do what you want with the data, otherwise assume that somebody got to it before you and attempt another GET-DELETE.<p>Neither method handles ""client never got the server's response"" very well, I'm not sure what a better solution would be.<p>Totally generic things like this are unusual, you can usually come up with a better set of resources and operations based on your problem domain.<p>REST is about the operations on the URLs; the URLs themselves should be totally opaque.<p>Without knowing anything about how the 3 urls you gave are used, what other operations are possible and how they interact with other resources it is impossible to say whether you're doing REST. The third one looks very suspicious, however (the second one too, though less so).",1248108957

(At least, most of the time this is why they exist.)<p>Functional programming is very much about decoupling ""pure functional"" computation and side-effects. Using pattern matching you can quite easily write a little machine that performs side-effects given different values. These things are simple and about as useful to unit-test as accessor methods are in oo code. Static typing checks do fine. Also, if it is broken, it tends to be severly broken and not lead to undetected or hard-to-find bugs but simply not work at all.<p>The interesting code to test is that which is given a bunch of parameters and returns a value that would instruct the side-effectful machine about what to do. This function can be tested with lots of inputs, and you check that it gives the correct instructions (without executing them).<p>This style of programming exists in OO as well.<p>Another reason to use Mocks is that they are queried for values that one need control over to rig the unit test. I.e. just a disguised parameters. FP simply doesnt do that.",1248108221

714648,comment,713339,713393,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I agree, our brain collects memories and filters a lot of the 'same of' into one category. We do, technically, remember nearly everything, but the memories are so similar they all end up running off the same neurones as a sort of space saving. Essentially once we've used a memory so many times it becomes a 'template' and instead of having 5,000 near-identical memories, we have 1 template and 5,000 name/place changes to it to save space. However, this process likely has a much grander function than we realise.<p>As we age, our life becomes increasingly routine. We all make beds, shower, cook, eat, do laundry, commute, work and sleep, they take up the majority of our days and will be repeated thousands of times. A child however likely only has shower, school, eat and sleep, their free time per day is probably near 8 hours, where as an adult likely has 1-2 hours of free time per average weekday.<p>If the majority of your day is taken up by a routine, it will quickly become compressed memories so the day may be long, but the year collapses into 2 hour increments of unique activity (supposing you don't spend them watching reruns on TV).<p>I remember first coming to Canada (I was born in the UK) and when driving on the highway I noticed a ""Wrong Way"" sign on the back of the signs on the opposite side of the road. Not only was it a unique sight to me, as in the UK no one would think to do that, but I found it highly ironic as Canada's neighbours (the US) drive on the same side of the road, but the UK whose neighbours all drive on the opposite side of the road doesn't have it. Now I've been in Canada for several years, I never notice the signs, and even though I'm going on a roadtrip later this week, I doubt I'll notice one of those 'wrong way' signs the entire trip.<p>However, personally I have witnessed my years getting relatively shorter, but since getting a job as a writer at 17 I've managed to fill a lot of my time with uniqueness. The act of writing largely disappears, but the memories surrounding it appear to be strongly attached to what I've written and I still haven't lost the memories of even my earliest writings.<p>I suppose I haven't found a way to extend my perceived lifespan, but I believe I stumbled my way into producing a strong 'lifeline' (if you will) that I've attached many lesser memories onto.",1248107761

714623,comment,714452,714452,0,0,il,,,"It would be interesting to see more data such as traffic(Alexa/quantcast?), number of employees/founders and so on.
This sounds rather silly, but if you collect enough data, you may be able to approximate something of a ""formula"" for startup success, or at least increasing your chance of success by a few percent.
I know PG always says it's the people and not the idea that matter, but looking at your spreadsheet, and assuming PG only picks equally smart people to fund, some ideas/verticals are clearly more likely to succeed than others.
I know there's obviously no statistically significant data to back this up, but my hunch is that, given the talents and abilities of founders chosen for YC are roughly equal, it may be the niche or market you choose to enter that can make or break your startup.<p>At the very least, a comprehensive list like this should give YC applicants a rough idea of what types of companies are likely to get accepted.",1248106982

2) Only allow specific IP's to connect to ssh.  If you are an admin on the road, use port knocking to open that ssh port up for a limited time from where you are at.<p>3) Last but not least, change the default port of SSH from 22 to something your company runs.  You can do this in /etc/services or in /etc/ssh/sshd_config<p>A lot of preventative maintenance helps you secure a system running an ssh daemon.
