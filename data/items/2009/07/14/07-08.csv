After all, regardless of GPL rhetoric, the BSD, Apache and MIT licenses are also very popular and someone who does a little digging can find exactly the license he is looking for.......unless he/she intentionally chose GPL!<p>Also, I dont believe anyone today is silly to believe that Microsoft or ""unknown large corporation"" will really steal their ruby/python/java code. Most big companies choose their libraries and tools very carefully and are more concerned about lawsuits as opposed to spending some developer time to re-write some library.",1247558355
703289,comment,702304,702304,0,0,yason,,,"It's universal that you can't both have and eat the cake. 99% of problems with GPL arise from the fact that companies and individuals want exactly that.<p>GPL is more indifferent to many real-world aspects than people assume it is.<p>It is an idealistic license and it only cares about the right to use the program and the availability of source code, to ensure free use and reuse of the program. This ideal is rather neutral towards any commercial and business aspects: it only conflicts with some of the established practices and beliefs of the current business world.<p>GPL does not intend to compete or lock-out other software while that may indeed happen if you're playing a different game and holding tightly on to contradicting views of what you think is important.<p>In reality, there are no other limitations in GPL than that effectively no single author or distributor can't enforce control over or killing the software.<p>For companies, there are two possible outcomes:<p>1) secrecy of the company source code is more valuable. Conclusion: there's no rational reason to even consider incorporating GPL code in the company. What's the problem?<p>2) benefits from reusing GPL'ed software is more valuable. Conclusion: GPL your stuff as well to gain the benefits and avoid any legal problems. What's the problem?<p>Otherwise the company is holding on to the belief that they can have and eat the cake, and effectively just wasting their own time.",1247558314

703286,comment,703086,703266,0,0,greendestiny,,,"In a perfect world where developers have chosen exactly the license they want then there is nothing really worth discussing. However I think a lot of times people put their software under the GPL because of its position in the open source world, and the rhetoric of the FSF.<p>There is a continuum from having your code used in a completely non-commercial project to being used by Microsoft in some terrible software. The FSF seems to be still in a mindset where software was controlled by these large companies who are the enemy. I think we've moved on, and I would like the community to reflect that a bit better.",1247557939

703280,comment,702795,702795,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"the main problem with linux is that it doesn't limit the users choices enough.  It's fine to keep all the choices available, but put them behind the scenes.  When someone boots up a linux distro for the first time they should see a browser, a word processor, email, a media player, and an IM client...some basic games too.  ubuntu netbook remix is the best example of this that i've seen.  Once you get this down, polish polish polish.  The average user doing average tasks should <i>never</i> see anything but a slick GUI.  If you sit any non computer savvy person down in front of it and they see anything else you have failed and you need to do more tweaking.<p>this is why apple can charge a huge premium on their products.  people sit down and it <i>goes</i>.",1247557537

703278,comment,702670,702670,0,0,pert,,,"I got burned about 10 years ago by 'samba' not doing what I thought I'd told it to.  I used the 'bind interfaces only' configuration directive, which I thought would prevent it from opening any ports on my Internet interface.  I was wrong.<p>Unfortunately I also had no idea about the concept of security patches and, to this day, I still have no idea how I should have gone about getting security updates for Slackware (I switched to Debian and never looked back).  The result was some script kiddie got root and started to use my box to start scanning for more vulnerable samba installations to break.<p>My response was to unplug all of the network cables and have a poke around to see what he'd been up to.  I took a full backup of the box and then re-installed it from scratch as I couldn't trust it.<p>I learned that you should always look at what ports you have open (`netstat -lpn` is my favourite command for this) and that there are some times when a firewall might be of use (I'm not a fan of firewalls on anything other than gateway boxes).",1247557516

If I invest time in it with my existing collection of snippets, what confidence can I have that it won't get zapped?<p>Anyone can edit is tough. There are situations where people think they know what you mean and go in and mess with things but miss the subtlety of a situation. Or where it comes down to matters of taste. With no commenting area, there isn't a mechanism for people to discuss this.<p>There should be a search mechanism that allows you - in a single command - to indicate the language your searching for and keywords. Better still if you can get to it via hotkey and if it sits at the top of every page. It should be possible to see and search just your own code submissions, and to make private submissions. I've got a page of stuff I keep handy which is where I track dumb cisco tricks and the like, and I'd love to have a place where I could move these.

It's either compelling enough code that you'll deal with the licensing, or it's not compelling enough and you'll have to roll your own.  It's basically just a non-monetary price point then, isn't it?<p>Am I missing something or is there some kind of assumption that people are entitled to other peoples work if they GPL it?<p>(Not saying that you make the assumption personally, but that you might be assuming that is what is stopping others)<p>I'm all thinking aloud / genuinely interested in what the issues are here.",1247556614

Except for 2 points:\n- In my lurkings on HN (for a few months now), I have seen that most folks here are pretty fair. Surely then they realize that choosing a license is the prerogative of the author. This is nothing to hate or get angry about.......just respect the writer of the code. There should be plenty of similar projects with more acceptable licenses if someone digs around. And if more people start using them, they will, in time be more popular than their GPL counterparts. After all, what is an open source project without a community?\n- Writing webapps (as a lot of projects on HN seem to do) does not require one to open source one's backend application.",1247556518

So better not to tell them that.<p>The best rates come from person-to-person contact that comes from networking.  The more you understand the clients' area the business the more you can charge.
