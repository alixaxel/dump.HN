We have admins watching for anything inappropriate at all times of day using a variety of admin tools; we also have flags a user can trigger in case they feel they should bring a channel to their attention.<p>Justin was about 20 when he started the lifecasting genre, and that's still about the age group that seems to want to share their life online the most.  I get the list of live streams in the ""social"" category once a minute, and show those channels that have viewers (at least 5.)  I don't think the age of the broadcaster is available in the API, but that sounds like a good addition.",1248940576
731826,comment,730755,731795,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, gotta be careful with respect to maintenance.  I crashed earlier this summer because I shifted my chain into the spokes, locking the rear wheel in a turn.  I <i>knew</i> the limit screw was set improperly, but I figured it was not enough to cause any problems.  Well, I was wrong.  I landed on my leg, though, and unclipped quickly enough that I didn't even scratch myself too badly.  (Threadlock is your friend, BTW, so the limit screws don't unscrew themselves.  I still pull the derailer cable before each ride to make sure the chain can't be shifted off the cogs, though.)<p>Also, did you use your front brake?  I tend to see my rear brakes as a backup; I use it if the front brake fails, if the front wheel has poor traction, or if I'm descending and just want to slow the acceleration.  The front brake can develop about 5x more stopping force, since the front wheel can't skid.  And, if you are used to using it, you won't go over the handlebars in an emergency. <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/brakturn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheldonbrown.com/brakturn.html</a>",1248940532

731822,comment,731319,731319,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think the problem is the lack of accountability on the govenrment's part.  If the leaders of FBI field offices routinely went to jail for raiding data centers unnecessarily (etc.), you can bet that they'd be more careful.  But since there is no punishment for ruining someone's life, they are just going to continue to ruin lives.  The false negative rate doesn't matter, as long as they occasionally stop a real crime, everyone gets promotions.<p>(That's my understanding anyway.)<p>Also, it is unacceptable that nobody will represent this guy in court.  As far as I know, the Constitution guarantees a trial and representation at that trial.  If he can't get either, then his civil rights are being illegally violated.  (Judges may not understand the Internet, but they do understand the Constitution.  Well, except for a few people on the SCOTUS that really need to learn how to read...)",1248939976
731821,comment,731316,731316,0,0,smithjchris,,,"This is the typical example where Linux suffers from lack of true engineering.  The kernel API and libs should be stable, predictable and well documented.  There should be no hacks to support odd behaviour because odd behaviour should not be specified.  Isn't that why we have POSIX?<p>What with recent issues with egotistical libc maintainers, people throwing their pacifiers over having to support junk, people moaning about ext4 (even though it works fine and is poor app behaviour), it doesn't give people much confidence.<p>Confidence is key.",1248939966
731819,comment,729980,730048,0,0,fdesmet,,,"It sounds like you haven't actually tried to obtain affordable private medical insurance.  I have.  A few years ago, I spent almost two years working sans paycheck on a startup and found it easy to satisfy one of my prerequisites, which was an affordable high-deductible medical insurance policy.<p>The notion that medical insurance has to be expensive is a myth.  The notion that medical insurance has to cover every bout of the sniffles is a myth.  My policy had a $1000 deductible, which meant I was on the hook for routine medical visits (I didn't have any in two years), but that policy relieved me from worries about financial ruin due to any potential major medical problems.  The high-deductible policy that I purchased was less than half the cost of my former employer's COBRA plan.  It was well within the realm of ramen profitability.  It doesn't take much effort to be an informed consumer in the medical insurance marketplace, but many people (it seems) can't be bothered to try.",1248939883

Every app seems to have its own social atmosphere and community; I used to have a shareware app for users of eBay, and was even a PowerSeller for a short time; the user base of my app was closer to age 50 than 20.  Do you have suggestions on features that could be useful to this userbase?  I've noticed that almost everybody has pop music playing in the background, for example.  Maybe something related to music and fashion?  Thanks.",1248939494

'IT' and 'Ginger' and a veil of secrecy were just about the only pre-release things that came from there, the hype blew it up way beyond reasonably expectations. The segway - which is innovative in many ways and has done a lot for robotics - could only dissapoint by the time it was released, no matter what it really was.",1248939161

731810,comment,729545,731713,0,0,smithjchris,,,"In single table inhertance, any leaf node from the inheritance graph cannot solely contain a relation to another object.  It has to be on the abstract base or the ORM dies when building inserts for other leaf nodes.  That leaves you to implement any business constraints on the model, but there is no model validation so it gets shifted into the controllers (or views as they call them).<p>Not overly good.",1248939037

They also don't accomplish much, in fact they are so 'safe' I doubt they'll ever do something in the first place.<p>If you do a lot chances are that you'll be wrong plenty of times. Given the average score of hits:misses Dean Kamen is comfortably outperforming pretty much any poster on HN, on top of that he seems to be a half decent human being trying to solve problems that really matter. His success rate is only part of the picture. Sure he's got an ego and there seems to be a disconnect with respect to how some 'ordinary' people perceive his products. But I guess that once you reach that level you have to be a very balanced person not to let it get to you in some way.<p>There is some correlation between having a billion dollars in excess income and being out of touch.",1248939002
731808,comment,731364,731364,0,0,jrockway,,,"Earlier today I wrote a post about ""security problems that C causes"" and neglected to mention the use of null-terminated strings instead of a proper data structure that encapsulates length along with the string.<p>Well, this is what happens when you assume some sort of special data is valid, when it isn't actually.  (\0 can appear in a string, it's a perfectly valid character, so it's not safe to use it to terminate the string.  But people do anyway.)",1248938911

This is the technology behind the XBox 360's ""Project Natal"", but it's a lot more than a game controller.  A Flash LIDAR camera directly senses the distance to every object seen by the camera by measuring the time-of-flight of a reflected laser pulse.  With accurate distance data for every pixel a lot of really hard computer vision problems suddenly become much, much eaiser.",1248938682
