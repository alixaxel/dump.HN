You live in a nicer place, you can observe your equity and wealth increasing month by month, you have more freedom to change your house or take up hobbies that you might not do in a rented house.  If the mortgage requires you work too much to enjoy the house, the mortgage isn't doing it's job.<p>I'm not advising making any rash decisions like going full hippy or something, but in a more gradual and moderate way, you can feel out your boss about working four days a week; look at your life and cut some spending, ditching the house and renting if that is what gives greater freedom and security; etc.<p>Careers and houses aren't worth that much.  They don't hang around that long or increase in value that much in the long run.  If you look at the number of times the average American moves or switches careers, any helathy cat or dog will outlive your current career and house.  They just aren't worth giving up life long dreams or health for.  Now your marriage, that could be different.<p>Try suggesting to your boss that you will commit to being in the office 10 hours a day, but need every Friday off.   When he shoots it down, wait a week and then suggest trying it only one week a month.<p>Also, take your ideas and break them up into extremely small tasks, that take an hour or less.  If you can look down a TODO list and see something quickly achievable, that can get you going even when you are exhausted.",1248850368

There is support for managing buffers, and other very primitive editor functionality like that.  Then there is the Lisp VM and associated data structures (""Lisp_Object"") to glue everything together.  On top of that are some primitive functions (""and"", ""cdr"", etc.), along with some primitive editing functions (""next-line"") implemented in C.  That's about it; the rest is all Emacs Lisp code that you can simply choose not to run.  (Yes, some gets compiled right into the Emacs binary to speed startup, but you can skip that.)<p>Sure, you can argue that many emacs extensions (hello, Gnus) are bloat.  But you can just pretend it doesn't exist; nobody is forcing you to use anything.  Plain emacs is a very simple toolkit for building your own editor.  Emacs with simple.el (and friends) is still a very simple, but rich, text editor.  As you add packages, you add functionality and complexity... but you can choose what to add, Emacs is infinitely malleable and does not care what you do to it.<p>I am not too familiar with Eclipse, but I doubt that it is simpler than Emacs.",1248849688

I'm not an expert in this, so some of it might be wrong in the detail.<p>Firstly, there is a comparatively simple pattern that grows endlessly - the Gosper Glider Gun.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_%28cellular_automaton%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_%28cellular_automaton%29</a><p>Someone asked about the processes used to create these sorts of things. If you read about Bill Gosper:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gosper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gosper</a><p>you'll see that he's a hacker's hacker.  If you analyse the GGG you'll see that it can be broken down into smaller pieces, each of which is a small modification  of something small and easy to understand.  In essence, you can build a GGG from small components, and then optimise it, the entire process being like writing a computer program, perhaps in something like BrainFuck: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck</a><p>I might meet Gosper in March next year.  I've made a note to ask him if that's actually what he did.  From what I've read, it is.<p>The question about <i>""growth in which it was not an oscillating reaction""</i> is hard to pin down, and it's not clear what you mean.  I would guess you mean something like:<p><pre><code>    A pseudo-periodic pattern is one which can be
    divided into two areas, P and P'. Inside P the
    pattern is periodic, and in P' the pattern is
    comprised of units, each of which is periodic
    under some isometry.
</code></pre>
Well, using GGGs you can beat that definition too, because you can construct patterns that build GGGs at a distance, and then you can make a Turing Machine that computes the digits of pi, then you can build GGGs at distances that get further away by the amount that is a digit of pi, and then you have something that's still sort of predictable, and still isn't what you want, but still satisfies the above definition.<p>Part of the problem is making precise make precise what you mean.  I suspect you're trying the equivalent of proving the existence of non-computable numbers, and then asking to show one.  Counting arguments suggest that amorphous patterns that grow indefinitely exist, but they're the equivalent of uncomputable numbers.  I can't show you one.",1248849209

Dyndns will suffice to get you started, though.<p>The main thing is not to let the problem of lacking hosting stop you from getting your project to the point where you have users and some potential income, as fast as possible.<p>Which is more likely:  a) you halt work on your project because something is not up to ""professional"" standards, start making money on something else, and your project just dies or b) 1 million people instantly decide to visit your site as soon as it is launched, and can't get to it, and then methodically check the whois on every site they visit for the rest of their lives to make sure you can't do another startup ?<p>The answer is, if you know a way to get a few users now, do it.

So I'll tell you about something I did when I was a grad student.<p>I was using an up to date TeX install.  My advisor wasn't.  To placate him, I had to copy all of my packages, and all the packages they referred to, and so on down the line so that he could compile my papers.  I did this entirely within make + some small shell scripts.  The fact that I could write scanners for %.tex and %.sty and %.cls and have GNU make (obviously) automagically use them to build the dependency scripts I instructed it to include was immensely convenient.  This is not impossible to do procedurally, but it was inconvenient, and the all-make solution had the attractive side that whenever there were bugfixes to the packages they got automatically included in what I was doing.<p>A better example, come to think of it, is the typical LaTeX woe; you can't build the final .dvi until you have accurate page numbers, references, tables of contents, indexes.  You get all of those by--building the .dvi.  So there's a strange circular dependency here.  Make doesn't deal with this especially well, although it can be done.
