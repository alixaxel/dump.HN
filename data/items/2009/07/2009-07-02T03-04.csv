683827,comment,683780,683780,0,0,imajes,,,"Oh wow.<p>It's so nice to see news from years ago making it back as 'new' headlines. Whatever.<p>Feedback for such schemes has been the following-<p>a: that people felt incredibly unsafe (especially women) and stopped going out out night, regardless of being able to turn the lights on.<p>b: non locals, travelers, elderly people, disabled and so on can't use it easily. period.<p>c: most street lights are high power sodium lights, which are (According to wikipedia and other sources) one of, if not the most, efficient form of distributing energy in the form of light. They also happen to have a fairly significant startup time, so motion sensors wouldn't be very efficient. It's not obvious that replacing with more efficient startup lamps and motion sensors would help.<p>d: would you want to drive where your eyes would constantly have to re-dilate as the lights come on?<p>e: i've seen some pilot programs that have photovoltaic collection plates on top of street light stands, which collect energy during the day to activate the light at night. Feels more like the future we've been looking for.<p>I'd much rather see policies which force office lights, computers and so on be turned off at night (or face fines, etc) than street lights that work less efficiently.",1246506895

683814,story,,,8,6,joshuarr,"Ask HN: What should I do with UberGoose?",,"UberGoose is a 'social catalog' that provides a forum for people to rate and discuss things. I think of it as Wikipedia meets Digg with a bit of Facebook and Amazon thrown in. Items can be goosed, which improves their popularity within a category – more popular items get more exposure. Additionally, goosing things adds them to your profile, so other friends and other users can see what you like. The goal is to become the go-to destination for user based ratings, reviews and discussion forums on the internet.<p>The site is currently stuck in private alpha. Really, it's a prototype, as it only hints at the site I imagine. It has several critical flaws due to its incompleteness, but is still kind of fun (but obfuscatory) to play with. The alpha test site was useful as far as putting together a development roadmap, but at this point I've exhausted my development funds. The current site was built in rails.<p>I've taken this about as far as I can for the time being and so I am looking for help moving forward. Ideally I would like a talented rails programmer and/or business guru to partner up with, but I don't know how to go about finding someone who fits the bill who would also be interested in working on the project for equity.<p>Any advice is appreciated, but I'm much more concerned with how to move forward than how to improve the current site.<p>Thanks!<p>http://www.ubergoose.com",1246506258

Python doesn't allow those circumstances; it also doesn't easily allow for nicely embedded Python in templates.<p>There are definitely cases where indentation as syntax is the wrong choice, and my use cases tend to hit those.
