We can't fix the fact that your friend is mad with power, and has a weak grasp on the value of an idea without someone to execute it.<p>You need to talk to your friend, and tell him you would love to work with him on this, but the opportunity cost only makes sense if you are an equal partner in the venture.  You simply can't take those kinds of risks, accept so little income, work those kinds of hours, without a reasonable expectation of equal sharing in the results of the work.  If he wants you to work for him, rather than be a co-founder, he should be offering competitive market rates and benefits (or contractor rates and no benefits; you could even offer him the ""friend"" rate of $100/hour rather than the regular rate of $150/hour).  He'll either realize he's being a douche, or yell at you to GTFO and never call him again.  Either way, you come out ahead and you don't get screwed out of a couple of years of your life just to wind up in a crappy job where you're under-appreciated and underpaid.",1247608793

Let's say YC gets 1,000 applications this summer.

If you use the $100 price point, that's $200K/yr just to review funding apps for 2 months.

He said that, in passing laws related to copyright, the government is, ideally, acting entirely to maximize the benefit to the public. He says that copyright exists in order to encourage authors to produce more works, because that should benefit the public.<p>> I don't claim to know where the balance lies between these two considerations, but I do know that there has to be a balance, ....<p>Stallman doesn't agree with you. He specifically states that the idea that copyright should balance the rights of various parties, is a bad one. Read the section titled, The first error: ""striking a balance"". It ends: ""Since the idea of 'striking a balance' between publishers and readers denies the readers the primacy they are entitled to, we must reject it.""",1247608625

Here's a quick background.<p>I started building some projects for fun and realized that it would be great if I can hire some help. Obviously, I couldn't afford a full time salary here, so I decided to see if there's some possibility of an offshore team.<p>I hired my first person 18 months ago and this person started working at <i>then</i> my partners house (he lives offshore). We moved into our first office 15 months ago and increased the team to 4 people. Till then I was just building stuff for fun trying to see what sticks. This is when I started getting requests from a couple of people to build applications for them. It was a good source of side income and so we did.<p>Fast forward to now, my partner is no longer with us (I own the company now), we have moved into a larger office and recently hired employee # 10 and # 11. We're doing some fun things building fun applications and this hobby has suddenly turned into a BUSINESS with real profit and revenue.<p>The problems and questions I have are:
a) My structure so far was flat. Everyone reported to me. We used scrum reporting from Assembla. However, now there's too many people to manage plus I still have customers to work with. However, if we introduce a structure, the hierarchy may slow things down. Thoughts?<p>b) With more people especially since I am not in the same location as others, there are communication hurdles. We've gotten pretty good at this but does anyone have better experience with dislocated teams that can suggest some tools? process? etc. that can help other than the regular skype, messenger, phone etc.<p>c) If we decide a structure, it makes sense for me to make my first 4 employees as leads. They have been around the longest and worked with me the most (and hence understand me the most). 2 of those are the strongest developers, however the other 2 not so much. However, from experience I know that when you make the smartest people leaders, they loose their day to day contribution a little at least in the short run. What do you recommend the best structure would look like.<p>I understand I may not have provided some details, so please let me know in the comments and I will add here.<p>Appreciate your help for a first time entrepreneur/business owner with little knowledge of growing a company and creating a structure that lends well to growth.<p>Thanks !",1247607540

The web today is a mishmash of technologies and clearly, following web standards has a lot of benefits.<p>However I'm beginning to think that using HTML tables for layout is a grey area. Certainly search engines don't seem to care too much about it (with respect to page ranking).  They have been having to deal with tables for layout since they many of them started.  I therefore don't think there is any evidence that you will be ranked badly from using them. Am I wrong?<p>Also there are many high ranking sites which use tables such as Jakob Nielsen's UseIt.com (http://www.useit.com/). Admittedly this site is old, but it has a Google Page Rank of 8/10?<p>Also many pay-per-click search engine marketing (SEM) sites use tables for layout.
Such as the ones created by Chance Barnett. (I'll mention the sites but I am in no way affiliated with them, I heard about them through Mixergy.com, anyway: DoubleYourDating, CatchHimAndKeepHim, HaveTheRelationshipYouWant, LoveIsInTheStars).<p>So my question is what sort of advantage do these sites have over pure standards driven sites?  Especially as many of them still have external CSS files.<p>I saw this article a while back on hacker news and it did have some good points:  http://www.flownet.com/ron/css-rant.html<p>I don't want to use tables, but if the advantage is speed maybe we should consider it?<p>Anyway I would be interested in your thoughts from a technical perspective.<p>Many thanks.
