My reaction when reading the book and even now is just to think 'set up one of those dodgy affiliate sites, ebook sites or drop shipping resellers', none of these being something I ever want to do.<p>The idea of spending a month making something and then the rest of your time reaping in the profits with low overhead is a great one. Not only does it give you the freedom to work on a startup (or whatever) without worrying about rent, but I'd warrant it gives you a fair bit of credibility too - and a possible exit, even; cf. the recent post about Mingle^2 which took 66.5 hours to build and which got sold to a competitor.<p><i>Edit</i> Actually, I kind of have a cash-flow muse of my own. I helped build up a gaming blog to the point where it pays significant money to writers, and am retained as a columnist there, contributing about 1 hour's worth of work every Saturday. Without going into <i>too</i> much of the gritty detail, if I doubled that to 8 hours of work a month, I'd about cover my rent. However, there's a catch; as my startup's become more exciting, I've had no time to play the game I blog about, and have stopped writing. I can imagine this working a wee bit better if I was writing a column a week for TechCrunch or something similarly in line with the 'day-job', though.",1248706050

725888,comment,724521,725656,0,0,robg,,,"There are numbers. They may be too correlational for your liking, but there is significant data. I think you have to be careful here. Saying the data are inconclusive, because controlled tests are difficult if not impossible, is one thing. But dismissing the data embraces the same fanaticism that you seem uncomfortable with. Science demands skeptics but deniers get thrown out of the tent. The difference might seem like a religious dispute but it really comes down to productive criticism versus unproductive needling.<p>The emotion probably comes from seeing something that seemed permanent, like permafrost and Arctic ice, melting away. Humans don't tend to like instability. And instability on a global scale is a relatively new phenomenon. Sunspots might be the next worry but what could we possibly do about that?<p>It's an interesting point on the cycle of religious movements (and it reminds me of deathbed confessions - what do you have to lose?). But what's an alternative explanation for rising temperatures? That's science. There's an existing and prevailing hypothesis that attempts to explain that data. You need another hypothesis that explains the data just as well. It could be that the Earth is simply repeating normal warming trends. The problem is, that's not a testable hypothesis. There is no experiment that could reject that hypothesis.<p>By contrast, if man is playing some role, then if we change our behaviors we should see a change in temperatures. If we see some reduction in global temperatures coincident with climate change interventions, that's another data point in favor of the hypothesis that man has some role to play. To me, that's another clear reason to pump research dollars into the problem. And sure, nuclear plants should be a part of the solution.<p>My point on not waiting is what can be gained by running interventions. Sure, it might be a wasted effort, but either way you gain knowledge you didn't have previously from simple observation. I really don't know what the alternative is. The planet appears to be changing. We're unsure of the cause - some more so than others. What's the problem with trying to figure out things through the scientific method? Wasted resources? Unnecessary hysteria? So what? Research and development is like insurance. You may not need it, but if you do, you'll be happy you put in the effort years ahead of time.",1248705190

725864,comment,724963,725520,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"""To my ears this sounds incredibly bureaucratic and unnecessary when you work with competent people""<p>Here is my explanation based on my observations.<p>- The mass expansion of IT in India, particularly in its second decade (late 90's to the present) was the result of the series of credit bubbles in US. Similar to China's manufacturing export bubble. Without the US bubble, the expansion would have happened, but not in the reckless, pell-mell fashion it happened.<p>- As a result, Indian IT companies hired fresh-out-of-college people in massive, really massive numbers - 25,000 people a year in each of the big 4 companies. Private colleges expanded massively to meet that demand. The analogy is to the US housing expansion (ultimately both were caused by the credit bubble).<p>- Competence arises for a good part from experience.  To visualize this, do a thought experiment: how would your team look if you substitute every team member with the same person but as they were starting out fresh. A good part of competence is simply knowing the skill & aptitude make-up of every team member. When everyone is fresh, that vital knowledge is absent.<p>- So the Indian industry came up with a ""solution"" so fresh recruits don't cause too much damage: create rules and procedures for everything. Bureaucratize. Alas, that ""solution"" imposes a long term toll on culture of the company.",1248704459
