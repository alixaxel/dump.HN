There are shortcuts for common patterns like endings ('ing', 'shun'). It's positional (high/mid/low per each line). Vowel sounds are dropped where not necessary, and where present they are the dots and dashes - positional (left/mid/right). It can make a distinction between light and dark pencil strokes to indicate voiced and unvoiced sounds.<p>In short, there are fewer marks to put on paper and the marks are simpler and more fluid to write.",1248739065

727064,comment,720144,721231,0,0,papersmith,,,"I probably should've written a disclaimer as to indicate my opinion.  :)<p>To be more specific, perhaps I should've emphasized that ""modern"" Asian cultures have questionable tastes, which is in direct contrast to traditional Asian sensibilities.  I feel that modern Asian cultures are too busy imitating what's trendy in the west.  It doesn't help the fact that instability of the past century made people lose faith in their indigineous cultures, while the western culture has evolved quite a bit since to adapt to changes of the world, thus leaving a big gap to catch up.<p>I'd venture that the vast portion of the old Asian cultures are appreciated now-a-days merely for their exotic aspects, even by Asian people themselves.  Whatever is preserved for practical reasons don't always fit in a coherent manner, there are plenty of rough edges to work out.<p>I guess a bad analogy would be that Asian culture is like Unix, Apple is Europe, Windows is USA, China is BSD, and Japan is Ubuntu.  The kernel is the philosophy, command line is the traditional culture, GUI is the pop culture, and the internet is globalization.  Windows eventually took over and became more accessible over time with its killer GUI apps.  For the time being, Unix lacks the ecosystem to build killer GUI apps, so they created Wine to run Windows apps.  There are also plenty of native Unix GUI apps that sprang up, but most are created in response to their existing commercial counterparts, and many of their GUIs are imitations.  FreeBSD has been around for a while, went through several regime changes, and is still kinda authoritarian with its userland programs.  Ubuntu is later to the game, has the most success in adapting to modern GUI needs, but there's still some distance to go to catch up to Apple and perhaps Windows.  Even though Unix is weak in GUI stuff, it's strong as servers, especially since the internet became popular.<p>Sorry about the silly analogy, perhaps I need to take a nap. :)",1248738969

727023,comment,726110,726629,0,0,sokoloff,,,"> If a particular person is deemed too much of a risk to lend to then they should not be lent money. How is it a better idea to lend them money at a higher interest rate?<p>That's the point of altering the interest rate: in many cases, it alters the outcome from ""too risky [to be profitable]"" to ""profitable [based on modelling/predicted likelihood of payback]""<p>Imagine that a debtor borrowing $100 has a probability of paying back that $100 of p. If p is exactly 1 (for practical purposes), then the lender only needs to ask for nominal interest over whatever would be equivalent the ""risk-free"" T-bill rate.<p>If p is exactly 0.99, then they need to ask for some greater amount, perhaps roughly an additional 1% margin (somewhat higher in practice to offset the administrative work). Surely you would agree that banks should be allowed to extend people credit cards at a 5% interest rate, right?<p>Now make p = 0.95. Now a bank needs to ask at least 6% over the T-bill rate, but you're very likely still OK with them requiring 10% interest on credit cards.<p>Now make p = 0.90. Now a bank needs to ask at least 11% over the T-bill rate, but you're probably still OK with them requiring 16% interest on credit cards.<p>If you're on board so far, by this point (in fact, in the step from 1.00 to 0.99 does the same thing, but it's just much more obvious now), you've agreed that different people can be charged different amounts, and if someone is deemed ""too much of a risk to lend to at 5%"", it logically follows that it is not the only solution to not lend, but rather for some borrowers to increase the interest rate until it is again profitable.

727021,comment,706619,707068,0,0,Nikklus,,,"The short answer (upcoming pun intended) is that it’s simply not true that ten pounds is the maximum you can gain in a year, unless you’re talking about an <i>achondroplastic</i> dwarf.<p>I myself have gained more than ten pounds of muscle at many points over a twenty year history of bodybuilding. It’s even more possible when you’re a <i>green hand</i>, as you will gain a lot easier from day zero than you will five years down the line. I think you’ve missed that the first four responding posters in the second link you’ve provided all agree with this in different manners. And from what I can see, (I may be wrong here) but Tim Ferriss also claims to have started his training regime—specifically targeted at maximum muscle gain—from day zero.<p>Regarding your third link, well, just looking at the quote you’ve supplied beneath it is enough. There are two variables in that statement which need to be highlighted, “…the average bodybuilder…” and “…nearly impossible…”<p>If you consider the reverse of what the author seems to be saying it would be along the following lines: “…in order to gain more than ten pound of muscle in a year, you need to be an above average bodybuilder.” So, all we need to do now is figure out if Tim Ferriss is an ‘above average bodybuilder’ or not. If everything he is telling us is true, then there is the possibility that he is indeed above average, either in genetics, or in his understanding of exactly how to build quality lean mass. Or even better, both.<p>However, you’ve unfortunately taken the third link out of context. If you read on, John Little actually goes ahead and supports ‘mavericks’ like Tim Ferriss. Immediately following the point where you’ve cut off his sentence, he continues:<p>“…due largely to the person’s falling prey to the hype and outright B.S. that is propagated by most bodybuilding publications and that line the pockets of more than a few gym owners and personal trainers.”<p>By this comment it seems to me that John Little’s definition of an average bodybuilder is someone who chooses to follow popular techniques…as opposed to those who use a more scientific route.<p>Now I’d never heard of Tim Ferriss until today when I typed the word ‘superhuman’ in the Google Blog search for other reasons, but his thinking and techniques are very similar to the ones that I used when I was in training. People also found it hard to accept the accomplishments that I made relative to my time and frequency in the gym (whole body, once a month, average of 30 minutes per workout.) I never made gains to the tune of 34 lbs in 28 days though, but then I never had the luxury of constant optimum conditions within which to grow. Real life kind of gets in the way.<p>My routine was based on the theories and practices of Mike Mentzer, a strong science-based proponent of the Heavy Duty method of training, which Tim Ferriss’s method seems very similar to.<p>It’s a real difficult call to make—not being able to examine the Tim Ferriss’s results first hand—but I’m gonna stick my neck out and say that 34lbs in 28 days could be done by a beginner, under strict and optimum conditions…conditions which include choosing parents with the best genetics possible!",1248737651

They usually can't get the same level of credit a man can get.  They are often doing it because they are moms who want to be home with the kids, so their first responsibility is to their family, not their business.  This means they can't put sufficient time and energy into the business to launch something on a more traditional male model of success (which means they often have no goal to expand from their home office to a more traditional setting).  They tend to be more risk-averse than men, in part because they just don't have as much capacity to recover from a big financial mistake as men tend to have.

If I've misunderstood you please explain. Assigning that kind of political power isn't something one does lightly.<p>The science and politics thing is indeed dicey. I would suggest that a set of ethical guidelines be established to keep both parties honest, much like we have with the doctor-patient relationship in psychoanalysis. There's simply too much temptation for each side to use the other for their advantage. We don't want to end up with one party ""scientifically"" proving the other party is a bunch of morons (substitute much more PC adjectives here). We certainly don't want politicians announcing that scientific or political debate is ""over"" for a particular topic. E-gads man, that's a travesty.<p>Last time I had a AGW discussion on HN (several months back), somebody pointed out that we've actually been seeing a <i>cooling</i> trend, not a warming one. If the current year continues that trend, the original models will have been invalidated -- the actual observed data will fall outside of the 95% confidence range. I know this sounds like stalling for time, but since I'm not in a hurry anyway, I'd like to see the current year's data.<p>I'm not a climatologist, and of course it's not incumbent on me to put forth any alternatives. I am, however, aware of several. (I've spent some time researching this issue). There's the 1500-year cycle theory, that since the last great ice age we've seen regular 1500-year cycles. There's the average-global-temperature-is-primarily-a-result-of-solar-radiation crowd. I think those guys, Russians if I recall, made a bet back in 2000 that the next decade would see cooling, not warming. Perhaps they'll get paid? I don't know. There are theories that cosmic radiation is responsible for cloud coverage and that <i>cloud coverage</i> is the primary ingredient in climate. My personal half-baked theory is that since we are talking about a mixed chemical and biological system, with hundreds of thousands of variables, the climate is probably a chaotic system with an attractor based around solar input. This means that small inputs could have large effects, but it also means that large inputs may have no effect at all. With a little more research I'm sure we could find a lot of other ideas out there.<p>The smoking gun in current model application is the fact that all of them have runaway conditions at the end. This has been interpreted as portraying some pending doom, but any computer science nerd who has played around with chaotic and CA systems can observe that the default behavior is runaway systems. So on general principle I'm skeptical that we're not seeing much more than experimentation noise.",1248736127
