712412,comment,712350,712360,0,0,viraptor,,,"What do you mean by ""Here in the UK phone companies have such a monopoly amongst themselves.""?<p>There's a choice between voda, orange, t, o2 and others and it doesn't seem so bad. Of course O2 seems to have the same problems like at&t - not good enough infrastructure and not enough coverage to handle iphones properly (and now they will get Pre as well, unfortunately). And there are crappy carriers like Three which should DIAF long ago. But otherwise, many offers are sensible.<p>You're forced to go the 18 months contract route mostly when you're buying the cheapest stuff, which is fair enough. Otherwise, I don't think the situation is bad at all.",1247965151
712411,comment,712022,712314,0,0,ekiru,,,"Zed seems to me to be using the word ""whore"" in a gender-neutral manner to describe anyone involved in this marketing campaign. On the other hand, I do find his derogatory use of the word ""pussy"" to be possibly misogynistic, but that's not so much a matter of his misogyny but a subconscious misogyny present in much of the male segment of American society.<p>As well, I think it's unfair to Zed to assume that any apparent misogyny present in this is a result of him being a misogynist as opposed to the possibility that it is intended to establish a tone that matches what he believes to be the feelings of the people involved in creating the marketing campaign he is ridiculing.",1247964945

This would be useful even if color is being used only as a relative measure not as an absolute ""number of times loved"".<p>Using color as an axis can be notoriously difficult to do properly/clearly (consider linear vs logarithmic mappings or using hue, saturation and/or value together to show one dimensional data) without even getting into aesthetic considerations.<p>Lest you think that I am being too critical, the fact that the graphic designer only modulated color value and not hue and saturation makes this chart better than some that I have seen.",1247964159

It willingly, almost gleefully, assists in the violation of its customers rights and privacy. It is a paragon of inefficiency. It fights against progress to keep its anachronistic business model relevant. It uses the legal system as a club. And it ensures that any actions brought against it can at best be Pyrrhic victories.<p>In short, it is truly every bad thing Microsoft has ever been alleged to be and worse.

Great reply!<p>Weight is not really a problem for me yet (according to this BMI index I'm underweight, fwiw), but this year I lost muscle and gained weight (in fat). I'd like to reverse that. My problem is with exercise: when I feel like exercising I do it like I used to be able to. But then the next few days I can't exercise because my muscles are sore and weak. And generally I have a hard time getting into the habit. I used to cycle ~120 km per week to school but now I live closer to school...so I used to burn one day's food by cycling and I'm not eating less now.<p>I don't care about looks and muscles, but I'd like to get in shape to be able to run & cycle better again and feel fitter. What type of exercise do you recommend? How do you motivate yourself to exercise?",1247962642

But there's also great value in that, too, when done right.<p>If you don't already know if you like writing, then you probably don't like writing, or else you would be doing it and liking it.<p>Not all chapters are equal.  The trouble is in knowing if your sample chapter is a proper sample of the book as a whole.  However, if you find it hard or tedious, stop right away.<p>It's probably best to write about something you already know and love, but beware the pitfalls in explaining what you've by now internalized to some newbie.  There's a good chance you've forgotten how odd or quirky many things are, and you really don't want to discover this at the point you are trying to explain it.<p>Good examples are hard.  Most tech books have questionable example code.  On the one hand, they need to be reasonably brief; on the other, they should not be contrived.  I tend to prefer walking the reader though a  longer code base spread out over chapters, as it will more likely match real-life code.<p>Very few authors make money off books.
