There could also be policy that every new house has to have solar panels (less cost if they are built in in large numbers)<p>However just like when the oil companies researched, patented and never sold oil additives that would have made petrol (gas) go further (not a conspiracy :) my Aunt was a research chemist for one company) purely to secure their market they are doing similar things with solar tech; lobbying and hiding it :) we worked on a small project at the end of my degree for an energy company I shall not name - they were actively patenting advances in solar tech ""for a rainy day"" :)<p>Fair play - no one else bothered to beat them too it.

I could see myself using this as a quick way to start new projects... especially with Drupal, as downloading & installing a bunch of modules can be a long process.<p>That said, I think the interface for adding modules could be more efficient if it functioned a little more like the iTunes search bar - just pull stuff in as I type.<p>Also, there's no reason to take me to a new page when I add a module - it's a waste of time. Try some sort of lighter-weight confirmation... maybe just add it to a sidebar panel that lists the modules I've added and give me a little flash so I can see it popped up there. Otherwise, I have to wait for this page to load that doesn't tell me anything new.<p>Keep at it!",1247594306

A hacker doesn't want to spend time doing all the boring stuff like un/zipping, find, copy, paste, create db, etc...  Flooha allows them to skip all the fluff and get down to the fun stuff like hacking.  Similarly, normal users can skip all of what they consider BS and just get down to adding their content.<p>""But, what is the revenue model in all this?""<p>Well, the free hosting is pretty limited at 100MB. Initially, we'll generate revenue from the premium hosting accounts.  However the potential is so much more.  Here's a short list.<p>1. Job listings and rent-a-coder type projects.<p>We hope to develop a community where users can find designers and hackers to further customize their sites.<p>2. Paid apps and addons.<p>Think ""iPhone App Store"" on this one.  There was a story here recently (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=659303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=659303</a>) about WordPress plugin developers who can't make any money from their plugins.  Well, imagine if they had a way to charge just a dollar or two and thousands of users used their plugin on their website...  There is also an opportunity for paid apps like vBulletin, which is the most popular forum software on the 'net and also has tons of add-ons.<p>3.  I've designed the site so that I can basically ""flip a switch"" and open it up to other hosting companies.  So, you could use Flooha, but on your own server or your web host's server.  There is potential for partnerships with big hosting companies.<p>I think I've given away all my secrets. ;)<p>""Good luck and keep us posted!""<p>Thanks a lot, I will.",1247594209

There's an okay discussion going on at New Scientist, where they talk about how we can liken a human baby to doing the exact same thing - getting what they can (food).  So I think we can use a better word than ""exploiting"" which has negative connotations - it's more based on <i>survival</i>.  I must say though that when I put down the wet food, I certainly get a different cry, likely because they like it and I give it to them only when I think it's appropriate (rare) - not when they want it.  They do run out of dry food daily or every other day, but they don't call for it, or cry for it... they'll come running when the bag or box is opening, but it's like ""aww.. dry food again!? I guess we'll live"".<p>Baby pups at malls or breeding grounds are simply too difficult to ignore. ;)<p>With both of these species, going back to the Egyptians for cats, and not sure when for dogs, over time they've evolved to be alongside us - and sheesh, we have kennels, animal daycare, grooming, the Wag Hotel in San Fran, and a new airline that is in talks to be only used for our pets??

The GPL is a legal tactic of the FSF movement, who believe that intellectual property in software is immoral - it's not just the promotion of more free software.  Being that the software industry exists within a larger social framework where intellectual property is accepted, and we have many commercial entities doing it, I don't believe that producing more GPL software will result in reversing that move that Stallman was so upset about, that led to the FSF - that move from everyone freely sharing their software in the early days, to closing it up and selling it commercially.  For your bicycling analogy, I think the BSD/MIT licenses work fine.  Biking is fun, and so is making free software, but biking more as a tactic to end the automotive industry, once again, seems naive.  I believe that if the FSF has a moral problem with intellectual property, a legitimate philosophical argument, then it should be addressed on a larger scale than simply in software.<p><i>The philosophical reason to use the GPL, rather than the BSD or MIT licenses, is to ensure that users have certain rights to the software they use.</i> - The BSD/MIT licenses are <i>more free</i> for the user, for they can now use it in commercial software, a right eliminated by GPL.  This protection of rights argument comes from the mentioned viral strategy of the FSF as a strategy to --combat-- proprietary software, specifically by eliminating this freedom to use it in commercial software (an immoral use).<p>Trying to cause such a revolution from inside the software industry out doesn't seem plausible to me.  Maybe I'm wrong - and maybe they'll win, but I don't think it's doing much -- so I continue to paste in the MIT license when I want to give away software, just so they know they can do whatever they want with it, and if someone wants to paste some of that into their commercial program, wonderful -- knowledge shared - which was my goal of giving it away: to contribute to the general understandings and capacities of software.",1247591449

704088,comment,702086,703251,0,0,tdavis,,,"So because it is difficult and fraught with past failure, we shouldn't do it? I don't really see how anybody could pose a logical argument for allowing a terrorist government to control a country.<p>We already completely dropped the ball on Afghanistan once and it wouldn't surprise me if we do it again, but if a country is being used to train an army of extremists bent on the destruction of the free world... well, somebody should probably look into stopping that. And I don't think saying ""please"" works on those people.<p>Then again, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe if we never invaded Afghanistan and overthrew the Taliban-controlled government, everything would be peaches right now. I certainly wouldn't have wasted a year of my life in the shit hole.
