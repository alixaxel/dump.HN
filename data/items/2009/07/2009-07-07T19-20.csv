This means that you still send and receive a bunch of mostly-duplicated request/response headers, and still have the latency of multiple request/response round trips.<p>Archives/sprites/etc. are better in some ways than pipelined requests.  Consider the case where the client is making a conditional GET request and the content hasn't changed on the server.  If the content is bundled into a single resource, then you just have a single request and a single HTTP 304 response with no body.  But if the content is served as multiple resources, then you have the exact same conversation repeated once for each resource.  For a site with 100 images, this will use 100x the bandwidth and take nearly 100 times as long.",1246996789

He did not attend the high school's dedication. Armstrong has never drawn attention to himself, and has accepted very little of the attention directed to him by admirers.

I'm not trying to say you're unqualified or unintelligent in any way, just that rationalizing an opinion with a job history is far less compelling evidence than factual examples. It's also interesting that you would immediately associate a well-made and supported argument (for those of us who have any experience scaling with technologies other than Oracle) with someone who isn't a database expert and doesn't know what he's doing.<p>Now let's get to the facts: while perhaps Oracle might have nice features, that doesn't mean that SQL is the best we can come up with, which is one of the primary points of the article (and one that seems completely unaddressed here). In a sense he brings to attention a common occurrence throughout human history wherein we reject change for comfort and these comments are doing nothing more than supporting that. Oracle is, for the most part, entirely too expensive for most businesses and even the businesses that are large enough to adopt it aren't making the profit they could with more affordable technology. You should also make note that, while banks do have strict requirements on data handling, they are really responsible for serving very small user bases when compared to things like Google, Amazon, Ebay, Facebook and the like. Sure the requirements are different for each of these, but ultimately your argument hold no water against these infrastructures, which are inherently <i>not</i> SQL and, at the same time, seem to be much more accepted as innovators of scalable technologies for the future...<p>One big problem is that real innovation comes at the expense of backwards compatibility, which would involve making a lot of changes. I can relate, since massive changes in most case imply bugs, which is a very unsettling position for some of these, but it doesn't mean there isn't a problem. Sure banks and other largely established companies would rather shell out the cash to support their legacy ideals than innovate new solutions, but he's right in that we've been spending many many years of man-hours trying to tackle the problem of porting a dated philosophy to an age that requires more scalability at lower cost. Lets also say that banks haven't been proving their practices to be economically sounds lately, so what is their input worth in this matter? Other than large boatloads of cash for Oracle that is.",1246993468
