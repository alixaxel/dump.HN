Now he's venting.<p>However, he does point out how many of his issues can be solved and after his list he makes the real point: It's not just one flaw that makes it rough, but rather the general lack of polish.  If you're willing to put up with that, like a lot of Linux users did for years, then you will probably like it.

Option is Meta, and various typical Mac Cmd shortcuts work by default (many of the ones that Aquamacs supports).  For example:<p><pre><code>  Cmd-C/X/V - copy/cut/paste
  Cmd-Z - undo
  Cmd-N - new frame (or ""window"" in Mac terminology)
  Cmd-W - close frame (if not last frame)
  Cmd-` - switch between frames
  Cmd-H - hide application
  Cmd-M - minimize frame
  Cmd-, - customize
  Cmd-K - kill buffer
  Cmd-T - bring up Mac font chooser
  Cmd-S - save
  Cmd-A - select all
  Cmd-O - bring up Mac file chooser
</code></pre>
And of course you can define your own actions that use Cmd if you'd like.<p>I think, for new users, the way Emacs does frames/windows/buffers is worth discovering instead of what Aquamacs does by default.",1248976214

Since he's a true coffee geek he called them up, told them that he owned a very small chain half-way around the world and asked if he could come visit. They agreed, and when he got there he was treated to a whole day of tasting, talking, and generally doing what coffee geeks do with people fairly high up in the company.<p>When he asked why they had spent so much time on him when, at best, he would becme a very minor customer they said that they did this to everybody no matter how small. The reason was that many years before another random guy had called up and asked if he could come down for a visit from the US. They treated him well, extended him some credit and generally gave him excellent service. He also ran a small chain of stores.

At the same time they ignored anyone who didn't fit their perfect prospect profile.<p>Failures to understand this have become legend.  The Mercedes dealer who ignored the millionaire in flip flops who left the showroom and bought a BMW.  The fraternity brothers who ignored the old man on their porch until he got up and left his fortune to charity.  The software entrepreneur who didn't take the call from IBM (for whatever reason), so IBM went to Microsoft instead.<p>And the solution is so easy: treat everyone how you'd like to be treated until they give you reason otherwise.  The best people I ever knew (family, friends, business associates) all made me feel special.  Come to think of it, they made <i>everyone</i> feel special.
