My suggestion would be to try and work with a small start-up who wants to quickly build some sort of international presence in a country of your choice and go live there for a year. That way you're working on something cool, you're still building your skills, but you're also able to take advantage of doing some travel outside the U.S. Given your background I'm sure someone would take a chance on you as a good business development guy.",1246733623

687423,comment,687260,687260,0,0,ilkhd2,,,"I already gave my points about immigration in some earlier posts, but my opinion is: Immigration is irrelevant to prosperity of country. Several reasons for that:
1. The countries many immigrants are from, you know they have very affordable medicine and education (former Soviet Union, for example), so in fact any  modern American big software company parasite on this cheap facilities, without any interest in developing similar things domestically.
2. There plenty of examples of countries with high rates of innovation, but with low immigration rates: Sweden (ericsson), Finland (Nokia), Japan.
3. I dare to claim, that immigration erodes values of American society.Imagine a person from China or India (the country where 60 million people literraly  live in poop, they are born in cast of poop-cleaners-by-bare-hands), the person comes to USA and imeddiately becomes middle class (upper sometimes). Well, this new middle class built from immigrants from ugly places, thet have a lot higher tolerance for injustice and corruption.",1246733169

The other end of the spectrum: I used to write code for autonomous UAVs back home (commercial and military).

Either the H1-B worker takes upon much more responsibility than they are being paid for, and therefore floors down the price the employers are willing to pay for an equiv. worker, OR they get stuck in a dead-end job and are first to get axed.<p>Ideally, this processing would take only a year or two.

This is already taxed money so thats even more than it sounds.<p>So that means you currently have 5 years of complete freedom to discover what it is that you want to do.<p>Move to Silicon Valley, start a startup, or join one. Or go travel. Nothing really broadens your mind like travel. And you can easily do that on $20,000 a year if you have no other commitments.<p>It's not $100,000 that you have saved up. Its 5 years. Keep thinking of it that way and you'll realize what you want to do.",1246731122

I use my workstation for everything else.  That gives me a strict division between productivity sucks on the Windows laptop and productive work on the Linux box.  When I want to focus, I can sit with the laptop outside my field of view, so I don't see new emails and IMs.  If I need to consult html docs while I'm coding, I use Conkeror on my Linux box so I'm not tempted into random surfing.  Using Conkeror and Awesome WM on my Linux box makes it very no-nonsense and very conducive to concentration.<p>Ummm, so, I already voted for Linux since that's where all the work gets done.

I'm sure others will mention the obvious political and government things. I'll risk the ensuing flame war and suggest that the lifestyle in America is better. My roommate's girlfriend is from a small town in mainland China, and by small town she means 1 million people. Her parents live in a 2 room apartment in one of those gigantic concrete high-rise complexes. In order to escape that sort of lifestyle you actually do have to be the cream of the crop entrepreneurial engineer with the blessing of the government. Even then, when you succeed you're just living in the same type of city, but maybe in a nicer apartment.<p>In contrast my parents are from a small town in the USA and they have a big house and 3 cars and play golf every thursday morning and have 4 kids and a bunch of nice stuff and can afford to travel to hawaii, or arizona, or montana, or wherever. And they are just normal, average people who didn't even start their own multi million dollar business with the blessing of the government.<p>There are definitely people who prefer the bustle of the city and for whom work and achievement trumps all else, including creature comforts. But for people who are into the 2nd type of lifestyle I've described, there's only a few places in the world where it's relatively easy to achieve: the USA, Canada and Australia. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I know about China, I don't believe that sort of lifestyle is possible for anyone.",1246730714

I think a fair-er comparison is of Noble prize laureates by ethnicity or country where they were born.  You probably will see a lot more even distribution.
Americans are not any smarter then, lets say Europeans.  It is just they have more means.<p>You will probably see a great correlation to economic output and noble price laureates because:<p>1. Richer countries attract smart people.  You are smart, you probably are smart enough to be given great jobs/research positions and the best places to live in this earth, which happen countries that are rich already.<p>2. To do nobel price research, you probably need a lot of financial/instutinational backing, which you are most likely to find in rich countries..",1246730427
