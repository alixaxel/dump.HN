697019,comment,696962,696962,0,0,patio11,,,"In the spirit of ""competition works"", I've got a suggestion for anyone here who is still in poor college kid mode and overdrafts:<p>Sign up for ING Direct Electric Orange checking.  They charge interest, not fees, on overdrafts, something on the order of a 9% APR.  So, if you go over on your checking account by $1, and you realize this when they text you and cover it a day later, you owe them less than a penny.  Don't make a habit of overdrafting, obviously, but this will save you substantially if you have a sudden attack of forgetfulness once or twice a year.<p>Obviously, since they're charging money on the actual amount your account is short by rather than per-NSF-transaction, it doesn't matter what order they process your transactions in.<p>Suggestion for people who are no longer in poor college kid mode: Don't spend more money than you have in checking.  Simple and effective!",1247193544

That said, if fiscal policy were pushing up interest rates the Federal Reserve could simply lower them and use monetary policy in place of extra fiscal policy.<p>This would present the risk of inflation, but if there were inflation (rather than deflation) we would not be in a liquidity trap requiring fiscal stimulus.<p>I think Krugman has gone over all of this.

697014,comment,696859,697008,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I rather intensely disagree. Big armies need to be used, and the social dislocation of war vastly outweighs the often meager benefits. Massive amounts of propaganda hide the problems, and there's a huge consumption of resources that could be put to better use. Teaching people to suspend their natural inclination to kill and getting them to do it on command is something that's easily converted to organized crime.<p>Gwynne Dyer is a good read - his basic thesis is that militarism is essentially the root of organized crime, and has been since Roman times: <a href=""http://www.gwynnedyer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwynnedyer.com/</a>",1247193119

697011,comment,696639,696980,0,0,sho,,,"Well, I am not an expert on religion at all, as you can probably tell. So the new angle is unlikely to come from me. I get frustrated with abstract discussions about religion - to me it comes down to, is it real or not? And the answer, of course, is inevitably ""not"".<p>I don't really know about these variants of Christians you mention. I suppose that if there are Christians who know that any supernatural events in the bible are fictional, and do not believe in God but merely try to follow the purported words of Jesus, then that is great - I totally support such people. Anything beyond that, though, is a leap into irrationality, and I suspect the vast majority of Christians fall into the latter category. I have certainly never seen or heard of a Christian who does not believe in God. Perhaps we can term the mere admirers of Jesus' words ""Philosophical Christians"", and ""Christians"" can refer to the believers in the supernatural entity.<p><i>The best I can tell, there is a universal core definition of God across religions which is something like ""that which we are not able to understand""</i><p>That seems like a uselessly broad definition and totally at odds with the common definition of the word. If I said to a normal person that I believe in God, he or she is not going to think ""Ah, this person believes that there are certain things humanity is not able to understand"".<p>When I say ""God"" I mean a supernatural entity as depicted in a religious text or tradition. When I want to talk about things we do not yet understand, I say ""things we do not yet understand"". I understand the anthropological point you are getting at though, and agree that ""God did it"" has been the refrain of savages throughout the ages when confronted with the incomprehensible. However, it is now 2009, and it's time for us to grow up, IMO.<p><i>""Not some myth-overloaded product of hundreds of years of religious dogma.""</i><p>Look, everyone else is using <i>that</i> definition. You should make up a new word or something because otherwise it's just confusing.<p><i>""God is a belief that we do not know everything.""</i><p>Argh! Is there anyone on the planet who <i>does</i> believe we know everything? Please narrow your definition. Ironically, the only people I ever encounter who think they know <i>everything</i> are the religious.<p><i>""I find such a belief a critical part of being a mature intellectual.""</i><p>I agree, but that's got nothing to do with religion, and it's not a ""belief""! You are talking about Philosophy, not Theology.",1247192843

If we can control the person 24/7, provide him with reasonable diet/exercise program, but strictly control his food/liquid intake so that his body mass decreases for a mere 50g per day. How likely would it be for the person to die from starvation while maintaining the huge percentage of body fat? I personally think it would be highly unlikely, but that's just a guess.",1247192674

697001,comment,696866,696866,0,0,inerte,,,"I've seen Google promoting fresh pages to the first results and then the pages vanishing. Many, many times... so your situation is not uncommon! In fact, it happened to me, right here on HN, check this comment:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=576727"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=576727</a><p>Whoever replied that my comment was at the top was right, I checked. But if you search for ""80-19-1"" today, it doesn't appear.<p>My <i>guess</i> is that, when Google finds a new content, it injects amidst the ""proven"" results, to, let's say, test it. To dip its foot in the water. To see if it floats in the storm.<p>Your page probably still doesn't deserve a top slot, not because of its contents, but because Google hadn't the time to properly analyse it. Does it pass on the spam filters? What are users doing: going back and clicking another result, staying for little time on the page (remember, if you use AdSense, Analytics or the user has the Google's toolbar installed, it can be measured), and all the other things.<p>So, don't worry. New pages (specially new domains) must have time to cook in Google's datacenter ovens. You should worry only if after 2-3 months (in fact, I've seen webmasters reporting that new domains might take over a year to fully blossom), the page still doesn't appear. Then it really means it should not, either because there's something wrong or your competitors outrank you.<p>SEO is a game of patience, padwan :)",1247191952
