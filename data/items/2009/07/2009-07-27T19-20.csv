If you are working on anything interesting, chances are you will end up re-inventing half a dozen wheels, taking much longer and coming up with a far less elegant and workable solution. The reason complicated topics exist is because they helped earlier solve problems that weren't obvious, and those problems are the ones worth solving.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is, yes, you can write code knowing only the basics, and yes you can cobble something together, but you'll always be limited by yourself.<p>Not to mention, learning more theory can help open your mind to other <i>categories</i> of solutions and more ways to approach problems",1248721997

I'm not just thinking of the usual definitions of 'cool' problems (compilers, etc). There are lots of problems that aren't as <i>meta</i> as a compiler that are also hard (and hence cool)... routing delivery vehicles, or optimizing any number of metrics.<p>Without a good grasp of what is out there, you'll be forced to do one of two things. Either you'll spend a lot more time than necessary to reinvent the wheel, or you'll implement the most straightforward solution, which might be far from optimal in both time and space. There is always the outside chance that you'll come up with something new and better than anything that already exists, but I'd argue the chances of that are much better if you already understand what is out there.<p>So yeah, I rarely need to do analysis for my day job, but am knee deep in combinatorial optimization algorithms for a side project.<p>For the followup question: any project that implements a language or a library is a place that good algorithms/data structures can make a tremendous difference. But there are applications everywhere. Even boring things like looking up a name in a phone book can benefit from knowing what a Trie is.",1248721857

726472,comment,726376,726376,0,0,cperciva,,,"Learning algorithms and data structures is important because:<p>1. Knowing the standard algorithms and data structures will allow you to figure out which one you should be using, even if you're just doing that via an external library.<p>2. Knowing the standard algorithms and data structures will help you in cases where you want something which is almost but not quite standard.  For example, I recently wrote a no-inserts hash table, because for my particular application I wanted to start with a populated table and then gradually remove entries; by removing the ability to insert entries, I made the code much simpler and faster (no need for rehashing!) -- but if I hadn't been entirely familiar with standard hash tables, I wouldn't have been able to do this.<p>3. Studying the standard algorithms and data structures gives you an opportunity to learn how to think about algorithms and data structures.  Even if you live your life without ever needing to sort a list, having studied sorting algorithms will make it easier for you to figure out the best way to solve whatever obscure domain-specific problems you do encounter.",1248721803
