Nice idea but like the 5 slice toaster I wonder how many times in a year the sites that I use are down (well, other than HN of course, which crashes at least once a day and then takes several minutes to come back up again).<p>You'd still have to poll your email to see that whatever it was that you were looking for is back up, some kind of IM coupling would seem to be a more convenient vehicle (or a text message to a cell phone).<p>Still, it's a nice idea even though the current design looks like an email address harvester, no privacy policy and no 'terms of service' as far as I can see.",1248335134

719211,comment,718825,718909,0,0,1gor,,,"Carol situation is a case of <i>prisoner's dilemma</i>, which may be presented in a bit shorter way than the article does. Let's use standard game theory terms for the possible actions of one male individual:<p>'Cooperate' (C) = to publicly approach an attractive girl<p>'Defect' (D) = to ignore the girl, read the paper instead<p>So, imagine yourself walking into a cafe and seeing Carol at a table. She has been there for a while, and you have no way of knowing if some other guy has already approached her (or if Carol has a boyfriend). Let's assume for the sake of simplicity that the first man who dares to approach Carol always gets her telephone number (her nice way to reward him for being brave). That automatically means that the second guy will be rejected and feel bad.<p>The outcomes are (in order of preference):<p>CD = You dare to speak to Carol, you are the winner, the other guys didn't dare to approach her.<p>DD = Every man in the room reads the paper, Carol sits alone.<p>DC = You choose to ignore the girl, then some lucky bastard walks across the room and gets her number. Bad, but you have not lost your face.<p>CC = The worst outcome. You have approached Carol, but she is already involved with someone else. You walk back to your table, feeling miserable.<p>You notice that second and third outcome are somewhat identical, there is no gain, but also no real damage. A rational person may well prefer to do nothing and land in the 'neutral' area where 50% of total outcomes lay, rather than to approach Carol and to have 25% chance of success vs. 25% chance of a complete disaster.<p>---<p>I think it is not the women's attractiveness that acts as a repellent, but uncertainty of her status (has or has not a partner already). The way for Carol so improve her situation is to develop some sort of signalling that says she doesn't mind to be approached (flirting used to do the trick in old times).",1248334919

719196,comment,718825,718929,0,0,kragen,,,"I know two totally beautiful, very smart women in my own city who have been single for months, in their late 20s and early 30s. My circle of friends includes any number of other attractive, smart women who have spent substantial periods of time single — not just not in a steady relationship, but not even dating anybody casually. (I can think of one who spent, I think, most of a year single in San Francisco. She has a steady girlfriend now.)<p>On the other hand, I've also experienced the case where someone I wanted to date (beautiful and smart) was single for only a week or two, and I was too late in finding out. Amazingly, this happened during the six weeks when I myself was single! I'm sure glad I didn't end up with her, though. Compatibility was pretty low.",1248333708

Although it's now 25 years since I took lectures from him, and more recent contact has been purely social, I am always impressed and humbled by his breadth and depth of understanding, and his ability to make material approachable.  Understanding becomes your task - he has done everything possible.<p>Not everyone will like every part of this book, and it's not a book of study.
