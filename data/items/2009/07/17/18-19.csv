Back then, we had no character limit on our system. Messages longer than 160 characters (the common SMS carrier limit) were split into multiple texts and delivered (somewhat) sequentially. There were other bugs, and a mounting SMS bill. The team decided to place a limit on the number of characters that would go out via SMS for each post. They settled on 140, in order to leave room for the username and the colon in front of the message.""<p><a href=""http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born...</a>",1247856978

If the government were to pass a law saying ""Newspapers should not print any op-eds critical of the government"", for example, <i>then</i> it becomes a first amendment issue and the newspaper can sue for the right to print such things.  (Which has happened, BTW.)  But if the newspaper decides on its own not to print such op-eds, it's perfectly within its rights and there's no first amendment issue.<p>Similarly, the government can pass a law allowing copyright holders to protect their intellectual property - say, the DMCA.  But it's then up to the copyright holders to bring lawsuits against people who publish their work - the government can't force them to do so, and they're completely within their rights to release their work under the GPL or Creative Commons.  No free speech issue - it's a property issue.<p>IANAL, but listen to the law student above.  His comments basically square with my understanding from lawyer friends and civics classes and occasional reading of court cases.<p>From a political philosophy perspective, you could look at it as libertarianism vs. anarchy.  The libertarian POV is ""You can do anything you want, <i>as long as it hurts no-one</i>.""  The anarchist POV is ""You can do anything you want.""  The Bill of Rights is intended to protect libertarian ideals, not anarchist ones.
