Hopefully things will change, but when I compare the experience of gathering 10,000 users on Android in a single release after an hour, with waiting for Apples blessing for weeks and weeks, I'll take the former, thanks.<p>The nail on the head issue is this: Apple are making buck$ from all this.  They don't care a damn.  Android, well .. Google may have its nefarious plans for us all, data-wise, but at least I have a lot more control, as a developer, over what happens.  And frankly, I think the feedback cycle with Android users has been a much more positive one than with the iPhone crowd.<p>I sure hope Apple loosen up a little, though I won't be counting on it.  I'll just focus on Android as my primary platform for now.  Its better for me, and better for my users: and thats what really matters.",1247817429

Did they think that the instructor would act noticeably different?  Or, did they think that for some reason the several month experience would develop more than perception, and actual knowledge?<p>Now, for a more interesting study, I'd be interested in seeing how well the student's perception correlated to a professional psychological profile, analytical review, and other _objective_ measurements of the teacher.",1247817378

In computing, the technological enabler of disruption in computing was the microprocessor. It so simplified the design of a computer that Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs could just slap one together in a garage. It transformed the industry’s fundamental technological problem—the design of a computer—from a problem that took hundreds of people several years to solve into one that was much simpler.</i><p><i>Then that simplifying technology had to be married with a business model that could take the technology into the market in a cost-effective and convenient way. Digital Equipment Corp. had microprocessor technology, but its business model could not profitably sell a computer for less than $50,000. The technology trapped in a high-cost business model had no impact on the world, and in fact, the world ultimately killed Digital. But IBM Corp., with the very same processors at its disposal, set up a different business model in Florida that could make money at a $2,000 price point and 20% gross margins—and changed the world. It’s a combination of the technology and business model that makes formerly complicated, expensive, inaccessible things affordable and accessible.</i><p><a href=""http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache%3Asloanreview.mit.edu%2Fthe-magazine%2Farticles%2F2009%2Fspring%2F50314%2Fgood-days-for-disruptors%2F+%22every%20disruption%20has%20three%20components%20to%20it%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache%3Asloanreview.mit.edu%2...</a>",1247815283

Your browser could easily have a ""no animations"" mode, or selectively disable certain animation types.  Browsers can implement animations much more efficiently if they don't have to call Javascript every frame, and they can also separate animation from whatever else the page is doing; animations could be slowed or stopped in background tabs or low-battery situations while the page's Javascript continues running.",1247814914

According to Rich Hickey, this is actually an artifact caused by the way the byte code is generated. The purpose of this code is to null out the arguments to prevent 'holding the head' in case of a recursive function call. Because of the way the byte code is generated, the decompiler can't accurately know when the nulling out takes place; it is definitely not happening at the beginning of the method.</i><p>This seems wrong to me.
