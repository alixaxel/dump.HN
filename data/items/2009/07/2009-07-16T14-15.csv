Then instead of charging a monthly fee include our distributed system in the game. When people are playing the game it generates some data (designed not to hog the CPU ofc) and sends it back - this ""pays"" for their play time.<p>The extension could be to get them to generate data when not playing the game and this could add up to give them ""in game"" credit for items and VIP treatment.<p>If I get the balance right (i.e. just creating some data but not affecting their computer use) do you think it would go down well?

Just like if you went to a bookstore and picked up 10 random fantasy novels.  You might conclude that they're all just cookie cutter pablum - most are - but then you miss out on George R. R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice, Guy Gavriel Kay's Tigana, LeGuin's Earthsea, and other truly excellent works of fiction.<p>But like anything, it takes some investment to tell the good from the bad.  If you just watch Jon & Kate Plus 8, Entertainment Tonight, and According to Jim, yeah, you're better off without the TV altogether.  But I claim that there's more good TV being made now than at any time in history, particularly for niche markets.<p>Here's some of my recommendations: Mythbusters, Penn & Teller's Bullshit, Supernatural, Dollhouse, The Office, 30 Rock, Lost, The Simpsons (not as great as it was, but still fun), The Daily Show/Colbert Report, Mad Men... and more, there's just a ton of really high quality work being done.<p>If your argument is that instead, you watch things online/through netflix, that makes sense.  If I didn't enjoy live sports sometimes, I'd consider doing the same.<p>Not everyone has to have a hobby of watching television, or movies, or reading for that matter, but the opinion that it's all crap is extremely ill-informed and snobbish, and I strongly encourage it to be dropped as something that makes you sound actively stupid when you say it.  It's an anti-pattern.",1247754109
