687820,comment,686840,687086,0,0,timf,,,"Sure, squint hard enough and it's the ""precisely the same.""  Being in a virtualization/utility-computing job for the last five years, I've heard this kind of quip over and over and I agree with it on the surface but it's true only in the most general ways.<p>I guess I was not specific enough above with simply saying ""remote virtual machines.""  With a credit card almost anyone can rent thousands of machines programatically (with redundancy across multiple datacenters if you want) and be using them in minutes.  And make them go away just as quickly.  And construct the VMs themselves programatically or by hand on a laptop.  And the people renting out the hardware don't need to even trust you.  All of this is a new development that changes the way business is done.  Like I said above, you can say everything is ""just"" logic gates plus electricity and claim <i>nothing</i> new ever happens (and I'll agree with you, too, I just won't think the conversation is going anywhere interesting).",1246758549

I didn't make significant progress beyond writing toy OCaml \nand was experiencing some serious culture-shock in my first foray into the functional programming world. After some floundering it became clear that I needed a better introduction to the functional programming mind-set. Purchasing SICP turned out to be an excellent decision.",1246758245

That solution is simply to let any and every qualified person into the country -- indeed court their attention and residence.  Anything else is selfish, chauvinist myopia.",1246758128

And the unique identification number project might not change anything when it comes to illegal immigrants, terrorists.<p>However as the article highlights this would give me one power for which I am okay to bear the grunt of privacy issues: I can (at least proactively) ensure my identity is not misused & if it is, I can at least be aware of it - stop it & probably dig in more.<p>Right now I have a ration card which is particularly necessary to get a cooking gas connection (which btw is of scarce availability - again corruption). There might be a person living at my native or hometown who is aware I am not availing the facility and probably using a duplicate card or something. There is no system to quickly check if this is happening. With the new initiative I hope it would be difficult to duplicate & easy to track. At the least these processes will get digitized the right way, given Nilekani is heading it & not yet another uneducated/ corrupt politician.<p>Edit: phrase correction.",1246757904

687803,comment,687303,687303,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"If you're in business and finance, then you already know about the miracle of compound interest.  Take at least $50K of your money ($75K would be better) and put it into any sort of interest-bearing account - stocks, bonds, government-backed securities, anything that pays a pretty good interest rate without being overly risky.<p>At 6% interest, your $50K makes you $1.6 million in 48 years.  Considering that that interest rate is on the low end of the spectrum, you should be able to do much better.  Just treat the money as if it isn't there, and you have a guaranteed retirement in the future when you'll need it.  From there, you can simply take as many entrepreneurial risks during your productive career as you'd like w/o having to worry about catastrophic failure.  Good luck!",1246756680

Seems like you would be better served letting the money work for you in the stock market while figuring out ways to self-fund with current earnings or outside investors.

687797,comment,687267,687267,0,0,duairc,,,"I use Linux exclusively. I did try OS X before (I have an iBook), but I just couldn't get into it. Linux users trying OS X have already commented on problems with window managers etc, so I won't repeat what they've said.<p>The real thing is that I just can't stand about OS X though isn't about practical like not being able to get a certain application or type of application working or anything like that (I do generally prefer the applications I use on Linux to their OS X counterparts though). It's simply that it's non-free, and the whole ecosystem of software for it is generally non-free. I know lots of Mac users and this doesn't seem to bug them or occur to them at all.<p>When I first turned on my iBook, I have to tell it more than once ""no, I don't want a .Mac account"". When I start iTunes, and possibly other applications (I just remember iTunes specifically), I have to click ""I agree"" to a license agreement. There are lots of really trivial bits of software which you'd get with `sudo apt-get install x` in Linux but the OS X equivalent is some sort of shareware crap... I found this to be particularly bad for tools that convert between file formats.<p>Am I just crazy or does this not bother anybody else that uses OS X?",1246756072

Saying something about the percentage of people in the world that have signed up, or the growth rate is okay, but the choice of where to live is pretty substantial compared to signing up for a website. It's not like other countries are losing citizens when somebody signs up for Facebook, and it's not like people are spending their entire lives on/in Facebook either.<p>Another intellectually dishonest number I hear Facebook recite is the number of developers. They get this number from the number of people who have installed the developer application. In the first year of the platform, that was 400,000. I know numerous friends who know nothing about programming that installed the developer application in that first week because they didn't know what they were doing. They recite this figure as if hundreds of thousands of people have devoted their lives to making Facebook applications. Sorry to burst someone's bubble, but it just ain't so.",1246756045
