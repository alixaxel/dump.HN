687790,comment,687587,687725,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I'd say the exact opposite. What is the point of replacing the conflicts with C++? Torvalds makes a very good case for not using C++ in the Linux kernel. At the very least, it seems like hiding memory allocation in kernel level code is a recipe for disaster. Of course, one could argue that you can use malloc in C++ just as well as in C, but then are you really writing C++? It seems as though you're writing C code  in C++. In fact, many of the language ""features"" that C++ offers seem to be Very Bad Ideas(TM) in the kernel.<p>In addition, as Linus responded earlier, anyone who has written a modicum of C code knows that you don't need the complex language features of C++ to write modular, object oriented code (in fact, I'd argue that C++ is a blight upon OO and should probably die a horrible death, but that's neither here nor there).<p>Most notably, however, is simply that it is not the Linux team's responsibility to defend their use of C over C++ -- given the amount of code that must be adapted, it is more appropriate for the C++ devs to argue what heavy benefits <i>C++</i> has in its favor (such that they merit the transformation of a complex and significantly large body of code).<p>I would actually say the C++ dev's view is more political than technical: advocating the switch to C++ ""just because,"" implies a political (or religious) reasoning, while the Linux team's view seems much more technical.",1246755440

Google ostensibly hires all of the ""best talent"" in the industry, yet what do you see of it?<p>If the government takes on some policy of allowing the world's ""best and brightest"" to immigrate, you're not necessarily getting the people who would have produced the most value. Instead you'll get people who have tons of qualifications and degrees.<p>Let's say France had this same immigration idea back in 1980. Would Bill Gates have been considered one of the brightest and greatest and allowed in? No. Would Larry Ellison? No. Would Steve Jobs? No. It's next to impossible to pick out the true people who provide value before the deed is done.",1246754898

I'm actually impressed with how well Linux on the desktop has matured over the past few years (I experimented with Ubuntu in late 2005 and it was nowhere near as refined as it is today), moreover, how easy it was to get everything working as seamlessly as it did on the Mac.<p>Granted, in terms of user interface (among other things), OS X is far superior to Gnome; however, aside from the gorgeous design of Aqua, in terms of actual day-to-day usability, they are pretty much on par with each other (at least as far as I'm concerned).",1246754370
687774,comment,687587,687587,0,0,tptacek,,,"There already are projects that run C++ code in the Linux kernel; the Click Modular Router from MIT PDOS is C++, for instance. It's probably prohibitively annoying to write mainline kernel code, like a device driver, in C++. There might not be anything to prevent you from loading a whole C++ subsystem, though.<p>I'll head some other commenters off at the past and note that MacOS X xnu has a C++ device driver interface, but is still a C-code kernel.<p>Linus is right about the exception handling and allocator issues. C++ exceptions are a misfeature in userland code; it's even more important for kernel code to be able to handle problems gracefully and explicitly, and unwinding stacks through functions running at different interrupt sensitivities and holding different locks seems like an disaster waiting to happen. And, unless my C++ has gotten rusty since Alexandrescu's book came out, nobody likes the C++ allocator interfaces --- which you'd certainly have to dive into to handle the kernel's various different allocation strategies.",1246754313

Our team had 39 people including 1 of the CEOs.  We did quite a few ""physical games"" to build team skills, trust, and overcome personal barriers, including firewalking.  One of the games was climbing a 50 foot ladder and jumping off (tethered, of course) to catch a trapeze.  38 people did it.  The CEO could not.  He climbed halfway up the ladder, started crying, and climbed down.<p>It was stunning and a little embarrassing.  We had been deferring to this guy for 4 days and there he was in front of us, totally exposed, probably for the first time in years.<p>There were many guesses about what had happened; I never really found out.

It makes our industry look like a bunch of circle jerking asshats.  Basically silly product gets built, silly product goes to silly bloggers, and spammy retweets/reblogs get made.  How is that building any value besides getting someone to try your service then leave it?  People overdo this launch concept.  They get one day of blanketed coverage and think that they have made themselves into a huge brand that the PR Gods love. Um, what happens a week later when your traffic dives off?<p>Get a simple product out there, come to a niche community to get some basic users to kick the tires, and then just have a final release version.  Build a good product, iterate, build more value, charge, and these amazing things will happen:<p>a) People will pay you\nb) People will talk about you\nc) Press will talk about you<p>Pay all the press, bloggers, or God knows what to tweetlogzinepaper it up, and with utter shit you'll just have wasted bandwidth and a depressing retention rate.
