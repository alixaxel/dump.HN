735484,comment,735270,735270,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You seem obsessed with this topic, but I question the quality of your sources and analysis. Of course if there were an exponential rise in money supply or similar absent a different fiscal, monetary and regulatory climate then this would be deeply alarming. But I feel you're making a meta-version of the same mistake many economists did, of over-extrapolating from a short trend. Massive policy changes inevitably result in discontinuities of quantitative data, so it's a mistake to apply the trend which obtained up to the discontinuity to the new discontinuity.<p>To take an oft-used metaphor, suppose the economy is a car or truck and money supply is one part of the steering system. If you notice you're heading for a crash, well you're going to spin the wheel hard or slam on the brakes - there's your discontinuity. The path of the car, on the other hand (which is GDP), will change more slowly. And once you've observed that the new course takes you out of immediate danger, you can then moderate the control system which you had drastically changed. In other words, slamming on the brakes (or accelerating out of danger, or swerving - adjust your metaphor to taste) does not <i>in itself</i> damage the car, but aims to substantially alter its vector.<p>In the bigger picture, addressing the question of whether the US economy will be in the toilet or at least near to it for years to come, of course it will. Just as the unpleasant effects of a hangover can often go on longer than the drinking party which induced it, so it will take time to unwind and recover from the serious structural imbalances of recent years. Obviously, I have a more sanguine view of this process than you do, as I believe it will still be possible for opportunity and growth to take place in the US. If you find my view dangerously laid-back, I guess the appropriate thing for you would be to invest heavily in defense contractors and raw materials.",1249077497

Byte order is undefined.  Structure layout is mostly undefined -- you pick field order, but you can't choose packing, alignment, or padding rules.  The sizes of the integer types vary by platform and compiler.  Bit field layout, packing, and alignment are almost completely undefined.<p>What you're left to work with are unsigned characters, pointers, and bitwise operations.  You have to pack and unpack everything manually, or your code won't port.

735445,comment,734380,734717,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Calm down, folks.  Just words, and I think we all understood what he meant by ""chord"".  There is a technically correct term for two notes played simultaneously (double stop also works for stringed instruments):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music)</a><p>Of course, his instrument included a hundred or more voices, and several of them were on different octaves.  So, I think one can say this was a ""chord"" by the general definition of ""three or more notes from a key played simultaneously"".<p>And, musicians do frequently refer to dyads as chords, as long as the third is there.  The fifth has less harmonic weight (and never changes from major to minor) and the whole chord can be implied with just the first and the third.  While pianists may mostly always have easy access to the fifth, stringed instrument players generally think of the fifth as the note you drop when you can't pick them all up.",1249076339

Replacing RAM on a Mac laptop does not void the warranty, and now replacing the HD is pretty easy, too (compared to the older MacBook Pro I have, which requires disassembling almost the entire thing).

(Note on one of the batteries mentions that it sticks out the back of the computer.)<p>So I take back the implication that the t400 is not well designed.  ThinkPads have a good reputation for hardware design, which I assume is well earned (have not owned one myself).  The same cannot be said for all PC laptops.  And software is a whole other matter altogether, of course.<p>As for customization, Apple deliberately restricts the options for customization relative to other vendors.

Then, instead of OS-and-apps, you do editor-and-extensions, applying your wikiable-app stuff to the extensions.<p>Or, instead of an in-browser code editor extensible with a web ecology of C#, do a similarly extensible email/groupware app. Or a collaboration space a la Sharepoint/Clearspace.<p>Or hell, do HyperCard.
