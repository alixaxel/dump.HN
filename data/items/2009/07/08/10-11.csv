They might also be dropping X11 as they go, but the article doesn't give that away.<p>This might actually work for netbooks that are mostly used as a fullscreen browser. But I don't see this making any significant inroads on bigger laptops or desktops in the foreseeable future. The technology behind ""the web"" just isn't up to the task. Wrong tool for the job.<p>The problems begin on such a basic level that I find it ridiculous someone with the engineering muscle of google is even considering this.<p>How basic?  Well, we don't even have a <i>Socket</i> on this soon-to-be-an-OS platform. That basic. Admittedly it should be relatively simple to add and <i>hopefully</i> the one outcome of this project will be that Websocket finally gains traction (across all browsers).<p>But it doesn't stop there. The HTML/JS combo is lacking severely in many areas relevant to RIAs. People still have to reinvent basic widgets like comboboxes, datepickers, auto-completion, richtext input, sliders etc. in javascript. CSS is still a nightmare even for simple layouts. Will google fix these problems and break compatibility to other browsers?  Don't think so.<p>So here's what I think they'll deliver: A mangled linux distro with chrome running fullscreen, likely even on top of X11. It'll have a fancy start-page that wants to log you into the google universe first. There will be some flashy widgets and a fancy javascript framework for the windowing - but overall it will just be a fullscreen browser with all its problems.<p>I hope they surprise me and do better. Because if <i>this</i> is their plan then I think it's time to sell some of those GOOG shares. Google never needed to hype their products upfront thus far. In that light this is a worrying announcement.",1247050633

693669,comment,692291,693204,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""In most cases, such similarity evolves from having overbroad generalizations and/or squinting from various angles till some vague similarity is seen.""<p>Yes -- you are absolutely correct.<p>To be specific: agile is incremental, iterative development, emphasizing the social aspect instead of the process measurement aspect of technology development. Agile is also a marketing term and not a branded, concrete system of anything. People have books on agile everything. Because of that, it can best be thought of as an ideal that teams strive to reach.<p>This means that there is no ""pure"" agile team. Instead you are looking for agile aspects of a team -- which means that most high-performing teams are going to have some. Agile best practices are simply those practices which most teams will naturally evolve over time. You can pick them up and save yourself some evolution.<p>""Most of the agile ""gurus"" can't code for nuts.""<p>A lot of them haven't coded in years, if ever. They're professional teachers, or book writers, or ""celebrities"". I'm working now with a large corporation as an agile coach (I code regularly) and we've got a couple of guys who are hard-core TDD zealots. Problem is, none of them have coded a real honest-to-god production system in the last five or ten years. One guy has never coded. Yet they're the first ones to tell other teams what they need to do to improve. They read a book or attend a seminar (usually by some other guy who hasn't coded in years) and suddenly they know what everybody else should be doing. That's not saying that TDD won't work -- it's saying that to help a team you really need to be actively working on a team and not be a wonk. I remain dubious of TDD, but that's me.<p>Beware of well meaning teachers and non-hackers who start getting the agile religion.",1247050447

In it's current state, there is really no way to compare Chrome and Chromium and claim they represent the same kind of polished product.

I took a short detour by Opera, before Firefox 3.5 became usable, and I was back where I started.<p>If I were  going to make a web OS, even for netbooks, I would rather have it use Firefox 3.5 as performance is much more predictable and reliable, not to mention it can be extended with addons, something I would consider a minimum for any platform.",1247048134

While what used to be butt ugly font-rendering has gotten better, at least to the point of readable, as far as I can tell there is still no plugin support.<p>The only way you can fully configure the browser is still trough running gconf-editor for some parts, and configuring Firefox and then importing settings from there.<p>That being said, my biggest issue with the current chromium builds is that performance is truly <i>horrible</i> and majorly unstable. Sometimes things just works, snappy, as expected. But in more than 50% of the cases when opening a new page the entire <i>browser</i> locks, for what can be periods of up to 5 to 10 seconds. Wasn't process isolation supposed to fix this?<p>If this browser is going to be the ""OS"" for the web, in it's current state its closest equivalent would be Windows 3.11.<p>IMO Firefox 3.5 is a much better browser, while peak performance being somewhat slower, at least it performs predictably.",1247047738

You don't have to use it if you don't like the advertising component, but they are providing much more than redirects of unregistered domains.
