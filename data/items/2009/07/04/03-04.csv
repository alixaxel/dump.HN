686881,comment,686840,686840,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"The UNIX point really resonates with me. I'm writing this post from Haiku (<a href=""http://haiku-os.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haiku-os.org</a>), and it sometimes saddens me to see that a lot of energy is spent on POSIX compatibility (Haiku is not UNIX, but there's a compatibility layer that allows trivial POSIX software to compile with very few changes, and makes porting larger pieces of software possible).<p>This, of course, has to be done. Otherwise there will be a whole bunch of software future Haiku users will miss out on, and a whole bunch of trivial software the developers would have to rewrite from scratch. Oh, and then it would take way too much effort to port Perl, Python, Ruby, Vim ...<p>These days, ""portable software"" pretty much means ""targets POSIX"".",1246679705

Irrespective of how many people actually cared about the man or his music, he was somebody that everybody knew of. Similar with Princess Diana's death - even people who didn't care about her rang around their friends saying ""Did you hear... ?""",1246679528

If Singularity were released under a non-tainting license, Renraku likely would be a distribution of it rather than an OS unto itself.

686861,comment,686853,686853,0,0,daeken,,,"I wasn't speaking in terms of actual relations (since files are a subclass of objects in my mind), but in terms of what inspired me.<p>That said, I disagree that files are a more powerful refinement.  So much of our code is spent converting to and from files, it's a curse more than a blessing.  The only really powerful thing about files is that there are tools on our current systems to manipulate them, but I don't think that has to stay that way.  Why can't we grep over a collection object from the command line like we do with a file now?  Why can't we have good network-transparent objects (a key feature in Renraku)?<p>The file paradigm in general is tired, in my opinion.  Streams just aren't a good mapping for the way we handle data.",1246678140

686853,comment,686853,686847,0,0,uriel,,,"> for example, the 'everything is an object' paradigm is really a natural extension of Plan 9's 'everything is a file' paradigm.<p>I used to think that way long ago, over time I realized that it is the inverse: 'everything is a file' is an extension and very powerful refinement of the 'everything is an object paradigm.<p>What makes file based interfaces so powerful is that they provide an uniform and almost universal framework for representing any kind of resources. The constrains that this imposes are <i>very useful</i> both technically (eg for uniform caching, remote access, proxying, filtering, namespaces, ...) and as a way to narrowly focus the mind when designing interfaces.",1246677477

686851,comment,686034,686601,0,0,anamax,,,"Pre-natal we can apply selection, changing the initial population.  However, the effect of that on survival is complicated.<p>Post-natal changes aren't inheritable.  They can merely be applied to subsequent generations, which is not really evolution.  These changes may affect survival, which can have a second order effect on genotype, but that's tricky and subtle.  (If a culture cuts off foreskins for thousands of generations, will boys evolve to not have them at birth?  By cutting them off, the population gets no benefit from having them, but there's no cost to being born with them.)",1246677364

686848,comment,686802,686845,0,0,daeken,,,"Managed code ensures things like buffer overflows are a thing of the past, so long as your compiler is secure.  It doesn't prevent against the design flaws that often lead to security breaches, but it's a start.  I'll take securing a compiler and design over securing hundreds of millions of lines of code, though, any day of the week.<p>Edit:  As for codecs and such, this is why I like my object store idea.  Your codec class would encode to a bitstream like now, but the entire class would be there on disk.  You could send the whole object across the wire and so long as they are using the same ICodec (or whatever) interface, it Just Works (TM).",1246676677

By doing so, you reduce the attack surface to a tiny amount of code and make it easier to develop.<p>That said, Inferno was way ahead of its time, and quite a few of the ideas in my system are based on ideas from it and Plan 9 itself; for example, the 'everything is an object' paradigm is really a natural extension of Plan 9's 'everything is a file' paradigm.",1246676553

686845,comment,686802,686802,0,0,profquail,,,"I saw a news article today from about a month ago, saying that Microsoft had decided to release the .NET Micro Framework SDK and porting kit for free (it's available for download now, I checked). I've been wondering for a while why people don't use it (or something similar) to write device drivers; it seems to me like that would go a long way towards making a system rock-solid.<p>Also, one good thing about a properly written, all-managed system is security. Assuming that the underlying OS is bug-free (a huge assumption, I know), would there be any way to exploit such a system remotely?<p>One other cool feature I thought of would be to implement some base classes for things like images, sounds, and movies, then implement various codecs and file formats using formatters and such in the System.Runtime.Serialization namespace. Thus, it'd be pretty easy to add support for a new codec or file format, since the codec class' assembly could just be copied to a special directory, then loaded via reflection.<p>A final note...think about how awesome it would be to have a full-featured, well-written managed OS. Since everything on top of it is also managed, it'd be very easy to port it to another platform (all you need to do is port the very fundamentals of the OS, and the CLR takes care of the rest!)",1246676519
