(You can't get <i>everything</i> tested the first time, but fixing bugs is much easier with tests)<p>* I can upgrade to a new version of a framework or library because when stuff breaks, I have a roadmap of what I need to change. I can then give a customer an accurate estimate of what it will take to do the work cos I KNOW what I have to fix.<p>You're doing it wrong if you write ALL your tests first. You write one, and you only write enough test to cover the feature you're implementing.  then you implement the code to make it pass. This iteration takes no significant time at all to an experienced programmer, and automated tools can run in the background, monitoring your code for changes and only running the tests your code impacts. Because we're programmers, and we know how to write code that does that.<p>You think this is a joke? Something to be ignored? Go ask a CPA (accountant) how they do the books.<p>They sure don't just do the math once and say ""trust me I'm really just that good.""  They balance the books. Dual-entry accounting. They do this because they are disciplined professionals. And people pay big money to accountants to get that right. Your tests shouldn't exist to exist, they should prove your code does what you want. Checks and balances.<p>Of course the path to this is the same path one takes to learn a new language. It will be slow to start. It was for me, but really, it's such a huge win for my long-term productivity. I am happier, my clients are happier.<p>Really, what's not to like?",1247723679

707398,comment,707263,707263,0,0,seldo,,,"This seems hare-brained on a number of levels.<p>Firstly, a hurricane involves an absolutely phenomenal amount of energy and area. The typical hurricane is 300 miles wide, covering an area of 280,000 square miles. Even the core (100 miles wide) is 30,000 square miles. How big are these tubs? How much of that area are you going to cover? How many of these things do you need to do that?<p>The idea goes even further off the rails when they start discussing non-hurricane uses, in two paragraphs saying the tubs ""could stir up nutrient-rich sediment on ocean floors to promote plant and animal growth in environmentally-degraded areas"" but then also ""moving nutrients and other material from the ocean floor to the surface to promote growth of algae to trap carbon as a tool in fighting global warming.""<p>Stirring up muck from the bottom is either going to feed fish (unlikely) or promote huge algal blooms (much more likely).

You don't have to worry about losing it.<p>Assuming that your site existed before theirs, they MAY be found to be infringing. Emphasis on ""may"" because you don't have a copyright on ideas, only on the expression of the ideas, and it has been ruled that the ""look"" of a site isn't protected. So, for a court to rule that the they are infringing, it will have to find that significant portions of the copy, code, or presentation must be a near duplicate.<p>I haven't viewed the two source files or CSS, so I can't even an opinion on the significance of the replication in this case.<p>Regardless, there are several reasons why pursuing this in court may not be a good idea. First, your copyright isn't registered, so you have the burden of proving that your site existed first. To do this you'll have to meet with  an attorney several times, file to have their ISP provide evidence that you will need to prove you case, suffer through the other side's discovery, depositions, etc. Basically, it will waste a lot of time. Second, even if you win you will have to show that you suffered some loss due to the infringement, and any monetary award will be based that loss. You're loss would likely be found to be the percentage of their revenue derived from infringing on your copyright. It appears that in this case, that would be negligible.<p>All this being said, it wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer write a cease and desist letter, and another if necessary. At the very least, that will force them to reword there sales copy, and rework their markup.",1247722684

For a site serving 13 million pageviews per month (80% of them are <i>uncachable</i> searches) we use 2 servers with about the same configuration (same memory, cpus). The database server has an average load of 1 and the application server (that is serving a bunch of other sites as well) is under 2 most of the day.<p>We have 1/2 of their capacity running an equally heavy site (all sites running on those servers make up 16-18 million pageviews per month).  So if they run on 1/10 of similar sites, we run on 1/2 of their 1/10. Even better we pay 100% percent less of what they are paying. I wonder how smart Atwood is.<p>I don't intend to be a smart ass here. I would never say ""Hey we run with 1/10 of your capacity, you are stupid"" because performance heavily depends on the application. StackOverflow probably has a 90% cache hit ratio (86% of visitors are from google that land on some question asked some days or months ago). So 3 servers for a cache and forget site (logins and bits for pages that change often can be cached too) serving 16M pageviews per month is below average. They maybe doing a whole lot of other things in the backend that we don't know of , but the same goes for the other sites that ""their programmers are stupid and use 10x hardware.""<p>I would expect them to say what problems they solved and how instead of bragging about how awesome programmers they (he?) are.",1247721545

They happen when the money supply increases faster than the relevant function of wealth and ""velocity"".<p>> When the fed lowers interest rates they in effect increase the money supply through the expansion of bank credit which is the primary means by which money is introduced into the economy.<p>""the primary means""?  The fed discount rate isn't that effective at affecting the money supply; it has a marginal effect.  If it was an effective means, they'd have used it.  Instead, they're printing money.",1247721273

IBM has not even remotely abandoned its propriety software business model. They contribute to numerous open-source projects, but most of their products are still proprietary closed source (some with quite high prices).<p>2. Regarding CCHIT, less than a third of work group volunteers work for vendors (I am one of those few). The majority of participants work for health care provider organizations, and a lot of them are actually physicians. All of the member lists are available on the web site.

While some stakeholders would have liked to see much more strict and comprehensive certification requirements, that would have been pointless since no one would have been able to pass. The approach CCHIT is taking is to gradually ratchet up the requirements in each new certification cycle. The next round of EHR certification will at least include some usability testing.<p>3. VistA is a nice product in some ways, but since it was designed specifically for use in the VA it doesn't necessarily integrate well into other environments.

It's open source so in theory it can be be customized but consultants capable of actually doing that don't come cheap. So proprietary, closed-source solutions often end up being cheaper and delivering superior functionality. Furthermore, VistA is a client / server application whereas the modern trend is toward web applications.",1247721177

707326,comment,707228,707258,0,0,imajes,,,"Joe,<p>You use ""will"" in your third paragraph a lot. Lawyers don't generally take cases for nothing just because a win is almost guaranteed (especially not over copyright). They take cases pro bono when they either expect to get massive publicity or massive payout. (i.e. the ambulance chasers exist because they are almost always suing insurance companies who settle)<p>You also state that the company will pay costs + damages. Again, the judge can rule that they must, but it's incredibly hard to enforce. Looking at the names of the founders, at <i>first guess</i> i don't believe they are in the US. So to start, you'd have to do searches of various company databases to find where to even file papers. It's non trivial and will add up.<p>OP: remember, whilst you may have a very solid case to win an infringement, remember the old adage: ""never sue someone who cannot pay"". You may, however, be able to get a c&d out pretty cheaply, and this sometimes shuts people down fast enough when it's obvious there is infringement.",1247721010
