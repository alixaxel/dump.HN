683327,comment,683148,683148,0,0,pmichaud,,,"I really don't think the journal model works well anymore.<p>It used to be that distributing papers was burdensome, so they compiled them into journals and professionals paid for a subscription. Built into the cost was peer review -- they couldn't just publish ALL the articles, because there was limited space, so they had to have professional reviewers filter out all but the ""best.""<p>So now that distribution has been solved, the only value-add that a journal can claim is that filtering process, which ostensibly is costly.<p>It all hinges on the question of whether peer review can happen without compensation. I think it's pretty well-established now that peer review without compensation happens constantly. Welcome to the internet, right?<p>So the correct new model is something like a digg/HN system that aggregates articles from various fields, and allows peers to review, respond to, and upvote important papers. I think it'd need to be more complex because of voter credibility concerns, but it seems workable. I can't say the same for the current journal model.",1246481042

683324,comment,682913,682913,0,0,Spyckie,,,"This observed pattern can be described by personality typing. I like to think of it as 2 classifications of how our brain explores - depth-based vs breadth-based search. Problem solving vs random walk. Directed vs discovered. Convergent vs divergent, etc. Essentially, one type enjoys digger deeper (defined by getting closer towards a goal) into a topic, while another enjoys expanding outward (exploring a topic, no goal required).<p>The majority of people enjoy doing one type of thinking and hate doing the other, which causes this culture difference. Depending on the class of problems that a field has to tackle, the community may be dominant in one or the other. Mathematics is a field in which a random walk style of exploration can yield fascinating results, while an engineering field is much more likely to benefit from a focused approach. Usually, the type of thinking that yields more results becomes dominant in the community and gets the right to snub the other.<p>The difference and contention, I think, arises purely out of the dislike of doing the type of thinking that you're not naturally inclined to. This dislike is rooted in unfamiliarity and a strong sense of worth that parallels our inclinations. The contention is rarely settled by arguments of logic, efficiency or practicality - it is not that people don't believe in logic, but rather because the arguments don't address the core issue. The core issue is our natural inclinations, which at its roots, are innate or at least solidly ingrained in us by the end of childhood.",1246480843
683323,comment,682101,682101,0,0,Wheat,,,"Any popularity in Python over Ruby stems largely from the fact that Python came first.<p>I've heard Python developer's working on a Ruby on Rails application that the problem with Ruby is that approximately equivalent to Python in terms of productivity. They wanted to use Python, but pragmatically you can't make the case to management to switch from one language to the other if the other language is more or less the same. But most of the time this effect works the other way around, where Python was established before Ruby.<p>I was doing Perl in 1999, and looked at switching to Ruby or Python. Python was still quite small back then, but you had web frameworks (Zope, Twisted), albeit the incarnations back then are clunky by today's standards, but Python was establishing itself as a clean, readable, dynamic language. Ruby on the other hand had no web frameworks, and almost no documentation in English - the only reason I was considering it was because I was working with a Japanese localization team and they thought Ruby was quite hot.<p>The debate over which dynamic or scripting language to use was always between Perl and Python back then. Perl was the incumbent and Python the challenger, Ruby rarely factored into the picture. It wasn't until Rails started to become useable and gain attention in 2004 and 2005 that Ruby interest started to really blossom. And so Python was well established for many uses: scientific computing, ad-hoc data processing, network programming. If you're a development manager of an application that you want to make scriptable, you would have made the decision to already go with Python, there just isn't any compelling reason to switch to Ruby beyond the sake of switching.<p>Another example is IronPython versus IronRuby: work started on IronPython in 2003, work started on IronRuby in 2007. IronPython is at version 2.0, while IronRuby is at version 0.5, and this is reflected in the polish of these language implementations. A .Net developer might decide that they prefer the idiosyncracies of Ruby over Python's idiosyncracies, but if they had to start a large project in today, they'd most likely choose IronPython since there is much less risk of the project bumping up against the rough edges of IronPython versus IronRuby.",1246480820

I guess the rough idea is a ""what-to-do"" dating mashup, where the pool of possible daters is narrowed by interest in certain thematic events i.e. charitable stuff, jazz concertgoers, outdoorsy things etc.   I did a quick google search and couldnt really come up with anything that was doing this, and thought it might be a neat idea.  Comments/Refinements welcome.  Also, if anyone wants to work on this, I would be happy to collaborate with someone.",1246479006

This is expected.  We are still in a recession, and even when it ends those are lagging indicators so they are likely to remain bad even after the recession is over.  But the rate at which they decline (in other words, their second derivative) has lessened.  Also, many of the leading indicators (stock market, bond market) have stabilized.<p>I do not understand the relavence of your statement about guns and butter, and if this is so like 1929, how so?<p>I do not know what will end the recession, or even if something specifically needs to end it.  The economy is after all cyclic.  but you made a very strong and direct statement that we are heading for a depression.  Given that this is contradicted by most of the economic experts that are referenced in newspapers, do you have any stronger justification?",1246478907

I've dealt with more than one piece of software where the mailing list is filled with tons of unanswered questions from noobs because the interface or documentation is a mess.  You start out asking stupid questions yourself, and everybody ignores you and keeps talking about their high-level expert problems, and you think, ""What a bunch of assholes.""  Then after you figure out the answer yourself, the answer is so stupid and convoluted or just so depressingly retarded that you can't bring yourself to explain it to anybody else who runs into the same problem.<p>I wish developers would see chronic widespread noob frustration as a problem <i>with the software</i> that needs to be corrected <i>by the developers</i>.  There are always a few people who are willing to spend days experimenting and digging through your code before they can use your software.  Not only is it a poor piece of software that can only be used that way, it's extremely confusing, because <i>that's not the way things are done anymore!</i>   New users are going to waste many days struggling with the overly charitable assumption that your software has a logical, well-documented interface that they are on the verge of figuring out.  When they finally figure out that there <i>is</i> no coherent interface and the user manual should be prefaced with a directive to ""tinker for a week until you understand how it's implemented, then you'll know what's missing from this manual,"" they're going to be filled with hatred and rage and desire to kill you.  At this point, if I mentioned the piece of software I'm currently working with, it might legally constitute some kind of threat, so I'll just say that I'm pretty fed up and it's a good thing there's no dog, wife, or child at home that I might vent my rage on.",1246478501
