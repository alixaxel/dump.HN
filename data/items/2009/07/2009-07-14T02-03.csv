I think such a view is neither justified nor constructive.<p>Yes, there are some libertarians who naively, and incorrectly, believe they are the <i>de facto</i> owners of property in the US. That is, they would not even agree that USG actually owns all US property. However, I'm afraid I still don't see why you view USG's ownership as legitimate, unless you are equating <i>de facto</i> ownership with legitimate ownership -- i.e., you don't believe there is any difference between the two.<p>> USG's management structure is awful...<p>Agreed, of course.<p>> ...but it would also be in the interest of USG itself. Thus I view a management change as more likely to succeed and less likely to incite violence.<p>I'm not so sure about this. Yes, USG could be run more profitably, but severe agency problems exist. Would the leaders of the Catholic Church want their subjects to be told there is no God, even if these leaders were paid large sums of money? Power and influence are worth something to them as well.<p>> If a management structure is bad enough, an outside group could be morally justified ( though not legally justified) in trying to seize the territory itself. But that would be worst case.<p>I assume a group of subjects would also count as an ""outside group""? If we are using common legal principles, then for the reasons I mentioned earlier, I suggest they would be legally justified as well, even if this might not matter all that much in the real world.",1247539585

702968,comment,702713,702955,0,0,randomwalker,,,"RAM was not the issue. The reason for the slowness, as I understand it, is rather that different files are spread out in different areas of disk, even if they are in the same directory. This is considered a feature, and I guess it makes sense under normal access patterns. So accessing a million files (even to load them into memory for the first time) would require the same order of disk seeks, and takes forever. I might be simplifying a little bit, but this is my understanding.<p>Could I have re-written the code by messing around with inodes and other low-level details so that it accessed the files in physical order?
