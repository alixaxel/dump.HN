718947,comment,716110,717685,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I wholly disagree for video games, but then I worked as a reviewer so I admit my view is likely very skewed from the average consumer. Near identical games come out sometimes months apart in video games, but similar happens in the film industry with Armageddon appearing 2 months after Deep Impact in cinemas in '98.<p>The new Harry Potter was held off last year because the produces were afraid two competing fantasy series could kill each other near a Christmas recession. Twilight, which is basically swept up in the box office and with Harry Potter 6 due out literally like a week later and cost almost 7 times as much to make.<p>However cooincidences occur frequently with movies and games due to waiting for the right market attention. I mean a G.I. Joe movie or Transformers movie could have been made whenever, similar with a lot of movies, however it's been impossible up until late to make live action movies with quality animation.<p>I personally see little difference between a lot of video games and movies. I'm uninterested in 2012, because I already saw it with Knowing and its about as meaningful as a movie on the millennium bug would have been in 1997. Then there's the whole Bedtime Stories following Inkheart (Which was due out in March 2008, but was pulled back to December 12 at least in the UK), and Bedtime Stories looked like it was rushed into production following the sale of Inkhearts rights.<p>Again, I'm probably not the best person to ask as I had a movie pass at like 13 (the pass cost $20 a month, I easily got $40 worth of movies per weekend). So I'll say there is a need for hype in the movie and video game industry, however I still believe there's a big opportunity for companies to rush poor quality movies into production to steal the limelight from another. This is especially true when some movies can take 3 years to produce and others are done and finished in 9 months and may wait another 6 months for release, but if you group movies too closely you end up with two distinct groups of movies (like plays) Comedy or Tragedy and then all grouping is meaningless.",1248316523

Without it, I would continue to think I know derivatives because I learned twenty formulas and did forty exercises (which in fact every idiot could do).<p>I'll allow myself to give some advice for those who are interested in problem-solving, but have no experience. If you have some, then this should be well known.<p>* Keep problem / exercise ratio as high as possible. This is impossible with many calculus books; find a book with hard problems. An ""exercise"" is something which checks your understanding of definitions and theorems; a ""problem"" is something which exercises your skill and forces to think. Do exercises if the theory is unclear. If a task starts with ""using mathematical induction prove that..."" then it is an exercise. A problem forces you to think <i>how</i> to do it.<p>* Doing differentiation exercises will give you some speed, but after five-twenty minutes your brain will stop thinking and start to rot. Healthy mathematics - just like programming - hates doing the same thing again. Of course you have to learn some algorithms, but this is a tip of the iceberg.<p>* Always take 20 minutes (some say more) on a problem, unless you think it is ill-posed; giving up early is stupid. If you think the problem is impossible, try proving it. Think about some way of solving, reject it quickly if you made a thinko; if you sense ""this might work"" go deeper. Use paper.<p>* Don't read too much on philosophy of mathematics or biographies; this isn't deep from the mathematical side.

If asked, most people (including most historiand, political scientists, and politicians) would have said a collapse (if it happened at all) would probably take many decades.  Yet in a few short years it was accomplished, and all of a sudden there were a slew of new republics in its place.<p>Or look at the end of segregation.  Again, to large percentage of the US population at the time it seemed not only that segregation was the way things were, but that it was the way it was meant to be (with much more irrational and passionate attitudes against desegregation than even the anti-drug hysteria we have in the US today), and very few would have expected it to end so soon.  And yet all of a sudden there was a mass movement that resulted in desegregation within a decade (though a good argument could be made that the process still isn't complete today).<p>It is easy enough to find many other examples of fast, radical change throughout history.

Maybe products are a lot worse today than they were in 1989.<p>My point is that there's no clear and necessary reason that a comparison of 1987 product quality to 2009 product quality is a valid counterargument to the OP's assertion.  The only way it works is if you intend to argue that product quality has <i>risen</i> (or at least stayed constant), while the percentage produced domestically has <i>fallen</i>.  And if you're trying to argue that point, you've got to provide some evidence (something more than a quote from <i>Spaceballs</i>, anyway), or you're just begging the question.",1248315484

We know that they did $1.1ish Billion in revenues but profit figures may be much lower (I've heard as low as $50M pre-tax). My guess though is that Amazon's shipping chain will allow Zappos to lower their costs, increasing EBIT. Still though, does not seem like a cheap deal.<p>At least Amazon will be able to leverage the Zappos brand should they decide to expand more into Apparel. This would probably work out well in the long term.",1248315076

The point of this article is that men think they are going to fail, not because they are not attractive, but because <i>attractive girls must have so many other options</i>.<p>Therefore, it is somewhat independent of the man's assessment of his own attractiveness. This model is probably oversimplified, however, as self-confidence must play a role in there somewhere.",1248315002

For after all, digital music and softwares are just that : virtual goods.<p>I actually spent some real USD in Second Life to buy decent clothes. That was for corporate use, with the company credit card. I discovered at that time that Second Life was a cheap and efficient way to organise online meetings (very decent VOIP, and the 3d-sound is a killer for large groups), but definitely not easy-to-use / intuitive.<p>For my not yet public startup we are actually thinking of going the Virtual Goods way... though I personally would prefer just charging users to use the product. Maybe I'm a bit old-school... well, anyway, the priority is to release the product.",1248314945
