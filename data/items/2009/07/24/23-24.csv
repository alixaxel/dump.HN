722717,comment,722676,722676,0,0,mquander,,,"Many people might be familiar with this video, titled ""Don't Talk to the Police"" which is a two-part talk delivered by Regent University law professor James Duane and a Virginia Beach police officer:<p><a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8167533318153586646&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8167533318153586646&...</a><p>It discusses many of the same issues, citing one primary reason for not talking to the police as the tremendous, unknowable breadth of federal law and the fact that you can't possibly know what strange provisions you might be in breach of.  Professor Duane quotes Supreme Court Justice Breyer:<p>""The complexity of modern federal criminal law, codified in several thousand sections of the United States Code, and the virtually infinite variety of factual circumstances that might trigger an investigation into a possible violation of the law, make it difficult for anyone to know in advance just when a particular set of statements might later appear to a prosecutor to be relevant to some investigation.""<p>Duane memorably points out that it's illegal to be in possession of a lobster of a length that is too short under Honduran law, even ""if you acted in self-defense.""<p>I strongly recommend it as an extremely entertaining and informative talk to anyone who hasn't previously seen it.",1248479860

In this way, the book is <i>sui generis</i> - there is no other quite like it. It should be read for that reason alone.<p>The book was not intended to be a primarily technical economic textbook or to serve as a comment on social safety-net issues and shouldn't be evaluated as such.",1248479769
722713,comment,717167,720845,0,0,kragen,,,"Your claim was as follows:<p><i>What you were agreeing with is the proposition that people might starve, by implicitly claiming that some people in the United States already do starve. Where? Has anyone in the United States, and I mean anyone, actually died of a cause attributable to undernutrition caused by anything other than mental illness in the lifetime of anyone posting here? Who? There are people in the United States who cannot buy food out of their own family budgets, and there are children who are not well fed by their neglectful parents, but I don't think there is any adult who actually lacks enough food to live. Where is the example?</i><p>It's true that that's mostly phrased as questions. I didn't provide answers to the questions of ""who"" and ""where is the example"", but I was (and remain) outraged at your false assertion that ""there is [not] <i>any adult</i> who actually lacks enough food to live,"" and the accompanying questions. The total death rate from undernutrition in the US is somewhere around 20 people per day, if the WHO is to be believed.<p>I don't think there is any place where people can participate in economic exchange without government ""interference"". Maybe in Somalia and parts of Afghanistan and São Paulo, but I think it's more a question of the form of government than of its absence.<p>Amartya Sen argues that there has never been a famine in a democracy, regardless of climate or lack of agricultural advantages. For a while I thought perhaps the 2001 economic collapse in Argentina was a counterexample (read some Economist articles from 2001 and 2002) but since I've moved here, I've heard that although starvation was more widespread than normal, it didn't rise nearly to the level of a famine.<p>So I agree with your reduced claim: people in the US are not going to suffer a famine unless the country descends into open violence or despotism. Deaths from undernutrition are presumably rising, because the current economic collapse is hitting the poorest people hardest, just as it did here in Argentina. Some people, as pj speculated, will starve. But it's not going to be like the Great Leap Forward, or the regularly scheduled famines under the British Raj, or the famine from Ukrainian collectivization. Cancer and heart disease will probably still be the leading causes of death.",1248479680

722711,comment,722517,722690,0,0,philwelch,,,"Keep in mind you're getting one side of the picture from Hazlitt. Hazlitt's a libertarian--he thinks less government is better. So he's not very prone to give you much evidence that sometimes, governments can do desirable things, just because that's not his bias.<p>The best advice I can give you is to try and separate facts from judgments. Take the minimum wage. It's well understood that minimum wage laws cause unemployment. It doesn't <i>necessarily</i> follow from this that you don't need a minimum wage, though. Without a minimum wage, you might have twice as much unskilled labor working for half the pay, but all of them are below subsistence level and require government assistance. Whereas a higher minimum wage means some people can be dropped from the rolls entirely while others have to collect more. Or maybe you change the welfare system. It's a judgment call which tradeoffs you want to make, just like engineering. There are obvious things (command economies are pretty crap, just like bubble sort is a crap algorithm) but there are more subtle things (like time/space tradeoffs that dictate different algorithms for different applications) that depend on what you're trying to do.<p>Likewise, consider health care. Some people think it's a moral imperative that a wealthy society provide health care to everyone. Economics asks some tough questions--at what cost, what level of care do we provide--but it also provides answers--what are different ways of doing this, and what are the cost-benefits?<p>Economics at its best is a science. It doesn't dictate your goals to you, it just warns you of some natural constraints. You might say, ""I believe in minimal taxes and don't care about poor people who need housing and health care but can't afford it."" Well, economics tells you that's very feasible. You might say, ""I believe in minimal taxes and a robust welfare state."" Economics tells you there's no free lunch. You might say, ""I believe everyone should have health insurance that meets these requirements."" Well, economics says, you could give everyone health insurance, or you could have a market in health insurance and give people vouchers to pay for it, or do any other thing you can think of, but here are the effects and tradeoffs of those policies.<p>In terms of what in economics to study? Microeconomics seems better grounded than macro. Behavioral economics seems promising. Austrian is a mixed bag--there's some stuff that promotes good economic reasoning but then there's also gigantic apologias for anarcho-capitalism based upon some moralistic conception of natural law that totally mix up the science of causes and effects with the moral aspect of goals and intentions.<p>I find that separating causes and effects from goals and intentions is a big problem not only in economics but also in ecology. There's a difference between saying ""I want to sustainably maintain an environment that is good for human life"" and ""I want to preserve the environment mostly the way it is without human tampering"", and an environmental scientist will recommend different policies based upon which goal she implicitly has in mind. Maybe some endangered species can go extinct if there's a better tradeoff for humans, or maybe not. Likewise with economics: there's no such thing as ""economics says policy X is bad"", only ""economics says policy X has effects Y"".",1248479635

Apple has little benefit in allowing El-Cheapo Music System to sync with iTunes, but lots of potential downside (support calls, lowered image of Apple, people migrating away from the Apple ecosystem towards less profitable accessories, buggy integration that requires development and testing of software update workarounds).",1248479594

Politicians are especially serious offenders, possibly because even if they know better, solutions that are economically silly are often publicly popular. For example, the ""Cash for Clunkers"" car programs are not a good idea. Although this book was written years ago, the exact same boneheaded policies are implemented today, advanced by the exact same nonsensical arguments.<p>This book will make you very frustrated when you have to listen to politicians talk about economics. :-)",1248479536

Be sure to use some numbers and symbols and capital letters, too<p>Adding symbols to passwords is a huge inconvenience. Why? Because some of the sites that I use fairly regularly don't allow the characters. I end up having a first-class password and a second-class password for websites that are overly draconian. The last time I used Digg (2 years ago or so) it had this restriction, and that's the only site I feel comfortable about sharing ;). Some well-known companies who should know better have the same restriction.<p>It doesn't seem awful on the surface, but I also switch my password semi-regularly.

It's really an economy of scales issues. The large firms have the capital and the resources to: lease fiber lines, buy servers, and hire analysts/developers to build the systems required to be an efficient player in the market players. Many smaller firms simply employ the services offered by these institutions.<p>To reply to a previous point, the article is very biased and tells a small part of the story. Most of the noise in the media and in blogs today about HFT is very one-sided. The fact is that these HF proprietary trading systems which trade on behalf of the big wall st firms are competing against similar systems offered as ""algorithms"" to the Institutional investors. To use an example, a mutual fund manager will try to buy 100,000 shares of IBM. That fund manager will go to an investment bank and route his order through a VWAP Algorithm. That Algorithm may be competing in the market against the same investment bank's HFT Black Box trading app. These two ""Algos"" don't know about each other due to ""Chinese Wall"" restrictions.

I end up talking about similar problems I've worked on, suggest an interface and then in the end address the particular problem and what modifications of convex hull I think could be used to solve the original problem we were discussing including holes. Before I get into all that I want to point at this article on StackOverflow dealing with triangularization of a polygon with holes <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406301/polygon-triangulation-with-holes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406301/polygon-triangulat...</a> and point out the typical algorithm used in triangularization, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation</a> This paper also looks promising but I haven't read it : <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WG3-4BVPRY5-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=8cf8e1775c4672a08acda0eaab0ab695"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi...</a><p>This is relatively similar to the problem I worked on where a dose curve had to be decomposed into rectangles to minimize dose delivery time. A paper on shape rectangularization from my advisor that addresses this is here <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/t2555274j2k16641/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/t2555274j2k16641/</a> but I suspect other resources will be more immediately useful. The constraints were more interesting in terms of here is a patient represented as a set of voxels and here is the prescription and tolerance of each so improper decomposition could lead to exceeding tolerance of a critical structure, but I digress...<p>My understanding of this is that what you would like to have in your system is a data structure representing an arbitrary, complex polygon derived from the intersection of a set of rectangles such that the data structure can be queried with some rectangle and answer with another set of rectangles that indicates that the unpainted portion of the original rectangle. So something like :<p>PaintHistory{<p><pre><code>   //returns a polygon or set of rectangles indicating\n   //regions to be painted\n   Rectangle[] findUnpaintedSubregion(Rectangle); \n\n   //adds the given rectangle to the internal representation\n   //of the painted area\n   void paintRectangle(Rectangle); </code></pre>\n}<p>So, you would want to query findUnpaintedRectangle as fast as possible and receive your set of rectangles to pain which could then be added I assume you already have such an interface that you are currently backing with some naive scheme.<p>I think building such a structure could involve all kinds of clever data structures depending on your exact constraints. If the paint really ""blows up"" then it doesn't seem approximations are appropriate, but I am reminded of the barnes-hut algorithm (for computing the N-body problem, <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture26/lecture26.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267/lecture26/lecture26...</a> ) and its use of the quadtree data structure to divide up the plane <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree</a> , but I am not sure if that is useful in this particular case.<p>Originally, we were talking about the related problem of decomposing the intersection of a set of rectangles into a set of non-overlapping rectangles that completely cover the area covered by the original set of rectangles and no more. I think solving this problem efficiently (n log n) would suggest a data structure that could give more efficient real time querying.<p>""...This rules out computing the convex hull and then decomposing, because that would fill in any holes...""<p>I think all this means is that the convex hull is not sufficient in itself. If you have the points in the convex hull and a set of points representing each hole, then rectangularization should be easy because the convex hull should be rectilinear.<p>What about this algorithm :<p>1) Compute the set of points which are intersections of rectangles or their corner points. Here is a fast algorithm for this : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorit...</a><p>2) Compute the convex hull of these points to give a containing polygon.<p>3) Compute the set of all polygons that represent holes in the convex hull polygon. I think this is a well studied problem, but you can imagine a number of naive solutions and then optimize them. For example, any polygon representing such a hole must be composed of corner points or intersection points, which are in the set we already identified. Do a plane sweep in increasing x direction and parse through the source rectangles, discarding points covered by other rectangles and points on the convex hull. This could probably be done as a slight modification of step 1. Definitely a tricky part, but I think a solvable problem...<p>4) At this point you have a set of points representing the rectilinear polygon that is a convex hull and you have a set of points representing each rectilinear polygonal hole in the convex hull. So, now you just have to decompose this complex polygon into rectangles - I think if you just draw vertical and horizontal lines at each point and compute intersections, that should lead to a rectangularization with minimal cleanup and you are done.<p>I hope some of that is helpful, certainly not a link to a complete solution but all that comes to the top of my head now....",1248476623

We need an a priori model representation for that; the rarer the event, the more the dependence on aprorism.

Given that the less frequent the event, the more severe the consequence (just consider that the 100 year flood is more severe, and less frequent, than the 10 year flood), our estimation of the CONTRIBUTION of the rare event is going to be massively faulty (contribution is probability times effect; multiply that by estimation error) ; and nothing can remedy it. So the rarer the event, the less we know about its role --and the more we need to make it up with an extrapolative, generalizing theory.
