I went with the former, however I sometimes wish I had gone the other direction.<p>Soooooo.... The manual job for me would have been an Electrician. I have friends that chose this route and are doing very well for themselves now. Good pay, make your own hours, potential to start your own business, etc. Manual labor in my opinion is extremely underrated, especially when it comes to trade related work.  College is pushed so hard to high schoolers these days, that nobody considers alternative paths. Just like earning a college degree, I think you can lead a good life and possibly become extremely successful applying your skills to learning a trade.",1248454695

And, downvotes are a 'scarlet letter' of community disapproval, and cause comments to fade in color and sink in position. It is a status kick-in-the-groin.<p>And that's OK, for truly unwanted behavior.<p>But the right kind of disagreement is good, healthy, necessary and should be celebrated.<p>One option would be to have two axes of single-click vote-reaction. One is classic up-down promote/demote, for whether a comment has quality. The other would be left-right agree/disagree, a mini poll to capture sentiments.<p>Unless there is an easy outlet -- a click-region -- for sending a 'disagree' signal separate from the 'disapprove' downvote, it is inevitable the two will be conflated, causing angst and periodic threads like this one.<p>For previous discussion on this 'two-axis' concept, see:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=613112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=613112</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=214521"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=214521</a>",1248454181

As a developer, I find this much better than not knowing about the issue at all.  How many people receive thousands of E-mails for their thousands of downloads?

My Dad stopped before he got hurt and he eventually started his own trucking company. There is now a shortage of trained farriers.

It was by no means low-tech - we mastered the art of the the frozen margarita, one guest's mp3 player played a seemingly endless collection of grime and baile funk through the cottage stereo, and we had at least two laptops on hand (no wifi) - but the cottage wasn't connected to any information/communication networks.<p>It was absolute bliss.<p>The common assumption about time is that it passes quickly when you're having fun and drags when you're bored or frustrated. In this case, time passed slowly in a happy drift of relaxation.<p>It was uncanny: we would spend what felt like several hours jamming with available instruments (two guitars and a flute), only to discover that it was still mid-afternoon - with plenty of time for a leisurely swim off the dock - rather than deep into dinner time.<p>Over a period of a few days, I read a 900 page book and still managed to find time for dog walks, in-depth conversation, a long bike ride into town, a trip to a local farm, and so on.<p>What happened when I got back for a second week of day trips around our house is interesting: I just couldn't muster up any enthusiasm for my usual online haunts. Why read reddit when I could dig into the next book? Why update my Twitter profile when I would take a stroll down by the waterfront? Why bother catching up on over 300 emails when my son was eager to hear the next chapter of <i>The Hobbit</i>?<p>It was a few nagging responsibilities that got me back into the online swing, and as I reconnected, time seemed to speed up again to the usual blur of disconnected images and themes to which I was clearly accustomed before going away. I'm back to doing my usual activities, but like Aaron, I find it all feels strangely hollow - even this comment.<p>If I don't take some kind of tangible lifestyle decision out of this experience and the slow epiphany that ran through it, I fear it will have been for nothing.",1248451927

In particular there's no reason to expect the distribution of hitting times to be normal, and intuitively it seems like the distribution would be very far from normal.<p>I wrote a program and did ten thousand trials; the 100th largest hitting time was 5578, which is my estimate of the 99th percentile of the distribution, and thus the answer to the version of the original problem where we don't have to fix the number of coin flips ahead of time.<p>The median hitting time from my simulation is 152; the mean, 506, the standard deviation, 1155.  Yes, the standard deviation is larger than the mean!  The distribution has a very long right tail.<p>I'm fairly confident (in an informal sense) that the median of the true distribution is somewhere near 152, but I'm not confident about the mean or standard deviation.  A lot of distributions in problems like this have tails which decay only like power laws, which makes estimating the mean and standard deviation from a sample very difficult.
