We want things to have a narrative, and we are bad at determining if a theory merely fills our desire for a narrative. Starting from a known phenomenon and crafting a theory around what we know should happen has the danger of creating a model that is too specialized or completely contrived.<p>If, however, the theory is able to make predictions about things we didn't already know, and those predictions agree with experimental data, then there's a higher chance our new model maps to physical reality.",1246913902

690437,comment,689808,689808,0,0,troels,,,"One more thing that you may or may not know is that functional programming languages are a kind of fuzzy concept. There are at least two different categories (well, probably it's more a continuum, but ..), being functional programming languages vs. function-level programming languages. (Note: Someone please correct me, if I'm confusing the terms here). Lisp's belongs in the first category, where Haskell probably belongs in the latter. The first category is more similar to main stream, procedural languages, where the latter is more abstract. Which is a better choice is open for debate; On the one hand, you'll probably grasp Lisp faster than Haskell, on the  other hand you might end up writing procedural code in it, instead of function oriented code.<p>See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function-level_programming#Contrast_to_functional_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function-level_programming#Cont...</a>",1246913728

OK, let's work on the 'abstraction' thing a bit.<p>Given almost any mechanical or electrical technology, there exists means of using that technology to control the duty cycles of machines.  The 555 was just an example of what you might use to implement an intermittent wiper.<p>As I understand it, accessories like windshield wipers originally operated from manifold vacuum, so the patent probably describes some sort of vacuum-based contraption which would be as obvious to MEs as a timer circuit is to EEs.<p>Another point being, even if it were a novel concept when implemented with vacuum lines and valves, it certainly wouldn't be novel or unexpected when cheap solid-state electronics <i>did</i> arrive on the scene.  But chances were good that the patent claims were broad enough to hold sway over future implementations.  (Disclaimer: I haven't read it.)<p>So fast-forward your 8-track to the early 70s: windshield wipers are now run from the car's electrical system, and wow, hey, cool, here's the 555... and meanwhile the goofy patent's still in force.",1246913712

690434,comment,689712,690075,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"You're thinking kids jumped on Facebook because it was hip. It's not - it's cool. There's a subtle difference.<p>When MySpace got huge, it was because of the social tail. Big bands joined, lots of kids joined to talk to those bands, those kids' friends joined, till every high schooler was a member. Facebook didn't get to succeed in a void. MySpace pracitcally did, because Friendster was fairly minute when MySpace got big and Friendster was a sterile, inept social network. Facebook entered a stuffed market and <i>beat the company with the monopoly</i>, because they, not MySpace, understood how to make a social network, and they understood what people wanted out of such a web site. Now that they've got it, they're not going to lose, period, unless something happens to disrupt how people live lives. Their monopoly is as real and impregnable as Google's.<p>I was there at the center of the transition, and I can say firsthand that the approach of high school students to MySpace versus their approach to Facebook was entirely different. They joined MySpace for boredom and to show themselves off. See Ze Frank's episode where he mentions MySpace and freedom of expression: It's something like that. Kids would use MySpace to show off their crappy, unreadable pages, because MySpace wasn't ever about the information on those pages, it was about expressing yourself, regardless of if anybody else really cared, and they didn't.<p>When people used Facebook, they still used it partly to alleviate boredom, but much more importantly, they started <i>communicating</i>. Facebook's central model is the newsfeed. They had it long before any other site. After Facebook added it, then came MySpace, Twitter, Tumblr, and even the smaller things: Flickr's contact tracker and similar ways to follow friend activity. Facebook was the company that realized a social site had to be not just about giving people a way to connect, but about <i>pushing</i> the connections. When I update my status on Facebook, all my friends see it. When I upload a photo and tag a friend, all my friends and my <i>friend's</i> friends see it. In essence it's a bunch of connected pulpits. If a friend of mine takes my picture, I don't need to point it out to all my friends, because it's pointed out automatically. If I post on a friend's wall, other people can join in instantly.<p>Because Facebook's based on privacy, there's no risk if you're half smart about it. I can do anything you want to and you'll never see it. Hell, I can insult my family members while they're friends with me if I've put them on Limited View and they'll never see me complaining about them.<p>The thing is, social is not ""cool"". It's a way of living. For people who use Facebook at all, the site has become a central part of communication, same thing as talking on a phone or texting or emailing. Are cell phones not hip any more? They were around when I was a little boy, and they're still around today. Facebook is a success on that magnitude. It created and defined the methods of communication that we now take for granted, and it's still ahead of the game. Did you know that before Facebook, there was no such thing as ""wall-to-wall"" view? You'd have to follow a conversation by reading two profiles at once. There were also no social tagging systems in place. Facebook came up with that. And poking got made fun of then and gets made fun of now, but I got hook-ups because of poking and I suspect high school kids are still taking advantage of that.<p>Facebook is a global site. It doesn't try to be edgy; its only innovations are the enormous ones. It's simple. People miss how simple it is because it does so fucking much. But my 50-year-old mother knows how to upload photos and write notes and post on walls. So does my 75-year-old grandfather. My 14-year-old brother just joined, not because he thought it was cool but because his friends were all talking on it. I have no family member over the age of 10 who doesn't have a Facebook account. Furthermore, I've got friends who all experiment with cutting-edge applications and sites; I experiment myself; there is nothing coming up that's taking on Facebook. The closest is Loopt, and the only people I know that use Loopt use it as a Facebook app. More than half the people I know that use Twitter use it to update their Facebook status. Twitter's not a direct competitor to Facebook, mind you, but a lot of the people who comment here don't remember that. To them, a huge millions-person application <i>must</i> compete with a similar site that offers similar functionality. It doesn't. Twitter is public; Facebook is not.<p>Facebook's privacy was its killer feature when it started; it still is. Even with its push for public profiles now, it understands that people use Facebook to be part of an isolated community that they care about. The people who go public aren't changing that at all. In a sense Facebook's eating its cake and having it, because it has sacrificed no functionality to appeal to the attention whores, but it's given them what they want, probably because <i>casual</i> users are benefitting. I no longer use Flickr or Vimeo: I link people to my Facebook photos and videos. It's great because I can link you to my photo albums if I want to, but you can't see my face outside the photos I make public; you can read my comments on them, but you can't read comments made by friends. There are no leaks in the system. I can be public and my friends can be hidden and we still use the same site.<p>Because of the app plugin system, nobody has a thing to gain by avoiding Facebook's walled garden. Digg has a Connect With Facebook button prominent on its site. It loses nothing it had before, and it gains Facebook users; if I'm a Facebook user, I can use Digg without having to get a second account; I suddenly use Facebook even more than I did before. I use Delicious and Last.fm and they both tie in with Facebook. My friends that use Delicious and Last.fm both use it through Facebook. It's brought us closer together online. I made a new friend out of a casual acquaintance because he saw me listening to a song on Last.fm by a musician that he liked that I didn't know he liked.<p>The point I'm trying to make here is that these things are <i>part of living</i> for me and my friends. It's not something we use because we think it's rad and unique. We use it because it provides us with a convenience. It's no longer addictive, even: With their last redesign, Facebook removed almost all the things that were irritatingly engaging. I don't get app requests or see people I don't want to see. I can block it all off. I can also, however, talk to any one of my friends without knowing their IM address, I can invite them to anything going on (an acquaintance of mine invited me to a hypnotist show he's putting on out of the blue, and thanks to Facebook we're suddenly talking a lot about things because we've found something to talk about), and I can do nearly anything I want to. People use Facebook notes to blog now, they store links on it, they keep their family photos there. We never once think of it as ""using Facebook"" just as we never consciously notice we use Google instead of Yahoo or Bing. So when those 8-year-olds grow up, they'll join Facebook despite their parents using it, because using Facebook doesn't mean ever once seeing your parents. It means seeing your friends, and being involved in their lives.<p><i>tl;dr</i><p>I disagree with what you said.",1246913643

Sometimes the music stops and a winner plants their seat in the most profitable position.<p>Many of the entrants so far have been happy to follow the strategy Mark Cuban recently outlined in his anti-freemium post. ""More importantly, when you see your BlackSwan company appear and you know they will kick your ass, rather than ramping up to try to compete, get out. Sell."" There's much to recommend that strategy, especially if you'd rather own an NBA franchise than a web company.<p>But Facebook has plenty of Nth generation advisors and investors who want to escape the flame-out/sell-out cycle and go for the Google-sized enduring win -- Andreesen among them. That changes the questions:<p>Is there a niche for a universal, well-tended social/identity network platform? (I think yes.)<p>Will one gorilla dominate that market? (I think yes, it has many of the same network-effects and natural-monopoly aspects as search or operating systems.)<p>Can the Facebook team avoid the nightclub-like fad boom-and-bust cycle? (I think probably; they're certainly wise to the problem and building defenses like crazy.)<p>Will being the de facto monopolist in this market involve massive new revenue streams (beyond advertising) that can now only be imagined?

We arrange with our clients that they can direct a domain of their choosing to our site, and we catch the request and template it accordingly.<p>Recently, I noticed some traffic to our site from a new URL, which has no such account with us. Now, because we don't recognize the URL as a registered client, our site applies the generic DEMO template when this URL is accessed.<p>I plan on contacting the person with whom this domain is registered, as well as putting in the appropriate filters to prevent this from happening again, but I thought I'd leave it be long enough to ask the question... What does this person have to gain from doing this, assuming it's not just a simple mistake on their part? Is there some security threat I'm missing? All they are doing is sending more traffic to our site from their own domain. Obviously it doesn't help us with search indexing or anything (and it may even hurt as far as duplicate content is concerned), but I wouldn't think it helps them in any way either.<p>The URL in question by the way is http://travelinafrica.co.uk",1246912423

Whether or not I smear said cake all over my employer's face, or share it with him at the table is a different matter; decided by how well s/he treated the people beneath them, including me.
I think its important to differentiate between the things that the people above your boss are forcing him to do and the things hes doing that you don't like that he's NOT being told directly to do.  
For example, at my work, my boss has to come around every so often to make sure I'm working up to speed, and this is required by his superiors.  What ISN'T required by the higher-ups is that he nit-pick what I'm doing, ^especially^ when I'm my speeds are above average.  When I quit, I intend to make that clear on my cake, lol.  I intend to lay out, ""I don't like that corporate requires this this and this of X (my boss) because it is counter productive, and I don't like the way X, my boss, does this this and this without a reason to do so because it is an obstruction to the work flow.""
I think communication is a big part of it, but for some reason it seems like now-a-days outgoing interviews are a thing of the past.  You know, where they interview you about your experience with the company as your going out the door.  Then again, if I actually felt my employer was at all listening to my suggestions to begin with I probably wouldn't have resigned to begin with, so I guess that explains that.",1246912395
