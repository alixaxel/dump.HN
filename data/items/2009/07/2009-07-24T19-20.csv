722276,comment,721577,722126,0,0,tom_rath,,,"Joel Spolsky summed it up pretty well in his last Inc. article:<p><i>""...The Web consulting business was great, but it had one problem: limited margins. You could charge only so much for an hour of some consultant's time -- in those days, maybe $200. Some of that went to overhead (say $20) and some to pay the consultant's salary (maybe $70). That leaves you with a mere $110 per hour in gross profit. That's a lot of money, but it paled in comparison with margins in the software industry, in which you can produce additional copies of an application at virtually no cost.""</i><p>So, if a body-shopping service company is competing against another body-shopping service company, they're facing the same per-employee costs and will have no problems in their market.  However, if a body-shopping service company is competing against commercial software for the exact same product and market, commercial software will face lower costs and receive higher revenue for the same work and so will have more resources to bury that competing body-shop every time.<p>Also, if our company receives a service call, we regard it as a failure of our product to address our customer's needs.  If a 'commercial' open source company receives that same call, they regard it as money earned from a support ticket.<p>Given that difference, which software product would you prefer to run in your business?",1248465503

722262,comment,720957,722146,0,0,gruseom,,,"Original rectangles are not required. What's important is only that the new rectangles cover the exact same portions of the plane as the original rectangles. This rules out computing the convex hull and then decomposing, because that would fill in any holes, i.e. the new rectangles would be covering space that the old rectangles didn't cover, which won't work.<p>Maybe I can explain this more fully. We are doing computationally-intensive processing of different regions of the plane. The order in which the regions get processed is unpredictable. We need to quickly, precisely and compactly answer the question: ""which regions have been processed so far""?<p>Suppose you hire a guy to paint your wall. He's very anal (or, let's be modern about it, has Asperger's) and only ever paints in axis-parallel rectangles. He's easily distracted and liable to paint rectangles in arbitary locations, so the process doesn't proceed in any linear way, but he does cover the wall eventually. Paint is expensive, so you instruct him never to paint over the same area twice. Our problem is to efficiently answer the question, ""What portions of the wall have been painted so far?""<p>Obviously we could just keep a list and add each new rectangle as it gets painted. But as the wall gets filled in, many painted areas will blend together. We'd like to keep the list as small as possible, i.e. we want the painted-so-far rectangles to be as large as possible. If we didn't care about that, we could just divide the wall into pixels and track the state of each.<p>It's not a disaster if we paint a few spots twice, but it's really bad to mark an area as painted if it hasn't been. That's why we can't ignore holes in the bounding polygon, i.e. space between painted rectangles. (Edit: actually no, it is bad if we paint the same spot twice. Imagine that the paint explodes if you do that. :))<p>The painting analogy can be extended to include color. In the original problem, we're painting the wall with a single color and all we care about is painted vs. not-painted. But if we introduce multiple colors, then we want to track not just ""which areas are painted"" but ""which areas are painted blue and which areas are painted yellow"". We still want to answer that question with as few rectangles as possible, but now we're not allowed to merge blue areas with yellow areas. That being said, a non-color solution would get us a long way.<p>NP complete problems are found everywhere in this space, no question about it. But there are also often useful results around approximations and heuristics. We don't need the optimal set, just small enough to make what we're doing fast.<p>Edit: the above also sheds light on why spatial indexing structures like R-trees don't work for this out of the box (though maybe they can be adapted to do so). These structures let you add rectangles and find them again. But they don't merge rectangles. If our painter takes a fancy to one-centimeter squares and decides to paint a thousand of them all in a row, an R-tree would end up with a thousand rectangles, even though the total painted area is a single n-by-1 rectangle at every step. Something like an R-tree with a ""compaction"" phase would be close to what we need, but maybe not close enough, because insertion into an R-tree is expensive.",1248465235

a budget has been a perennial event. In just a handful of years, when we enjoyed
an unexpected windfall of taxes, is the budget enacted without gimmicks and
raiding the funds of other state and local agencies.<p>It's popular to lay the blame at the foot of Prop 13 and the requirement of
a supermajority to pass the budget, but the real cause of our enduring
fiscal crisis lies with the 120 members of the State Assembly and Senate.<p>Our state representatives never saw a spending bill they didn't like. Especially
since in political calculus $$ equals votes. It's quite popular to spend
money on some crackpot idea then issue a press release bragging how a
representative is 'doing something' about the problem.<p>In the occasional year where we have an unexpected surplus do we use the money
to pay down our existing debt or bank it in anticipation of a future rainy day?
No, we spend it on new projects, but we don't simply spend it, we float bond
issues which obligate us to spend a like amount of money yearly over 30 years.
Our base spending level keeps growing. We have no flexability to spend less
during a bad year because of entitlements like school spending (which by
constitutional amendment consume approx 40% of the budget), existing debt
service and third-rail special interest issues.<p>Our representatives exhibit the drug seeking behavior of addicts,
pawning a neighbor's tv to buy their next fix. But, it's not crack or PCP that
that has them in it's deadly grip. It's money. Cold. Hard. Cash.<p>Our elected representatives in California are boxed into a corner. Any
move they might take to cut spending risks alienating the special interest
groups that dole out the political contributions. Take prisions, for example. 
In California we incarcerate a larger percentage of our population than most other states (moreso than some countries, even). Our spending on prisions is nearly 
equal to what we spend on education. (Yet, our prison health care system has been
put in the hands of a trustee by the federal courts, since we have been killing
one prisoner per day due to inadequate prison health care). Any attempt
to cut prision spending (and thus endangering the employment of members of
the CCPOA union) brings immediate and harsh retribution by CCPOA.<p>So, don't blame Prop13 or the supermajority rule. Even if those were not a
factor, we'd still be lurching from crisis to crisis, but we'd have tax rates
that are double of what they are now...<p>Joe McGuckin",1248463756

It's not a hate-fest either. As you most likely understood, I implied that some people might be willing to overlook MS's evil because it's an American company, as in, out of patriotism or something.<p>As a people, you(?) do seem to be prone to indulging overreacting. Take ""Sodomayor is a reverse-racist"" for example. Or the heated discussion around abortion.<p>> MS isn't a gigantic living organism with a single brain - there are a lot of teams in a company the size of Microsoft, each with different leadership and goals. Some will be friendly to open source, others will not.<p>I believe I addressed this by saying not everyone in MS is evil. But if you look closely, you'll discover that it's <i>really</i> freaking difficult to deny MS's actions as a company being evil.<p>> It's easy to paint an entire group of people with a broad brush and see the world as black and white, but then you'd also be wrong.<p>Right, black and white. The truth/reality is often pretty straightforward though. As for painting an entire group of people with a broad brush, see my original comment about not everyone working for MS being evil.",1248463681
