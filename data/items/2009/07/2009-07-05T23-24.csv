688872,comment,688660,688660,0,0,mpk,,,"Verbal communication is just inherently different from communication through the written word.<p>We've all encountered teachers who lecture ""as though they are reading from the textbook"". It's the same information, so why should it matter?<p>I think it has to do with verbal communication being more about interacting with other people. When I see another person lecturing (live or through video), I find it easier to stay focused on what they are telling me. There are all these visual cues that add some extra hooks. And then, of course, the verbal ones. The accents, the pauses, the little jokes or references that are thrown in.<p>Just think of your favorite stand-up comedian. Compare reading a transcript of your favorite session to an audio recording of that same session to a video of that exact same session. You probably experience them all very differently.<p>So instead of comparing a text with a lecture, where both share the same subject matter, compare a text of the lecture with a video of the lecture. (Bonus points for comparing a text on paper with a video of some guy reading that paper aloud).",1246837594

Right now I work a lot with architects, for example, and many of them are very smart and yet have disastrous spelling abilities.<p>Since I observed that there are smart people who can't spell, I've revised spelling ability down to ""weak indicator"" of stupidity or poor education. I.e., if someone spells poorly <i>and</i> has a few other things going against them, then the spelling will help decide the matter. But I would not make any rapid judgements on someone's intelligence based purely on their spelling/grammar.",1246837272

688862,comment,688583,688746,0,0,ori_b,,,"I'd say the way you described unpaid internships, it is pretty much exploitation. The intern is doing essential and valuable work, and is producing value for the company. They should be compensated for it.<p>The fact that the system is set up to encourage people working for free is simply a setup for exploitation. A mild form of blackmail, if you will; ""You'll never get ahead if you don't work for me for free"". While an intern might not get paid very much, I think they should at least be able to cover living costs from their earnings.<p>Most internships I've seen tend to cover a good deal more than that, with pay starting in the ballpark of $20/hour.",1246836769

688860,comment,688300,688418,0,0,Periodic,,,"They also can mistake business for productivity.  For example, there's the classic joke (at least in the sys admin world) about breaking something about a month before reviews, then stay over the weekend to fix it.  You will be the savior of the company and be rewarded in kind.<p>Really good work is hard to see sometimes because it doesn't look like work.  If you had two teams, one just delivered on time on and on budget and the other spent a heroic month overdue fixing bugs and finally shipping over budget it might appear that the people on the second team are better.  They work more and worked harder than the first team.  You might even decide that the first team was given too large a budget and too much time, when in reality they paced themselves and had talented people who could give good estimates and were able to deliver on their promises.<p>YOU might not make that mistake, but I can guarantee that many managers would give greater rewards the team working overtime to fix (their own) bugs than the one that consistently delivers on time and on budget.<p>I think it has more to due with the culture believing that software is buggy and impossible to schedule, and rewarding people when faced with those things.",1246836641

If there's a ceiling, then smart kids will quickly hit the ceiling and then start measuring themselves by how much effort is required to stay there.  That's the way it was at my school:  all the honors/AP kids learned the same material, and in every class there were at least a couple of kids who got high As on most things.  The only way to distinguish yourself was to do it without working hard, because you couldn't distinguish yourself by accomplishing more and harder things.",1246835834

It is well known that these chemicals at high levels eat people's souls, but do not do much physical damage.  At clinical doses they're harmless.  Some caution in kids for heart shenanigans.

We have some things that we could do with a hand on but don't have the time to do ourselves nor the budget to put out elsewhere. This stuff is mainly developing internal tools for our penetration testing team. If you're a Uni student looking to expand beyond a straight CS degree or go into pen testing or information security I can think of worse ways to spend your summer than helping a bunch of guys out with projects, probably wangling sponsorship for government clearance and getting to help out on real world pen tests - then of course if you do well there might be a job when you finish uni, or at least a set of industry references.<p>I agree that exploitation is wrong, but the key is to find something that pays you back in ways that will help you, and money isn't always the best way to get paid.",1246835744

688846,comment,688569,688569,0,0,oversharing,,,"I love this article.  Every little failure in school (failing to win first place in a competition, getting a B on a test) made me doubt my talent, and I started losing all belief in my ability when I started taking graduate-level classes in my field.  I knew it was irrational and wrong, but for the previous decade of my life, working hard in school had been a reliable sign of a lack of talent.  The kids who had a future in a subject breezed by and the kids at the bottom struggled.  Now I was working hard, even struggling sometimes.  Did I instantly abandon and unlearn a decade of programming?  No.  It was like the end of <i>The Crying Game</i> in slow motion, three years of discovering that where I <i>thought</i> there was some talent there was, instead, a disgusting, useless lump of flesh.<p>By the time I got to graduate school I was overwhelmed with a feeling of inevitable failure.  I just couldn't stop thinking about failure.  Every time I picked up my books I would think about how humiliating it was not to be good enough.  I was actually doing acceptably well in my coursework, at one of the top PhD programs in the country, but it became impossible for me to even sit down and study for any length of time because I was so ashamed.  I tried to talk myself into a more sensible attitude, but I just couldn't do it.<p>I have very few memories of the six months I spent living there.  I didn't make any friends and can only recall the names of two people I met there:  my advisor and one classmate who was friendly toward me.  I remember my apartment and the office I shared.  (I remember forcing myself to go to the office to study, and I remember sitting there wondering whether the other students could tell how stupid I was just by watching me.)  I can remember a few of the places I went -- the zoo, a restaurant where I ate almost every day, a few movie theaters, a used bookstore -- but I don't really remember being there.  I didn't use any drugs while I was there and rarely drank (since I had a policy of not drinking alone.)  Yet I don't have any memories of specific times or events.  I just remember being in my apartment, being at my desk at the office, feeling stupid, miserable, and worthless.<p>And so I dropped out and got a job in software.  That was very lucky for me:  I chose it because I thought it didn't require any real intelligence (which I was obviously lacking) but it turned out to be a good way to put my talent to work.<p>P.S.  I normally post under a different name, but this is kind of a whiny sob story, and I'd rather just get it off my chest anonymously.<p>P.P.S.  Now that I think about it, the only reason I remember my advisor's name is that I later saw him interviewed in a PBS documentary about a famous scientist he worked with.",1246835613
