684201,comment,684002,684002,0,0,diN0bot,,,"i like these oldies but goodies, too, but can a story from 2004 really be considered (hacker) <i>news</i> ? i don't think the chronologically ""what's new"" aggregator is not the right solution for ""best things of all time"".<p>it's no good if this story pops up every year. hacker news should prevent duplicate urls, and perhaps provide more browsing options, eg monthly top stories.",1246535293
684200,comment,683514,683758,0,0,trapper,,,"I agree, it's much faster. When hiring for a developer position I usually ask ""what's the most recent scientific paper you have read"" and ask them to discuss it. Extra credit is given if it's in a different field than computer science.<p>I have found this a very reliable way to weed out candidates who can talk the talk but really are just winging it.",1246535186
684199,comment,683807,684134,0,0,skorgu,,,"I know you don't mean it this way but this sounds like SQL databases can magically index their data without scanning it. Add a new index to a large table in any RDBMS and it'll do exactly what you're describing.<p>Query on an un-indexed column and it'll take forever every time. (There's an Oracle database I deal with occasionally that takes 50 seconds to count 78 rows. No we can't add an index.)<p>All NoSQL (eewww) non-RDBMSs do is move the pain around. The efficiency and lookup times are (usually, mostly) orthogonal to the orientation of the data, all you can do is align your use case to hit as few pain points as posisble.",1246535160
684198,comment,684072,684072,0,0,davidw,,,"Something they didn't touch on is the possible size of payouts: if you get your refund, you get N dollars (pounds, I guess, in this case), whereas there is no set upper bound to the ticket.<p>That said, if you look at the comments, some guy did something clever and searched eBay for Elvis tickets, and found them going for $60, which may well mean you'd be better off getting the refund.",1246535151
684197,comment,684024,684175,0,0,sho,,,"Actually, the site at the top of the thread is free: tobytripp.github.com. You only have to pay if you want the CNAME support, as you suggest, but this example is not of that. So I suppose it adds value to the free subscription, yeah.<p>But .. is it really worth diluting the brand, and diverting the team's attention? I have seen personal articles on a username.github.com blog which have nothing to do with code. Someone seeing the site via one of these avenues for the first time would come away with the impression github is a free blog provider. And, amongst other things, they are!<p>And what happens when people start, saying, hosting large media files? It might not have happened yet but it will. Then one of them gets slashdotted, the site slows to a crawl, and the team's running around putting out fires caused by some free service which doesn't have anything to do with version control, just ""adds value"" to having an account on that site.<p>Well, I guess they've thought all this through and decided it's in their interests. I was just surprised, is all.",1246535107
684196,comment,684023,684093,0,0,pmjordan,,,"As indicated by tetha's comment, that's not really true. Nature is a pretty good RNG. I was more amazed that someone who seems to have taken a keen interest in cryptography would not be concerned with generating good keys. Maybe I should expect that of someone who lived 200 years ago. I don't know.<p>(yes, the numbers could of course be truly random, but they don't seem it to me)",1246534909

This has been like a geek version of The West Wing.<p>Bottom line is you can't adopt anything that requires royalties for the web. You just can't. From then on it's just politics and ""arguing on the internet"".<p>It's also a real travesty that the furore over video has eclipsed the unarguable case for Vorbis as the default audio codec.<p>The next big move for Theora fans (apart from the more obvious: lots and lots of compelling Theora content) is getting Xiph Quicktime Components installed on the 3/4 of Macs that don't use Firefox. Maybe they want to hook up with the Perian guys? I wonder what their install rate is?",1246534323

684184,comment,683647,684007,0,0,tetha,,,"In fact, testing the software is not just there to make refactorings possible. The tests for the software are there to check if the software behaves correctly for a (hopefully representative) set of inputs. 
Thus, the check if a refactoring is invariant is mostly a side effect from having a test suite for your software, and thus, in my opinion, it does not matter how secure your recfactorings are. I do have my tests already!
(And yes, I do consider it a heavy code smell if there are no tests written, because lots and lots of things are so very, very easy to test if structured ... if structured ok. not even well structured, just without hard-coded dependencies)",1246534223

684181,comment,683647,684041,0,0,derefr,,,"Technically, we have this one too: identity, versus <i>equivalence</i>. Just like in the real world: when one thing can replace another (it has the same <i>members</i> or <i>properties</i>), they are equivalent; when modifying one would modify the other (or, if you like, when two of the same thing occupy the same space, e.g. the house at 123 Fake St. and the house at 123 Fake Street), they are identical. There's no need for the word ""pointer"" in that explanation, notice :)<p>""Equal"", however, means neither equivalence nor identity; it's generally just a math term, meaning ""identical/equivalent <i>in magnitude</i>"" (where numbers are the only things for which ""equivalence"" <i>is</i> ""identity."") Phrases like ""equal rights"" imply that the <i>total value</i> of the rights can be reduced to a number, and compared; to put it another way, that the rights are sortable. ""Equal"" has no meaning for things which cannot be sorted—there can be ""equivalent paintings"", or ""identical paintings"", but never ""equal paintings.""<p>""Equal"" is basically the worst possible term to have absorbed for talking about the comparison of anything other than numbers. The underlying comparison is always one of either identity, or equivalence, and this should be simply stated outright—it causes no confusion, nor are there any special cases for which ""equal"" is necessary.",1246533922

684176,comment,683807,684142,0,0,sho,,,"Well, the disk space is not the controlling parameter usually. Getting a ridiculously huge amount of fast, reliable disk is pretty much a solved problem. If all you were doing was writing logs at a constant rate then you could ""scale"" pretty much indefinitely just adding larger and larger disks to the same poky DB server, and it wouldn't matter if it was 5GB or 5PB.<p>The proper scaling issue is, of course, with the cpu and memory of your single DB server - and its disk <i>speed</i> - which can only be expanded so much, and at exponentially increasing cost. It's conceivable that even with a fixed amount of data, say 100G, you might have to confront scaling issues with increasing site usage, long before you reached anywhere near the limits of your raw disk space.",1246533606

Github hosts git repositories.  git repositories are a great way to manage your website.  github charges you money to use your own domain name for your github website, but lets you try it out for free.<p>The github pages concept adds value to your subscription, which seems like something that's very good for their business.

684172,comment,683807,683887,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Another thing is that some people have problems with SQL itself, not relational databases per se.
