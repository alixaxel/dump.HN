Then certain trusted people, partners or alumni, can rate the applicants over time. Instead of going days without shaving and being exhausted, you could spend a few minutes each day flipping through applications. Surely over time those you are interested in for an interview will be apparent. I'm pretty sure there was a reason not to use this approach, but it may be worth it to bring it up again.",1247601441

I ""just reside"" in my apartment in the city, I live in the neighborhood.  In a suburb people don't just reside in their homes, they live in them.  They have dinner parties and outdoor BBQs.  Their kids play ball in the back yard with the neighbors and hide-and-seek in the nearby woods.  Even a modestly priced home has room for a workshop, a library, a garden, and an entertainment center.  In the city, you'll be lucky to pay through the nose for enough room for one of those things in a decent neighborhood.",1247599138

Your plan helps you test that assumption, nothing more, nothing less.<p>Edit: Adding number 4: If, while carrying out my plan I find out that the video store is on fire, or that my wife would rather go to the theatre instead of renting, <i>I adapt</i> to the changing reality. I do not stubbornly insist that I follow my predefined plan. I incorporate the new variables into it. In certain cases, this does in fact mean changing the objective.
