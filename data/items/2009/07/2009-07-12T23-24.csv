700751,comment,700409,700409,0,0,ovidiupl,,,"I finally registered on HN to make one short comment: Read ""Why Popcorn Costs So Much at the Movies: And Other Pricing Puzzles"". It's a short, readable book on pricing ""for dummies"" by Richard McKenzie (UC Irvine).<p>I have zero formal training in economics, and I found the book enlightening. It discusses price discrimination thoroughly - after all, it's a critical component of pricing theory.<p>I, too, find the thought of one buyer paying more simply because s/he can afford the price somehow ""wrong"". I don't fully buy the explanation in the book (mainly revolving around time opportunity costs, as I see it). But, at the same time, life is not always fair - morality and money are orthogonal to some extent. If this behavior were deemed harmful by society, surely it would be illegal by now?<p>[Edit: Minor Engrish nit.]",1247443059

That could mean a period in academia, open source, or a long period of learning at some other company in the industry.<p>There are a few cases I know of where the founders were not experts, but in those cases it was because they stumbled onto a new market, so nobody else knew more than they did.

Would they trade things that would have more monetary value later for things that have less monetary value now? Could you just write an app that had people pushing a button for ""free"" cash?

Could you tie it into the iPod, or an addictive game? with the right combination, the whole thing could go viral.<p>The idea of ""cheating"" people doesn't interest me -- If I did something like that I'd be clear about this being for entertainment value only and I'd even support limits on the amount of play per day.

- what is your expected conversion rate from free users to paying users and can your business survive on that rate (+ a healthy margin for safety) ?
- what is the cost of supporting a free user in case the monetization of a free user is less than the income on that user ?<p>A fairly simple spreadsheet will give you the answers, if you can't determine the conversion rate then do a survey with a pledge. That way you get a ballpark figure, reality should be within 50% of that figure, so to be on the safe side discount it by a factor of 2.<p>Last but definitely not least, if your 'premium' package offers nothing of value to your user (because for instance multiple free accounts give the equivalent of a paid account) then don't bother trying.",1247440536
