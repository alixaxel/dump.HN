719355,comment,719043,719242,0,0,hvs,,,"I think Microsoft would be most likely to start firing patent lawsuits at a time where Mono started to gain real traction in the free software community.  So, if the community <i>did</i> start adopting Mono as a major platform and developed a lot of good software for it, that is when Microsoft would pull the trigger.  So, either way, Microsoft gets what it wants.  They limit adoption by holding patents that could be later used against the community, and if it <i>does</i> get adopted they can start suing.<p>I say this as someone who really likes the .NET platform and think it could add a lot of value to the free software community.  But I have to agree with the FSF on this one.",1248350291

Having transitioned from maker to manager over the past couple of years, I was just commenting to a co-worker yesterday that I find it almost impossible to finish the maker-like tasks on my to-do list (mostly writing and reviewing long documents).  I've been feeling a lot of guilt about this, but I couldn't see a clear way out.  After reading pg's post, I'm thinking about blocking off some afternoons for maker activities.  Thanks!",1248350152

I find that if I have something scheduled at a fixed time immediately after ""making"" mode, I'm less productive just by knowing I can't tail off naturally. I therefore try to schedule ""stuff"" as the first thing in the morning.<p>Or is it tricky to get the founders you're advising to agree (with you, and among each other) on a common definition of ""morning""?",1248350040

Can they do that cost effectively? Can their algorithms produce as useful results in the face of ""optimisations"" by 10's of thousands of SEO/SEMs across the globe?<p>I'm guessing no.<p>My wife makes the most awesome gingerbread men (and brownies) but that doesn't mean she can put Greggs out of business.<p>Still props too them, they're doing something awesome.",1248349461

Time in the office is always full of disruptions, and I often can't get into any sort of groove.  When I'm alone, at home, I'm far more productive in just a few hours.",1248349409

Almost certainly including Microsoft.<p>MySQL has bugs, but the basic functionality works on Windows. Or so I assume, considering that those bugs don't seem to have prevented tens of thousands of PHP developers from making good use of MySQL when developing their software. (I wouldn't know, of course -- I use Mac OS and Linux.)<p>I'm sure the bugs are annoying, though. Maybe the people who care about them should get out the GPL source code and fix them. Or maybe they should pay someone who knows how to fix them. Or maybe they should do what just about everybody else seems to do -- calculate the price of options one and two, compare them to the cost of running Linux, and deploy on Linux.<p>Or they can bang on the table and cry in the hopes that someone will fix their problems for free. Good luck with that.",1248348779

It seems to be about improving prescriptions based on metabolic profiling, which makes sense. However, I've never had a doctor take my fingerprints in order to prescribe medicine, and I'd surely walk out with haste if they tried to.<p>I thought that the point of taking fingerprints was that they are something people can unintentionally leave behind at a crime scene.
