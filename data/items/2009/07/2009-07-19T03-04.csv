Apple makes most of their money from being the ""sexy consumer electronics company"", and no matter how you try to spin a telecom, you can't make it <i>sexy</i>. The only way Apple could <i>successfully</i> buy out a telecom would involve replacing the entire culture of the telecom with Apple's own dedication-to-snobby-perfection culture, which itself would involve replacing most of the employees and management with Apple's own. They'd have no one left to make computers!",1247975989
712567,comment,712269,712496,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Two things to be said about this argument.<p>One: Martha Angell says it's just a line of propaganda. From a review at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Truth-About-Drug-Companies-Deceive/dp/0375508465"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Truth-About-Drug-Companies-Deceive/dp/...</a><p>""In <i>The Truth About the Drug Companies</i>, [former editor of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>] Angell explains how a huge portion of the revenue generated by 'Big Pharma' goes not into research and development but into aggressive marketing campaigns to sell their product. She describes how, even though the drug companies claim that it costs them an average of 802 million dollars per drug to develop new medicines, that figure is obscenely inflated since it factors in marketing as well as expected interest the company would have received had they invested the money in the open market. Meanwhile, Angell says, most of the R & D work is done by colleges and universities funded by the government. There are also problems with the drugs themselves, Angell indicates, since a majority are 'me-too drugs', slightly modified versions of existing products which meant to address concerns of consumers most likely to spend money on pharmaceuticals...""<p>Two: Even if I were to accept the argument at face value -- which I do not -- what it's saying is that as an American I pay far and away the highest medical costs in the developed world, yet receive no better health outcome, and have no guarantee that my insurance will actually cover me when I get sick (rather than finding a way to reject me based on some technicality)... all in order to generously subsidize drug research for the benefit of the rest of the world. Now, I like to think of myself as a generous guy, and I used to work in drug research... but screw that. I'll take Canadian or Western-European-style healthcare, peace of mind, and a check. Then we can talk about how much of my extra money I'd like to contribute to erectile-dysfunction research.",1247975952

A deal that is part cash, mostly Apple stock would probably go down well with current Sprint shareholders (the ones I know are fairly pessimistic about Sprint's future, but are holding in the hopes that the Pre helps, or it gets acquired for a premium).<p>Sprint definitely has a history of horrible customer service, which maybe Apple could finally slay. I live in their home market (KC), so obviously coverage is great here, but not sure if it would be sufficient nationwide to be worth it to Apple. That said, Amazon apparently thinks coverage is sufficient for the Kindle.<p>Definitely an interesting idea... who knows if Apple really wants to bother running the network though. It could take a while to raise network and customer service quality to meet Apple-customer expectations (ie. perfection), tarnishing Apple's hard-earned brand name along the way. Claiming all the successes (the device) and blaming all the problems (the network) on AT&T could be convenient.",1247975611

712545,comment,712269,712456,0,0,jpwagner,,,"Calling the current US system ""private healthcare"" without thinking of the idealized private healthcare is a fallacy.<p>Let's suppose drugs and medical procedures were not subsidized by any body.  (Completely impractical (not a recommendation) but useful for this thought experiment.)  What do you think would happen to the price of these drugs and medical procedures.  People would pay for them if they valued them at their price.<p>In having people pool together money in an insurance body (of which there are currently many) you allow shared responsibility so that a disaster (theoretically) does not financially destroy someone.  So now drug companies et al are indeed negotiating with insurance companies.  Insurance companies have huge margins (nature of the business) and end up paying prices based on the value after margin.  Because of this padding, prices go up.<p>Now imagine instead of a bunch of insurance companies you have one.  This is public healthcare.  Prices will be very high, but it won't look like that to the consumer because it is a public cost.<p>Furthermore the ""ask Canada"" argument from the privatize-it side points out the reduced wait-times and increased specialized innovation that occurs in America.<p>No one's arguing that the way it is now is perfect, but a public system in America is a scary thought.",1247973750
