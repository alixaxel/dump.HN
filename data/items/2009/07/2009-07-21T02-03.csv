If there's an ""equivalent"" to 165,000 tickets on an opening weekend of a Hollywood movie, it's probably closer to 165,000,000 page views. And that's in how much revenue is generated--for the production company, a film playing in an actual cinema would rake in more than a YouTube release of equivalent revenue, because your local movie theater makes almost nothing on ticket sales while YouTube probably makes a significant percentage of ad revenue. It's not like YouTube can give all ad revenue to content creators and sell overpriced popcorn and soda, after all.",1248143537
