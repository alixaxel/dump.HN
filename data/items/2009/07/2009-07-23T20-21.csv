We're a startup, except we're not, because we're profitable and we've been around for 4 years. Etc, etc.<p>I'm saying the CTO title is bad for two reasons:<p>* It's a deceptively bad title to assume, because to a lot of people, it denotes someone who has stepped away both from coding and from actively managing MRDs and roadmaps. There are smart people with CTO titles, but, like it or not, there are a lot of dumb people with CTO titles too.<p>* The role itself is weak compared to the VP/E, who owns the dev schedule, and the VP/PM, who owns the roadmap and the customer contacts. Both those roles can win arguments with appeals to authority that the ""CTO"" can't counter.<p>It's not that marketable. It's a vulnerable and (often) superfluous role. It's a net lose.

I don't see how this <i>couldn't</i> lead to even more entrepreneurship.<p>* Getting grade inflation under control will help demonstrate to students that results come from work, not from handouts. Entrepreneurs have probably the best grasp of this idea.<p>* The average founder probably has a much better grasp of probability than the average high school graduate. This doesn't seem to stop them now.<p>* A more competitive high school environment will encourage kids to do amazing things. Sure, some will get caught up in the grades game, but an ideal education system wouldn't have kids idolizing grades as is done today, and students will be allowed to focus on the things that matter to them (be it arts, entrepreneurship, or a million other mentally stimulating activities whose end results mean more than grades).",1248380659
