693437,comment,684840,686782,0,0,10ren,,,"<i>Clarification 2</i>: I, like Jeff, also have a pricing matrix for my product. Sometimes people don't read it properly and are confused - although I'm nice about it, I tend to feel unsympathetic. This is because it's hard for me to really see from someone else's point of view, since we only actually ever see from our own...<p>It reminds me of the founder/maintainer of a very successful programmer's website who said, ""People will not read what you write [for a web-app GUI], not matter what you write, or how you write it"". His frustration was maxed out. It occurred to me that one solution is to only provide buttons (i.e. actions) for what you actually want users to do. This constrains their choices to only valid ones. This amounts to a kind of ""wizard"" - but they've been very successful, so this isn't a bad thing. It also obeys the ""don't make me think!"" imperative, provided  the GUI is designed-well... It also helps if the pricing options are also designed well. In fact, I believe it is worth sacrificing profit/benefit to the customer (or other efficiencies) if by doing so, you can make the choices clearer and simpler for the customer (eg. clarity can come from obvious patterns in the pricing, even if they totally don't fit the true demographics).<p>To apply this to successfully communicating the limits of each pricing option, where ""successfully"" means that the customer hears what you say, you could have a button for each limit. By consciously selecting the limit, the user would know what it is. Unfortunately, this can lead to frustrating backtracking when one choice constrains other choices in unexpected ways. One can muck around with different orderings of the choices, but I think that ultimately, the only real solution is to <i>make</i> the options match what the user would expect.<p>That is, change your pricing model to accord with what the user expects. Not vice versa. This is a kind of ""pricing positioning"", where the goal isn't to sell more, but to communicate better, by associating your product with a category, and then following the standard pricing approaches for that category - whether they suit you or not. The purpose is to communicate, and doing it well makes everyone happier.<p>For me, it's intrinsically valuable: successful communication is a joy in itself; miscommunication is suffering.",1247034697

Examiner.com has brought you on to cover topic X for them, in this case ""Cubicles."" If their sales pitch is similar to the one their Chicago coordinator tried to use to poach away my writers, they probably promised you exposure across a large, growing, national audience and told you that several of their examiners are making thousands of dollars each month.<p>However, the reality is that they pay you less than $5 per thousand impressions you receive on your articles and they're recruiting so, so many writers for inane topics like ""Chicago Christian Fiction"" and ""Chicago Cult Classics"" not to mention such great topics as ""Jonas Brothers"" and ""Howard Stern"" that there's no way anyone can get much of a push from being featured on their already crowded front page.  You're on your own.<p>So you guys spam reddit.  And you spam it hard.<p>Examiner.com writers spam Reddit (and Digg) so hard and consistently that I can only assume their editors explicitly direct their ""examiners"" to post their stories to the site.

I often go over there looking for interesting local news and links. Over the last 6 months, as it has been overrun by ""Examiners"" I've found less and less there.  You've killed that Reddit for me.<p>And so tonight I notice a linkbait headline on my beloved hacker news...with the dreaded ""Examiner.com"" source tag next to it.  As a news junkie, that tag has become synonymous with blogspam and low-quality writing.  So that's one strike against it.<p>Then I click inside to the comments and see someone else is wondering how this received any votes at all.<p>And then I see that the submitter has only submitted Examiner.com articles to HN.<p>Stop spamming us with your spammy content.
