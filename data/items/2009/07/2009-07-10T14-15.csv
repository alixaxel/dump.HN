Currently, I use Blueprint with Compass driving the generation.  This gives me a lot of flexibility and more readable code than if I were wrangling directly with CSS for all of it.",1247236895

697704,comment,697619,697619,0,0,gcv,,,"Fascinating. I haven't finished reading the entire presentation yet, but I already stumbled on something.<p>The author lists a drawback of the first antipattern (""metadata tribbles""): a table split into multiples to keep its size down requires tricky querying, specifically, it requires a union across all splits (slide 10). It also requires extra effort to keep table structures synchronized (slide 11). Then, in a solution to his second antipattern (""entity-attribute-value""), he suggests doing something quite similar to his first antipattern: creating multiple tables with nearly identical columns and using a union to query across them (slides 27 and 28).<p>Hello? So to resolve antipattern 2 you just apply antipattern 1? This is why precisely why relational databases for most problems look like square pegs being hammered into round holes.<p>[EDIT] Not sure if it's worth finishing reading this presentation. Slide 56, a ""solution"" to the problem of storing a hierarchy in a relational database. Breadcrumbs. Not bad, except that the query now requires a ""like"" clause. Whoops, can't use an index on that column anymore! (Feel free to correct me if there exists a RDBMS which can use an index on a ""like."") Hope the author doesn't mind a nice table scan on that query. He doesn't even mention this problem.",1247236387

So while many of these companies may fail — like many do regardless of geographic location, they'll produce talent that has experience and a better understanding in the next cycle. I agree that there is hype, thats the nature of the beast with popularity and seemingly unavoidable... but it contributes to maintaining the ecosystem in SF.<p>Also, I've concluded most investors prefer investing in strong teams over simply a new idea.
