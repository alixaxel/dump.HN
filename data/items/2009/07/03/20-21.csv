Or maybe healthcare in the sense that we aren't healthy; needing less healthcare?<p>The question is too vague for me. If we are talking in terms of ""sicko"" (the documentary) then one solution I have to say is socialized healthcare. I don't feel that social healthcare is necessarily the same as just any other social industry. Therefore people should not react in the same way. Socializing the auto industry is terribly anti-capitalism but its not the same as health-care because there is (or should) be a moral obligation to help people in need regardless of their financial state. You can't morally need a new car. It might still be possible to have private hospitals, for ""premium"" treatment. That already sounds rather <i>dirty</i>, but it reminds me of the postal service. Having government-run postal service actually made the industry better as a whole. Everyone can send a letter for 42 cents is it? but if they want it there overnight, there's fedex.",1246654440

He also has 'it' and has built a little TV show around the concept of entertaining (not just the food, but the party planning etc.). Thank you so much for posting this.<p>I have bent over backward to try to stoke his interest in new/social media, but he wants to make the expensive-looking TV show with big-ticket sponsors first and collect money off it later. Nobody wants to cough up tens of thousands to sponsor a media brand that hasn't quite gotten off the ground.  If he would give me a free hand and go the Vaynerchuk route I could make this work for him easily. Instead he's wedded to a financially top-heavy business model which combines the worst of all worlds.<p>He was an innovator back in the 90s of things like diet informercials but he just does not get the idea of audience-building on the internet and is avowedly technophobic. You would laugh/cry if I told you how this plays out day-by-day.<p>I know it's kind of antithetical to 'hacker news', but does anyone else have experience of dragging an unwilling boss or co-worker into a modern paradigm?

I do agree with you, without trust things can only go wrong, as he is most likely going to align with the company, I can't do anything about that really. What I think it might be a good deal would be to split the 60% to something like 20% for him, 15% for me, 15% for the other guy and the remaing 10% as options, which to me sounds reasonable. Even so, what other dangers are there? Can they kick us out after a while, since they will have the majority of the company stocks? I mean in the sense that after a year or so they say they're not happy with our performance in the company, the current company value is, say £1m, take your £150k for your 15% and go home. Could they do that?<p>Also, do you think it is reasonable to demand equal salaries for the three of us, as he claims ""we're going to be equal, nothing like he's the boss and we the employees""?<p>Another thing he said and I forgot to mention, was that when I said to him that I will be fair but not modest, he said that he knows a guy from his previous company (which surprise-surprise has the same specialty as me) that desperately wants to join the company, but he's giving priority to us, because of our loyalty over the years working with him.

Perhaps by changing the popular applications to connect to a daemon that handles persistent storage and tagging of blobs.<p>The regular user wants to know as little as possible about the file system anyway. Their concept of stored files are those that can be seen as icons in their desktop. Pure hiearchical paths are a thing for programmers and power users (sadly?).<p>Oh also, while going for tagging things, RDF is even more generalized, allowing you to classify tags them self. Each application might want to tag files they create or modify with an application-class of tag. (date-class tags, format-class tags, author-class tags,...)<p>Each application should implicitly add as many tags as it can when saving things (application name, resource kind, content-type, author, date, icon, etc).<p>This would allow you to get files by recalling ""that image i shopped up in gimp last month"".",1246653678

Short background:  I started with a small web app for fun 8 years ago as a side project.  It has grown into a pretty nice sized business that I run full-time and it's till growing rapidly (and spinning off other related web apps).<p>I finally decided that it was time to become a ""real"" company and ended up creating an S-Corp as the operating company and an LLC to hold all the intellectual property (trademarks and copyrights to source code mainly).<p>In finishing up the paperwork, I had to meet a new attorney and when I looked at my situation, he thought there was a good chance that somewhere down the road, I would have the opportunity to sell the entire business for a big payday.  I currently own 100% of the company and don't need angel/venture investors as it's generating good cash flow on it's own....but I might want to exit someday.<p>He tried to explain to me that I would want to structure things so that a ""Stock Sale"" would be attractive and so that I could avoid trying to need to do an ""Asset Sale""  He also wondered what Business structure would offer the best tax situation if a sale came to pass.<p>I'm sorry to ramble on but here are the questions:<p>1. Does anyone with more experience in these matters understand if a different business model would be advantages tax wise in selling the whole company for stock?<p>2.  Would a different business model make a stock sale more attractive?<p>Thanks for ANY guidance/help you can provide.<p>PS - I've asked my CPA and HE can't imagine why anything other than an LLC or S-Corp would have any advantages, but admitted he's not put a lot of business sale deals together.  Also - the business could easily ""merge"" at any point into a single entity by having the S-corp purchase the LLC (to create one s-corp) OR by disbanding the S-corp and having the LLC take over all operations (to have 1 LLC)<p>Thanks again",1246653353

Why does everything have to be about sending things overseas or make the government deal with it?<p>Why not start simple, teach better preventative care.  What I mean is that the US as a whole is very unhealthy.  Rather than having people wait till they get sick, get people to take better care of themselves through eating, fitness, etc. Even have means to reward these people.  It's proven people that eat healthy and workout visit doctors/hospitals much less.  An article I recently read stated that an obese person visits a doctor 10 times more in a year than a healthy person.<p>Beyond this I think health plans should be revisited and restructured to make people more aware of their spending.

686561,story,,,5,7,Spike,"Startup company stake - Please advise...",,"Hi everyone,<p>I need your advice on starting a company with two other partners, and my question really is about equity levels. Here's the story so far...All three of us have been working for a university  and for various reasons we all have decided to move away from the academic world and go in industry. One of the partners (let's call him X) has good links with industry in China and he managed to bring money over to start a project, which is the design and development of a point-of-care device. The contract terms between the university and the funding company made clear that any IP arising from this work will belong to the company, with us three being the named inventors in the patents generated.<p>They were happy with the outcome and through X's prior links with company (X is a board member in the company) it was agreed to form a new company. They agreed to invest around £300k in return for about 40% stake in the new company. The remaining 60% would be divided as follows: 20% for X (he claims he had bought in the past seven patents from his previous company which went into liquidation, investing £120k - later he said it was actually £150k), 20-25% for options for other paeople that will eventually join the company at a later stage) and the remaining 15-20% for myself and the third partner.<p>At this point I need to point out that myself and the third partner are making things happening (in terms of engineering) and without us it would impossible (or at least it would take a lot of time for him to build a new team) to start the company now. Also, it is important to note that X has no other option but to leave university, as his contract is due for re-evaluation in September, with negative predictions for the outcome.<p>Some more info about the forecast of the new company: we will be using the manufacturing facilities of the funding company and we will have direct access to their sales network, They say the market is already there, they have clients and last year they had a turnover of more than $10m (it might be more, i can't remember accurately). My salary will be slightly less than the market value (probably around £35k/yr) and I suspect X will be asking for a lot more, as he takes for granted that he will be the technical director and acting CEO of the company.<p>There are many details that we're not told of, because X is taking the excuse that his contact in he funding company does not speak English fluently, that's why all their conversations are in Chinese. We get the occasional email in English circulated among all of us, but nothing mentioning stake levels. I feel I'm heading straight towards a not-so-good deal, while I know for a fact that X will not go below 20% as he immediately points his finger towards his £150k investment in previous patents, while making claims of the type ""I have achieved with great efforts your involvement in the new company as co-founders with a stake, rather than just employees"". I have started to grow tired of his bull and I'm trying to figure out how I can go about sealing a good deal for me. I have previously discussed with him the matter of equity, as one day he came to us and said ""when the time comes to decide equity, you must be modest"" and at that point I told him that modesty has no place in business, I will only be fair and I won't settle for anything less than fair, I will literally walk away if I'm not happy with what's offered to me.<p>I have the feeling that this is the ONLY time I can bargain with him, or them (the funding company), as this is the only time I feel that if i break the team, he won't be able to go ahead, at least not according to his time plans. I'm fighting with myself, as one side of me wants to grasp this opportunity of potentially making enough for the rest of my life, while my other side is telling me that X is trying to manipulate the whole situation based on the trust he has with the funding company, and that without him they wouldn't invest, which is probably true. Still, I can't trust him, at all.<p>Apologies for the long story, I just needed to draw, with as much detail as possible,the whole picture. I would appreciate any thoughts you might have, I desperately need some advice from people who understand business. I'm very good at what I'm doing but when it comes to business, it's all chinese to me....<p>Thank you in advance.<p>S.",1246652674

What I'd like to do is repeat the RAND experiment. Take a large group of people at random, and give them different amounts/types of health care. Measure their health outcomes.<p>This will at least give us some data to make a more informed choice.",1246651533
