Or the weekend before that.<p>Road life is measured in hours.  I'll find myself telling somebody a story of this amazing thing that happened earlier on my trip, possibly in another country, and suddenly realize that it was only 3 days ago.  A month of travelling compresses so much life into such a short span that it's really strange checking in with friends back in the world that can account for that same month with a single sentence.<p>There are times when life in the 'states can approximate that (the first weeks of a new startup for instance), but it's so easy to drop back into steady state where life is measured in calendar time.",1246611491

685797,comment,685565,685601,0,0,batterseapower,,,"PDGC would make a lot of sense as the GC system for Haskell.<p>The key change you need to make to the RTS is, when you evaluate a thunk, rather than overwriting it with the final value, instead append the evaluated value to the thunk. Then, the GC should be free at any time to erase the ""evaluated"" part of the thunk if doing so would allow it to free up a lot of memory.<p>When a thunk is entered it should return the evaluated value if present, otherwise it should use the code pointer and closure data to create the evaluated value again.<p>The key challenge is designing the algorithm that decides what is beneficial to lose references to. Probably you want to keep some stats around about frequency of access of thunks and so on.<p>I haven't seen anything like this proposed for Haskell, so I would be interested in reading a paper, should you implement it :-)",1246610602

This library is being written to prevent companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google to have sole control over being able to write social applications that use their friend graph. With Connr - anyone can write an application that works out of the box with all social networks.<p>The concept is very simple - find all common links by matching lists of friends across networks and use XMPP to handle the communication. But we hope to abstract the functionality enough to make development easy.<p>We are two Indian undergrads working on this project and need feedback from the developers of various social applications,<p>You can see a rough diagram of what we have in mind here: http://anirudhsanjeev.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/connr2.png<p>Or read my initial write-up here, with some more details:\nhttp://anirudhsanjeev.org/project-connr-easy-open-cross-network-communication-framework/<p>I have an immense respect for the insight and experience of the HN Community and would really appreciate your advice and feedback.<p>Thank you.",1246610206

One resolution:<p>One can imagine an abstract model of a concrete physical object (e.g. a lever; a geometry; a count of objects) and then ignore the concrete reality, and become so fully immersed in the abstraction that one loses track of time. I suggest that this is a form of mindfulness. Thinking about an abstraction is not <i>necessarily</i> mindful: it can be done in a non-mindful way by being constantly distracted by other concrete objects or other abstract models. Mindfulness is <i>flow</i>.<p>The ""future"" is a abstract model, and so the above also applies to it.<p>For human beings, these imagined interior worlds - be they abstractions of objects or of the future - as just as much a reality as the physical world.
