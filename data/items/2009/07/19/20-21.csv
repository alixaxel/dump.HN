Our brain filters out some large percentage of it's input, to keep from being overloaded.  It filters out what it's already familiar with.<p>As a kid, you're not familiar with much.  A yield sign is interesting, for example, and you notice it.  Later, you see a yield sign, and can't even remember you saw it.<p>If you travel to Australia, and the yield sign says ""Give Way"",you notice it again.  That's why travel is so memorable.  Your brain filters less when you're in unfamiliar territory filled with new perceptions.<p>As we get older, unfamiliar things and new perceptions are fewer and fewer, so we're getting less input per unit time.  Thus it seems that time is passing faster.<p>My own philosophy, which I often forget to follow, is to optimize my perceived lifespan by doing as many unfamiliar things as possible.  Unfortunately, sometimes I just want to get a hamburger instead.",1248036993

713390,comment,712975,713274,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>five(-ish) years ago, you might well have faced the choice between using Perl and using Rails for a similar project. That decision would have proved fateful.</i><p>Let's keep some perspective here. Rails, Django, and the various Perl frameworks each have their rabid partisans, but they represent fairly tiny variations on a single theme: Client-server web applications. There is very little danger in overspecializing in any one of these. You can move from one to another with ease. They employ similar concepts, by necessity. The HTTP and the SQL and the CSS knowledge all transfer over. The browser is still the browser. My god, I <i>wish</i> the browser was changing fast enough that I risked becoming a dinosaur!<p>I suspect that there is far more danger of overspecializing in, say, MySQL than of overspecializing in Rails. Databases are huge, complex beasts with real differences in their implementation and operation, and they can have profound impact on the performance of your app. (Just ask an experienced Oracle DBA. He or she will talk your ear off, as happened here on HN the other week.) The difference between the various brands of glue that we use to stick our databases to our web servers? Not as fundamental as we'd all like to think. The stuff I do today is not much different from what I and my colleagues were doing in AolServer Tcl in 1999. (Now <i>that</i> is dinosaur web technology!)<p>The <i>real</i> danger of becoming a dinosaur happens at a higher level. I'm a professional PHP programmer now, god help me, but I'm not afraid of missing out on the Great Django Revolution: When Django is finally ready to call my colleagues and I, I'll listen, and I'll probably understand what it's saying because it'll still be speaking the language of server-side web apps. The real danger is that one day I'll wake up and realize that the interesting problems have moved off the web server entirely and that all the fun is in standalone Javascript apps, or iPhone apps, or Microsoft Surface 3.x apps, or Scala applications embedded in your shoes, and server-side web app development has become about as exciting as Internal Revenue data processing (which it resembles in many ways).<p>When I really want to <i>diversify</i>, I'll look at Javascript or Objective C or embedded systems programming. I won't look right next door. That's too easy. Alas, this means that my track record of never getting around to learning Python may continue. :(",1248036943

You can form processes to govern the engineering, you can compute some things to be just right, you can make some nice tradeoffs and eventually you're finished. You could build a bridge like that. You could build a GUI like that. Or the 10th website of similar functionality. Or the 100th half-assed C-library replacement because your project can't or doesn't want to depend on the standard C lib on all platforms.<p>Most importantly, basically, much of what could be engineered often gets automated. Programming always happens on the edge of unmanageable complexity and anything less than that gets quickly automated. That leaves very little to be engineered. Basically you engineer something if you insist on not being lazy and doing it by hand.<p>Throw in a ""minor"" scalability requirement, or a guaranteed response latency of less than X milliseconds, or some ""easy"" dynamic ""addition"", or some ""basic"" interoperability mechanism to another program, and suddenly your engineerable bridge must be designed to support a million tonne UFO the size of Manhattan that keeps gleaming in the temperatures of several thousand Kelvin.<p>To conclude: Software engineering does happen but only after the software has been written enough many times so that we actually have experience in doing it, and often for only a short while until the engineering part can be automated and programmers released to work on something more complex.<p>Software is so tricky that you don't want to redo it too many times unless you really, really have to.",1248036564

713368,comment,712858,713032,0,0,akeefer,,,"What would those metrics be, though?  Pretty much every metric anyone has ever come up with to ""measure"" software development has been worthless, and it doesn't look like that trend is going to be broken soon.  It's like trying to apply metrics to writing a novel.  After a certain point, if something doesn't work you have to accept that maybe it's just a bad idea, and I think we're well past that point with software development and metrics.<p>About the only useful metrics I know of are all end-state sorts of things:  bug counts and regression rates, number of satisfied users versus dissatisfied users, number of successful implementation projects versus failed implementations, and whether you can generate real revenue or business value.  As soon as you start trying to look at things like number of lines of code, ""function points"" implemented, coupling metrics, test coverage metrics, etc. it tends to start distorting your development efforts, and the harder you push on formalisms and hard metrics the worse it gets.  Pretty much any metric in software is really a way to get at some unmeasurable underlying thing like ""quality"" or ""rate of progress,"" but they're always easily gamed.  It's like standardized tests and education:  the more you push on ""accountability"" and standardized test scores, the more teachers teach strictly to the test, and the less the kids actually learn.  Similarly, of the best ways to destroy a software project is to guide the development based on metrics.<p>I think you get much better results if you approach software as a design process, which is inherently unpredictable and non-repeatable, instead of as a manufacturing process where predictability and repeatability are the desired goals.  As much as the word ""agile"" has come to be almost meaningless these days, that's really the original insight behind it:  on a fundamental level, software development is an unpredictable, non-repeatable design process, and so the best you can do is to expect that to happen and build in ways to deal with that, rather than instead trying to exert more control.",1248036231

That's why God invented Capacitors, Inductors, and Bank Ledgers.  To smooth over the instantaneous fluctuations in the system.  However, long term, the capacitor needs replenishing.  Long term, a nation better produce more than it consumes, to make up for the times it produces less, and for the inefficiencies in the system.

But: No. Obviously not. We've still got a lot of brave people. Ask a New York firefighter.<p>As the astronauts themselves would probably have hastened to point out at the time, there were half a million U.S. troops in Vietnam even as Armstrong was stepping onto the moon. Some of those troops lived with much higher stress, for much longer, than any astronaut. The same is true for many soldiers working today.<p>No, NASA's problem has everything to do with gravity and economics and little to do with a shortage of heroes.",1248034303

Basically, this is making bike riders go slower so that they can ride longer and put some small amount of power into a bus.<p>However, what some gyms are doing is hooking up essentially the same thing to their stationary bikes, and hooking those up to their power grid.

713331,comment,713056,713056,0,0,gojomo,,,"There is a conflict between letting people use tags for whatever meaning is natural to them, and mildly enforcing a 'consensus' meaning.<p>I'm currently working on a system where starting a tag with a specific character implies 'consensus definition'. Each such tag has a corresponding wiki page where users can hammer out the common standards for its use/meaning.<p>For now, the special character is ':' -- the '#' of '#hashtags' presents problems mapping into neat URLs.<p>So for example, the tag 'photowalk' would mean whatever each user individually intends it to mean. There's no expectation of common meaning, even though in many cases a useful concordance may occur (as in any mixed personal/public tagging system). OTOH, ':photowalk' means exactly what the matching /wiki/:photowalk page documents it to mean. If you use it incorrectly, people and the system will nudge you to clean up your usage. (In particular, later users can essentially nullify your mistaken tag in a manner analogous to correcting a wiki edit, by applying a '-:photowalk' tag.)",1248033910
