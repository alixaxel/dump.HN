I use Github extensively, for things that are totally unsuited for Launchpad.<p>But since you asked, I do have some next step ideas for Github. When a project has a lot of forks, there's no quick way to know, especially as a <i>user</i> of that project, what the differences are between all the forks: which is canonical, which is most mature, etc. Also, development tends to fragment because there isn't much of a social link between forks, besides the network graph.<p>I'd like to see each project family have a single community hub with features similar to individual projects: wiki, bug tracker, etc. This would be used both to support users and coordinate developers. To keep it user friendly, put the wiki in front. Bonus if you can detect duplicate projects imported from other hosts and keep them in the same community.",1248202650
716674,comment,716546,716637,0,0,jerf,,,"One key difference is that each individual lump of ""socialism"" (not the best word but it will do) is replaceable, and each of them can and will die while the larger capitalistic system will survive. Moreover, should one unit become particularly abusive, it can be punished without wrecking the whole thing.<p>Another is that even if most people choose hierarchy because it works, you remain free to try something else. (Within reason. I notice publicly traded companies do have some constraints on their organizational structure which do tend to force you towards hierarchy whether you like it or not.)<p>In a truly socialist society, there is only one unit: The government. This unit can not be replaced when it fails, because it will admit no replacements. It can not be punished, because it is the punisher. All units grow old and decrepit, the government is no exception, and when it happens, you just get stuck.<p>The problem is not socialism, hierarchy, or ""any"" centralization. It's in promoting one unit to the top (be it ""government"" or ""corporation"") and breaking all mechanisms for replacing it in the misguided impression that the system has attained and will forever keep perfection. (When the real trick to creating a sustainable government and maintaining freedom is in concentrating on how to make it <i>easy</i> for a certain amount of replenisment, renewal, and change to occur without the whole thing breaking.)<p>Following up on this and indirectly replying to some other threads, it is rather disgusting to pin ""fascism"" on some social conservatives at the very moment that social liberals are trying to convert our medical system to fascism, have taken a lot of steps to make our automotive industry fascist, and are generally favoring huge centralized financial systems with all the power located in companies where the line between ""company"" and ""government"" is increasingly hard to find. If the conservatives are calling for fascism of various stripes, which for the sake of argument I'll accept without question, the liberals are <i>doing</i> it. Right now.<p>Maybe it'll get undone once the crisis is past... but what are the odds?",1248202573

Then it uses a rhetorical sleight of hand to tar all corporations with the brush of syndicalism, equating Mussolini's psuedo-nationalized sham companies with (I guess) the S&P 500, and pronouncing the WSJ Editorial Page as a bastion of fascist thought.<p>It concludes by suggesting that people who disagree with the author are --- well here I'll just quote: ""you support dictatorship in any form, and oppose democracy, you are anti-american, a traitor, and scum.

That was always such a conflict in my mind, since we are all busy around the clock. But here these guys were worried, but not doing anything about it.
