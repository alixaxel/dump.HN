The campaign mode and missions are not yet present in the version available right now. However, you may buy a discounted license today, which will unlock the features of all future versions up to and including the final with the full campaign in it!<p>As we at Data Realms continue to release more complete builds of the game, we will also be reducing the discount gradually until we reach the final version and full price of the product. So the earlier you buy, the better value you get!

They are either using YouTube as part of a social media campaign or advertising within some user content hosted on YouTube.<p>It's not clear at all what's happening on their balance sheet, so speculation will continue.
