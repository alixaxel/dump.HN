Here's the paragraph that concerns me.<p>""Democrats, who initially sought tax increases, said they had managed to ward off cuts proposed earlier by Republicans that would have been catastrophic to the state's social safety net.""<p>Here's the problem.  The only way they could both cut spending and ""preserve the safety net"" is to cut rates. Because the ""safety net"" is a series of programs and if they aren't cutting the programs they have to be cutting what they pay for the programs. Meaning they're planning to pay less to the agencies that service the children, elderly and mentally ill who survive because of the state's safety net.<p>But a look at any non-profit angency's books will tell you they barely get by as it is.  So suddenly these agencies are on the verge of collapse which is something that simply can't happen.  You can't have children, the elderly or the mentally unbalanced thrown out onto the street en masse.<p>So what happens?  The state is forced to go over budget to keep these agencies alive.  So they increase the rates, and we're back to the same problem.  I'm as against tax hikes as the next guy but I suspect this resolution will be next to meaningless.",1248161794
