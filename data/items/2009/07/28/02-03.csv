For this you are paid between $60k and $200k per year.  As part of this job, you are expected to publish papers which document your original work for the benefit of mankind.  Any professor who doesn't put any and all work they do while employed by a public university into the public domain (or the closest thing allowed by their university) is the lowest of the low.  I can't describe how I feel about such a person without a very large amount of swearing.<p>Suppose someone came to your house and tell you that they want to work on a way to make your electric bill go down, but unless you give them some money up front they won't have enough time to both hold down an outside job and work on your electric bill.  Then, after a while, you ask them how it's going.  They tell you that you can see the results of their work if you pay them $50.  That is exactly what some people do, except they collect less money and collect it from way more people.  Dirtbags.",1248749850

I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.<p>I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<p>Using only a hoe  and a large glass  of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous  documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension  bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang-gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair  electrical appliances free of charge.<p>I am  an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over  my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been  caller number nine and have  won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured  New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat.400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.<p>I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food  item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA.<p>I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I  successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The  laws of physics do not apply to me.<p>I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life  but  forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and  a toaster oven. I  breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan,  cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.<p>But I have not yet been to college.",1248749605

727332,comment,726376,726376,0,0,cullenking,,,"It is important if you ever plan on writing software that works well.  For example, I am working on an application that draws routes on Google Maps.  There are points that comprise the route, and the points have data associated with them.  I wanted to be able to mouse over the map and have the nearest point on the route highlighted and populate a headsup display with the information it contained.  This is a non-trivial problem to solve efficiently.  You can do it the naive way and just linearly search all the points on the route on every mousemove event, however, that can be hundreds of thousands of comparisons a second for a long route.  However, if you use an efficient data structure for multi-dimensional searching, like a k-d tree, you can find the point in 20 or so comparisons for a large route.<p>The best part is that data structures like a k-d tree are rarely covered in higher ed CS programs.  However, if you have a core competency with algorithms and data structures, finding the appropriate data structure or algorithm and implementing it becomes so much easier.<p>Even the simplest data structures to implement, like a linked list, come in handy.  In the same application, I had need for a linked list structure however flash has none.  However it was trivial to cook up (after all the work on the k-d tree), and 30 minutes later I was in business.<p>stevecooperorg said it best: if you want to just glue crap together, then probably not.  However, even ""gluing things together"" can be assisted by these concepts!  My mapping application could be considered ""gluing"", however to do a novel job and make it more than the competition, you have to have the extra bit of knowledge.",1248749133

He's talking about business success, not how you spend your time.  There are plenty of people who create products for small markets and can't make the growth jump past that early small market into a larger one.  This isn't always (or even OFTEN) a feature-creation problem.<p>Here's some cool math: If your acquisition is linear (""we sign up 3 paying customers every day"") and your churn is percentage (""we lose 8% of our paying customers every month"") you will eventually hit a point where your growth STOPS (unless you can fix one of those two stats).  The zombie state Drew is talking about (I think) it where your revenue is largely not growing, you can feed yourself but no one is ever going to buy you, and you've run out of ""move-the-needle"" features/efforts that can improve acquisition or retention.

There are also people who claim it helps to dump them into boiling water, then turn the heat off, and they can then soak for much less; this also fails in my experiments.<p>I believe that dry beans have to soak a long time cold because you want them to actually start to sprout.  (I know from experimenting that dry beans are still alive and can be planted.)  I think, like malt grain in beer making, they need to start to activate so they make the enzymes that are going to turn all the starch to sugar; then when you slow cook it, those enzymes work and break everything down a lot more.<p>Also, I think if you cook on a wood stove you will find that too hot is more of a problem.

Usually, API access needs to be mediated through additional logic (authentication, access control, rate limiting, etc.).<p><pre><code>  Forcing all of that logic into template tags is just silly.\n</code></pre>\nI have to admit that I don't really know what you're getting at here. If you do have a case that's as simple as ""use another template"", well, you use another template. If you don't, no amount of program logic in templates is going to save you.<p>Anyway, here's how I see it:<p>1. Django's template language is designed to permit enough logic to handle presentation, and to be easily extensible for cases where you need something more.<p>2. Jinja is designed to permit quite a lot of free-form programming constructs, and is not particularly easy to extend when you run up against a wall.<p>These are fundamentally different approaches to ""templating"", and what I've found is that people who prefer, say, Jinja tend to just use it and move on. The people who stick around to argue are the ones who think that some particular tag or extra bit of logic should be made available by default in Django, and so are arguing about differences of degree rather than differences of kind.",1248747072

Because its easier in large batches (I use 2# of beans at a time), I divide any I don't use immediately into quart containers and keep them in the fridge, or even freeze them.  That way I have it readily available, usually in a fair selection, when I want them.  I have been thinking about beans and rice a lot lately since I got laid off a few weeks ago.<p>Also cooking time varies by types of beans.  Roman beans are probably the quickest.  Limas, great northerns, black beans, and pintos in between.  Kidney beans never seem to really get done, which is why they are often used in chili, you can simmer the chili for hours without kidney beans cooking apart.",1248746848
