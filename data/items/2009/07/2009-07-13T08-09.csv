Material and methods<p>Subjects.<p>[Ethical committee disclaimer]. [All subjects] were screened for morningness or
eveningness according to their timing preferences as defined by two questionnaires
(MEQ (1) and MCTQ (2)). The two groups were matched according to age, sex and
educational level and did not differ in their anxiety and depression levels as well as in
sleep quality and day time sleepiness (all ps > 0.1; Table S1). Morning and evening
types significantly differed in their scores on the two chronotype questionnaires
(MEQ and MCTQ). Exclusion criteria were reports of medical, psychiatric and sleep
disorders, medication or drug consumption, alcohol abuse, excessive caffeine
consumption or physical activity, shift work within the three past months, and
transmeridian travel or disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle within one month before
the experiment.<p>Design and Procedures.<p>An overview of the study design is illustrated in Fig. 1 of the main text. Individual
times were scheduled according to each volunteer’s preferred sleep and wake timing.
Criteria for such timing preferences included sleep schedules adopted on free days as
assessed by the MCTQ (2) and after interviewing the subject to ensure that the
scheduled timing was as close as possible to the schedule that he or she would
spontaneously adopt. In a second step, the screened subjects came to the sleep facility
for a habituation night. After this night, they were asked to follow the sleep schedule
(± 30 minutes) they would spontaneously adopt while free from any social and
professional constraints. Target bedtimes and wake times were determined for a sleep
duration of about 8 h (± 30 minutes). To assess the subjects’ compliance to the
selected rest-activity patterns, motor activity of the non-dominant arm was recorded
using actimeters the week prior to the experimental sessions along with sleep-wake
logs. After this week under actimetry recording, subjects came to the sleep laboratory
for 2 consecutive nights. The precise schedule of each session was individually
adapted according to the subject’s habitual bedtime on the basis of the mean timing of
the subject’s sleep midpoint derived from actimetric data of the preceding week.<p>Subjects reported to the laboratory 7 hours before habitual lights off on day 1. After
the hook-up of the electrodes, they continuously stayed under controlled conditions in
dim light (< 10 lux) in order to avoid the influence of bright light on circadian
rhythmicity parameters (3) and in the aim to equalize pre-scan conditions between
subjects. Subjective sleepiness (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Karolinska
Sleepiness Scale (KSS (4))) and objective vigilance (a modified version of the PVT
(5)) were assessed at hourly intervals while awake. Furthermore, hourly collected
saliva samples were assayed for melatonin using a direct double-antibody
radioimmunoassay validated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy with an
analytical at least detectable dose of 0.65 pg/ml (6). Circadian phase was estimated
by the calculation of the mid-range crossing time of salivary melatonin (7, 8). For
each individual curve, the maximum value and the minimum value was averaged
(mid-range value pg/ml) and taken to determine the mid-range crossing time (time of
day, h) on the abscissa.<p>Polygraphic data (see below) were recorded during the nights preceding fMRI
sessions. After lights off, subjects were allowed to sleep for 8 hours. Then, 1.5
(morning session) and 10.5 (evening session) hours after wake up of scheduled sleep
timing, they underwent a fMRI session during the practice of various cognitive tests,
including the psychomotor vigilance task on which we focus here. For half of the
subjects, the morning session followed the first experimental night and the evening
session the second night, whereas for the other half of the volunteers the morning
session followed the second experimental night and the evening session the first night.
Subjects were allowed to leave the facility between the two experimental nights. They
stayed in the laboratory under dim light conditions (<10 lux) for at least 4 hours
before the scanning sessions (see dashed line in Fig. 1). They wore protective glasses
avoiding excessive light input when going to the scanner room.<p>The order of selected cognitive tasks was counterbalanced across subjects and
sessions. Before the start of the experimental protocol, all subjects underwent a short
habituation scan session in order to familiarize them with the noise and the body
positions associated with the fMRI environment.",1247474699

After that, this logic flows simply and inexorably.)<p>Till this point, I thought you were defending Swoopo and your logic actually made sense to me because the parties involved in the auction have different valuations. If a person spends USD 10 bidding on a product, the mere possibility of having a USD 1200 product for such a low price may be more valuable to him than Swoopo's valuation of the transaction (USD 10). Plus the suspense and thrill adds to the valuation by the bidder :)",1247474622

But I'm sure you can find examples at all ratios.<p>I'll look at what I use. Both Weebly & Dropbox (I use the free of both) follow a true freemium model. IE, they both offer a perfectly usable free version. I'm not sure what percentage they do, but 1% - 10% sounds about right to me, especially if you discount those who are really sampling vs those who actually use.<p>I also use Gmail & Gdocs. These are theoretically freemium too, but at a much higher free/paid ratio.<p>You're going to see quite a lot in the professional/business software category. My explanation for this is that it is software people pay for. If you can sell your software/service, maybe can probably sell it with a freemium model.<p>If you can't sell it (eg photo sharing/search/etc.), maybe you just can't sell it. Freemium isn't magic.<p>The percentage has to relate to your marginal costs in some way. Even 1:2000 can be fine if your marginal costs are zero. You care about conversion rates only inasmuch as you care about absolute numbers.<p>*I recoiled a little when I read Anderson quoting an actual ratio. I think that it's a bit off. But I do think segmenting businesses by their ratio would be an interesting way of looking at them. A 5% business isn't following the same model as a .01% one.",1247473535
