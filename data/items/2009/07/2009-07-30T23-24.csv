The hardware is built to a uniform worldwide standard (established and enforced, during its crucial early years, by a single company: Microsoft) and is developed with money that is recouped by selling millions of units to Windows users.<p>In the phone market, such a large, self-perpetuating commodity hardware platform has yet to evolve. The market is heavily balkanized. It's under the control of multiple carriers whose rules determine exactly what will be sold and where. It's a rather different universe from that in which Linux evolved.",1248998208

733386,comment,733255,733280,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"There is a big difference between books and music/video. With books, it is not only the content but the medium that is part of the experience.<p>A paperback is lightweight, cheap, durable and independent of other resources. Most importantly, a book as an experience is a long, drawn out affair. Books take hours to enjoy, so it's of little importance how many I can carry at a time.<p>Music/movies have the opposite effect ~ they are shorter durations of entertainment, so the more I can carry, the more I can enjoy the experience. The major advantage of digital music is that I can carry my whole library with me in my pocket. Even if I could do this with my bookcase, there is little reason for me to do so. This defeats one of the major advantages of kindle.<p>I don't disagree with anything you say, but I don't think the death of the book will happen any time in our lifetime, or our children's lifetime to be honest.",1248998176

These people don't trust you and/or your boss(es) any further than they can throw you. I don't blame them frankly. There have been far too many examples of why they are correct not to.<p>So these other people figure that the best way to safeguard their money is to make sure that you and your co-workers are legit. The only way they can do that though is by hiring yet more people to ensure that you actually tell them the truth about what is happening to their money. It's these third parties, the ""auditors"", that run most large companies.<p>Auditors have found that there is a certain set way of running companies that tends to result in the least amount of risk to the money that funds the operation. The money that belongs to someone else. Auditors ensure that the company is run according to these principles.<p>Ergo: the fact that some rimjob 3 states over once used iTunes to and IM to run a kiddie porn distribution ring or whatever and caused heartache for the money suppliers of that company means that the Auditors concluded that IM and itunes pose a risk to the other people that supply the money for your company: hence, you aren't allowed to use itunes as a matter of policy.<p>It gets even better when the government gets their hands sticky as well. Because then you get crap like Sarbanes/Oxley that basically makes being a criminal more difficult by making everything more difficult.<p>Public companies are not about the product/customer relationship. They are about the investment/investor relationship. You are the investment. Your job is to provide a moderate to excellent growth rate for as little risk as possible.<p>This is why public/large companies have little incentive to innovate in the same way start ups can, as an aside.",1248997422

Not so much, especially if there is a flowerpot.ny.us.

Let's say 95% of the characters are between 65 and 90, and every now and then there's a 44-32 pair. Then your program could be pretty sure that 44-32 is a delimiter, and that 65 and 90 are the ranges of characters used in keywords.

It isn't very practical at all, I think, and you probably want to look at more practical ways to list possible delimiters, etc...
