699482,comment,698754,698860,0,0,azanar,,,"This analogy is a bit off. Manhattan is no longer under a glacier for the same reasons cyclones form. Climate change has been a part of this planet's behavior for the whole time it has been inhabited by <i>any</i> forms of life. To complete the analogy, I wouldn't will us to put the heat energy from the cyclone back into the tropical ocean that fueled it.<p>For that matter, modern life already tolerates deep, profound respect for processes on this planet. Research being done right now into the formation of tornadoes in the plains every spring is being done with the goal of greater detection. Tornado <i>prevention</i> is not something I hear a whole lot about; the goal is to get people out of the way while something of immense energy plows through a region.<p>Building tornado shelters, much like building stilted houses along the coast, or buildings ables to withstand repeated ground waves along the West coast, are a result of people coming to understand these forces and how they behave. This to me rings of a pretty deep and profound respect; a recognition of something to be studied and understood, not just prevented, and maybe not even <i>to be</i> prevented once we understand the implications.<p>Maybe I <i>am</i> discounting too much the power of our ingenuity; maybe I am calling for too much humility. Perhaps, in time, we will discover a way to do what tropical cyclones do without unwanted side-effects. Depending, I might even want to help work on it. But I am not optimistic that we will.",1247342269

699468,comment,699146,699386,0,0,stcredzero,,,"""Worse is Better"" is just an inaccurate way of saying it.  More accurately, ""It's the Culture, Stupid!""<p>If a language fits a group's culture better, it will be adopted more.  Smalltalk lacked operator precedence for algebras -- big lose for the non CS sci/tech crowd.  At first Java had some of what Smalltalk had, but fit general programming culture better in terms of C-like syntax, free (beer) tools, and static types.<p>Lisp is close to timeless mathematics, but a bit farther away from everything else than everything else.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the AI field gravitated towards Lisp -- those guys were used to meta-abstraction.<p>Perl just threw every Unix tool there was into a burgeoning scripting Swiss-Army knife.  As a result, everyone in the Unix camp could relate to it instantly.<p>Worse is <i>not</i> better.  Better is better.  But designing to fit existing cultures has a big short-term payoff for a programming language.  This means a bigger user base, which means more eyeballs, more libraries, and other dynamics that also get you lots of Better.<p>The Best would be: a programming language that has a high fit with non-CS/programming sci/tech types <i>and</i> elegant design, first-rate implementation, <i>and</i> mathematical universality.",1247341093
699467,comment,698716,698855,0,0,sid,,,"Hmmm, i sometimes get that same kind of feeling though i always tell myself, ""no it should be ok"", they are trusted, smart, respect my privacy my data and benevolant ...<p>I store my emails using gmail, my code for my startup is backed up in my emails as a final restore point should something bad happen to my servers and source control, my design specs, tasks list are all stored within google document, my calculations and budgeting is done using googles spreadsheet. I still trust them and that is why i am still comfortable but to tell you the truth, the slightest glitch or security leak, or signs of <i>evilism</i> would really make me think twice.<p>To add to this discussion a few things i have noticed (could be my paranoia, but who knows ..). A while back during uni there was this company called bullant (not sure if anyone ever heard of them). They had a decent product which consisted of a browser and a backend VM engine. There were a few features of the backend engine that i thought were really good and nice to develop in and generated really great apps that could be delivered over the internet. However i think the product didnt fly because it required users to change and use their own proprietry browser, the change was to drastic for users, it wasnt gradual enough as many users were already used to mozilla/netscape and ie.<p>If i draw the comparisions sometimes i wonder if the introduction of chrome, the new V8 engine and all the hype of SaaS, whether this is a slow movement similar to what bullant all those years back tried to do. I wonder whether slowly and incrementally certain <i>really great</i> google apps will be just that tiny bit slower in ie or ff and slowly over time would certain features of the new great google app that everyone uses and loves stop working in those other browsers requiring us to all change to chrome to get the most out of it ? I sometims think whether the vision is that sometime in the future we all log into our linux/apple/windows computers and for 80% of the time fire up our chrome browsers go straight to our favourite google app saved in our favourites and no longer require 80% of the applications that we now have installed on our PC's ?",1247341033

699464,comment,698754,699171,0,0,azanar,,,"You read my call for education as a call for indoctrination. That's not what it is; it is a call for realizing the implications of our actions go deeper than just the immediate consequence, and that if we try to gain control over a system at a natural equilibrium, and attempt to pin it to a new equilibrium that is more convenient for us, we may disturb other equilibria as well. The consequences could be far worse than just leaving the system alone, and building our society to withstand it rather than control it. This is why many houses along the Gulf Coast are built on stilts.<p>At least in the case of tropical cyclones, I am having a really hard time believing that we will be able to prevent their formation, and still be able to emulate accurately all of the various effects they have on the planet. We'd have to build systems to advect heat from the ocean to the mid-atmosphere and mid-latitudes, rain to places where the storms no longer go. We'd have to find a way to prune all the weak trees these storms naturally prune. The same argument is made for the infrequent windstorms Seattle experiences; it keeps the forests healthy by knocking down the weak and sick trees. We've have to do this identification and pruning by hand, not just in the tree farms, but in <i>whole forests</i>.<p>This is the kind of education I'm hoping for. Not telling people we can't control nature and that is the end of that, but explaining, with as much depth as they would like into the theory, that attempting to define a new equilibrium for a particular system on this planet runs the risk of other equilibria being redefined as well, and also needing to be controlled; these in turn may redefine even more equilibria, ad infinitum. Maybe ""can't"" <i>is</i> the wrong word here, maybe what I mean to say is ""you don't want to"".",1247340965

I thought this was the greatest thing, so of course I bought it.<p>Then I started getting emails from Trent whenever they released something new or posted new tour dates. The emails were decidedly uncommercial... just plain text, as if he was emailing a group of friends. It's easy to dismiss other weekly emails (<i>ahem</i> Amazon and Borders) because of all the fancy graphics and marketing, but the NIN emails were both infrequent, personal, and very relevant.<p>So far, these emails have led me to buy The Slip, Niggy Tardust, the new Street Sweeper Social Club album, and attend two concerts. I'm definitely more involved as a fan, and love being told when things are happening, rather than having to follow the band's website.<p>I think the trick is not to overdo it.

699448,comment,698716,699192,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"WARNING: I'm not as paranoid as this post. Quite. ;)<p>I follow the arguments that computer processing power is cheap and getting rapidly cheaper at a surprising rate. Because of this, I don't want to constrain ideas of ""the worst"" thing that could happen to be limited to things I can imagine now. I doubt it would end up killing you, but information is power and giving out information about you is giving away power over you in exactly the way that some people feared photographs were capturing their soul.<p>(That is, within a small number of years, ""the worst"" thing could be very much worse, and in unpredictable ways).<p>However, let's see:<p>1) ""Government does bad things, made worse by Google's position and power"" scenario --> Governments use phone companies to track ""terrorists"" by who calls who and what is said (or is rumoured to - see Echelon). It's not too far fetched that they could forge links with Google for Google to flag up suspicious persons by net activity (See recent story about German legislation mandating that ISPs block a list of pornographic websites. They could mandate Google.de to be included), and the list of triggers could be secret. So far so good, but ... a change in public opinion, a terrible government gets in power and starts adding more triggers based on the kneejerk fears of the day. Are picked up by it because you were reading an unusual amount about medical fraud? Because you were in the vicinity of a known communist's house thrice in a week (picked up by your GPS mobile phone)? Because of your religion, gender, sexual orientation, political leanings?<p>2) Techno-illiterate courts legislate that Google's information hoard is in the public interest and must be made publicly available. Anyone can now search all that stuff about you, all your emails, their contents. Have you ever wanted a stalker? Have any jealous friends? Is there nothing you would like to forget? Think employer-employee profiling, discrimination and bullying can't get much worse?<p>3) Nobody emerges as a Google sized competitor. Google becomes the de-facto choice for advanced image, video, audio processing. Google announces Google CCTV - desirable for companies because of the unlimited storage, web accessibility and tremendous analysis capability. Voices are transcribed, people are tracked, identified by sight, motion, limb length, gait... Soon all companies use GCCTV. Soon local councils do. Soon dflock can be tracked across systems. Google acquires eyes all over the country. Google starts population-scale experiments in secret. Can they predict where you will be? Can they, by dint of showing you different adverts, search results, articles with different slants <i>influnece</i> where you will be? Which stores you shop in? Who you phone? Which way you vote?<p>3.1) Voice control hasn't really got much further. Microsoft, Dragon Dictate, Apple, they're all roughly as good as they were. Google has been quietly training on youtube videos, GrandCentral phonecalls, GTalk calls, google mobile search. Theirs is much better. Any device from your satnav or car stereo to your TV or Kindle has Google Voice tie-in. Everyone loves it because you can talk in whole sentences and say things like ""remind me to watch XYZ on channel 123 on Sunday"" and it does. Google offer this for free because now they know what you're doing when you're not on the net - and what you're talking about when not directly addressing your devices. Goto (1) and (3).<p>4) Google starts accepting ""bribes"" by another name. CrummyLabs Sound Cards by some ad-words and they appear at the top of search results for Sound Cards. Not happy with this, they backhand a few more quid and their competitors results fall lower. Then vanish. Competitors drivers are nowhere to be seen. Forums discussing their competitors wind up on page 50. Reviews vanish. The only products you see, hear about, can easily purchase and get support for are those with ties to Google. Not just IT products though - why did you <i>really</i> buy that cooker? Google hires Derren Brown. You start to bank with Google Bank because ""it's the best free bank"" (well, that's why you think you bank with them).<p>5) It's 2025 and Google translate is as good as a human translator. All international business phonecalls go through Google Translate. All international <i>political</i> phonecalls go through Google Translate. Tranlsate isn't always completely honest and unbiased in its translations.<p>Information is power, Google's net is wide and growing wider. The more information flows through them, the more scope there is for them to do bad things, and the more incentive for legislative bodies, malicious employees, hackers, spies, to try to get their hands involved too. The worst thing that can happen is probably along the lines of you (us) being more and more a pawn in someone's business and political games, or being caught up in some witch hunt or having our lives ground up and spat out ruined by a juggernaut that doesn't even notice us.<p>We are buffetted by massive tidal forces now. Google is paving the way for those to be controllable, all the media forces synchronised and coherently pushing in the same ways. A laser not a light bulb.<p>(And if a sentient computer appears, which company do you think will spawn it? Which company has masses of computing power, masses of data, masses of smart people, masses of money, a corporate culture of machine learning and megascale processing?

US citizenship is only lost if the person expressly disavows US citizenship when or after becoming a citizen of another nation.  (US and international law no longer recognize the concept of ""nationless"" citizenry.)<p>The US does not recognize dual citizenship with hostile nations. The last-acquired citizenship is deemed the person's current citizenship.<p>The consequence of dual citizenship is that you pay taxes, if applicable, to both countries as citizens. (Many countries have different tax rates for non-citizens.)<p>Edit: Follow-up to the above post -- The US treats its passports as superior to those of other nations, which is why you are urged to use your US passport when traveling in or out the US. You do not actually have to turn over your other passport. Israel, for example, requires citizens to use an Israeli passport for expedited re-entry.",1247338926

What is in your opinion the best platform to interactively play around with software that manipulates images and that will have to show the results of the manipulations after each of several stages ?<p>Performance is somewhat important but since this is the prototype stage not paramount, I'd rather have a very good 'workbench' at the expense of performance.<p>Is there an open source framework for such projects ?",1247338816

Network architects (well the bad ones anyway) know what they need to do to the firewall to achieve connectivity but dont know what security side effects those changes have thus rendering the firewall put in place to have no effect at all. This equates to 1000's upon 1000's of dollars spent simply to be rendered useless by silly decisions. I guess having said this the fault is more heavily placed on the user and not the equipment in this case.<p>I think if you look at the plight of anti-sec the equipment and the software is as much to blame as the user controlling them in many of the cases",1247338811
