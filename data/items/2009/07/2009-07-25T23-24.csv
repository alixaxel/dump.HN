In certain cultures or countries women have been always well considered, but in others it's not so clear.<p>Housewives being inferior? No way. Being a housewife requires a lot of skill, energy and certain sacrifices that most modern women (me included) don't want to make. Managing a house is like managing your own little company. Except you cover 90% of the job positions at once. And generally cannot fire your ""employees"". Housewives really deserve a lot of respect. And a honor spot in the entrepreneur comunity :)<p>Anyway, that's the issue, precisely. We have on one side, a lifetime job, where you will most likely have to depend on someone to provide enough money to run it properly. On the other side, you can be independent by getting a job you might change whenever you feel like. Wouldn't you prefer traveling, have different job experiences, etc. while you're still young? We women actually can now make this choice between committing early to family or wait some more years (I think sooner or later our genetic code will push us to want a family).

723846,comment,722446,722446,0,0,tybris,,,"*sigh, doesn't it ever occur to anyone that a company that still makes billions in a deep recession, has the largest market cap of any IT company, has a share of over 90% in its main revenue markets, was until recently led by the richest man in the world, and only hires the world's brightest people, might not be stupid?<p>If a company wants to stay alive it needs to diversify and enter new markets. It shouldn't come as a surprise that Microsoft doesn't try to create new markets. Its core competency has never been innovation, it has always been outmuscling the competition in growth markets.<p>Many of the diversifications have been a success, with Internet Explorer being the flagship. Netscape showed the Web was going to be big, Microsoft entered the browser market to make it so. Internet Explorer was for a large part the catalyst that put a Windows computer (with Office) into every home in the late 90's.<p>The same thing happened when RealPlayer showed streaming video was going to be big. Microsoft decided to give its WMP product a boost and made it so. The multimedia possibilities further catalyzed sales of Windows PCs and Media Centers in particular.<p>At this point IE and WMP are no longer important since there are plenty of widely available alternatives that other people are developing freely for Microsoft. It is shifting its attention to other areas that could further fuel its software line. Azureus will establish a firm presence of Windows in the Cloud, while acting as a catalyst for new features in their corporate products like Office and Exchange.<p>Visual Studio, .NET, DirectX, etc. have all been major catalysts for the development of the largest software legacy in history, which means Windows will be in business for at least another 30 years.<p>Finally, Microsoft has entered a number of markets in which the only ""failure"" is that it didn't become market leader. Otherwise, many of these products are a success (Bing, Xbox 360, Zune, Game development, MSN). The added value in terms of diversification and building new products and expertise is also notable. The MSN/Live expertise is what allowed them to build Azureus, Bing and Office 2010.<p>The only area in which Microsoft really failed to win its battle is handhelds. Apple outwitted them with religious marketing and some UI novelties, Nokia/Symbian always managed to keep a tight grip on the phone market, and Google decided that the mobile OS itself can be a catalyst for its web products. This is not only a missed opportunity, but may also come to threaten Microsoft's dominance in other areas.<p>Overall. Microsoft is not evil, stupid, at the end of the road, or sliding downhill. It's the #1 IT company and very good at doing business.<p>(No, I use Linux about 90% of the time, use Opera, VLC and Gmail on all my machines and I don't own a copy of MS Office. It's just that I learned not to ignore the business part of IT.)",1248565556

723831,comment,723486,723610,0,0,fatdog789,,,"There are so many inaccuracies in that comment I don't know where to begin.<p>1) Contrary to popular belief, most prenups are not thrown out -- the only requirements for a valid prenup to survive legal challenge is that both the (future) husband and wife were separately represented by counsel, AND that both spouses disclosed ALL properties (real and personal) they possessed.  The validity of a prenuptial agreement is measured at the time it was signed, unless extraordinary circumstances justify re-evaluating it at the time of divorce -- and in such cases, the re-evaluation takes into account the relative importance of holdings.  For example -- a normal person selling a startup for millions is an extraordinary event.  Warren Buffet selling a company for millions is not.
<i>EDIT: Note that I am simplifying the requirements; the others involve a lawyer, so the lawyer will let you know what they are if you ever do a prenup.</i><p>2) Spousal support -- does not include money for the children.  It is solely to ""equalize"" income between the former spouses, <i>and can be readjusted on petition at any time by either spouse</i>.<p>3) Child support -- the custodial parent may not use child support for their own benefit (unless that benefit is incidental to the benefit to the child).  If the custodial parent does use child support for their own benefit, the non-custodial parent is entitled to reimbursement for that amount, and possibly a reduction in child support.<p>Interlude: Nas.  Nas is a millionaire.  He had a kid, with a woman, <i>and lived a lavish lifestyle</i>.  B/c of that, on divorce, his wife and kid get to continue living a lavish lifestyle via alimony (wife's standard of living during marriage) and child support (child's standard of living during marriage).  Lesson to learn: If you're rich, live a normal lifestyle and you won't pay (relatively) much in support.<p>4) Poor people -- whether black or white -- do not trust the legal system. The reasons are mostly obvious.   However, a good portion of it is that poor people base their understanding of the law on shows like Judge Judy and Jerry Springer, not realizing that these shows are staged and/or not real courts.<p>5) The divorce rate for first-time marriages is less than 30%. (20% is the figure I hear most often).  The divorce rate for people who have been married before increases by about 10-20% for each subsequent marriage.  If you take out the multiples, divorce is actually fairly uncommon.  
Note too, that the divorce rate amongst college-educated couples (both spouses) is less than half of the divorce rate amongst couples where neither spouse went to college (stats for first-time marriages).<p>5) Harsh divorce laws discourage divorce.  Think about it -- the easier and less painful it is too divorce, the more likely people are to go through with it.  Divorce rates jumped when no-fault divorce laws were passed.",1248564748
