But as I said in the reply above, it's not easy to determine just how many people in an area use craigslist.<p>That being said, I'm not sure the two categories have such a hard seperation between the users. People on craigslist who use it for finding prostitutes probably also use it to find housing and vice versa.",1234663060

If you're in a city, the 'quality' folks aren't generally using it and you'll waste a lot of time, money and silly dates to get anywhere. Especially now. Six years ago, you could make great friends in Boston on craigslist, for instance. Now? Enjoy that healthy dose of spam.<p>Out west, where it's not as populated or where it's long distances to find new folks, you can successfully find weird people or who have diverse (so there, considered strange) interests, but you're simply going to still waste a lot of time.",1234663011

481652,comment,481383,481614,0,0,markpercival,,,"Ok, to the first point, how do you determine the population of a city on craigslist? For example metro Atlanta has around 5 million people I think, while the actual city is ~600k. And some locations split out, such as LA and Orange County. I think the number of posts is both a good determination of population and usage rates. I'll agree though that it's not perfect, but I'm not sure there's an easy way to determine a ""housing metric"" for a craigslist city. It's hard to know the size of the surrounding area that uses the service.<p>As to the second point, the channels may differ, but a city that's affluent and embraces technology should see an proportionate increase on both categories, housing and erotic services. And LA has a great climate for ""hollering at cars"", while Boston should probably have the higher rate due to weather.<p>I'm certainly not going to argue that this analysis is anywhere near perfect, but I think you'd agree that Boston at 4% and LA at 24% is probably not just a matter of people moving more frequently.",1234662757

It was within a long discussion with a guy who kept complaining nobody had respected his accomplishment and wanted to hire him.   I wanted to tell him that he had to have feedback loop to align his and others' interest.  (And to be honest, I was already irritated to the guy at this point.) That was the context.<p>I don't deny that there are important problems worth to tackle even nobody seems to care about them.  But if you do so, you won't complain about nobody caring, will you?",1234662754

481649,comment,481383,481614,0,0,natrius,,,"Also, it assumes that usage of each category on craigslist increases at the same rate. Since housing and erotic services have strict separations between them on the site, it seems as if the network effects would be relatively (but definitely not completely) isolated to individual categories. Secondly, network effects increase the utility of the site logistically, so the ratios between different categories at a given point in time aren't meaningfully comparable.",1234662311

Breaking terms of a contract is none of that, therefore <i>""but if it's in Apple's contract that by buying their product you agree not to mess with it ... you don't buy the thing with intent to break the law""</i> is an incorrect frame to describe what happes. The correct frame if ""violating the terms of a contract"".<p>2. Breaking the terms of contract does not always lead to problems and is not always wrong - some contracts are unenforcable because they contradict a law, and some are plain morally wrong.

481634,comment,481311,481381,0,0,davetufts,,,"Saying that Roosevelt tried to ""stimulate the economy with government investment near the end"" of the Depression is a little misleading.<p>So is Krugman's statement about Hayek arguing, ""in the depths of the Depression"", against credit expansion.<p>This makes it sound like we were in the middle of the depression -- without any government intervention yet -- and suddenly the State decides to expanding credit. This is far from the truth. By the middle of the depression, say 1936, the government had already been intervening and expanding credit for seven years. Though I'm sure Hayek and Mises spoke out against such intervention on day one, anyone with half a brain would speak out against a policy that hadn't been working for seven years.<p>Hoover, like Bush, implemented massive government interventions. Both Hoover and Bush somehow get labeled as Economic ""do nothings"", but check Hoover's record: after the crash in 1929 he implemented massive trade tariffs (Smoot-Hawely), signed a ""Home Loan"" act to encourage more houses and protect against foreclosure (sound familiar?), raised income tax, raised corporate taxes, signed the ""Emergency Relief and Construction Act"" to fund massive infrastructure projects (like the Hoover Dam), etc...<p>Then, after Hoover's interventions, FDR came along and continued intervening with even larger, New Deal, programs.<p>Krugman's point of view does seem to be that FDR's New Deal started too late, but he, and other Keynesians, never explain why Hoover's 3+ years of interventions just made things worse. I'm with the Austrians on this one - If the State stayed out of the economy, these depressions and down-turns would fix themselves MUCH quicker.",1234661632
481633,comment,477955,478671,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"Every doctor I have been to in Austria has been superior to every doctor I have been to in the USA, with the exception of my ENT surgeon, who was a middle eastern immigrant to the US. (He was a top doctor in his field, taught at JHU, invented stuff, etc.)<p>The doctors in Austria take more time with you, they listen to you better, they come up with more novel solutions, and they seem to know more about other medical fields.<p>And here's why this is true:<p>a) free medical education. Yes, FREE. That means people who want to be doctors, can; the only requirement is that they can hold their own academically. That also means that when they complete their education, they are not saddled under $300k+ of debt, and thus are not having to hustle and scrimp for money.<p>b) a culture of service. Yes, really. Austria has a huge number of social workers -- nice ones, too -- and unlike in the US, there's a very solid mixture of men vs women. People can actually earn a decent living (thanks to socialism) helping other people.<p>c) a very different situation with insurance (everybody has it) and lawsuits (uncommon).<p>All of this combines to having a huge number of women doctors, and a huge number of doctors who are in it for passion and not for money, and doctors who are not afraid to just give you an atypical solution or who have to worry all the time whether the patient's insurance will pay for it.<p>And amazingly, it's cheaper than in the US sometimes, even if you pay out of pocket. I saw a top-rated dentist, got a 360 degree x-ray, he himself poked around in my mouth and proscribed an antibiotic -- and with the exchange rate, that whole thing cost me $180 US.

481620,comment,481498,481599,0,0,unalone,,,"Look, don't buy a computer based on what you think of the company. If you're serious about getting stuff done with your computer, get the best damn computer you can, regardless of company reputation, regardless of what other people think about it.<p>If you think that you can live with Ubuntu, with all its problems, then get Ubuntu - but get it because it's cheaper, because it's more tinkerable. Don't get it because of Apple's dickery. Of course Apple is a dick. They insist on having complete control over your user experience. As an Apple user, I will attest that I love it. Some people get a kick out of supermodding their computer. My cofounder loves Linux for that very reason. I like Apple because they do everything for me without thinking.<p>I think this case is over-the-top, but I don't necessarily disagree with Apple's reasoning. If I made a product that had a built-in application system designed to my specifications, I'm not sure if I wouldn't be pissed off at the people who wanted to get around that either. Jail time seems a bit over-the-top, but if it's in Apple's contract that by buying their product you agree not to mess with it, and I'm fairly certain that's been the deal since the iPhone came out, then you might not like that, but <i>if</i> you don't like it, you don't buy the thing with intent to break the law. You get a different phone, one that lets you modify and tinker with things. If you get caught, then you'd better have known that there was a chance of it happening from day one. It's risktaking: always has been, always will be.<p>People get into a bunch of arguments about evil and not-evil. It's not about <i>evil</i>. It's about <i>intent</i>. Apple's intent has always been to control every aspect of their product. They insist on controlling hardware - so you can't get OS X on another company's computer. They insist on controlling software - so you can't free up your iPhone. Some people disagree with that, but it's their prerogative as a company, and it's let Apple consistently create the best products in their respective markets with little debate. If that's evil, then I guess I'm evil, because I think they have the right and I wish more companies were that restrictive.<p>So think about that when you get your computer. Don't worry about all this bullshit arguing either way. Think about the computer itself.",1234660280
