The quote taken out of context in the article does make the tag sound like rather ridiculous though.<p>More from quirksmode.org:<p><i>I use it a lot in the great compatibility tables. These tables are very large and very tight, and I wish to avoid horizontal scrollbars, if possible. These scrollbars are mainly caused by the length of method or attribute names, for instance getElementsByTagName(). Therefore I do:<p><div class=""name"">getElements<wbr>ByTagName()</div><p>I give the browser the option of adding a line break. This won't be necessary on very large resolutions, when the table has plenty of space. On smaller resolutions, however, such strategically placed line breaks keep the table from growing larger than the window, and thus causing horizontal scrollbars.</i><p>I still won't be using it. :)",1234659305

481606,comment,481211,481331,0,0,jganetsk,,,"The simple answer is, they don't have a choice.<p>Some number of dollars flow into their country every year. Some number of dollars flow out. The difference effectively ends up in the hands of the government. They have to do something with it... because if they do nothing with it, they are effectively exchanging Chinese goods for nothing more than cheaply printed pieces of paper.<p>They government can't spend US dollars inside of China. The only thing they could do is buy American exports, and American assets.<p>If China were somehow to launch a stimulus plan that was fueled by American production, than that would have the effect you are suggesting. They could have Americans come over and build their roads and schools for them, with American materials. They would improve their infrastructure and we would get our money back. But this is impractical, and China gets the long-term benefits, not us. In fact, we get screwed in the long-term, because the return of all those dollars to America would cause inflation.",1234659163

481596,comment,481211,481331,0,0,baddle,,,"China relies on its ability to sell cheap goods to the world.<p>Problem : the more people buy Chinese goods, the higher the Yuan is supposed to get. Therefore, they would lose their initial competitive advantage, because a higher Yuan would mean more expensive Chinese goods. It's the classic path for any prospering country, at some point it has to become a ""normal"" rich country, adapting to a lower growth.<p>Solution : China buys a lot of US debt so it can artificially deflates its own currency. Because they sell a lot of Yuans, their currency is deflated = chinese good cheaper to the world = strong demand = especially from the US because of the stronger $, Americans can buy more Chinese goods.<p>You see it's a complex situation, and we can even argue it's a kind of win-win situation because Americans can afford more goods as well. But this strategy is unsustainable in the long run and could damage both countries if the worst case scenario happened.<p>Basically, China has been holding the ball underwater with the consent of the Bush administration, because of the susmentioned ""win-win"" deal. A lot of economists have been very critical of the former administration because such large amounts of money could put America at risk. Now that the crisis has stroke, this threat is more pertinent than ever.<p>Anyway, the Chinese governement has absolutly NO lesson to give to the Americans in this case, it was entirely their initiative and no one forced them to buy US debt, it was their own strategy, and it didn't come with any sort of guaranty that the $ would remain strong. The American people could blame the Bush administration for letting this situation happen tho, but everybody enjoyed it trough an increase in buying power.",1234658210

481592,comment,481577,481577,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This seems totally off topic for YC.<p>But, strangely enough, a handful of friends and I discovered this anatomical feature when we were kids...maybe seven or eight years old...and developed it to a pretty predictable art form.  We called it ""skeet"".  Which, in modern/adult terminology means something altogether different (though also involving bodily fluids).  I haven't done it, or tried it, in over 20 years.  So the ability seems to be completely atrophied, but I remember what it felt like now that I'm thinking about it.  I reckon I could make it happen again with a bit of practice.<p>And, so I don't actually know <i>how</i> to tell you to do it at will, but I know it can be done, because I've done it, and seen a few other kids do it.  Some were better than others (much longer range, and dramatically better accuracy), but I don't know if that was a factor of more practice or if some people are built significantly different.<p>Anyway, if a bunch of seven or eight year olds can figure out how to do it without guidance, I'm sure a grownup with a hackers mindset can handle it.",1234658083

In order to maintain the currency peg, and to actually get the US dollars from the hands of industry into the hands of the government... the Bank of China has to print lots and lots of money.<p>The entire phenomenon can be thought of as the USA exporting inflation to China.<p>On a smaller scale, this is actually a good idea. It's known as building a foreign currency reserve. It serves as buffer against inflation. If the Renminbi were to spiral out of control, they could adjust the peg, give US dollars back to the people in exchange for large quantities of Renminbi, and just retire the money. People would keep their holdings denominated in the dollar until things settled down with Renminbi. Every country has foreign currency reserves. In fact, with a stable foreign currency, building a foreign currency reserve is the safest way to inject money into an economy.<p>Generally, it is thought that Chinese holdings of American debt are far larger than necessary for an effective foreign currency reserve.",1234657328
