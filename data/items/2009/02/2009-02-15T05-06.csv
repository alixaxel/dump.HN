E.g. when you shut down a small instance after 61 minutes you'll pay for two hours.<p>Frankly I fail to see how this matters today or what kind of app he envisions where it could matter in the future.<p>1000 large instances set you back a measly $800 per hour. If your app needs elasticity to a degree anywhere near that then the spindown overhead will probably be the least of your worries. After all I cannot imagine a traffic pattern that would ""flicker"" at a second or even subsecond rate.We're rather talking about huge surges (slashdot effect) or the classic bell curve pretty much everywhere.<p>When you compare that $800/hr to the operating costs of running your own 25 fully stuffed racks then you'll still come out ahead by a large margin - with every opportunity for a spindown only adding to your advantage.",1234677196

Microsoft only has one genuinely cool product, the Xbox, so having one of those on a big LCD with Rock Band 2 for customers to play might be pretty awesome. But that doesn't make for much of a store. Seems like they'll need to fill it with third party products (that run their software of course) to have a shot.",1234676096

The truth is that they have only objected to arguments by the EFF that jailbreaking ought to be granted an exception to the DMCA.  The fact is that jailbreaking (which involves bypassing protections of a copyrighted work) is <i>already</i> subject to fines and jail time under the DMCA.<p>Now, one could argue that Apple's opposition to the change implies that they want fines and jail time for jailbreaking, but that doesn't reflect the content of Apple's objection (<a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/responses/apple-inc-31.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2008/responses/apple-inc-31.pd...</a>).",1234675460

For example; in the comments, someone asks where Jimbo Wales would be considered an entrepreneur and the author of the blog says that Jimbo Wales is <i>not</i> an entrepreneur, because WikiPedia is not a for profit business.<p>This a rather arbitrary definition of an entrepreneur.  I checked both Dictionary.com and Merriam-Webster.com, and both of their definitions for entrepreneur <i>do</i> include room for entrepreneur who found non-profits.   See for yourself:

Creating a long lasting and profitable commercial business is certainly a valid motivation for entrepreneurship, but so is changing the world, or even something as modest as looking to establish a second income stream, or looking for a different time/income tradeoff (4HWW, etc).",1234674569
