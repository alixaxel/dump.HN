466943,comment,466704,466832,0,0,shiro,,,"I'm not sure, but probably because productivity of programmers is hard to measure?  You, as a programmer, solve different problem each time.   Productivity can be defined by<p><pre><code>    (* individual-productivity-coefficient
       (/ (* amount-of-the-task difficulty-of-the-task) 
          time-to-implement))
</code></pre>
Within these parameters, managers can only see time-to-implement clearly, amount-of-the-task vaguely, individual-productivity-coefficient relatively (to other coworkers), and difficulty-of-the-task hardly.   Suppose you spend a week to solve X in busy environment, then spend a day to solve Y when the noisy manager is on vacation and you know X and Y are more or less the same amount and difficulty, so it's 5x boost!  But the only clue the manager has is that you finish Y in 1/5 of the time of X, and each counts as single ""feature"" so the amount of task should be the same, and they conclude that the difficulty of Y is 1/5 of X instead of thinking that your individual productivity coefficient raised 5x.",1233798691

Roads will be much the same, people wont have their houses rebuilt, office buildings will be similar. It will be all the technology inside that's different.<p>If you've read Vernor Vinge's latest novel, Rainbow's End, that feels like a fairly convincing future. Mostly augmented reality, fewer user serviceable parts, and improved medical technology.<p>±<i>imminent-singularity</i> implies a sharp switch. That's not how I think of it - it's more a series of concentric circles - singularity event horizons, future-shock waves emanating back into the past - that we are already in, and have always been in, where each one marks a point where enough quantitative change has happened to make a qualitative change that would be difficult to predict from before the change. The imminent-singularity refers to the fact that they are getting closer together, and as more of them happen in less time, the cumulative effects are that much stronger and faster, leading to a techno-sonic-boom.<p>The key changes to hurry along ""the singularity"" are changes to hurry along new and better kinds of thought. As Alan Kay(?) said, computers are tools for thinking, so I think it's right to look at computing/IT for the changes with the most impact.<p>Significant AI work will, I think, be software based, or biological designed with software. Significant nanotechnology design will be done with lots of aid from computers. Significant collaborative work will be done with the help of future telecoms infrastructure. Significant sharing and spreading of ideas will be telecoms related.<p>Plumbing, railroads, highways ... A new kind of collaborative shower? Trains that run even if there are leaves on the line? What kind of technological change do you think would make major differences? I think something along the lines of personal communications tech would make the most difference, e.g.:<p>- An open API for all train and bus timetables and up to date changes. Imagine being in an unfamiliar city, opening Google maps. It finds your location, you click where you want to go, it finds a bus/underground route for you, next few buses, option to buy a ticket.<p>- Local area networking such that you walk into an airport, your phone knows which flight you need so arrows appear on it and show you where to go in the airport. Over here, down there, to this checkin, then to that lounge.<p>The technological changes that I think will make a difference are in people and bureaucracy and communication, not in roads and rail themselves.",1233797631

This can in no way contribute to any discussion where understanding is the goal. Arguably, it follows that the rest of the essay is not intended to help people's understanding.<p><i>The idea of the singularity is that technology, especially in the form of artifically intelligent robots, will solve all of our problems and technological advance will speed up exponentially starting roughly around the year 2030.</i><p>The point is that the rate of advances in nearly all fields <i>is</i> exponential. Doubly exponential, in fact. That is, the exponent is growing at an exponential rate. And it's not that all of our problems will be solved, it's that the advances will be so dramatic that rules derived from how things are now--this side of the singularity--are useless for understanding what happens after the singularity.<p><i>So far technology innovation hasn’t outstripped Malthusian human population growth.  We can grow more food more efficiently, but the number of human mouths to feed has grown just about as fast, so that we struggle to feed everyone.  A lot of what we’ve done over the past few hundred years has come at the cost of using up the Earth, e.g., clearing forest for farmland or digging up coal and oil and lighting it on fire, taking all of the Cod out of the North Atlantic.</i><p>One of the most blatant straw men I've seen in a long time. First, technological innovation hasn't outstripped Malthusian population growth because technological innovation <i>is the cause of it!</i> Frankly, there are a lot of sad things about having 6 billion people on earth, but I think that about 6 billion of them would vote against programs that say, reduced the food supply.<p>Second, this ignores the amount of stuff we are able to get out of a unit of matter taken from the environment, and the amount of pollution produced by a unit measure of production, and the amount of dispersal for a given amount of pollution. In short, it categorically ignores any good that can have come from technology.<p><i>Far from freeing us from cleaning the house, Artificial Intelligence thus far has failed to live up to promises made by professors seeking research funding in 1960 (that reminds me I need to do laundry!).</i><p>It's probable that this fallacy has a proper name, but I've always called it Ascription of Intent. And I'm talking about the first implicit fallacy, which is an assertion that professors lied about AI for the sole reason of obtaining funding. The other fallacy is an ad hominem attack, namely that because professors were (allegedly) lying to get funding, AI is [useless|stupid|malevolent|a bad thing].<p><i>Given the track record of tech as a mixed blessing and as a slower agent for change than predicted, do young people need to prepare for 2030?  Can they prepare by listening to Ray Kurzweil, or anyone else born in 1948?  Should they fork over $25,000 for nine weeks or simply watch old Jetsons episodes?</i><p>It's coming thick and fast, now. Technology is a slower agent of change than predicted? Really? Who's predictions? I remember a prediction about computers someday being smaller than a rhinoceros, and another about how every town will have one telephone. Even 20 years ago, did anyone imagine that a global computer network would be so pervasive that even logically fallacious essays would be conveyed instantaneously the world over?<p>Furthermore, his point is specifically and directly addressed by Kurzweil et al. Actually, not even 'et al.' In 'The Singularity Is Near,' Kurzweil talks about how even scientists--especially scientists--underestimate the pace of progress because of their proximity to the drudgery of their own various specialties. He talks about how the aggregate adds up more quickly than humans are able to directly sense, and that it takes analysis to get a true picture of the rate of progress. I think we need to insist that Greenspun at least obey the principle of charity and put the best representation of his opponent's argument forward, rather than the worst. (And not just for the sake of charity, but because that is how collective knowledge--rather than, for example, an author's personal agenda--would be advanced.)<p>And what does anyone's birth date have to do with it? He may as well have comment on the race, creed, national origin, sexual orientation, or eye color of Singularity advocates.<p><i>Maybe I will kick off the comments section with a realistic tech innovation that would change the world in a positive way.  My pick:  A better battery (cheaper, lighter, higher power density).  That would enable the use of renewable energy in every kind of portable application, e.g., cars and airplanes, and also make it much more practical to use wind and solar generation.</i><p>Has he not heard of Lithium-Ion batteries? He's not heard of the Tesla Roadster? Is he asserting that battery technology is the only factor limiting the adoption of renewable energy? Power generation density isn't an issue? High capital costs aren't an issue? Regulatory hurdles aren't an issue?

I have an official 'work-from-home' day (Wednesday) and the option to work from home other days if there's nothing at the office that requires my attention.<p>However, I usually just go in to the office every Wednesday and only sometimes use the work-from-home-any-day option.<p>I happen to like the work environment we have. I have a nice clean office space with a big desk, two large monitors, good lighting, a comfortable chair, a kitchen with food and drinks, a rec room with couches and a pool table and whiteboards everywhere.<p>I am frequently interrupted, but half the time it's by fellow coders working on different problems who want to bounce some ideas off of me. There's an unwritten protocol for programmers interrupting programmers where I work. You walk by and say 'hey'. You get a 'hey' back and if the programmer doesn't turn back to the monitor, they're usually open for interruption. Or they might suck you into whatever problem they're working on.. :)<p>The other half of the interruptions are from the operations, business, sales and management side. These can be very annoying and consume a lot of time, but I encourage them (up to a point). For one, they provide a good finger on the pulse of the wider company operations. They keep a level of transparency between software development and the other areas of the company. They're also good for social cohesion (a 'we' feeling as opposed to 'us and them').<p>Interaction just works better face-to-face. The pool table we have, for example, is rarely used for actual games. Usually it's used by two or three people that are discussing something and just making a few shots while doing it. Or just goofing off for a bit.<p>Of course, I also have to get some code done. I can manage my time and do this, but I also have a lot of freedom in this respect. If you're working with a boss who micro-manages you, eh.. well .. that's a different story.

It seems that this is the thing you have the most problem with -- the selfish, immature attitude of wanting to never die.<p>I got the gist of what you were saying, but it doesn't track with me. Of course people don't want to die: that's the whole idea of being alive. Not dying. Sounds silly, but you can't be alive unless you really have an aversion to dying. Else you'd jump off a house roof or something to see what it was like to fly and that would be that.<p>If you feel some threshold is going to be crossed where we're non-human -- and we're not already there -- then I think it's up to you to define where that is. It would help advance the argument. We could discuss what attributes of humanity we lose when we cross that line. Otherwise all we have is the extreme case -- never dying -- and that's nowhere near being on the table as a realistic possibility.<p>I'm 43, so that makes me half-way there, more or less. Of course I could kick it tomorrow. Would I like to live to be 250? Well heck, I liked living to 43, and that's a lot more than my great ancestors could have done.<p>Imagine what somebody from 10,000 BC would think of us: living to 110 sometimes, having major parts like hips replaced with plastic parts. Artificial hearts, animal organ transplants in the near future, medicine that makes you frisky when you're 90. Seems to me we've already passed the point of being non or trans-human.
