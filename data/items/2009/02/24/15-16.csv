It looks beautiful but right now I've got one site in my top list that I feel shouldn't be there, because I didn't like my #6 and cycled through far too long, looking in vain for the one I wanted. (EDIT: Fixed!)<p>2) The feel is incredibly Mac-like. This is what I've wanted Safari to be like all along.<p>3) People that run the browser in ""anti-chrome"" mode (remove the bookmarks bar and the URL bar and run all searches with CMD-L) will find this to be the best solution they've ever used. Now there's a single line, since even the tab bar is gone. Brilliant solution on Apple's part to the problem of eliminating chrome. Furthermore, there used to be a bug where the search bar wouldn't vanish if you used the Google search bar during CMD-L. That bug is gone, meaning there's no need for a workaround (though I still think having a shortcut for a javascript-prompt Google search is the best solution).<p>4) It's a little harder to drag the tab bars around: I like that they let you detach more simply, but rearranging will take a week's getting used to.<p>5) Using Zoom with multitouch is incredible - I love how that feels - but not quite perfect. It's too responsive.<p>6) Multiple tabs look great - I like the expanded view and the faded out text that appears.<p>7) Trying to open an old tab I keep trying to double click, which minimizes the window. Not quite optimal.<p>8) No spinning loader for the page I'm currently on? Frustrating.",1235490471

493132,comment,492716,492716,0,0,nihilocrat,,,"In my own experience, from a creator's standpoint it's quite a bit different. You have to make sure pretty much every track loops well, and for non-cinematic music you don't really have the luxury of an ""intro"" section of a song; you have to hit the hook or otherwise the ""meat"" after the first measure at the latest. This is especially true of intro or menu music; the player is probably only going to listen to 10-30 seconds of the music before they move on to another screen that plays different music.<p>For someone who tends to make music based on ""whatever sounds cool"" and experimentation, it's very jarring to actually have to make the music accompany some on-screen, non-linear action and fit the theme of the game. It forces you to use instruments you might not be comfortable with (ex: an orchestra for a fantasy game) but also lets you explore instruments that would never fit in one of your personal tracks (ex: panflute and mandolin in an electro house track). It forces you to rethink your melodies and arrangements; it's surprising how bad or unfitting some non-game music can sound when played in a game, because it was designed to be the center of the audience's attention. Thankfully, because of this and the fact that the player is generally distracted with the game, the tracks only need to be about a minute or two minutes long, which is a lot simpler to make than a five-minute or longer track, and allows you to just focus on one set of patterns and be done with it. It's sort of like how a short story doesn't allow the space to develop subplots or excessive exposition, you've just got to get your point across and be done with it.",1235489347

493128,comment,492716,492991,0,0,unalone,,,"Film soundtracks are rarely played continuously. They're used in snippets. Very often, a movie soundtrack will consist of tracks that are 30-60 second hooks, since that's all the director needs. In any event, the soundtracks are tools to be used by the director.<p>In a video game, it doesn't work like that. Most tracks are played in their entirety and looped. It means that a song from a video game very often requires some integrity that a song in a movie doesn't need, because the song has to be replayable again and again without losing its meaning. Furthermore, game soundtracks are <i>long.</i> The Final Fantasy soundtracks started with 50 tracks in the original NES versions; the Playstation games ranged from 80 tracks to 160, which is <i>incredibly</i> long. That's longer than a good deal of operas, for instance (and back in Final Fantasy VI, an operetta was included in the soundtrack itself).<p><i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i> is a term Wagner used for his operas, actually, and it's that operatic mindset that video games most remind me of. When you compose for a video game, you've got enormous potential at your hands: your music determines the mood of everything that happens. When you write, you're told how your tracks will be used, how they'll blend together, and that gives you an incredible freedom to really do whatever you can.<p>In my article, I mention how Nobuo Uematsu very frequently shifts genres: he's written waltzes and ragtimes and celtic pieces and rock pieces and piano ballads and he's had two pop hits, once of which (originally written for Final Fantasy VIII) sold half a million singles. If he'd been writing for a movie, that wouldn't have been possible: the best movie soundtracks all integrate around a sonic theme, similarly to how a symphony works. A video game's music is far grander: when you're writing over 4 hours of music for a single soundtrack, you can create music that goes over and over themes, and <i>still</i> have space for two hours' worth of whatever you see fit.<p>Because of the circumstances in which you're writing, you have a freedom to use your mind in a way that no other composer today really gets a chance for. It's similar to having a patron in some ways.",1235489217
