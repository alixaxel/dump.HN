486747,comment,486511,486602,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Technology doesn't have an agenda. It's not an organism. The idea is utter nonsense.</i><p>Speaking as a piece of cellular technology, (admittedly a very advanced and well-abstracted one) I'm surprised that you find this hard to believe. Organisms are technologies, and our agendas are technological agendas.<p>If you take away my supply of fresh water, I will fight to get it back. Why do I want fresh water so badly? Ultimately, it's because of a technology choice, made -- perhaps by accident -- by my distant ancestors. My <i>really</i> distant ancestors. Several billion years ago a replicator (might have been DNA or RNA; might have been some earlier self-replicating structure; nobody really knows) built itself a nifty technology for protecting itself and moving around. The technology -- which eventually evolved into things like cell membranes and organelles -- was designed to work in salty water, where the replicators happened to live (or did they move there, <i>because</i> saltwater-based tech worked so well? Again, we don't know.)<p>It's been a long time since my ancestors lived primarily in salty water. And yet nearly every component of my body still requires a wet environment, containing a rather precise concentration of specific minerals in solution, in order to survive. Maintaining that environment requires a steady supply of fresh water from the outside world. And so I find that my body is preprogrammed to seek fresh water. This isn't my idea. In theory, I could be happy to live as a disembodied mind, without drinking water. But I'm built out of a specific technology, and that technology has an agenda.<p>Humans often fail to consciously notice that <i>living things</i> and <i>technologies</i> are aspects of the same thing. We use the word <i>technology</i> only to refer to objects that we don't identify very closely with. (But not, of course, to things that weren't built by living creatures. A star is very complicated, but it is not a <i>technology</i>.) But the word wears off quite quickly. Successful technologies rapidly get adopted into our lives. I would never call my left hand a <i>technology</i> except in an essay such as this. Even to call my cell phone a <i>technology</i> is beginning to seem stilted -- to do so, in my culture, would label me as either a techie or a luddite. And we may have reached the point where, alas, the Internet is no longer a technology to me. It's a significant part of my thinking, and a significant component of my happiness. Cut <i>me</i> off from the web long enough and I will probably react as if you'd stolen my fresh water. (We may soon reach the stage where being disconnected from the net will literally kill you, just as losing your job in the USA can kill you by removing your health insurance at a crucial moment.)<p>But though I identify more closely with my left hand than with the stainless steel screws in my jaw, and more closely with my metal components than with my contact lenses, and more closely with my contacts than my clothes, and more closely with my clothes than my car, and more closely with my car than my iPod, and more closely with my iPod than with the buggy software I wrote this afternoon which I will probably throw away, what -- really -- is the fundamental difference between any of these things? They're all technological components, created by technologies, in pursuit of technological agendas. Or, phrased differently, they are all artifacts created by living creatures in pursuit of life. Same difference.<p>Incidentally, I'd like to wish Charles Darwin a happy, belated 200th birthday. And it doesn't surprise me that, so many years after his work, essays like this still strike many people as ""utter nonsense"", perhaps even evil. The really big ideas take time to soak in.",1235018390

486744,comment,486618,486618,0,0,mattj,,,"Easiest answer: If you're using neural nets (his example), you could just write the backprop algorithm. Chances are performance matters, so you can hand tune your code to generate the best assembly.<p>Most of machine learning work involves huge data sets. You divide your time between cleaning up / massaging your data until it's usable, coming up with models, deriving properties of the models, implementing inference for those models, and, most importantly, tuning your code so you can actually get meaningful results on huge datasets.<p>Doing the differentiation is, by far, the easiest part of all of that.<p>Also, in many cases, your model won't have a tractable form (like, say, requiring you to sum over all permutations in your data set at each step of your training). You have to come up with ways of approximating these results, often using sampling techniques.<p>Being able to find a derivative to a function that takes O(n!) time to calculate exactly isn't exactly useful - for gradient optimization methods, you'll often have to calculate the value more often than the gradient.<p>Basically, when finding a derivative is feasible it's more useful and not much more work to derive it yourself.",1235018337

486740,comment,485813,486017,0,0,pixelmonkey,,,"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody.<p>-Thomas Jefferson",1235017966

Personally I would think that the Hulu ads are more valuable than the TV ones because it is 1 advertiser per show and there is less signal to noise for the viewer. When I watch football on Sunday it is sponsored by Ford, Toyota, Miller, Budweiser, Verizon, and 10 other companies I will never remember or care about. When I watch the Daily Show on Hulu it is 1 company a few times and actually leaves an impression.",1235016892

I don't think there has been a definitive ruling on the matter but I think torrenting is illegal because you never own the show, you have a license to view it in one way and viewing it in another violates that license. For example, if I get the show in HD on my package and you don't, me giving you a copy means you have an experience that you would not otherwise have and therefore are violating the copyright.",1235016684

On the other hand, the whole point of the Pirate Bay is to violate copyright. I've never seen it used for a lawful purpose, though I am sure it is occasionally. That's a substantive difference. It would ring a lot more honest to me if the defenders of Pirate Bay said ""I like to download things and I think current IP laws are wrong"".</i><p>Defenders <i>do</i> say that. <i>I</i> say that. The point I was making is that TPB isn't breaking the law. Even if they're helping other people break it, they themselves are innocent.<p>To use your gun analogy, if, rather than selling guns, you're the guy that gives directions to people looking for guns, then you're innocent. You're not touching the guns. You're just handing out directions.<p><i>That's a valid position that can be argued.

Adwords is opt in without any pressure and a lot of tools that at least make me feel like I'm optimizing my buck. I think if I were called by an Adwords rep and asked to spend more cash or else my pagerank ""might go down,"" I'd feel just about the same as I do about the hypothetical Yelp sales practices.<p>That said, I'm with you dpifke, it doesn't help the credibility of such an incendiary article that it appears in a lesser-known publication.",1235016459
