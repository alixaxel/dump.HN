Because, in fact, every engineer should know something about accounting. One of the things I regret is that nobody in my youth ever found a way to make accounting seem compelling enough that I was convinced to learn it. It turns out, though, that modern economic life is a big game played according to complicated rules, and <i>accountants are the referees</i>.<p>Most engineering decisions cannot be made without an accountant. If money were no object we could solve many website scaling problems by buying one server for every anticipated visitor -- or, alternatively, by only allowing one visitor at a time into our sites. (Let them stand in line!) These are not silly ideas: People used to have to stand in line at major universities to use scientific calculators, but now we've made them cheap enough that we can just give one to every math student. The thing which makes many obvious solutions silly is: They cost too much, or they don't make enough money. And to answer the questions ""how much is too much? how much is enough?"" requires accountants.<p>Finally, please don't call this thing I've just written ""a hypothesis"". That makes me wince. I'm having fun with the metaphor, but it would be a mistake to reify it:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)</a><p>The metaphor is fun because I really am related to monkeys (well, chimps, technically), and because many human behaviors really do make sense in chimp terms as well, and because it's quite possible that this is not entirely a coincidence, or a case of convergent evolution. But let's not go too far. It <i>is</i> only a metaphor. I'm built out of chimp parts, but I'm also built out of distinctly human parts.<p>For example, it would be bad to argue like this: Early humans lived as free-ranging nomads, so a better office design would be one that forces <i>us</i> to live like free-ranging nomads. That idea has been tried. And it turns out that one of the hacks that make the modern world possible is <i>personal collections of artifacts</i>: piles of papers (with the most relevant ones on top) and post-it notes to cue your memory, photos of your family to regulate your mood, egg timers to remind you to take breaks, vastly complex, expensive, and personalized suites of hardware and software to help you write code, the custom-adjusted chair that keeps your back in working order, etc. In other words: Having your own office makes you more productive.",1233521564

After that he does a postmodern doo wop album and moves on to jazz fusion and movie tracks, returning to pop rock just in time to release an album consisting of only guitar solos.<p>With Zappa, if he's not singing you can't tell it's him writing the songs.

Well, I have reached a crossroad and need to figure out how to proceed from here.
I am, like most of you a founder of a startup(s)... long story short I have lost my job that was funding my startups and currently have no income. my 2nd start up is about to launch any day now and all our hopes (5 people) are hanging on this to succeed.
My first startup was a failure/success, it has won many awards some very ""prestigious"" and still gets tons of traffic and not to mention gets me some positive recognition but NO MONEY!
basically, Traffic is not enough to make any real money.<p>I am seriously considering starting a pay porn site (my friend owns 7) and explained how I can make some decent amount to at least keep paying the rent.
I have already contacted an attorney because I am concerned about my name not being affected by this... I frankly dont want to be associated with porn and explained to me how to make start this with out using my name.<p>My question is this:
Would you (startups/entrepreneurs/VCs/funders/anyone in the industry) do business or be associated with someone in the porn industry?<p>Thank you.<p>P.S: If its not obvious I have started a new account to hide my identity.",1233520256

If you had a blog, I'd read it.<p>I think that getting to the psychology of the problem as you are attempting (or succeeding) is a very worthy task that lots of people need to be working on.<p>I'm no water vapor ignoring tree-hugger, but the inefficiency of our current work system where people heat and maintain homes that are empty for 12 hours a day, go to office buildings that are empty for 12 hours a day, using a car that they use for two hours a day, to do work that could be done at home, is insanity.<p>Why do we tolerate this as companies or as employees?  We can seriously look for solutions, or we can wax cynically about ""the man"".  One path leads forward, to a solution.<p>If your hypothesis is correct, there are compromises we can do, to satisfy the inner-ape, while gaining some efficiency.<p>- We can remove people's personal effects from their work areas, so multiple people can work in that cube.  On Monday and Tuesday, it a marketing guy.  On Wednesday and Thursday, it's an engineer.  On Friday and Saturday, it's an accountant.  Let groups that never interact anyway, REALLY not interact, and as a bonus, you reduce your necessary office space by 2/3rds while still maintaining ape bonding time for two days a week.  The other three days of work, people work at home, freeing up our highways by 2/3rds as well.  Actually, we free up our highways by 3/5ths (math left as exercise for the reader) because now we have staggered our weekends a bit.  Nobody works on Sundays still, but accountants work on Saturdays.<p>Would there be tons of coordination hassles, with accountants needing to talk to engineers about their annual budgets?  No, not really.  Because our whole premise here, is that none of this face time is actually needed from a business standpoint.  Internet and telephone would be just fine.  It's needed at a deeper level, among team-mates and up/down hierarchies, but it's not needed from one tribe to another.<p>The accountant tribe and the engineer tribe will never form an alliance, they are evolutionary enemies.
