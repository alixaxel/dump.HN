I think his comment from stackoverflow demonstrates this:<p><i>I get paid for code that works, not for tests, so my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence (I suspect this level of confidence is high compared to industry standards, but that could just be hubris). If I don't typically make a kind of mistake (like setting the wrong variables in a constructor), I don't test for it. I do tend to make sense of test errors, so I'm extra careful when I have logic with complicated conditionals. When coding on a team, I modify my strategy to carefully test code that we, collectively, tend to get wrong.</i><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-unit-tests/153565#153565"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153234/how-deep-are-your-...</a>",1233766667

Its basically a regular python like language that has lots of built-ins for doing stuff with vectors and matrices and plotting things nicely.<p>Mathematica on the other hand is more of a tool for doing things symbolically (x's & y's).  You can integrate, differentiate, find roots, etc all symbolically.  It does have tools for doing numerical integrations and such, but they are much more of a black box than matlab's and are very hard to port out of mathematica.  Some math folks don't like mathematica because of its black-box attitude, which is understandable.  I use it sometimes for calculus.<p>Don't do linear algebra with mathematica.

I've tried all the various ports, and Aquamacs is my favorite 'native' port, but I actually miss the X11+gtk build I used before. There's something to be said for an emacs that feels like emacs :)<p>I agree that the option key is no good as Meta - Cmd is Meta in my setup.<p>I absolutely override the Mac keybindings. 
I like having M-Q as fill-paragraph, and I found that other useful commands were being hijacked by useless OS X Text Services (like M-> for end of buffer got stolen by OmniOutliner)<p>I have a large 1920x1200 display that I tend to use with one emacs frame maximized, and some arrangement of windows inside that frame - most often I have a full height window on the left, and two half-height windows on the right. Sometimes I use three columns of windows, and other times four equal-sized windows makes sense.<p>One of those windows is almost always running zsh inside ansi-term (M-x ansi-term). Some prefer shell-mode, but I think ansi-term and zsh are more useful. I don't think shell-mode and zsh cooperate too well.<p>Most of my work is done in python, and I just started using pymacs and ropemacs, which seem useful.

It also tried to save my <i>entire color-theme</i> to custom-set-faces, which is an idiotic thing to do; the color-theme takes up 1111 lines in a nice elisp file off on it's own - why try to stuff it in custom-set-faces?<p>Anyways, just a warning - you may have issues if you try to give Aquamacs a largish .emacs file you've built up over the years on other systems.

It was a comparison between 'angry' and 'calm' driving, during the angry days the driver was supposed to avoid letting people in front of them and on the calm days they were supposed to slow down and let people turn into their lane from side roads. This wasn't about fuel efficiency, it was about how much time it would cost you and quite counter-intuitively the 'calm' drivers who let multiple vehicles go in front of them actually ended up getting to work faster.<p>They also mention the ants collecting behind an ant that's carrying something. It's probably for a different reason (IE not losing the food) but it reminds me of the fleet-style of driving where they want to get vehicles to drive behind each other, sharing the same air pocket, which IIRC Mythbusters showed that tailing a big rig could reduce drag by up to 80%, however that was equivalent to being like 5 feet behind the big rig and they couldn't drive 'calm' enough at that distance and reduced efficiency, but at around 10 feet they got like a 60% drag reduction. Fleet driving (by computer) would allow vehicles to drive at 5 feet behind a big rig and get that drag reduction. However, I don't know how you'd pay for fleet-style driving because vehicles like a big rig would be improving efficiency for dozens of vehicles, which would assume nationalized transportation control so big rig drivers don't get ripped off on gas.",1233764618
