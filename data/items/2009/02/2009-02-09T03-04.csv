It was surprising how often we were wrong... :)  There was one guy who I had seen at the weekly colloquia for almost a year, who I had always assumed was a homeless, probably mentally ill guy, who was just there for the food.  Then one day he asked an incredibly technical question in the middle of a lecture.  I think he was actually from the math department.",1234151986

Macros are simply shorthand for code that will be literally placed at the spot they are called.<p>So rather than calling functions, with all argument expressions evaluated, and a call stack, and blah blah blah, you are just copy-pasting code without it actually ending up on the screen for a developer to see.",1234151910

472882,comment,472774,472774,0,0,tsally,,,"Yeah I have news for the author.  State schools don't have money and private schools do.  If you/your family don't actually have enough money to pay for your college education, you'll get financial aid from the private school but you'll  have to pay full tuition at a state school.  The schools who he was throwing around (Brown, Stanford) all guarantee 100% need based financial aid.  And if you are a genius like the author suggests, you're sure to get some merit based financial aid as well.<p>Personal anecdote:  If I had decided to attend University of Chicago instead of University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, I would have paid $15k less per year.   Urbana's tuition is ~$25k per year and Chicago's is $50k.  Of course, since I wanted to study Computer Science the choice was obvious, but if money had been the issue I would have gone to Chicago.  If money is a _serious_ concern, you _will_ get financial aid from a top private school.<p>If you do have enough money, the monetary aspects of your college choice become a question of value, not necessity.  The author should have framed his article in that sense.  There's good advice in this article, but none of it applies to people who are contained by money.  Rather, it should have been written for the people who want to get the most of their money.",1234149515
