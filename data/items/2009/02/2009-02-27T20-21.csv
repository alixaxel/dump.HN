If we're using ""every store is in a mixed use area"", then you're correct, but that's saying that you can't have any alternatives to mixed use.  If we're saying that ""mixed use"" is ""a walkable community that has at least one vendor for almost every need"", then a lot of places qualify.<p>I note that mixed use advocates in the US argue that they should have the choice.  If they extend that courtesy to others, they have to be satisfied with something short of universal mixed use.",1235767955
