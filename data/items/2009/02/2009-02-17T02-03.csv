484004,comment,483724,483914,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Well, I don’t know how a ""recession in the real economy"" differs from any other recession so I can’t really address that point.<p>But as for the banks you’re simply wrong.  The problem with your argument, and many like it, is that you hide the actual facts by focusing on the macro.  That produces a lot of analytical fear mongering with no real basis in fact (to even claim our 7.6% unemployment rate compares to the 25-to-30% rate of the Great depression is ridiculous).<p>The fact is I still get credit offers in the mail daily.  The banks that are going out of business are having their assets bought by bigger banks that are seemingly doing just fine.  So I don't see any banks ""hoarding cash""<p>More importantly you still have 92.4% of the population gainfully employed (and probably another 4% on top of that who are housewives, students or otherwise not looking for a job).  That means there’s still a huge market of credit worthy people who want to buy stuff on credit.<p>The great, great, great, great majority of people are not in danger of losing their jobs.  That makes them as credit worthy now as they were a year ago.  On the other end of things banks still have shareholders and shareholders still expect profits.  So in the end you have a supply and demand system that is still up and running just as it always has (it’s just slowing down).<p>P.S.  To give you one example of the fear mongering going on a lot of people are quoting Japan’s ""lost decade"" but very few of them are pointing out that Japan still had positive GDP growth throughout that decade..",1234839497

483981,comment,482257,483311,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Read up on the government of 1908, it was extremely corrupt.</i><p>Indeed it was.  But perhaps you have heard the name K Street before?  The retail, envelopes-full-of-cash corruption is now mostly gone.  Corruption today is organized, supersized, and legalized.  It's called interest group politics.  Worse, because government is so much bigger, both in revenues and the extents of its regulations, interest group politics has a far more pernicious impact on our lives than the corruption of 1909 ever did.<p><i>The world would probably be more wealthy without that drain, but I don't know if it would be better.</i><p>Even given that we want to spend more on healthcare, the government healthcare programs waste somewhere on the order of 80% of the dollars spent.  My point was that the taxes we now pay are not being put to good use.<p><i>I expect the government of 1908 was more corrupt than the government of today, people did not have the money to let government take that much off of them</i><p>Just look at the rates.  Combined federal tax rates for a median earner in 1909: 0%.  Combined federal tax rates for a median earner 2009: ~20%.<p>The government was very corrupt then, but at least people new it was corrupt and thus had little inclination to vote in leaders that would raise taxes.  Our modern government, via its K-16 education system, has basically taught everyone that the government is our mother and that giving it money is righteous and good.<p><i>So yes taxes are up, but it's not like the money is set on fire we are getting a lot of services from that money.</i><p>Federal taxes do not pay for streetlights and cell phones ( and neither does much of state and local taxes).  I generally view the interstate highway program as a disaster that destroyed urban neighborhoods and created an unsustainable reliance on automobiles.<p><i>When it comes to social organizations things like MMO guilds and facebook let people be far more social than the average pre car social club.</i><p>You have got to be be kidding.  Human beings did not evolve to socialize via text.<p><i>Over the last 100 years the middle class and the wealthy have left city's and have only recently been returning. Murder statistics among the poor and they have always been high so correlating it with city living is missing the point.</i><p><i>Murder statistics among the poor and they have always been high so correlating it with city living is missing the point.</i><p>This simply false.  At the turn of the century, 85% of the population of Milwaukee were immigrants or the children of immigrants.  Yet the homicide rate was 3.7.  The other big northern cities were similar.  The people in these cities were mostly poor immigrants.  Yet they worked hard and moved forward in life.  In the 60's, breakdowns in law enforcement, ""urban renewal"", and the growth of the welfare state allowed the growth of a large criminal underclass in the cities.  Riots and muggings pushed the hard working middle class out into the suburbs  Poverty does not cause crime.  Culture and lack of rule of law cause crime.",1234837686

483977,comment,483042,483042,0,0,Kontra,,,"Flash versus Open<p>Perhaps one thing we can all agree on is that the future of the web, mobile or otherwise, will be more or less open. That would be HTML, MP3, H.264, HE-AAC, and so on. These are not proprietary Adobe products, they are open standards…unlike Flash.<p>In confusing codecs with UI, Wilson keeps asking, “why is it tha[t] most streaming audio and video on the web comes through flash players and not html5 based players?” The answer is rather pedestrian: HTML5 is just ramping up, but Flash IDE has been around for many years. Selling Flash IDE and back-end server tools has been a commercial focus for Adobe, while Apple, for example, hasn’t paid much attention to QuickTime technologies and promotion in ages. It’s thus reflected in adoption patterns.<p>Hopefully, this summary will clear Wilson’s blind spot:<p>Apple is betting on open technologies (as it makes money on hardware) while Adobe (which only sells software) is betting on wrapping up content in a proprietary shackle called Flash.<p>From:<p>Does ""A VC"" have a blind spot for Apple?

483971,comment,483320,483887,0,0,sho,,,"I don't understand this obsession about only storing hashes, as if that's the primary critical issue with site security. There are plenty of reasons to store the plaintext, and in a well secured database I really don't think it is much of an issue. Or as I heard someone say once, ""If you can break into my database, and show me how, I will quite literally give you a million dollars"".<p>Off the top of my head, here's a couple of very good reasons to store plaintext:<p>- password recoverability: if the user knows they can recover the password, they're more likely to use a more complex one<p>- flexibility with authentication: to use something like HTTP Digest Auth, you need the plaintext to be able to hash it with a one-time nonce<p>And like many will no doubt point out, hashing it isn't all THAT secure anyway. If it's not a very strong hash, or there's enough information to reset it somehow, they can get what they want anyway. Not to mention that if your database has been cracked they probably have everything they want anyway - why even bother logging in?<p>I just don't get it.
