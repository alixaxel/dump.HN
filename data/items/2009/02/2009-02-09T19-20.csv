And so, scientists had said the benefits of unconscious thinking are greatest when a decision is complex, with multiple options and attributes.<p>""Our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors, such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is,"" Newell said. ""If conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material, or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate, their choices are at least as good as those made 'unconsciously.'""",1234209345

I like more choices and I think the resource is fantastic for googling, kudos to Jeff&Joel, but in my case, when googling doesn't help and I need to ask someone, it just seems that IRC beats it hands down: why would I go to SO asking jQuery questions if there's #jquery on freenode where John often answers questions himself? With something like jRuby or Linux hosting the picture is even better: JRuby lead programmers always hang out in #jruby, bunch of smart folks helping each other in real time.<p>Whereas I see people ask a question on SO and... what exactly do they do next?  Sit for hours hitting 'refresh' every minute or so? SO is great for googling for similar questions answered in the past, but I just don't understand why people post questions there in the first place.<p>Sometimes I think that if IRC hasn't existed and someone would have launched it now  as a fresh idea, all tech blogs would be filled with <i>""IRC changes everything""</i> and <i>""the game is over for slow HTML-based collaboration""</i><p>Am I missing something?",1234206956

Both run on specific schedules (which arent always great) and often times you need to take multiple variations to get to the final destination (or remotely close).<p>If a pod system existed here it would allow me to travel faster and more accurately.
