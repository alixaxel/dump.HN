Compared to that, grabbing data from the DOM using DOM text node methods is a walk in the park.<p>The thing with the json solution is that once we have things being ajaxed in, it becomes very hard to maintain the code. Has id=""date7"" been used? What if I add a comment while the ""shoutbox"" feature is updating?<p>Having the data in HTML would let us use something like Jquery's livequery and it would work regardless of how the data and how much data got into the page (plus we get the benefit of the no-javascript scenario I mentioned before).",1233867581
