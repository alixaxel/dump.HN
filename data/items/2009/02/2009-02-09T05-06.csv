Is it not thebest way for you to achieve something to be imbued of the ""true spirit"" of that thing. Even if it is ""wrong"".<p>Nietzsche talked about a pessimism of strengh related with the Will to Power where he says that holding something true is important to achieve a certain purpose. He distinguished that from the pessimism of weakness where beliefs are hold not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself.<p>Having strong convictions is important, because it focus all your being in achieving this purpose that you've created for yourself.<p>I would rather phrase the main idea in Mr. Graham's essay not as<p>""keep your identity small.""<p>but rather<p>""keep your identity flexible.""<p>What you believe today might not be what you'll need to believe in order to reach a certain goal in the future.<p>Yes it's a form of relativism, and it requires a lot of self
discipline to avoid falling in to a kind of ""it's no use"", pessimistic stance, that nothing really matters. It means holding something true,  even if you know it isn't true. Just make it so. Because that's the efficient and

If everyone behaves the way they do with larger deploy cycles even after moving to an extremely short deploy cycle then you would have lots of downtime.<p>The point wasn't that it solves downtime, but that it causes you to more readily understand sources of downtime. You then have to use that information to make your development and deploy process resilient to those classes of failures. Rinse. Repeat.<p>For example, at my company we would spin up a new engineer and within about a month they would take out a database (or worse) with a query that would be extremely slow. What did we do to fix the problem? We capped all queries to 20 seconds, after which we would fail the page request. In the best case, a developer pushes a page with a slow query in it, and the page fails enough to cause the revision to roll back. In the worst case, the feature the developer was working on would be broken but the rest of the website would continue functioning.<p>And yes. yes. yes!
