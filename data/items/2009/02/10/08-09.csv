On average the amount of money available per square kilometer of land is low, lower than some 'real' third world countries.<p>This means that outside of the bigger population centers the infrastructure can be seriously lacking.<p>Trade wars with the US (under the guise of infected beef, logging rules and whatever else the US can come up with to avoid real competition with Canadians, and that all in spite of 'nafta')) have wrecked a good part of the Canadian economy.<p>One reason Canadian banks are in such good shape is that they have a captive audience, there is hardly any competition (there are very few banks in Canada and they all have - coincidene ? - roughly the same tarrifs for their services. They rip off their customers every chance they get, where else are you going to go ?<p>Canadians are pretty much enslaved to their banks, I have no other words for it. The amount of misery caused by those 'healthy' banks that I've seen first hand is nothing short of unbelievable and I really would not wish the Canadian banking system upon anybody.",1234256126

I hate reading long articles on my monitor. (I do it because there's no other option than buying the paper - but for one article?.) I'd be happy to pay in order to be able to read a good article on the subway. Not $1/article, mind you, but even a few cents per article would turn into a nice sum of money for the newspapers.",1234255886

Or another way to put it: whats the point of not loosing money if you don't have any to begin with.<p>A more extreme example: During the 1930s, there was one notable country which did not experience an economic depression. That country was the USSR. As it had a command economy, the planners decided against a depression and that was it. However, they could not allocate agricultural resources effectively and had a famine instead. So, back then, it was very easy to say the the USSR is great as it has no depression but whats the point when they have no <i>food</i>.<p>* Source: CIA world factbook (search google).",1234255772

Most mainstream news sources I have read, and I include the NY Times, offer precious few facts per article. Analysis of those facts is non-existent, replaced by snippets from press releases or quotes from ""experts"". I guess it's supposed to be intellectual if you get commentary from both sides on an issue, even if both sides are giving you crap.<p>Now compare that to the Economist, The Wall Street Journal, and more niche publications.

474901,comment,474591,474762,0,0,Xixi,,,"The problem is not to write something that works, bottom-up, as you type it. Any half-decent software engineer can do that. The problem is maintenance : when you start to modify existing code, a function many other functions rely on (I assume functional style, without side-effects here). And sooner or later you'll have to alter your code, whatever the reason: spec change, performance issue, bug, new problem to tackle, you name it.<p>The simplest thing I can think of is if you have to alter a function to handle correctly some corner cases. You didn't think about them when you wrote the function in the first place, so basically your function was buggy all along... Now you have to test all the functions that rely on this function again. What if they relied on said bug and you didn't realize it ? With tests, you just run the tests (and hope they were well designed...). With your technique, you do the same, by hand, function after function...<p>Or to remain in a very bottom up style, what if you realize that one of your underlying brick was poorly designed ? It just doesn't address well the new problem at hand and need little enhancements... Anything that relied on this brick have to be, well, updated to use the new functions, and of course checked again. Again unit-tests come in handy...<p>Note that I'm just making the case for unit-testing, not test-driven developement itself...",1234254230

Employing people is excluded, renting office space is useless in that time frame, so the only things I can imagine are buying rights to something or buying actual physical merchandise.<p>Buying services, i.e outsourcing much of the work, is just a way around the no employees rule. Labour cost is probably the biggest chunk of most growing software startups' cost and that's excluded.<p>My conclusion is that it needs to a be rights based business.
