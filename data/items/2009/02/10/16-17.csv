These languages got OO horribly, horribly wrong; so if you use them and dislike OO, it's possible that you dislike the language -- not OO.<p>If you use CLOS, you'll see that functions are functions and data are data.  CLOS just gives you some tools for calling different functions depending on the type of the data and for specializing subtypes.  This is OO done right, and it is not what the author of this article is referring to.<p><i>Objection 2 - Everything has to be an object.</i><p>Everything has to have a type, yeah.

Unless your code is all in one file, this is going to be a problem regardless of the programming ""paradigm"" you choose.<p>When writing Lisp, I often put all my class and method definitions for one chunk of the app in the same file.  I think this is what the author wants to do, and it is do-able and commonly done in CLOS.  In Java, yeah, you have to put each class in its own file.  That is irritating, but the problem is not OO.<p><i>Objection 4 - Objects have private state.</i><p>This is true.  I prefer to write OO code that maps one object to another, rather than mutating an object's internals.  The sad reality is that this approach is slower and uses more memory than the mutation approach, but I think it's easier to reason about and maintain.  Computers are fast, anyway.<p>So while it's possible to misuse OO, whatever that means for your particular tastes, it's also possible to not misuse it.

However, using classes will let you hide some of the data structures which are not necessary globally, reducing the cognitive load.<p>Objection 2 - Everything has to be an object\n - Not in C++. You use classes where appropriate, and ordinary functions elsewhere. I agree that everything shouldn't be an object.<p>Objection 3 - In an OOPL data type definitions are spread out all over the place.\n - similar to objection 1. You CAN store all definitions in a single include file, but for large projects this can be a LOT of data definitions, where many/most of them are only relevant for parts of the applications. Hiding data definitions in separate classes will make it easier to focus on the RELEVANT data depending on which class/function you use.<p>Objection 4 - Objects have private state.\n - again, similar to 1 and 3. ""State is the root of all evil"". If you store all data in a single file, then you have one giant global mess. By assigning them to a class, you clearly state the responsibility and scope of the variables. A private state is nobody's business but the class. You don't HAVE to have private state for objects,but then you either need to pass all data to each function, or use global variables instead.<p>For Erlang (functional programming) these objections make (some) sense since you DON'T want any state whatsoever to facilitate concurrency.<p>However, saying that OO sucks is stupid, and the four reasons for why OO was popular is not even worth responding to. I don't think functional programming will become more popular due to this rant....",1234283320
