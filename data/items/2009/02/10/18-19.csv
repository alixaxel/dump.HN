The music industry has just branched out far more.<p>Radiohead, My Bloody Valentine, Neutral Milk Hotel. Of Montreal. Nirvana, The Flaming Lips. Belle & Sebastian. I'm naming a very slim set of music: I'm ignoring everything that's not rock. And yeah, they're different from the 60s bandset, but different isn't always worse. Radiohead's music is more complex than any 60s musician I can think of save Zappa, and his work picked up in the 70s and 80s.<p>Back then, outside activities were encouraging people to all group together. Now it's all divided. You wouldn't get the guitar virtuosos of the world - and they're better now than they ever have been in history - playing next to pop acts - which are arguably catchier than the stuff back then, thanks to the science of pop writing. They're separate fields; they've split off. Now, instead of a focused field, things have split and branched and turned into a hundred thousand separate branches.<p>I think that I like modern culture <i>better</i> than I would have liked the 60s. I like the Decemberists. I like that they're quirky book rock. I enjoy Harry and the Potters. Neither one is The Beatles, but nowadays instead of 20 big names I listen to a hundred small names and each one has something to fascinate me.<p>This nostalgia pisses me off.

I hate to make hifalutin' claims and not back them up.<p>But here's the quick version:\nWhile fruits are a better source of sugar, in excess they're bad too. Too much sugar, how ever is comes, is linked to higher GL and inflammation. When eating fruits and vegetables, I choose the low sugar/high water weight variety. You want to maximize the high vitamin/antioxidant/phytochemicals ones, as with any food.<p>That's the minor disagreement. But the majors ones are with carbs and fats.<p>Carbohydrates are complex sugars. They're broken down into the simpler forms, but they're same forms that the original article describes as bad when excessive. What I dislike the most about them is effect on insulin resistance, inflammation and leptin levels.<p>Where I differ here is what the macronutrient balance should be. I think high carbs, brown or white, isn't good for you. Don't get wrong you need them but the amount depends of lifestyle factors. I get most of my carbs from oats and in trace amounts in the rest of what I eat.<p>The other disagreement is with fat. We're finding out that fats aren't entirely bad in all cases, even saturated fat. It depends on the form they come in. High heat just kills in particular. It's the main reason trans fats are bad actually.<p>But this is true for all foods. How they're cooked, or if they're cooked at all, determines how healthy they are for you. It's well known that heat and light for instance can kill nutrients in many foods.<p>Macronutrients balance shouldn't be separate from lifestyle.

Case in point:  I know I have submitted a couple stories that I thought were HN worthy, but that people called me on in the comments (Alabama Fat Tax, for instance).  I still thought it was relevant, but I had the self restraint to only submit occasionally anyway.

Basically the way it works is it inserts a layer between the routing and transport layers (called the shim layer), which handles mobility. The transport layer gets a locally significant identifier that uniquely identifies the connection on that host. This remains persistent even after the IP address changes. The shim layer then notices when you've got a new IP address and alerts the other host or notices when the other host has stopped responding for a while and waits for it to make contact again. You'll probably also need access to a DNS server that you can update on the fly, since HIP resolves HITs (HIP identifiers) to IP addresses via DNS. This isn't by any means a production solution, but if you're willing to try it out I'd love to hear how it works out for you :) Also the third reference explains how it works far better than I did.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.openhip.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openhip.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_Identity_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_Identity_Protocol</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://infrahip.hiit.fi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infrahip.hiit.fi/</a>",1234290153

They said this about store-based retail, too.  ""Stores can operate more <i>efficiently</i> on the web, and will take over because they don't need the bricks and mortar!""  What happened?  Well, for starters, we found out that people <i>like</i> to shop in stores.  We also found out that logistics, customer service and returns are always significant fixed costs, and the absence of bricks and mortar doesn't necessarily make them cheaper.<p>2) Race to the Bottom:  <i>""every English-language newspaper is in direct competition with every other. Millions of Americans get their news online from The Guardian, which is published in London. This competition, and not some kind of petulance or laziness or addled philosophy, is what keeps readers from shelling out for news.""</i><p>...and last I checked, the Guardian has the same problems as everyone else in the business.  I guess the Utopian ideal here is that every newspaper on the planet gives their content away for free, until they all simultaneously combust in a cloud of bankruptcy lawyers and rainbows.<p>More seriously:  the end-game here is not a world where we have the journalism quality of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the San Francisco Chronicle, only online and free.  The end-game is Gawker and TechCrunch.  Sound like a fair trade?<p>3) Everything Is Different Now, Man: <i>""And the harsh truth is that the typical American newspaper is an anachronism. It is an artifact from a time when chopping down trees was essential to telling the news""</i><p>This is not ""harsh truth"" -- this is 95% wishful thinking, 5% fact.  The 5% fact is that there is another way to access media, that has both benefits and drawbacks.  The other 95% is that the Silicon Valley, VC-for-everyone corporate culture has <i>infected</i> media, and given it a business model as unsustainable and wasteful as a midnight candy bar delivery from Kozmo.com.<p>People still like to consume media on paper.  It doesn't require electricity, can be done without the aid of a machine, and can be archived easily, by anyone.  Granted, the <i>type</i> of content served by traditional media is shifting, but that doesn't mean that newspapers and magazines don't have a future in the Brave New World of digital media.<p>More importantly, the internet <i>hasn't</i> made it free to produce good content.  We all like to dance around this critical fact, pretending that if we just spend enough money on viral loops and news aggregators, we'll be able to reproduce our current media offerings.  But we conveniently neglect to notice that many of the interesting articles we read on Digg or news.google are <i>produced</i> by reporters who are being paid by the old media.

What we need is some time of cultural incentive to read the new page, and pages 2/3/4 of the new page.",1234288999

If ticketmaster starts becoming more like a scalper in its operations, then the secondary ticket market becomes pretty useless.  Or, do the ticket prices just increase even more in the secondary market.<p>Normally, I'd say this would make ticketmaster RIPE for disruption, but they're the gatekeepers.  You can't get tickets any cheaper than what they sell them for.  If they also interlock with the record labels, it's going to desperately slow innovation in the music industry around concert tickets and alt. revenue sales.<p>Thoughts from the ticketstumbler guys?",1234288960

I think it's good to have an overview so when you do run into some problem it may trigger your memory about something you read so you can easily find the documentation you need, but nothing really replaces coding.",1234288959

To address the hidden-jems problem, another idea would be to randomly serve up the second page (Page 2 of the front page), giving the hidden-gems a better chance to make it to the first page.",1234288957
