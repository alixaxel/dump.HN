While the downloads and CDs were never big moneymakers for artists I heard of one local band in the Boston area that managed to build up a respectable fanbase thanks to the service. The on-demand CD pressing arrangement was also convenient for creating and selling limited numbers of CDs to sell at shows.<p>That iteration of mp3.com's business model didn't survive, but I really think that has more to do with the power of major labels and existing distribution/sales channels. In my opinion, it's hard for Band X to make it as an indie artist without the backing of a major label's marketing budget and arrangements with Apple, Amazon, Walmart, etc.",1235671122

Spotify is merely making this more obvious than before.<p>The music business can flourish, as long as they adapt to the new circumstances instead of longing for the ridiculous successes of CDs in the nineties.

Snocap used to offer a service where you uploaded music and could sell it through an embeddable ministore. AmieStreet has something similar. And, of course, so do we.<p>But I think the author oversimplifying a bit. Sure it's technically easy to sell music online. The stuff that's hard to come by is people's attention.<p>And while it's true that the Internet lowers distribution barriers, it has also decreased the perceived value of music recordings. Because access has gotten so much easier, people tend to think of music less as something you can own, but rather of something you have access to, be it through MP3s on your hard drive or streaming. We at Popcuts set out to address that. Because we think there's a deeper sense of ownership possible than simply having access to a sound file. And we do think music should have a price tag.<p>Our site is based on the idea that buyers of a song get a share of the revenue that song makes in the future. So when you buy a song on Popcuts, it's in your interest that that song does well. You might tell your friends about it, but you probably won't seed the file to a BitTorrent site. In addition, we try to reward the behavior that a lot of music fans already show: They know of a hot new band before everyone else, and they want to show it off. </selfpromotion>",1235670580

Similar voting or comment moderation systems on reddit or other places are sometimes reasonably fast.<p>I would not mind selecting a pull-down or radio button and hitting submit at the bottom of the page, however.  In fact I'd prefer it.<p>And there are more examples of such systems poorly implemented, often to the point that they kill the usefulness of the site.  Slashdot's firehose with it's + / - buttons is like that, and slashdot's main page has become like that, but I am logged in have as many ""new features"" turned off in my preferences as possible.  When I type text into a box on Facebook, I can outrun the letters appearing by several sentences.  There are numerous sites that use various kinds of javascript rich text or html editors that are also pretty unuseable.<p>I like gmail, but not it's javascript features.  I use the basic html setting, because if I live it up with the normal setting, my browser will become unuseable after a few hours.    It was particularly bad in some of the previous versions of firefox, which apparently had some memory fragmentation issue regarding parsing javascript, but as javascript brings no benefits and makes the page take slightly longer to upgrade, I have never switched back even now that I have the latest upgrades to the browser.<p>I like google maps as an application, and I use it pretty extensively, at least once a week.  I don't find it's panning arrows and so on particularly appealing, and I habitually restart the browser after using it, to clean out any javacrap memory issues remaining.<p>And it is not simply the idea of the type of interface google maps has that I object to:  for example, I love Google Earth, and I like to change the angle of view and rotate around various landmarks and so on.  This is on the same computer where I turn off java script for gmail.  So it's not just that I have some Amish insteance on older interfaces.  It is that javascript in the browser sucks.<p>Now, that doesn't mean you won't make a billion dollars making a web site that depends on javascript, of course.  But all other things being equal, I think you should focus on interfaces that are very simple and very fast if you want to get adoption.

(this is a premise in the high protein diets)""</i><p>I think the key thing in extreme dieting is to ensure no loss of muscle. An obese person is going to have to take drastic measures to lose weight, and are highly susceptible to malnutrition (many times they're already malnourished due to poor diet to begin with) and cutting the amount of food you eat in half can be dangerous.<p>The key problem with anorexia isn't that they have such low body fat (it's a problem, but it's unlikely to kill you) it's that they don't intake enough protein. Once there's a shortage, your body starts using muscle inside your body, and unfortunately there's a extremely highly protein dense half-pound of muscle we all know as a heart.<p>What the Atkin's diet is great for is that if you drastically need to lose weight you can do it without causing serious and irreparable muscle damage and potentially heart damage.<p>If you're wanting a long-term (as in 1 month or longer) change in diet then protein is key for exactly what you said. Most obese people are at high risk of things like hernias as most never built up the muscle in the abdominal wall and are literally a ticking time bomb.",1235669104

A successful older person has a trusted network that they can approach with their ideas, and therefore worry less about NDAs. Younger people -- and those with less experience -- are often cold contacting angels, or setting up meetings with potential investors they have had very short business relationships with.  The potential investor probably won't steal their amazing idea, but the process of starting up is much more difficult and the time cycle of idea to launch could be significantly longer for this group of people than those with experience, which could explain the paranoia.<p>I'd expect those with a smaller, less ""powerful"" network to more often ask for NDAs on new ventures, regardless of age.",1235668060
