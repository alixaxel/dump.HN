A low point was of course September, and October... but things have increased since then.  Even newspaper classifies for jobs are on the up.  Also the number of client requests for new projects has gone up for software developers/designers/advertisers/marketers I know.<p>I don't really track USA places - so I can't comment on them.<p>Is this Joel on Software post another thinly veiled advertisement for their services?  Yes.",1234407037
477923,comment,477601,477772,0,0,tjmc,,,"I think in general the distinction is that a startup can scale more readily than a small business. That's easier to do if you're selling software than, say, haircuts which is why I think the term ""startup"" is used so much around here.<p>I think there's also an element of the entrepreneurial mindset on HN. The term ""small business"" seems to be considered implicitly defeatist here, unless you're (merely) building a ""lifestyle business"" which excuses your lack of ambition!",1234406874

Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Palm's death-hour, nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die:
No place will please me so, no means of death,
As here by Palm, and by you cut off,
The choice and master spirits of this age.",1234406371

Smashing The Clock (mentioned in the article) was written over two years ago. This is the first I'm hearing of Blue Shirt Nation.<p>Then we have reality. Like many others I abhor shopping at Best Buy. Every employee is required to parrot a greeting at you when you get near. They have a large collection of music, none of which will be what you are looking for unless you have an affinity for top 40 trash. Their ""high end"" audio gear is overpriced Bose garbage. Cashiers try to sell you warranties for $10 electronic items, offer you magazine subscriptions and online services.<p>I also happen to know several people who have worked at Best Buy that absolutely hated it. There are entire websites dedicated to hating Best Buy that are frequented by former Best Buy employees.",1234405932

But it would probably be noticed!<p>You are probably right to an extent- but a lot of times people are browsing FB to waste time.  If they are looking at the profile of some girl they like, and an ad shows up for the new album of one of the bands she likes- could that not potentially be an effective ad?  (This could be a friend, who has a birthday coming up, and FB could suggest presents based on your friends preferences).  I really think that FB just needs to adapt their ads better.  I hope they get it figured out and prove everyone that thinks they aren't worth 15 billion wrong!",1234405502
