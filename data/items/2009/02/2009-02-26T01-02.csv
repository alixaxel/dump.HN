495254,comment,495188,495188,0,0,wallflower,,,"I liked this guide, even though it was brief - there were some useful career koans.<p>> Finally, don’t forget to be well rounded.<p>When I started my first real software development job at a fairly large company, I was surprised to see that practically everyone worked on their own life outside of work, with a few exceptions (like me, at the time). They were part-time geeks in that they spent time away from the computer - when they were not at work. That was the biggest difference for me - going from college to the work force.<p>Some had families - which were their focus - every year around Halloween time it was vividly evident how important their children were (""John has two kids!.. I had no idea"") and their jobs were (to support their families).<p>Some invested time in hobbies - whether it involved fixing up motorcycles, renovating their house, and my favorite (volunteering to maintain old railroad steam engines and <i>run</i> them on occasional weekends). The weirdest hobby - was a guy who did rubbings - as in rubbings of gravestones - when he traveled.<p>The first years in software development can be intense because you (usually) can hyper-focus on it. Once you get some experience, you'll start to realize it's not about the technology - there are common patterns. And once you have a lot of experience, you might be on the transition path out of wanting to code with the latest out there - e.g. settle down, start a family.<p>> That point is worth repeating another way: an extra dollar in salary is not really a dollar, it is 60 cents.<p>In the crazy dot-com days, I invested a mere thousand and made $25k+ and lost it all on margin calls. And learned to realize how hard it is to actually make $25,000 while paying living expenses. Tracking is the first step to budgeting - and it can be painful.",1235612424

495235,comment,494943,495181,0,0,dejb,,,"I think it is probably most relevant to consider where the funding comes from - 'He who pays the piper calls the tune'. You really would have to involve those who fund the research in your little conspiracy theory for it to make sense. Publicly funded research money generally comes from the government. I don't really see enough incentive for the governments of the world to be paying for biased research in favour of global warming. In fact I would argue that the previous US administration demonstrated a significant bias against the global warming case.<p>In the case of private organisations the incentive to pay for biased research is obvious and it is an expected tactic.<p>When proposing a conspiracy theory such as the one you are with respect to global warming it can help to point to a previous examples of where a similar thing has occurred. As an counter conspiracy theory example I'll put up the debate over smoking. Although public research started to show signs of health problems, the smoking industry fought with their own paid 'research'. Millions of lives have probably been lost as a result of the delays in changes to public policy because of the FUD spread by the smoking lobby. To me the incentives with global warming seem to be the same as with smoking was and I see every reason to believe the situation is the same.",1235611486

This, however, does not <i>necessarily</i> mean that the concept we nowadays refer to as 'technology' did not appear in earlier Presidents' addresses by other terms: 'invention', 'innovation', 'engineering', etc. Therefore, I find the author's racing of 'future' and 'technology' in the historic speeches to be rather meaningless.",1235611466
495233,comment,494943,495181,0,0,mkn,,,"Ah, the despicable grant-money trope rears its ugly head again. Fine and fair enough, we all agree that research takes money. But I would really like to see, from people who run this one up the flagpole, substantive evidence indicating that 1) Advocating falsehoods is a good way to get grant money, rather than to earn scientific ridicule and a sure death to one's research credibility, and/or 2) A significant number of theories have risen to acceptance within the scientific community based on the supposed ease they afforded in obtaining funding, and have later been dropped when the scandal was discovered.<p>Note that the above two, if supplied, would still not rise to the level of proof that any particular area of research was lethally contaminated by researchers' avarice. For that, you would actually have to show 1) That the research was flawed or came to an incorrect conclusion, and 2) That the researchers responsible were falsifying data or inventing specters with the intent of obtaining funding. To discredit research in this way, you would have to use the scientific method to convince scientists, and/or courtroom procedure to convince a jury in, say, a civil trial to recover fraudulently obtained research dollars.<p>The above should be enough to show why these accusations occur in online forums, editorial pages, and blogs, rather than in research journals or courts of law. Simply put, it cannot be done because these accusations are so patently absurd as to be rejected out of hand by people whose expertise is actually in finding things like this out. If it were otherwise, one could make an academic career out of showing it. If <i>you</i> are so sure of it, please do so. Get published in Nature, or another respected journal. Do such groundbreaking research that you get invited to give talks to academic audiences. Your service to mankind by debunking a flawed institution that claims (at this point legitimately, I might add) the mantle of being the best way that the human race has of gaining new knowledge will be immeasurable, even if you did not, in the same stroke, supply humankind with another and superior edifice. Until then, by perpetuating this silly vicious lie, you are merely pissing in the fountain of knowledge* for the purposes of self-aggrandizement.<p>Our current body of scientific knowledge has been made possible by the scientific method. This method is designed to <i>ruthlessly root out falsehood.</i> Look at cold fusion. I would imagine there would be no easier way to get funding than the promise of cheap, relatively low-tech, non-polluting, and abundant energy. Yet, Pons and Fleischman were immediately discredited and now stand as objects of ridicule to this day. Everything that you rely on to supply you with your modern lifestyle comes from this kind of scientific rigor. Medicine, transportation, hygiene, materials, manufacturing, computers, the list goes on.<p>Show a little bit of the proper respect due to the edifice that has done so much for you.<p>*""[P]issing in the fountain of knowledge"" borrowed from YouTube user Thunderf00t's excellent videos on young earth creationism whackos.

I found Y Combinator naturally.  As I was reading the application (just to see what the process entailed), I read one line about how good applicants come from HN.

If you have other (trusted) coders that you know, see if any of them are willing to take the work from job 1 at the going rate ($19/ hr).  Ethically, I believe you can send the work to them (and they might be grateful, given the economy...)  Additionally, be sure to bill for the hours that you spend spec'ing the work to your subcontractor (these will be few and far between -- but most companies would be willing to pay to have stuff completed sooner).<p>If you don't have trusted colleagues (and/or cannot find someone working for $19/ hr), I'd start looking for them.  I recommend trying out oDesk (outsourcing).  As long as you have decent specs, they can crank out work quickly for you.  Of course, you will still need to rewrite a bunch of their stuff (most don't have great code quality, IME), but you bill that out as well.<p>This leaves you time for the real money making project.<p>The big problem is the on-site requirement.

495216,comment,495053,495053,0,0,dcurtis,,,"I think a lot of the growth problems might have to do with the devaluation of karma. The solution to this might actually raise the quality of comments and front page stories.<p>When I posted a comment here a year and a half ago, I felt like each vote was a real, actual smart person praising or agreeing with what I had said. Each point had a lot of meaning, and back then 5 points was considered a pretty good score. Now each point means much less for some reason. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because I don't trust each individual person as much. For example, as I write this, the top comment is about someone using a script to submit this article. It's two sentences, and it has received eleven votes. To me, each of those individual votes mean less than they used to.<p>The net effect of one vote, for the whole culture of hacker news, has gone down significantly. This reduces the total perception of worth for each user, and, more importantly, for each voting action. Back in the beginning, I felt like I had some amount of <i>power</i>, in that if I voted something up it would literally rise in the list. In fact, I felt like I had some sort of <i>responsibility</i>. Now that active, obvious change in story rank rarely happens, so I feel like my vote is somewhat worthless.<p>I tend to mostly agree that the quality level of submissions and comments has stayed the same during the growth of this site, but the devaluation of karma has led to other cultural changes. There's something comforting about sharing ideas within a small group of people because you feel like you have real influence, and I think I'm starting to lose that feeling here. There are so many new faces that my perception of quality has gone down, even if the actual net level of quality for each item has stayed the same. Seeing many posts with 100+ karma on the front page recently has kind of solidified that feeling for me. Who are these hundreds of people?",1235610254
