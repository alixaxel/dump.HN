I really doubt many outside of a tech environment have ever even heard of Opera. I still am surprised at those unaware of Firefox.<p>And something they need to learn, even if you have a superior product, a business requires superior marketing to succeed. Relying on anti-trust lawsuits and 'call to actions' are not really going to advance them to where they want to be. In this case, they come off appearing weak (and starting a wikipedia entry on it, oh please, talk about where factual claims are not going to be represented).",1235660226

495862,comment,493712,494908,0,0,gstar,,,"Apologies in advance if this is rambling.<p>I'm an IT contractor (never done web for money).  My opinion was formulated based on my experience managing an IT division over 5 years or so and also doing various PM and architecture roles.<p>You can more-or-less validate the first 50% of my claim by giving a bunch of computer literate people some brand new boxed PCs or Macs, and an internet connection and telling them to go for it and set up their environment.  They'll be able to get things up and running, and if they have a little bit of nous they will usually come up with something workable.<p>Of course, it won't be engineered.  I did some work for a fairly big manufacturer about 10 years ago that opened a small office on the east coast of Australia.  The small office got absolutely no IT support as it was off the radar, and because of the corporate structure Finance left them alone too.<p>They managed to brew up the essentials of what they needed using Access for sales/marketing, MYOB for the books and corporate webmail and hotmail.  When IT found out, they went spare and ""fixed"" everything.  The office suffered in both performance and morale  because instead of their terrible (but working) homebuilt CRM and accounting systems they had to use a set of ancient AS/400 apps that were about 1000ms away (no problem for interactivity because they were on 5250 screens, but very slow turnaround).  The PCs were useless too, IT made them log in to Netware and do file/print over an 8kbps CIR Frame Relay connection.<p>Government (and to a lesser extent business) exposing and unifying APIs and SAAS probably means that in 2009 situations like the one I messily chronicled above will scale, because the IT development and infrastructure component just isn't required.  Someone somewhere else who knows all about scaling, security, DRP and backup has done it for them and is happy to charge a per-user-per-month fee.<p>If this happened now, they might have used a 37Signals product and Salesforce for example (no idea about the ERP side).<p>My current contract is a guerilla finance project to build some analysis tools for SOX compliance that they haven't been able to get corporate IT to deliver on for 3 years.  We built a small app in Python with a web front-end (Django).  It was quick, it worked, and it's a manifestation of people realising that IT has become commoditised and that IT doesn't have to be hard.  I guess IT wanted to do something like build some ABAP programs in SAP using consultants that charge £800 a day on a 2 year timeline.<p>There's a lot of law firms, design offices and small practices that just go out and buy some macs and never even call in IT help.  It's going to happen and keep happening, and it's difficult to see how the shift away from corporate IT could happen if you're focussed on changing the VAT rates in FORTRAN, applying PTFs to the iSeries, or keeping the active directory backed up.  Shifts aren't usually obvious when you're in the thick of it.<p>I don't think the quickest typists in the typing pool ever thought that the managing director would type his own memos 30 years ago, either.",1235658459
