Some people think Sex Pistols are nothing but noise.<p>We don't know much about Homer, Plato's concept of ""the gods"" was one that said humans had their own free will and were <i>not</i> tools of the gods (brush up on Greek mythology, particularly Prometheus), Einstein gets called religious but wasn't actually. Dante you may be right about: I haven't studied him enough to know.<p>People claiming brilliance goes back as far as Shakespeare, who was known for being hotheaded and arrogant with his writing. It certainly goes back further, though I couldn't name specific names earlier than Shakespeare, who's pretty much the perfect null hypothesis. If Shakespeare thought he was good in and of himself, that means possibly the greatest artist of all time rejects this theory of divine inspiration.<p>Art isn't about <i>originality</i>. It's about <i>personality</i>. Art is partly about technical expertise, partly about artist ego. You only know yourself: the process to genius in art is the process of discovering your own standards.<p>For what it's worth, I've never had that experience. I know exactly what caused me to have the ideas that I do. I analyze my ideas until I understand what drives me to create them. As a result, I'm extraordinarily egotistical. It's why I thought it was worth denying the statements from the original post.",1234065433

Isn't going critical a kind of shorthand for going supercritical, because in practice any situation that produces the first is going to produce the second?<p>Edit: Actually I think criticality is the right metaphor.  It's a change in state from what preceded it.  That's the important part, not the resulting explosion.  (Arguably there are in fact analogs to control rods in online discussions-- nesting depth, the fact that people get tired after a while, etc.)",1234065424

One of the questions  was whether or not I had a personal website, which I didn't. I did not end up with that job.<p>A website will make you more professional. Let's say I come across your blog. If I read more than a few entries, it would probably be that I was interested in your writing. Since your writing sounds technical, your blog might make me interested in having you work for me (assuming that I was in a position where I was managing people). Well, if your blog was on a website, I would be able to find out a lot more about you. And things like a resume and a project portfolio might convince me that I wanted to contact you.<p>So basically my point is that a website related to your work and career will help you market yourself and build relationships with other people.

Schools are littered with ""all-American students"" who try to be as generically happy as possible. It makes finding actually bright kids a pain.<p>The problem is that the counterculture rejects that stuff - partly because it's true that a <i>lot</i> of people who do all that are shallow and annoying.

When the government ""redefines"" civil marriage (e.g. with the inclusion of interracial couples), religious organizations can still retain their own definitions of marriage.<p>If the government had originally had all couples register as ""civil unions"" and optionally marry in churches, then surprisingly this debate may never have occurred -- it is purely semantical.",1234064290

471780,comment,471353,471667,0,0,unalone,,,"And yet. And yet Harry Potter says that Voldemort isn't the only evil, that the Ministry that Harry's expecting to take care of him is just as awful in that it hides facts to raise morale. And yet, part of the moral of the book is that if you fight for what's right, there's a chance you're killed for your beliefs. And yet, the father-figure is revealed in the end to be a racist and a bigot and partly a coward. Some of the villains go unpunished. Some innocent people are tortured and killed. The moral of Harry Potter might be that good wins in the end, yeah, but it absolutely offers ambiguity. Never with Harry, but with other people. And that's fine, literarily speaking: it makes Harry and Voldemort into foils, into pure good and pure evil, and from there you can debate the exact nature of good and evil. The story's deeper than it lets on because it's <i>so</i> well written (for the most part) that you can ignore a lot of what's going on because it puts itself very subtly into the background.<p>Furthermore, it ended a lot of the publication limits on what constitutes kid's literature. Suddenly the stories don't have to all end happily ever after, lengthy series with <i>big</i> books are acceptable, and heavily political and religious themes are allowed. That's big: it let kid's lit writers have a lot more respect for their work.",1234064236

471769,comment,471207,471352,0,0,petercooper,,,"<i>The problem is that ""subscriber"" is supposed to equate to ""person"", but it does not. In email marketing this works because we have a person identifier (the email address). There is no similar identifier for feed. What that means is that out of TechCrunch's 100,000 subscribers, I as an individual represent 5+ subscribers (once on Google Reader, once on bloglines, once on NewsGator, once with NetNewsWire at home, once at NetNewsWire at work). I am a pretty typical TechCrunch subscriber so it is possible the number of ""people"" is actually 20% of the number of ""subscribers"".</i><p>Do typical TechCrunch subscribers subscribe using <i>five</i> different feed readers? I don't subscribe to it anymore (I do follow @techcrunch on Twitter though - TC posts too often for my feed reading habits) but when I did I used, well, <i>one</i> feed reader. I assume that is pretty typical. Besides, your e-mail example doesn't work either if someone has five e-mail addresses!<p>Going off of the stats on several of my feeds (ranging from 18,000 ""subscribers"" down to about 1000) I see that in most cases Google Reader accounts for 50%-70% of subscribers. The numbers Google provide <i>should</i> be pretty accurate.. and so while there might be a slightly inaccurate swing in the remaining 30%, if the Google Feedfetcher number is showing 10,000 subscribers, I am pretty much guaranteed that's 10,000 unique Google users.<p>As a publisher with a significant audience for my niche, I find the subscriber count <i>very</i> useful and it provides much of the reason why I've stayed with FeedBurner despite the issues. It makes it easy for me to prove I'm the biggest in my niche because the closest people have counts over 30% lower than mine.. and I can't see the swing being that much considering how popular Google Reader is now.",1234063458

The implication was that problems like that do show up in ""real-life"" coding, and while brute-force solutions for those problems work for very small n, you need to recognize the fact that those problems do not have reasonable solutions in general, and you should know how to approximate the solutions (in the technical sense of ""approximation""), and furthermore know enough complexity theory to know the situations where even an approximation will not have a reasonable solution.<p>For example, I believe that the problem of creating optimal schedules for high school students is NP-Complete (optimal in the sense that it will satisfy all of the students' preferences for electives, and all of the teachers' preferences for the classes they want to teach).<p>Yes, I admit that the example will never involve petabytes of data.

I think a huge number of Internet users are vulnerable to it:<p>a)  Use any means you please to compromise the password on a low-security site, such as HN.<p>b)  Use the same login credentials at other low-security sites, such as Facebook and Twitter.  These compromises are valuable in their own right, but what you are really looking for is the email address.<p>c)  After you have their email address, compromise it using variations on the same password you already know.<p>d)  You can now read their email.  Search for ""statement"", and identify which bank they bank with.  Go to bank and try logging in with their email and password.  That probably just worked.  If not, click ""lost password"", supply email address and their security question (you have their Facebook already or can in seconds, how hard will it be to find their mother's maiden name or middle school?), and enjoy.<p>e)  For added fun, look for other high-value accounts whose security is premised on the email user being authorized, such as brokerages (a tough target due to strong institutional controls, like banks) and GoDaddy (a successful compromise would cost me FAR more than what I have in my bank account).<p>The worst part?

471761,comment,471192,471596,0,0,gojomo,,,"It's inherent to TCP's exponential backoff, which means any one connection's throughput follows a sawtooth pattern, pushing to use more capacity, then falling back after lost packets. The gaps between the 'teeth' are suboptimal utilization.<p>Multiple TCP connections improve things as long as each connection's 'teeth' aren't aligned. Consumer broadband asymmetry makes it worse, because when one direction gets saturated (like an uplink) and loses ACK packets on connections that are primarily downward, the downward side still backs off, even if it wasn't yet close to using downward capacity.<p>Your example of getting full capacity from a LAN link isn't very instructive for what happens over broadband links. Suppose your NIC supports 100Mbps and every link to your LAN destination has at least that capacity. Your NIC will be the bottleneck; you won't trigger the TCP mechanisms. As soon as your 100Mbps local link hits your 10Mbps cable modem, the TCP congestion control becomes a significant factor.",1234063012
