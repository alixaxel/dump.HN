OS X is missing many modern OS features, like automatic updates for all your software and programmable window management (a la Xmonad).</i><p>Most of my software <i>does</i> automatically update. I'm not entirely certain what programmable window management is, to be honest, so it doesn't seem entirely necessary.<p><i>I don't think you quite understand -- if you don't follow their rules, you lose your job, your house, your freedom, and your way of life.</i><p>As I said in my other response post: I'm not standing by Apple. I'm saying that I won't go out of my way to vilify them for this. I believe really firmly in an artist's right to control their creation, and I think that Apple's work qualifies. Jailbreaking is also removing a lot of profit from the app store developers. I think that's a damn shame. People are pirating the App Store applications.<p>Jail time is pretty severe. But I won't criticize Apple for going after people who're refusing to play by their rules, because in all honesty, if I was in their position I don't know if I wouldn't be just as harsh.<p><i>Finally, it's important to keep in mind that Macs are just Dell machines in a pretty case. Intel makes reference designs, and everyone uses those. Macs are truly pretty, but that's all -- they are not particularly functional. In my group of friends, there is about a 50/50 split between Apple laptops and Thinkpads. Among these people, there is not one broken Thinkpad, but there are three broken Macs. All the problems are keyboard-related, so they have to carry around an external keyboard until they have $1500 to buy a new computer. Apple won't fix them.</i><p>It's an old adage that design isn't how something looks, it's how it works. Macbooks have far more elegant functionality. This is much contested, so let's not have yet another debate about this, but the computers' designs are leagues apart. I'm also a bit biased because the Apple Store has fixed my messed-up keyboard, and because I've spilled OFTEN on my Mac with no problem.<p>This is a debate that has a lot of different perspectives. In my college, three Dell computers have died on my floor alone. No Macs have. There's a different story in every group.<p><i>So anyway -- you are not really depriving yourself of anything if you go for a Linux box. The software you'll run on it is the same as anything else. The hardware is identical to what you get in a Mac. The price is probably the same. In fact, I think you'll find that the increased customizability will make the Linux box a better deal.</i><p>I know this'll provoke another rant, so I apologize in advance, but again and again: if that's how you look at computers, yes. Linux will be better. I don't look at it that way: I look at built-in experience. I think that customization is a waste of time. My computer uses the graphite theme and a black background, no custom icons, and half the software I use is default Mac software. Out of the box, Mac offers more. That's my perspective, and the two of us have bitched back and forth about this enough that having this damn argument just doesn't seem worth the time.",1234684561

Changing the world is actually very low on my priority list and I'd say most of the other founders I know think likewise.<p>It's not that I wouldn't love to change the world - I just don't find that a realistic goal to set.

 the best damn computer you can, regardless of company reputation,
 regardless of what other people think about it.</i><p>I'm not sure how this is an argument in favor of Apple.  OS X is
missing many modern OS features, like automatic updates for all your
software and programmable window management (a la Xmonad).  If you are
just going to use emacs, Firefox, and xterm, using OS X is going to
waste a lot of your time compared to a slightly-tweaked Linux install.
(With that in mind, if you use GNOME or KDE, you are also going to
have your time wasted, although at least everything updates itself in
the background, and it's no worse than OS X or Windows.)<p><i>Of course Apple is a dick. They insist on having complete control
over your user experience.</i><p>Including sending you to <i>prison</i> if you don't do what they tell you.
I don't think you quite understand -- if you don't follow their rules,
you lose your job, your house, your freedom, and your way of life.
(This is not really Apple's fault, since they didn't make the law, but
the fact that they are interested in ""taking advantage"" of laws like
this show that they are truly evil.  Nobody has threatened me with
jail over modifying my OpenMoko phone.)<p>Finally, it's important to keep in mind that Macs are just Dell
machines in a pretty case.  Intel makes reference designs, and

an external keyboard until they have $1500 to buy a new computer.
Apple won't fix them.<p>Incidentally, I have watched someone accidentally spill a bottle of
water onto his Thinkpad, and the thing still works fine.  The water
drains through the little drainage holes that go through the laptop,
and it's easy to disassemble everything so it can dry out properly.
Not so with a Mac -- I hope you like external keyboards.<p>So anyway -- you are not really depriving yourself of anything if you

The production values improved later on (and Joey's clothes changed a lot), but it really seemed the same to me. Note that I'm evaluating it as a series of jokes, which is the primary characteristic of a sit-com (though not the only one).",1234683350

Colleges -- especially Harvard, Yale, MIT, etc. -- offer a wonderful education and opportunity to their students. The professors are the best in their field and you can learn a lot; and can grow both intellectually and as a human being.<p>What you take out of college is what you put into it. College isn't for everyone, so don't attend if you’re not willing to put in the time and effort, but you can learn so much if you do the work, pay attention, and get involved.

481821,comment,481211,481211,0,0,1gor,,,"China has been keeping the value of its own currency down in order to support its exports to the US, and in the process it has been accumulating dollars (which then are invested in US debt). There is a big question if they will continue to do that.<p>The US debt accumulation process runs like this.<p>A Chinese exporter of electric goods (for example) has its revenues in US dollars but his costs are mostly in Yuan. As he receives money from his American customers, he sells dollars to buy local currency to pay his workers, to pay taxes etc. Without Chinese central bank intervention the collective activity of exporters would drive Yuan rate up vs dollar very quickly and that would make their exports less competitive.<p>Chinese central bank wants to keep exports competitive, so it buys US dollars from the exporters at artificially high rates. Its 'foreign currency reserves' keep growing as long as there are exporters bringing in piles of export revenues in dollars. All these dollars needs to be bought up in order to keep Chinese exports competitive. And then all these bought dollars need to be invested, the US Treasuries being the natural place for it.<p>This all works as long as US consumer is buying. But the US consumers have stopped buying like they used to for many years and some say forever. No major revenues are expected from exports to the US. No need to buy dollars for the Central Bank.<p>In fact, the opposite is likely to happen. Chinese domestic consumption is growing fast. Very soon domestic Chinese market will become the biggest target for the world's exporters, just as US post-war consumer was. Chinese central bank may want to stimulate local consumption and capital inflows by switching to 'strong Yuan' policy, just like US did with its dollar. There will be no point of spporting the USD and holding dollar-denominated securities (US treasuries) for them.<p>To summarize, Chinese investment in US treasuries is not a result of desire to find a 'safe heaven' for extra money. It is because they need to park all that greenbacks the accumulated during years of keeping the Yuan down. Today they do not need to support USD anymore. They have no reason to buy US debt either. Prepare for a nasty surprise.",1234682276
481820,comment,481789,481789,0,0,aneesh,,,"This is a great move by Glaxo.  I interned a drug company a couple years ago, and you could tell there was real effort to make sure those could not afford the drugs, but needed them, could still avail their benefits.  There were programs to provide drugs at free or reduced costs, and real patients were frequently brought to the company's headquarters to talk to scientists & executives about the diseases they faced, and how they faced them.  Moves like this on Glaxo's part can do a lot to ease the burden of disease.<p>There are two problems here:<p>1) Affordability of drugs.  The onus here is on the drug companies to be good citizens, follow Glaxo's lead, and go even further.  It makes good sense for drug companies to give back in this way, like Google's support of many open-source initiatives.<p>2) Lack of treatment for third-world diseases.  This is a much bigger problem that will require outside forces, like private foundations or government.  Big drug companies are making drugs for lucrative diseases like cancer, but people in poor countries are dying of AIDS, diarrhea, or malaria, before they even have a chance of getting cancer.  There's not any monetary incentive for research to go into solving these problems in poor countries.",1234681518
