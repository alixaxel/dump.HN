There's no way in hell I'd be a programmer if it meant working with punch cards; it'd be above my irritation threshold. There might be a lot of people out there who would enjoy programming, but installing and configuring a compiler and editor, for instance, are simply too frustrating/boring to them.<p>There weren't many photographers when you had to develop your own film.

Wants to live a little.<p>I've recently been a victim of the redundancies here in the UK, I was previously at Blyk (about.blyk.com), as an everything guy. I worked on PR projects, assisted in developing the mobile content portal proposition, managed the online channel, mobile design and production. They liked my mind, and applied it to lots.<p>I'm pretty fed up of the UK and am endeared by the states and the start-up scene.<p>I can find flights for £350 from Heathrow to SFO, which leaves accommodation to be found. I'm on an incredibly tight budget.<p>So I'd be incredibly appreciative if anybody:<p>- Knows of a reasonably priced room going, or has a spare room<p>- Knows of an available position (I can imagine they are few and far between)<p>- Will trade work for board<p>About me: I'm 19, left school at 17. Joined Blyk, there for nearly 2 years. Worked 3 roles in Marketing and Creative. I'm a normal kinda guy. British. Dashing. Charming. Modest. Have been living in central London for the last 2 years. Versatile, hungry for knowledge.<p>I just need to get out there and then make the next steps. When do I want to leave? As soon as Monday.<p>I truly appreciate any help or comments, I'll be refreshing every 10-20 seconds!<p>Many thanks,<p>Geoff Wright",1233499897

460872,comment,460555,460864,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yep, you would think so.<p>But the economy is mind-bogglingly complex and nuanced, full of billions of actors who act rationally and irrationally. Lately we have computer systems thrown into the mix that move billions of dollars around without a human decision involved.<p>The one thing economists <i>can</i> say is that people usually act in their own best interests. If there is a loophole to be found, people will find it. However smart the person coming up with the rules might be, those billions of people, due to the powers of chaos and sheer numbers, will always be smarter. You can't engineer billions of people like you would a skyscraper.<p>The logical conclusion here is to that simple systems that are easy to understand (and likewise easy to understand how to game) are better than complex systems that still get gamed but nobody can easily figure out why.<p>However there is a second camp that says that the economy is like a big science experiment: pull a rope here and see what happens over there. Sure -- things might not work as expected, but somebody has to be in charge and that's how science experiments work. After all, as you pointed out, just how difficult can it be? What <i>do</i> those guys do all day?<p>The problem is that the social engineering camp always seems to have the same problem as the laissez-faire camp -- there have been panics (recessions) for as far back as we have records. So policy doesn't seem to matter that much (or if it does, we haven't hit the magic combination yet). In fact, because of the points in the first two paragraphs here, there's good evidence that the more we muck around with the economy, the worse we actually make it. There is a large and growing faction of economists that believe that the actions of the Federal Reserve (and to some extent Hoover and FDR) made the panic of 1929 into a full-blown depression -- turned something that would have taken a year or three to recover from and turned it into the biggest panic the country has ever seen.<p>So no, economics are chaotic, not Newtonian. the laws that apply are myriad, complex, and currently non-understandable -- and they apply at the individual rather than system level. That's why economics are so much fun (or suck so much, depending on your viewpoint.)<p>Hey -- if it were easy, everybody would be doing it.",1233499041

We have rules about how to build skyscrapers to keep people from getting hurt.  Why not the economy?  Take what works, throw out what hurts.<p>There has to be an incentive for people to make money, but it should be ok if it's required to be within a set of guidelines.  Unfettered capitalism builds an unstable system.  Unstable is bad (again, think skyscraper).<p>Certainly, economists must have a set of rules or principles that apply here.  It would be some equation with a bunch of variable coefficients.  Under some values of those coefficients, the equation would have an approximate solution that is unstable, like an exponential term with an exponent that can swing from being positive to negative and back.  The job of ""regulations"" would be to limit these coefficients.<p>They must have that sort of thing, right?  I mean, what the fuck do they do all day?",1233497772

Rather my point is simply that when the expectations are very high -- he has a NYT quote on that same page calling him ""the Leonardo da Vinci of data"" -- this kind of tiny detail leaps out because poor typography is an example of how design mistakes can make it more difficult to convey information.",1233497581

It is highly unusual that people making minimum wage at one point in time are the same people that are making minimum wage many years later. The same is true for net worth, which almost as a rule takes time to acquire.

So it is completely rational to expect that to some extent the lower tiers don’t grow as much as the upper tiers - you’re not taking the age/time factor into consideration.<p>I would be interested to see the same numbers broken down by age group - for example, how is the net worth of people in the bottom 20% and top 20% changing just for people in the 40-45 age group.</i><p><a href=""http://www.urban.org/Publications/406722.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urban.org/Publications/406722.html</a><p><i>The [U.S. Department of Treasury (1992)] study uses income tax return data between 1979 and 1988, tracking the adjusted gross income of a group of households that paid income taxes in all ten years examined.
