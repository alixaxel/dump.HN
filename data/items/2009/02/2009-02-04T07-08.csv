You should have <i>one</i> unit test that depends upon the location of the menu, and everything else should be isolated by stubs, shunts, mocks, whatever.  Otherwise, they aren't really unit tests, because they're testing more than a unit.<p>I didn't realize how wrong I was doing it until I got to Google.  (Then again, a lot of Google's best programmers are doing it wrong too.)  Perhaps this is because doing the right thing - mocking out your dependencies and testing <i>only</i> one feature per test - is often harder in the short term than just running all your code when you test the topmost layer.  But I think the point needs to be hammered home: most programmers who're doing ""unit"" testing are not doing <i>unit</i> testing, and their code would be much less brittle if they took the time to stub out lower layers.",1233733484

  that you tend to make as code evolves tend to break a constant percentage
  of your unit tests.... 
  So the end result is that, as your project gets bigger and bigger, if you 
  really have a lot of unit tests, the amount of investment you'll have to make
  in maintaining those unit tests, keeping them up-to-date and keeping them 
  passing, starts to become disproportional to the amount of benefit that you 
  get out of them.</code></pre>",1233732281
