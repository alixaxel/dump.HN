Yes he sets out lists of guidelines to follow that you can brainlessly treat like a checklist, but you won't get the full understanding behind <i>why</i> he created the list (and in what context) if you treat the guidelines that way.<p>Jeff Veen gave an analogy at an Adaptive Path workshop I went to a long time ago. I'm no expert and I don't remember the exact verbiage, it was something along the lines of how in kayaking, there's a few basic rules of safety when it comes to tides and currents, but if you don't understand how those rules came to be, then you're left completely vulnerable to very dangerous edge cases where the rules don't apply, like when paddling under a bridge. If you just stick to a checklist in the situation, you'll get sucked under and die.",1233964786

Launching our Open Beta today!<p>Pain: most sites look and work terrible on mobile. Latest devices (iPhone, Android) work OK as emergency web access tools, but don't provide a proper mobile experience (like http://iphone.facebook.com/ does).<p>Designing for mobile is time-consuming and expensive, so most sites don't bother.<p>Current solutions: build a separate mobile site (lots of work), mobilize an RSS feed (not good enough for most sites), use an automatic transcoder (poor look & feel).<p>Painkiller: Mobify.Me lets you, the web designer, <i>quickly</i> design a ""mobile projection"" of the existing site by picking content blocks off your site in our web interface, styling it with CSS and deploying via a DNS CNAME. Mobify.Me takes care of device recognition, image resizing (sites download 2x to 10x faster), feature detection, template matching and many other mobile problems.<p>We're bootstrapped and will be introducing several premium tiers this weekend. There is a completely free limited tier as well.<p>It would be great to get your feedback! Please let us know what you think.<p>Here's some examples:<p>http://m.grousemountain.com (powered by a custom CMS, 3 hrs of work)<p>http://techvibes.mobify.me (powered by a custom CMS, 3 hrs of work)<p>http://spin.mobify.me (unofficial mobile version of spin.com, Drupal, 4 hrs of work)<p>http://momo.mobify.me (unofficial mobile version of mobilemonday.net, WordPress, 2 hrs of work)<p>Thanks!<p>Team Mobify.Me",1233964699

I had hoped that this appearance was superficial, and that in reality they wanted a student to inquire and ask for assistance beyond the covered material, but alas, this was not the case.  In reality, my questions were usually greeted with being ""irrelevant to the course material and not related to what we were covering"" - even when the material was clearly an extension of the course material and was presented by me as a means to engage the teacher and hopefully learn more than how to write a C++ application to parse a txt file...  \nThis said, my Java and ASM teachers were great and did welcome this interaction - but the majority of my professors seemed disinterested (at best) in talking about anything other than the verbatim script out of the book.\nBut that was just my school - mileage varies.",1233963846

It worked pretty well, except for the API seems to lack some basic features.  For instance, if you happen to lose the id of a customer profile, there is no way to ever recover or delete the profile.  It will just remain inaccessible (and blocking duplicates) forever.  Additionally the API is bolted onto their old API, so you have to check two fields for error responses, etc.  Definitely a solid system, but sort of rough around the edges.<p>Now as of this past December we decided that it was a priority to internationalize billing for our app.  We have partners in Europe and have even received grant money there.  Long story short, we needed to be able to bill Europeans in Euros.  As it turns out, quite a few gateways advertise billing in foreign currencies, but the majority convert the currency internally and then bill in dollars.  Well you can imagine that if you're in Europe and you purchase something for €5, but the gateway converts to dollars (at an unfavorable rate) and then bills your account in USD (incurring a second unfavorable rate), you're going to be pissed when you see a €7 charge on your statement.<p>In our (admittedly rapid) research, for any kind of low to moderate volume of transactions, Braintree is the only gateway that will actually process multiple currencies directly.  We made the switch, and processing payments in 3 currencies as of 24 hours ago.  The Braintree API (standard POST) is dead simple compared to Authorize.net (SOAP) and yet doesn't feel any less powerful.",1233963696

I believe this line is what Deist Christians believe, that there was a big bang but that fundamentally everything had already been arranged to happen long before the Earth had even formed.<p>I suppose when I was Christian I was probably a deist. I couldn't believe that some magical power made the red seas part, and either it never happened or god arranged a freak weather phenomena that could. I mean to create Earth how it is he obviously must have planned a Mars sized object crashing into primitive Earth to form the Moon.

470537,comment,469880,469880,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I don't understand the causation/design argument. Anything complicated enough to create the universe must be just as, if not more, complicated as the universe It creates. If God or The Flying Spaghetti Monster created our universe, then such Entity must be at least as complex as our universe, begging the infinite regress of who created said Entity and why is said Entity so complex? Causation itself is a red herring. The universe is, period, properly viewed in imaginary time, not real time. In imaginary time, it is neither created (caused) or destroyed. It just is. And if you don't understand that, I suggest you re-read 'A brief history of time'. Thus if the universe has no cause then structures within like ourselves should need no Designer, otherwise, who designed the Designer? Design in an un-caused universe ends up being an illusion given to us by natural selection. Within (real) time, natural selection works, creating things like human apes and elephants. Within imaginary time, nothing is created nor destroyed. Natural selection explains design. Imaginary time shows there is no beginning, no need for a cause. Clinging to the god delusion is going to require more than first cause and design arguments boys and girls. There is one sense in which God or The Flying Spaghetti Monster do exist, and that is, they exist as memes. They are viruses which hijack the human mind and in some cases cause the human it hijacks to hijack, say, airplanes. There is a great poster out there with the words, ""Imagine no religion"" superimposed over a picture of the twin towers. Without God, the meme of God, that is, those towers would still stand. I think its time this species grow up and get rid of the god delusion or else we bloody well deserve to go extinct.",1233961966

I see the difference between atheism and agnosticism as analogous to the difference between conclusiveness and inconclusiveness.<p>I don't agree with the ""refuted yes"" idea. In logic, ""no"" is not necessary equal to ""not yes"". For example, ""not black"" could be ""white"", but also ""green"". ""God"" does not have a well defined enough definition: it's very likely that God is not a bearded man on a cloud, but questions like whether omnipotence or omnipresence exist  (and their correlations) are a whole new can of philosophical worms :)",1233961957

It's like when they discovered they don't believe in a god anymore, any trace of evolution in their view of the universe just freezed. This is bullshit. I can easily call myself secular humanist, vaguely militant-atheist, zen-atheist (there's also zen-christians and zen-buddhists, don't worry), and I doubt very much I will die with the same labels.<p>People change, and people are different.

Plenty of people with stellar resumes and 20 years' experience come in and absolutely bomb on relatively simple coding problems.  Maybe they used to know how to code but have gotten rusty since they've been doing more management or hands-off architecture recently, but for whatever reason they can't solve problems that any recent grad ought to be able to solve.  Some of those people can talk a good game when discussing higher-level stuff or when they're doing a lot of hand-waving, but they just can't translate it into code effectively.  My point is not that ""older"" people can't code:  when you do find someone with 20 years experience who can code well, they're generally incredibly valuable.  Rather, it's that you always have to be skeptical and can't take someone's resume or stated experience and skills at face value.  Those questions are there to filter out people that won't be successful in our company because their coding skills are below par, regardless of age, experience, or education.<p>If someone asks you to do something that seems ""beneath"" you or trivial, just do it as well and as quickly as you can so you can get it over with and talk about more interesting things, or use the problem itself as an excuse to start a conversation about something more interesting than the problem itself (""the interesting thing here, is that if you write it this way it's easier to test"" or ""if you used a language like X, you could write this more easily,"" or ""realistically, I think this function would be more useful if you changed it to behave like this, so that it would then be useful for doing Y and Z as well as X."")<p>It's nothing personal, it's just the interviewer's job to be skeptical about your stated skills until you prove to him or her that they shouldn't be.",1233961689
