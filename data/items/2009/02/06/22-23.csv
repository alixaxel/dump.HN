The answer for that is to work at a company that offers such a ladder (there are many) or work in a start-up (where they can't afford to have ""pure managers"").<p>There is also shops which are driven by buzzwords rather than actual technology, who are just looking for bunch of kids who match a keyword list. I wouldn't want to work there anyway (whether at my present age, or in ten-fifteen years).<p>There's also the illegitimate worry: ""some 22 year-old will replace me""; this is of the same genre as ""my job will get outsourced to India"". The answer to that is don't do simple, trivial work.  Be something besides a byte pusher (incidentally, great deal of ""web development"" is indeed simply pushing bytes). Anyone can make a CRUD app with PHP and MySQL: learn something which isn't immediately listed in the craigslist jobs section, perhaps?

470519,comment,469880,469880,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"When I was young I was brought up without any conversation whatsoever on religion. I do remember returning home from school one day (Church of England, so we said the lords prayer at assembly) and I asked my mum, ""Mum, is dad in heaven?"" and she just looked at me and replied ""Don't be silly, he's at work."" That pretty much resolved my religious beliefs until I was around 14.<p>At 14 I slowly converted to Christianity and at about 15 I would probably have called myself an Anglican. This, however, went down hill <i>extremely</i> quickly. I remember my youth group got a talk from a parishioner who said we shouldn't listen to sinful music like 'Marilyn Manson' or other rock and roll. Me and a few friends went to our group leader after the guy left and said 'if you bring someone here preaching that bullshit again we're gone', I can't exactly remember how many weeks went past before I never went back.<p>After leaving, I quickly began realising that a lot of what I was being taught was complete BS, that they were trying to get me to question science. Well I'm a sci-fi writer, that shit doesn't stick with me. I quickly learnt that all the religious phenomena are merely a form of hypnosis.<p>Today I believe <i>nothing</i>. I am <i>not</i> an atheist, I see it as another bullshit religion just with a non-existent god at the top, because all I hear are people like Richard Dawkins preaching in the belief that there isn't a god... but any form of belief in the absence of evidence (the existence and thus non-existence of god is fundamentally unprovable) is <i>FAITH</i>, they have faith there isn't a god. I mean fundamentally Christians believe in the existence of a hypothetical entity, where as Atheists like Dawkins believe in the non-existence of a hypothetical entity. It's the opposite side of the same coin, where as what I believe most atheists really believe is that the 'coin' doesn't exist.",1233960754

Motivated by the observation that certain folds are associated with more natural sequences than others, the principle of fold designability (the number of unique sequences compatible with the backbone structure of the fold) was introduced (1). To place the problem on a mathematical foundation, an analogy has been drawn between sequence space and phase space in statistical physics, where the backbone structure represents a macroscopic state of the system and distinct sequences are microscopic states whose occupation of the macroscopic state is associated with an energy, the folding free energy of the protein. In this language, a fold's designability is correlated with its sequence entropy (2). \n""""""",1233960355
470510,comment,469880,470077,0,0,olavk,,,"I think it depends <i>which</i> God you ask if someone believe in.<p>For example, the Platonic idea of The Good is a pretty abstract philosophical concept which does not exist in the physical world - rather the physical world is some kind of shadow or reflection of this Good. You can't really prove or disprove the ""existence"" of this interpretation of reality, although some would say you can apply occams razor to it. Plato would argue that you cannot <i>not</i> belive in this, if you just consider the question reationally.<p>On the other hand, the biblical God Yahweh is a beeing with a physical shape and with intentions and emotions, which walk around in the physical world in historical times and interact with people (and killing them left and right!). The existence of this beeing could easily be proved if you meet him, but cannot strictly speaking be disproved as long as he remains in hiding. But the evidence can be weighed the same way we weigh evidence for the existence of mammuths or unicorns.<p>The christian notion of God has historically been kind of a mixture of these two ideas (and to a lesser degree many other).

He had a very sophisticated model for how the amino acid sequence determines the shape of the protein's active area. It was way over my head but he treated it as a solved problem.  You may find his papers interesting.<p>The combinatorial search results on protein folding are theoretically interesting, but I don't think that they are show stoppers for finding, or optimising the folded configuration of a protein.  As you mentioned, most of the degrees of freedom which lead to the exponential size of the search space are irrelevant.  A detailed understanding of the physics of how amino acids interact in water with ions can allow one to make approximations that vastly reduce the size of the search space.<p>Plus how much time does it take a protein to find it's native conformation? Let's say the folding time is 10 ms. I think ultrafast pump probe spectroscopy has shown that alpha helices and other secondary structural motifs form on the time scale of 100 ps.  Then the protein explores about 10^8 configurations before it finds the native one.",1233959461

I wrote a long comment in this thread, where I went off on a bit of a tangent on how the US should institute a moratorium on funding for graduate student training, but I deleted it, because it felt overly negative and conspiratorial.  You did a much better job of saying what I was trying to say, and backing it with numbers.  Bravo.<p>Suffice to say that I agree that we're training far too many scientists in this country, and that somehow, we need to find a way to wean Universities (and industry) off the government dole.  The problem is, after decades of subsidy for advanced research, the US is addicted to cheap intellectual labor in the form of under-employed graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.  If the government were to drastically cut funding for these ""training"" positions, the university system would collapse.<p>My opinion is that the only way out of this conundrum, is to force industry to re-invest in R&D over the long term.  That means no more licensing patents from university research programs that were developed using federal funding;  no more ""tech transfer"" that allows corporate research to be done on campus for slave wages; and a slow dial-down in agency funding for applied research at universities (as opposed to basic science).  Research and development has to be driven by market demand, if science is to be a stable career choice for intelligent students.",1233958502

Or things are humming along smoothly until you wake up one morning and you've been smart priced back to the stone age and aren't making anything per click anymore. The only guaranteed winner with AdSense is Google themselves. The reason AdSense is so successful is because Google takes an unspecified cut of every click and it's an industry built on the back of ringtone scams and click fraud.<p>Being beholden to a market that consists of a bunch of AdWords account managing hooligans that gnash and claw all day to drive bid prices down and are being governed by Google isn't really the kind of market you want to be counting on long term.
