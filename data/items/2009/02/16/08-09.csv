(Ron Paul wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve during his campaign for President. Imagine what life would be like now with no Federal Reserve to control interest rates; then put yourself in Krugman's shoes being talked down to by a random caller, after repeatedly calling attention to the housing crisis more than just about anyone else since 2006, and after winning a Nobel prize.) I'm pretty sure he wasn't rattled.",1234774734

You have conflated people <i>recognising</i> that people behave in ways that cause difficulty with <i>blaming</i> them for doing so.  Not helpful.<p>Separation of concerns is as useful in customer identification as it is in writing software.",1234774725

The problem was we either had to trek downstairs for plates or tear off pieces of the pizza box.  Needless to say we usually ended up tearing apart the box, so this would definitely have been a wonderful pizza box for us!<p>Hopefully delivery places start ordering these quickly!",1234774276
482822,comment,482311,482687,0,0,enqk,,,"French banks usually give a (small) credit line above which deposits must stay (interest-free). Below it you pay the full fledged interest rate + fee. The debit cards tend to debit your purchases at the end of the month too. So in the usual case, within the credit line, it is financed by fees rather than interests.<p>However credit cards do exist, even if they have been maligned for a long time in media:<p>Major credit card issuers in France are often linked to the retail sector (see <a href=""http://www.pass.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pass.fr</a>) .. others got consolidated into traditional banks (cetelem for example)<p>The traditionally French ""no permanent credit"" model for banks tend to raise fees and favour low deposits I guess.<p>In both cases anyway the banks pray on the poor / moderately poor people to ""dress them up"" with all sorts of products and credits they don't need. (And arguably, that society pays up after 30 years)",1234774215

482819,comment,482434,482434,0,0,patio11,,,"You could try selling downloadable software:<p>1)  People often do not balk at paying $5 for it.  Substantially more, usually.  (There are all sorts of business models but common wisdom among a forum of sellers I'm on is that $20 is about the lowest you'd want to ever sell software for.)<p>2)  You get to choose your customers.  You could choose, for example, people with a pressing problem who are willing to pay for a solution.  (I suppose you could do that on the iPhone too, but you'd have to deal with a distribution scheme which rewards mass above all other things.)<p>3)  Other people will make fantastically more money in software than you can ever dream of and it will <i>never hurt you in the slightest</i> because you do not compete with them for resources, attention, or customers.<p>4)  The sales curve generally goes up over time, as you get higher search engine rankings, learn how to market, update your product, and have growth from customers rebuying the product and recommending it to your friends.  This is a sharp contrast to the typical game or iPhone app sales curve, which one can simulate by plotting Wile E. Coyote in the seconds after which he steps into open air.",1234773840
482818,comment,471660,471660,0,0,amutap,,,"To assume an identity is a natural trait of every human. It has harmed us the most by far. I feel glad such an abstract topic is put in words by Paul. Thanks Paul.<p>I agree with Paul when he says we need to keep our identity small. Assuming an identity weather it be religious, national or any other, blocks our rational side from seeing things clearly. An identity levies upon the carries a sense of entitlement; it clots our mind with prejudice.<p>It is high time we stop doing this. And by keeping our identity small we lift the entitlement burden from our head. We no longer need to belong to a particular group, justify certain legacy thoughts that were forced upon us.<p>Many of the problems we face today are because of carrying identities which we assume by chance! The country where I belong, the language which I speak, the religion which I follow - every thing was enforced upon me by chance. Why should there be a resentment when one tries to shrug an identity.<p>It will only make our minds clear and we will be left with less burden to carry,",1234773640
482817,comment,482743,482743,0,0,ible,,,"The author spends much of the article quoting things which are relatively innocuous, then claiming they mean something far more extreme, and far more easy to attack, than the original. A rather disappointing bit of intellectual dishonesty for a 'distinguished professor'.<p>Academic inquiry is a public good as is the news, done by people as a job as do reporters, and academic freedom supports providing that good as does freedom of the press.<p>The press tend to get quite angry at attempts to control them, and those who go against the interests of their employers are lauded by their peers. I don't think arguing for academic freedom is any more elitist than arguing for freedom of the press.",1234773556

Anyone who thinks things like this that go down on social networking sites scares the politicians is so naive and silly. The lawmakers aren't going to listen until their threatened with the loss of a big special interest or something arises that could potentially generate a large enough stink in the media that the population doesn't vote for them anymore.<p>Blacking out profile pictures on Facebook will do basically nothing to help. They need to demonstrate that a lot of people are really pissed off about this. They need something like the Anonymous Anti-Scientology demonstrations, not just a bunch of people that lawmakers perceive as angsty hipsters blacking out their social networking profiles for one day.<p>I agree that this law seems horrendous, so hopefully someone with a little more experience gets in front of it and figures out a way to stop the thing before it takes effect.",1234773528

You can read it here: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200903/meltdown-geography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200903/meltdown-geography</a><p>That author argues the exact opposite.  The most interesting idea he talks about (IMO) is this:\n  Every phase or epoch of capitalism has its own distinct geography, or what economic geographers call the “spatial fix” for the era. The physical character of the economy—the way land is used, the location of homes and businesses, the physical infrastructure that ties everything together—shapes consumption, production, and innovation. As the economy grows and evolves, so too must the landscape.<p>He points to a less suburban future, where mega-regions dominate the geo-financial landscape.  Silicon Valley is right at the heart of one of those mega-regions.",1234772363
