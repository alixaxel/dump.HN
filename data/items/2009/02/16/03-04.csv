I was mining my bookmarks tonight to find links worth posting, and searched to see if one had been posted before. Search YC indicated it had not been, so I posted it, only to discover to my chagrin that someone else had just submitted it just before I did. (My submission is now deleted, to avoid duplication.) I try to search before I submit, so accurate and timely search is helpful.",1234756716

I can envision a majority accepted standard, such as paypal is for regular transactions, then a user can deposit, say, $5.00 and apply it to his favorite sites via a subscription to their content.<p>This payment gateway could be an interesting start-up.  Like the paypal button, a site could have a subscribe button on their site which automatically adds the content to the users subscription list/ completes the sale.<p>Then you could have a browser plug-in or stand alone app that aggregates and categorizes the content for the subscriber.  This may result in a traffic decrease, but when ad-support doesn't matter, neither does hits.  It would then be quantified by total subscribers.<p>Stop me if its been done already...",1234756646

I just did a Search YC search to see if this link had been posted to HN before, saw that it didn't turn up in that search, and then submitted, only to see that you posted just a while before I did. (The slightly different form of the URL you submitted kept the HN software from detecting my duplicate submission.) I've just deleted my submission to invite other readers to comment on this thread.

482646,comment,482257,482354,0,0,megaduck,,,"< I have to wonder why that, culturally, seems to be linked to Asians?<p>I can't speak for other Asian countries, but I know China.  From what you wrote, your experience and the experience of Zhang Rui (the high school student) couldn't be more different.  I've recently had the wonderful and depressing experience of teaching in rural Chinese high schools, and it was an eye-opening experience.  The pressure and stress on those kids is simply astounding.<p>Unfortunately for Zhang Rui, there is probably no more important single event in his life than taking the University Entrance Examination (高考, or GaoKao).  There are really only two life paths before him, depending on his score.<p>If Zhang Rui gets a decently high score, then he can attend a large university in a city like Beijing or Shanghai.  He will receive an urban residence permit, and a small stipend that he can use to live as a student.  He'll receive a degree without much difficulty, and he should be able to get a good job.  He can become a professional, he can go into government, he can become a writer, he's got a lot of options.<p>If Zhang Rui gets a low score, then he has few or no options.  He lives in a remarkably poor region, even by Chinese standards, and his father is probably a peasant farmer (or something close).  He's probably also got a rural registration, so he'll never be legally allowed to leave his village.  He can either follow in his father's impoverished footsteps or become an undocumented migrant worker, sweating in a factory or hand-mixing concrete on a construction site.<p>Those are the choices.  Zhang Rui might be able to skip university and still lead a full and interesting life, but the odds are hugely against it.  He'll have to fight the system until the day he dies.<p>This is the harsh reality that Zhang Rui is facing, and it helps to put everything into context.  His father and teachers know all these things, and so it's likely they've boiled it down to a cold binary decision:  either little Zhang gets into university and brings the family out of poverty, or he's another worthless peasant stuck in Anhui. The only thing that matters is the score on the GaoKao.  It's horrible, but not uncommon.<p>I sincerely hope that Zhang Rui overcomes the system without losing his soul (or his life).  He sounds creative, strong, and insightful.  China could use more voices like his.",1234755878

No Child Left Behind has made that common practice.<p>The proficiencies are more than anything designed to test the quality of a given school's education and measure their progress. School districts' federal (and often state) funding and various other things are determined by their results on those tests.<p>My statement was that there isn't really a better metric.

It's interesting to see who the first people to tweet about something that becomes popular are.<p>The downside about Twitturly is that nearly every tweet is the same:  the title of the URL.  There's less and less relevant information about URLs each time to I check it.<p>It's a neat idea, but I don't think people are too hot for social media stuff anymore, in terms of acquiring.  There are hundreds of ways to get quality URLs, and as far as I know, nobody has really proven it's <i>profitable</i> to provide those URLs.  Albeit, sites have been acquired (Reddit, Delicious) around the principle, but I think those days are gone.<p>I would love to be corrected though...<p>Where did you hear about the author putting it up for sale?",1234754650
482638,comment,482038,482627,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"The law handles ambiguity all the time. See Judge Learned Hand's negligence rule for example. He famously stated that a defendant is negligent (say, a shop owner whose customer slipped on some ice on his steps) if the cost of taking precautions is less than the product of the magnitude of the likely damage and the probability that such damage will occur. In our example of the shop owner, spreading salt on one's steps is very cheap and the expected magnitude of damages is a bit larger, so a shop owner must keep his steps free from ice.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_negligence</a><p>This is an ambiguous standard, but it gives the judge a guideline to make his ruling.<p>Similarly in criminal cases, intent must be present for criminal act to have occurred.

[...]<p>None of our men are ""experts."" We have most unfortunately found it necessary to get rid of a man as soon as he thinks himself an expert--because no one ever considers himself expert if he really knows his job. A man who knows a job sees so much more to be done than he has done, that he is always pressing forward and never gives up an instant\nof thought to how good and how efficient he is. Thinking always ahead, thinking always of trying to do more, brings a state of mind in which nothing is impossible. The moment one gets into the ""expert"" state of mind a great number of things become impossible. [...]<p>As I have said, we do not hire experts--neither do we hire men on past experiences or for any position other than the lowest. [...]<p>It is particularly easy for any man who never knows it all to go forward to a higher position with us. [...]<p>There is not a single man anywhere in the factory who did not simply come in off the street. [...]<p>there is the pressing to take away the necessity for skill in any job done by any one. The old-time tool hardener was an expert. He had to judge the heating temperatures. It was a hit-or-miss operation. The wonder is that he hit so often. The heat treatment in the hardening of steel is highly important--providing one knows exactly the right heat\nto apply. That cannot be known by rule-of-thumb. It has to be measured. We introduced a system by which the man at the furnace has nothing at all to do with the heat. He does not see the pyrometer--the instrument which registers the temperature. Coloured electric lights give him his signals. [...]<p>The length of time required to become proficient in the various occupations is about as follows: 43 per cent. of all the jobs require not over one day of training; 36 per cent. require from one day to one week; 6 per cent. require from one to two weeks; 14 per cent. require from one month to one year; one per cent. require from one to six years. The last jobs require great skill--as in tool making and die sinking.</i>",1234753960

482627,comment,482038,482566,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>Using your logic, should we also restrict websites that track campaign donations, just becuase the campaigners find it painful to their process?</i><p>I think you are misrepresenting the logic. The difference here is the difference between a common sense argument & an argument that contains clearly distinguishable definitions. The latter is the kind needed (usually) for legal matters. But a lot of the time we are just trying to find a legally acceptable definition for the common sense argument. 'Illegal if it's mostly for illegal stuff,' is not the kind of law courts would be comfortable with. But I would argue that the issue is with defining an abstract principle. Sometimes these issues are resolved with linguistically.<p>The Pirate Bay's Raison D'Etre is pretty much to do with illegal content. The existence of some legal reasons is a fringe issue. (You might dispute this. In that case, the argument is over this point.) Imagine your unlocked bike list. Or how about a children home alone list. Defining this in an airtight manner that would satisfy the common sense is almost impossible. Specifically defining 'mostly' (as in mostly illegal content) would create a situation where there is a threshold to be met. This shelter could be used as a shield against prosecution. Defining it in terms (eg <i>intent</i>) would create different problems.<p>But these are problems <i>always</i> present in legislation. That doesn't mean you give up on laws. I think that most proponents of Pirate Bay (regardless how clever the arguments) are in the medical marijuana camp. They aren't themselves convinced that Pirate Bay should be there because of possible legal uses. They are themselves convinced by believing that content should be free or that IP laws should be changed or that Government shouldn't take on itself the role of policing this realm.",1234753508
