Normally, I love the idea of private companies funding research, but Microsoft has a habit of not using its research for anything commercial. Instead, they file for thousands of patents and just sit on them.<p>I feel the same way about Google - by spending their vast profits on hiring more smart people than they need (instead of say, giving a dividend out to shareholders), they do a disservice to the entire industry. Smart engineers and researchers are relatively rare, and shouldn't be sitting in some research building writing up papers that will never produce a dollar - that's what Universities are for. Instead, they should be out there starting companies and heading the engineering teams at small to medium companies.<p>It's almost tragic to the tech industry that Microsoft and Google are so profitable.",1234323483

So the car has to provide energy to raise the car 9cm for every meter traveled.  That's 1.5m/s vertically.  So for an average car of 2000kg, we have to provide 2000x9.8x1.5 J per second, which is ~29KW.  (That's gravitational potential energy mass x grav. x h)<p>Wow, so maybe it's right.

Still... maybe we already have micropayments, but they aren't evenly distributed yet.<p>The current generation of gaming consoles does something close to micropayments and scrip at the same time, through their online shopping points. They solve the transaction cost problem by making you buy $20 worth of points at a time (I bought 15 Nintendo points for World of Goo, and then blew the change on an impulse buy - a copy of Opera). Points also solve the resistance problem, by having a captive audience of users who want what they offer.<p>The next step might be to allow game review sites to accept Nintendo/Sony/XBox points for access to content, demos, trailers, etc. At the same time, that would tie them more closely to the console manufacturers. More mainstream channels could follow as they see fit.",1234322809
