If you could get rid of these barriers...<p>I think if someone could provide a browser-based all-in-one solution with language+IDE+hosting+tutorials, then that would fulfill most of his criteria.  You could type a few lines, instantly view the page and then send a link to your friends (who can view it at any time).",1234346334

The biggest problem is defining the scope which is almost impossible to do in any detail at the beginning of a project.<p>Instead, I'd recommend either fixed price for small, bite sized tasks, or (as per my current contract) a weekly rate until completion. I work on rapid turn-around, so the client almost always knows exactly where the project's at and how it fits with their requirements. Of course a precondition of this is a decent level of trust on both sides, and a client who's not a pain.",1234346331

Unfortunately, I had to use some of my existing programming experience to save me when I experimented a bit. For example, I decided I liked 'cheese' better than 'honeydew'. That put me in a state where I needed to guess what the tutorial was monitoring for and had to replace cheese to move forward. Additionally, there was times where I experimented and it advanced a page with no way for me to go back. With some polish, this could be a very promising educational tool!",1234346296

If someone won't buy a domain with an existing TLD for their personal info why would they pay a premium rate for this?  It's like the white pages asking you to pay a premium to be listed in their book.<p>You also have the chicken/egg issue.

(In relation to the time it took him to complete the project.)<p>2) The developer over-works due to under-bidding.<p>Neither is particularly advantageous for the client, as a developer will not be as responsive to a client's needs if he or she is working towards a minimum feature set.<p>A developer can make a reasonable estimate based on clear goals. If requirements change (as they inevitably do) the developer will be compensated accordingly. Similarly, if the project is finished in less time than expected, the client will reap the benefits.",1234346024

But lets say the error rate is so low that just 0.1% of automated releases go wrong.  Rolling out 50 times a day means you'll expose an error every 20 days.

476794,comment,475082,475082,0,0,ggruschow,,,"<p><pre><code>  There is no simpler way to allow open ended integration with arbitrary web services.\n</code></pre>\nProviding an email address is simpler, and it's already provided to these specs by a zillion times more web services. Email also provides for better reliability (receive a message sent even when your service is unreachable) and queueing.. all outside of the code and often infrastructure you'd need to do yourself.<p>The main reason it may be worse are that we've got a ton of programmers, frameworks, and virtual hosts that seem to live in a limited little world called ""the web."" (Sorry - personal rant - this mindset is annoying for me when trying to hire programmers these days. It's even annoying when I talk to somebody about a new business involving a lot of programming, and they assume it's a website.)<p>Sure, spam is also an issue, but that only reinforces my point. Spam is an issue because email is in common use.. it's not for arbitrary HTTP POST because it isn't. If it ever is in common use, spammers would have no trouble using that too. They're doing plenty of arbitrary HTTP POSTs to web comment systems including cracking some CAPTCHAs in the process.<p>If he changed his stance to saying there'll be an arbitrary body provided at setup time, or given no body, it'd HTTP GET it, perhaps allowing some keyword substitution for a few standard things like the address that changed.. That'd be something different. You really wouldn't have to write or deploy any ""code"" for many integrations - for the sender or receiver. You could instead just provide the appropriate info to call an existing web service with its existing parameters.<p>On the other side, the email address callback also allows you to contact humans more easily, and if you did the same arbitrary response with keyword substitution thing.. You could make websites do form letters for you. I'm not sure that's a good thing or not.",1234344024

Would I have done so if there hadn't been a BASIC manual on my shelf and an interpreter baked into the system? Dubious. I then learned Pascal once I got my first PC, because Turbo Pascal had been included by the previous owner. The first compiler I had to fight for was Turbo C (had to convince my mom to ask one of her colleagues for a copy). But by then, I'd been programming for over 3 years.",1234343886

476786,comment,474919,476589,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"OO doesn't match the way I think anyway. OO makes it appear as if all objects can do something, e.g. window.open(), list.add(item). In the real world some objects are passive, some objects are active and conscious and some complex objects have behaviour but don't respond to simple instructions (e.g the economy).<p>I believe this is a very fundamental feature of how we think about the world and it's totally unlike OO. But I also think that it doesn't matter at all. Formal systems don't need to resemble language or the way we think about the world (or the way we think we think about the world)<p>We don't naturally think like Snoopy swearing, but regular expressions are still a very productive tool for someone who has learned to think differently than he would naturally do. The same goes for maths and many other tools.<p>I'm very skeptical about OO, but that's not because it doesn't match the way I think. I'm skeptical because OO APIs force me to know things I don't want to know. They constantly make me think about which class has a particular function.<p>But the rationale for putting a function in one class or another is based on implementation considerations that are of no concern to me as a user of an API. It's mostly about which object's state is affected most, how dependencies are managed, what types of changes are expected, and so on.<p>I've given this example elsewhere but here's the short version again: Say you want to initiate the sale of a property via some API. There are many objects involved: A buyer, a seller, a contract, an estate agent and a property. Which of the five classes involved contains the method you're looking for?<p>It could be in any of these classes and I don't want to think about it. I want a sell(property, buyer, seller, contract, agent) function and the API should figure out its own state and dependency matters.",1234343684
476785,comment,475958,476364,0,0,sho,,,"This is a good point. Rails has a pretty ad hoc way of dealing with static pages - throwing them in /public mixed up with everything else. Cached pages get thrown in there too, and sweepers need to be able to delete them. I don't like the mess of permissions that arrangement necessitates so generally redo it.<p>Rails is also by nature a one-app pony - many web pages have more than one app that could reasonably be called ""discrete"" except they share users. Setting up something like that in Rails is messy no matter how you go about it. Further evidence would include the ""REST everywhere"" approach, which is wonderful if you're focussed on a full blown machine-accessible web app but a waste of time for something simpler.<p>I'm not exactly a Django expert either but I've heard that ones runs into limitations there quickly too - as you'd expect, no free lunches!<p>To sum up, both frameworks are good for what they are: a starting point. Any large project is going to find itself doing a lot of custom work anyway. So pick the language you like best, basically. For me that's Ruby but I have nothing against Python that goes much beyond the level of ""I don't like the way it looks"".",1234343565
