Anyway, my point in a nutshell was that making energy analytics available to all might not help that much. After all, having information about how much energy we're using is not the same as being arsed enough to change our usage patterns, but the effort of gathering the additional information will definitely consume more energy. It may be a negligible amount for one person or even a household, but multiply that by all the people on the energy grid and I bet you'll have a significant number, no matter how sophisticated the technology.<p>I guess the question of whether such a project is ultimately worth the trouble comes down to the amount of energy that will be saved by the people (which my cynical nature inclines me to think will be a small minority of the total population) who care enough to actually alter their usage patterns for it versus the amount of total energy consumed by the project. Then again, the people who care, like yourself, are probably already careful about the amount of energy they consume, so my guess, though I hope I'm wrong, is that the nett effect of the project will be to increase overall power consumption.",1234331761

Evolution begins from the first cell, and goes forward from there. The study of how that first cell formed is called Abiogenesis.<p><i>""Let's review science first -- evidence in science is only authoritative when you can (without fail) repeat an empirical process X and come up with the end result Y (the evidence).""</i><p>Predictions made by science can speculate on the outcomes of a particular experiment <i>or</i> on the ability of a hypothesis to explain past outcomes. Without the second half of this statement you can discard all mathematical models, including the science of the big bang, star formation, weather/climate prediction, and nearly all of social science.<p><i>""Brilliantly rational science we have there.""</i><p>Science, when done well, does nothing of the sort. What you have described is poor science, and there is poor science much the same as there is poor coding.

Everyone from Target to Citi issues notes in the money markets.<p>And yes, the banks are required to have more assets than liabilities.  But that has nothing to do with the money markets or day to day operations.<p>Here's a crappy, but workable analogy.  What do you do in a modern computer?  Have enough money for all the programs that are running, up front?  Or do you have some shared virtual pool of memory?<p>The money market is kind of like that.  It's silly for each and every corporation to have all the cash on hand it needs for day to day operations.  That would require a lot of money that would be sitting around doing nothing.  A much more efficient system is to have lenders who dole out short term loans (that pay darn little but are almost guaranteed to pay back) to the corporations as they need them.<p>Suppose that January is just a nasty month, and Target has to dole out lots of money to its health insurance benefits.  That's fine, they'll just issue more commercial paper, and it will all work out when they tally up the bills at the end of the quarter.<p>Without that money market, what would happen instead is that Target would either have to keep a lot more money lying around, or run into a brick wall if something bad happened.

(Yes, I'm assuming this is not a legal advice and you're unlikely professional accountants here. ;)  But real world experience is what values.)<p>We're forming a new S-corp.  I'm planning to do this in Delaware.  However, both me and my partner are located in California.  We'll do consulting and few Internet ventures under it, however, during the first days (months), the most income will come as consulting for other California company.<p>I heard that California  state requires everyone who do business in CA to have a special entity of company BOTH in CA and state, where you're originally incorporated in. (This is not an actual quote, but something that I heard.  I might be wrong.)<p>Do you have any better knowledge about this?  I'd really appreciate your help.<p>On the other note, I'm also planning to run the company myself, including accounting.  I'm pretty much okay with Quickbooks or whatever is needed to keep the books.  However, my knowledge is pretty limited on taxation issues.  So I'd also be very thankful on ideas of outsourced accountants and the typical cost of such service.  References would be great.<p>Thanks.",1234328479
