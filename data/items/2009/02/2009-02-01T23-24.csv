But of course I have no idea how interested I would be in business because I have no experience at all with startups.<p>So basically I have had this idea in the back of my mind to start a small side business, something comparable to the ideas on this website: http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/8-stupid-frat-boy-business-ideas (I actually have briefly thought about t-shirts). If I would do a startup or business project, I would want it to be something I could treat as a side project, and have a low initial investment.<p>Reading about entrepreneurs it seems like most of them have a significant number of failures before they have a successful startup.I am also right now very risk-averse since I would have no knowledge of what I'm doing. So while I would have the goal of making money, it would probably be more of a secondary benefit. My primary goal would be getting experience dealing with suppliers, customers, marketing, and those sorts of things. It would also give me some idea of how comfortable I am with failure, since that would probably be the outcome for my first business project/startup.<p>So would this type of thing be a good way for me to get some experience and business knowledge? Or would it be better to choose something that required a co-founder, more time, and money?",1233531282

Because there are parts of our product that really suck. And we know it.<p>Here's a reverse case study: 37Signals was a lot more reasonable 5 years ago.

Reality is good.<p>Cut forward 4 years, they launch Highrise, a product that was so ""less"" that it was practically ""nothing"" and not usable for anyone. It didn't have any features people required to actually manage their customer relationships.
