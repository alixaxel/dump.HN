The only place I hear those kinds of conversations are here, on the web.  I have a fairly limited dialog with people on these subjects, really the market and my partner are the major sources of input for ideas and where to go in the future.<p>I'd love to be in SV, to be a part of it, but I'm not willing to trade what I and my family have for the benefits to found there.  How can anyone afford to live there also,  is beyond me.<p>Anyway - i'm rambling.  I guess I should start to take my online identity more seriously.  I should post in my profile what my company is and does.  I should try and connect with people I meet on here.

I guess its the same as in the physical world, but there you have cues, and police, and safety.<p>pg - any way to add some kind of reputational system to hacker news?  Or maybe thats a good startup idea.<p>You could put in anyone's username, and any site, and rate them on a series of categories - whatever.  It can be as simple as 'friend' like facebook.  But it would be a kind of metadata for these relationships.  I could see if someone who is a friend of mine on here likes them, trusts them, etc.  Though making all of that explicit might be too much.  Human social interaction allows for alot of subtlety - you can say alot without saying anything.

Even though Gödel had shown that the ultimate goal of the formalist program is unattainable, they still mostly won that debate by being able to produce more meaningful results. The radical intuitionist, with whom the author seems to sympathize, did not only reject the axiom of choice, but even things like the law of the excluded middle (i.E. they assumed that ""A or not A"" is not necessarily true). That makes many proofs considerably harder to perform, if not totally impossible.<p>Not surprisingly, the formalist program was  also more fruitful for endeavours like computational logic and the theory of computation, which resonate with the formalist tenet that mathematics is just the manipulation of strings of abstract symbols according to specific rules.<p>This <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer-Hilbert_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer-Hilbert_controversy</a> gives some of the context.",1234909149

Now I reload my RSS reader and find this!<p>Life is strange sometimes...<p>What I started wondering about is if there's a chance of achieving better compression results if the compressor and decompressor could communicate about the compression before it happened. For example, (ignoring CPU constraints) what if when I was downloading a large file over the web, the web server and the browser conspired together to achieve a higher rate of compression customized just for me by using some kind of shared knowledge (like a history of what was recently downloaded or whatever) to achieve a transfer of less data? (Like, if I had a bunch of files on my client that the server also has, could it use small chunks of those known files and index their location in the new file to be transfered - thus saving me download time?)<p>Obviously this is not a fully formed thought... but I think it might be worth considering that compression need not always be bound by the type of data, but also by the receiver of that data and the intention and method of that data's transmission.",1234908875
