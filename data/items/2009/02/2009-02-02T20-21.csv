There's easy-to-setup and use technology in pretty much all mail servers to check for and prevent that.<p>(I'd find it super neat however, if there were a program that took all of the president's emails and inserted extra random spaces/punctuation/etc. so that if there WERE leaks, they'd be identifiable.)",1233608361

I imagine that you could end up with lots of functional-illiteracy type issues where students would only be able to do a task in the tightly controlled circumstances that they have been trained on but have difficulty generalizing.",1233605323

If EC2 goes away... bring up your own Linux, Windows, or OpenSolaris instances, and run your apps there.<p>Granted, that's not true of S3, SQS, or SDB... but seriously, how hard is it to program against an abstraction layer? Easy enough to rewrite your own ""store_photo"" function to use a replacement for S3.",1233605316

If I had been able to bail out and go join my friends in the class taught by the easy teacher I would have, but I certainly would not have learned anything.<p>In fact, now that I think about it, I think such a system would probably encourage a trend toward treating schooling as a sort of nationalized childcare program, as the money and rewards would go to teachers (and schools) where students are allowed to float through. You can argue all you want about how much <i>you</i> enjoy learning, but I imagine that the vast majority of the people in my high school could have cared less. (There are similar arguments for why private schools do better than public schools: private schools are primarily composed of the kids/families that actually care about what said student is learning.)",1233605130
