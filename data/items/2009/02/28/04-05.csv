While there are plenty of college drop out entrepreneurs that are very successful (e.g. Bill Gates), there are also a lot of successful entrepreneurs that are college graduates.  An MBA is more debatable.",1235797114

497991,comment,497951,497951,0,0,s_baar,,,"I'm suspicious of the claim that there can be more than one silicon valley. With founders being more mobile and VC in... shrinkage (less willing to take risks setting up in new markets), the likelihood of any such concerted effort being possible is nil. After all, you're not going to get anyone outside the organizers to move from the valley in significant numbers, so I think the prospects for natural growth is limited.<p>I suppose what you say is true, but I don't see any reason to think such a transplant would ever outstrip the size/clout of the valley. And that's what it comes down to, is that with the big players already entrenched, and the weather so nice, no city will come close, even if the transplants do prove a boon.",1235796468

Sure, you could get a hundred or so new grads from your university every year, but how many hackers migrate to the bay every year? What's the turnover rate?<p>If you have a million in funding, you're probably going to want to hire some people to help you (you have enough money to shoot for the stars; moreover, ramen profitability seems both a waste and unable to recoup the investor's money). Hiring good people outside of SV, especially if you want to use interesting (read not java / ms) tools, is going to be a bit more of a challenge.

497987,comment,496754,496872,0,0,strlen,,,"There's a different way to put it also:<p>A start-up usually takes at least four, on the average seven years until a ""liquidity event"" occurs (Some stay private forever and while profitable, don't offer any opportunity to just hand the business off without losing everything).<p>Thus, if someone is willing to try building a start-up (potentially, a four year commitment) why not try a college education provided they have the means?<p>Lastly, college education has rewards in it of itself: not just the employment/entrepreneurship opportunities it may open. There aren't very many jobs/many feasible/executable start-up ideas out there where you'll get to write operating systems, compilers, design RISC chips and code in Haskell and Scheme (I did/could do all of the following, despite going to a school that wasn't, by any means, a top research center for EE/CS). Add to that being able to attend lectures and write papers/essays on topics in such as Ancient Greek History.<p>The last paragraph sounds like something I'd like to do if/when I have a ""liquidity event"". On a personal note, had I not been exposed to these topics, I may have found routine software engineering work to be the most exciting task I could put my mind to (as I did, when I briefly worked full time during and after high school) -- and would see no reason for entrepreneurship.",1235796123

497985,comment,497921,497921,0,0,jrockway,,,"Not quite.  If you're a seasoned Emacs (or presumably Vim) user, you will know it's not Emacs or Vim within about five minutes.  It is nicer than vi or mg, though, and it starts up really fast.<p>Yi does provide great facilities for implementing these features, however.  Syntax highlighting is done by proper incremental parsing instead of flaky regexps.  Emacs has tried this, but honestly, Emacs Lisp runs way too slowly for this to work.  Yi seems to handle pretty big files with good performance, which is very nice to see.  Hopefully ""extensible"" major modes are finally nearby.  (If you've ever read cperl-mode.el, you'll see why regexps are a bad choice for implementing syntax highlighting.)<p>Although it is not my current editor of choice, I think Yi is a better ""way forward"" than continuing to let the C-based GNU Emacs platform live on.  Emacs' great strength is the hundreds of thousands of lines of Lisp code it bundles.  Emacs' weakness is that it wants to support that code forever, even though it makes modern features like concurrency impossible to implement.  My plan is to add compartments to Yi that will emulate Emacs and run Emacs Lisp code.  This will let you edit with simple.el's editing features, or check your mail in Gnus... without having the ""real"" Emacs around.  Then, when you want more modern features, you can start porting the legacy Emacs Lisp code to run on Yi directly.  This is better than the usual ""let's reimplement emacs"" plan of ""let's throw away everything!"".  (This is why you are currently using GNU Emacs or XEmacs and not SXEmacs or the one written in CL.  It's too hard to rewrite everything all at once.)",1235795710

497983,comment,497951,497951,0,0,sgman,,,"The question is: is there something in silicon valley that makes startups more successful here? If there is, then the companies you fund will be working against competitors that have a significant advantage over them. I don't think a sample size of 30 is large enough to answer this question one way or the other. Therefore, while the initial prototype requires minimum investment, it likely will not give you the information you need to decide whether to continue with the program or not.",1235795527

If a city offered these companies a million dollars each to move, a lot of the earlier stage ones would probably take it.</i><p>This seems like a highly effective way to kill startups.  Never mind the whole ""moving to a different city where you won't have many contacts"" bit -- if a startup is still small enough to be able to move easily, throwing a million dollars at them is likely to give them too much of a runway.",1235795120

I've been wary of other books on evolution, even though the subject fascinates me, because I worry that they will be either repeating the same information (even the evolution bits of HTMW seemed repetitive since I read it immediately after TSG), or worse, dissecting creationist arguments. Dennett's book looks like it might be a good complement to TSG though, so I'll check it out.<p>The Language Instinct is on my list too now. Thanks.",1235793674
