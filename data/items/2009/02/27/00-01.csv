I had a lot of fun in my year at HP Labs.<p>-- Software product development often has smart people and you can have flexibility in what you do.  The key is whether you are working with a dozen or two of people or a cast of thousands where you are a pigeon in a hole.  The larger the group, the more likely you are a plugin module, stuck in a role, susceptible to offshoring.<p>-- IT is probably the pits and should be avoided.<p>If you are looking at a raw startup, you really need to understand the environment.  Sure, you get to do lots of things and have a lot of flexibility, but there is a good chance that you will have to work 60 hour weeks.  If you aren't prepared for high energy and high commitment, it can take a toll on you and your family.  If you are, it can be a hell of a ride.  Also take into account of the funding/financial side of the startup or you may find no food on the table.  One thing is do NOT go in with the expectation of getting rich, particularly if you are not a founder.  Most of the time you won't.  Dont take this as a negative, I think startups are more fun than nearly anything else.<p>Another class to consider is a small fast growing company of 20 to 200 people.  It's a lot like a startup, but you can have a life too.",1235695973

496665,comment,496475,496608,0,0,anamax,,,"> California planners don't seem to like multi-use zones, so strip malls and sprawling apartment complexes pop up all over. I want to live in an apartment in a livable, diverse community on the same street as stores and restaurants, but this is extremely rare outside of places like San Francisco.<p>Actually, it's Californians who generally dislike ""diverse"" communities.<p>That said, they're not that rare.  They exist in all of the bigger cities, SF, Oakland, Berkeley, Sacramento, plus places in the LA basin.  (I don't know about the inland empire.)  Heck, it's even possible to find them in almost every ""college town"".  Almost every small town is ""diverse"".<p>In short, your real complaint is with places like Santa Rosa.  Move.<p>> my biggest problems with California are prop 13<p>Prop 13 is the only reason that CA cities and counties aren't having to choose between a 20% drop in revenues or a 25% increase in property tax rates this year.<p>About half of the homeowners and the vast majority of the commercial property owners are going to see a 2% increase in their property taxes this year.  Meanwhile, folks who bought recently may see a modest decrease in their property taxes.<p>As a result, CA's property tax revenues are going to be fairly stable.<p>Prop 13 is a cap on property tax rates and a limit on the increase in ""value for the purposes of taxation"" wrt a given owner of a given property.  When property changes hands, the value for taxation goes to the sales price, but as long as it doesn't, the rate of increase is capped, which is why many owners (especially commercial) will see a modest property tax increase even though their property lost value in 2008 - the property tax is catching up slowly.<p>Remember that ""cap on property tax rates"" that I mentioned above.  Almost every CA city and county is at that cap.  Do you really want to argue that they would have dropped the rates to keep revenues stable during the years when property values were exploding?  (Prop 13 was enacted during a previous boom when they didn't drop rates....)",1235695226

There are so many benefits, and as long as you have a little self-control, pretty much no downside.<p>I disagree. This is great advice for the majority of people. Not everyone, but the majority.<p>Do credit cards offer benefits? Yes--convenience, expense tracking, protection against theft, etc.<p>Are these benefits free? No. People spend a lot more using credit cards than cash. Maybe not you, but most Americans. I don't care enough about this to look up the stats, but I do have a PHD psychologist friend on the payroll of one of the major credit companies and his job is to contrive ways to make people spend more on their cards.<p>Think about it like this: your cash is dumb--it justs sits there in your pocket. Your credit card is smart, however. A whole cadre of smart people--who are incentived to get you to spend more and pay late--are tracking how you spend money and are cooking up ways to get you to spend more and pay fees.<p>I know the empirical numbers would help my case more, maybe I'll dig them up and write a blog post about it.",1235694622
496657,comment,496475,496475,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Living in California is really wonderful for the most part - but the state income tax is a killer. I'd love to move back to Cali, but it would involve a higher cost of living (not a big deal) and about a 10% pay cut (due to state income tax, and a big deal). I work remotely, so when deciding where to live next I have to think through:<p>""Ok, I'd looove to live in the Bay Area, but if I lived in Seattle where there's <i>no</i> income tax, I could have an extra X bucks per month.""<p>Where X is 9.3% of your salary:<p>60K => $465/mo<p>80K => $620/mo<p>100K => $775/mo<p>120K => $930/mo<p>So the question becomes, is it worth the X bucks a month to live in Cali? Sometimes it is, sometimes it's not. I use Seattle as an arbitrary example of course - but it could be any of the no income tax states. Of course, many folks don't have the option at all - but more and more people will be able to choose in the future.<p>I don't know much about how state governments work - but it's interesting to see how some states can have no income tax and still be better off financially than high income tax states like Cali. Sometimes I hear the argument that it's because the no income tax states have <i>much</i> higher sales taxes. However, the sales tax in Cali vs Washington or Texas seems about the same (around 8%). Perhaps there's a big difference in property taxes - I'm not a homeowner so I don't know or really care about that. A lot of it does seem to come down to how well the state is run when you look at it as a business instead of a 'state'.<p>As an aside, if you live in a no income tax state and want to avoid sales taxes where possible - Amazon Prime is your friend ;)",1235694613

496648,comment,496079,496424,0,0,micahphone,,,"Agreed! Selling downloads is a very short-term business model. iTunes and Amazon know it won't last forever and are just making what money they can while waiting for streaming everywhere to become commonplace. I'd say we're about three years away in terms of mobile phone technology before streaming becomes the dominant business model. Early adopters right now are using Spotify, Pandora, Slacker Radio, etc. and not looking back. When all music is streaming artists will be paid royalties funded by either subscription or advertising.

496647,comment,496581,496581,0,0,triplefox,,,"If you're talking about more than trivial applications(examples: computational geometry, statistics, parsing and saving common formats) libraries become important as a means of offloading effort. They can be abused, for sure, and by being overly general purpose they can often cause no end of trouble, but using a few good libraries appropriate to the domain may result in 1000x less time to get productive results, even if the language sucks. So you've just gotta have libraries. The problem a lot of new languages face is that they aren't different enough to necessitate building out a new set of libraries. Bindings to C are an ugly 80% solution, good enough for most cases, and they have the nasty result of making C even more all-consuming as the source of all library code.<p>haXe and Factor are both good examples of languages that have a basis with which to grow their libraries. haXe is getting uptake from a variety of angles but the emphasis is clear the everyone involved wants to minimize the costs of multiple-language incompatibilities, and that is resulting in powerful libraries across multiple domains. I don't know the details of Factor's growth, but I suspect that it is doing so on its strengths as a ""next-gen"" concatenation language in a field with little comparable competitors. Both languages have C bindings available, but haXe in particular has strong reasons to create native libraries.",1235693703
