The key things for me were:<p>Giving up alcohol for two months\nNot eating much at all\nDoing the fitness regime to boost metabolic rate<p>By the time I stopped I was on level 45 of the ladder, had never felt fitter in my life and wasn't ripped per se but was certainly toned.<p>Since then my weight has gone back up largely due to work and old habits coming back - I've taken up cycling which is definitely having a positive effect, but I'm not sure it'll be as effective without consideration to other areas (crap food, booze etc.)",1235732302

497096,comment,496946,496946,0,0,paul,,,"Another interesting detail is that this is roughly the 4th iteration on the FriendFeed backend since we launched 17 months ago. If you look at the the graphs at the bottom of Bret's post, you can see that our previous system was about to die -- average pageview latency had increased from about 135ms to 260ms in less than a month! (not a good trend) This new design also accommodates some important upcoming features that would have been problematic in the old system.<p>This experience reinforces my belief that it's better to be quick than brilliant. If we had wasted a lot of time trying to build some really smart, super-scalable system right from the start, it would have inevitably been over-optimized for the wrong things, since the product and requirements have changed quite a bit since launch. By continually rebuilding the system, it stays relatively simple and close to our actual needs (plus it incorporates everything we learned from the previous iterations).",1235731733

497094,comment,496285,496686,0,0,StrawberryFrog,,,"Exactly. technical debt is a great tool for explaining to non-technical management why you'd want to invent time in refactoring, reviews etc that have no obvious tangible result in the finished product (short version: it's a drag factor makes it harder to add features and keep the bug count down later).<p>It's also a good tool to allow the management to do what management does best: take the technical information and make management/financial decisions based on it, on how much investment can be made <i>now</i>.<p>It turns a binary either/or choice: devs saying ""Our code is bad, we need to rewrite"" into a quantitative one: ""How much technical debt do we have? Is it increasing? Can we reduce it?"".",1235731457
497093,comment,496995,496995,0,0,vladimir,,,"I think it would be better to take advantage of JavaScript's flexibility instead of trying to make Java on steroids of this language. People began to use dynamic types to speed up development and make it more flexible.\nBut I agree that sometimes we have to check variable types in JS, so this library can help. But for me these cases are rare.",1235731354
497092,comment,496675,497018,0,0,herge,,,"Maybe that works for you, but most of us in the <i>real</i> world have been trying that for years, and with little result. You cannot manage what you cannot measure. A simple, easy to understand, but certainly cumbersome at times system like the hacker diet works well.<p>Also, you'll stick to your diet longer by eating smaller portions of the food you like than by eating large quantities of food you hate (I'm looking at you, salads). You're better off being hungry than dreading meals.<p>As always, YMMV.",1235731043

It's not just alcohol, but yeh, out partying and drinking leads to 2am takeaway, hangover foods and the calories in and of itself in alcohol are bad.<p>Like everything, you will find people who tell you ""the best way to lose weight is X"" ... employ a multi-faceted approach and you'll get the best results. There is no silver bullet. Some people will not stop snacking, some people will not stop eating greasy takeaways and some people will not stop driving 3 blocks instead of just walking. Try ""Being healthy"" and if you find it difficult to do everything at once, take baby steps. Eat healthy food on Tuesdays and Thursdays only, building up one day at a time every two weeks. Sometimes it can take a while to get used to not being full of MSG-ridden salty foods and stuff like removing caffeine from your diet can be difficut. Getting used to the taste of wholegrain this and low fat that takes a while. It's better introduced slowly... you'll find it more difficult to keep to some sort of strict that requires that you eat stuff that you don't like 3 times a day.<p>It is important to do as much as you can to increase your metabolism. This means not being sedentary! Get out, go for walks, exercise, go for a jog. Whatever. Measure, rinse, repeat.<p>Take a sensible approach to changing your lifestyle and it can definitely come about. Fad diets, exercise machines, stomach crunchers etc. are useless without you recognising that you want to be healthy. It's not just about losing weight and remember that! There are people of average weight living extremely unhealthy lifestyles who will die younger too.",1235729120
497071,comment,496475,496980,0,0,davidw,,,"Because the Columbia river, and specifically, the Columbia Gorge are probably far more suited for power generation than pretty much anywhere else in the country?  You have the 4th largest river in the country very near to its outlet going through a deep gorge in a mountain range.  It's pretty hard to beat that.  The PNW, in general, has a lot more water than California does (something all too obvious to anyone who has ever spent a winter in western Oregon or Washington).  Of course, all those dams have done their part to kill off the salmon runs, and that industry, but that's another story.<p>Anyway, this article is politics, though, as can be seen by the resulting discussion, so I went ahead and flagged it.",1235729084
497070,comment,496946,497014,0,0,jbert,,,"I don't understand how that scheme can work, since changing the number of shards changes the location of most users.<p>e.g. we have 4 shards, so user 5 is on shard1. If we go to 6 shards, user5 is now on shard5.<p>I guess it works with downtime to move the users, or another layer of indirection, where the newly created shards can ""point back"" to existing shards, but otherwise I don't see it.<p>My understanding of sharding is that it's best to have a global lookup table user->shard. That's not a huge amount of data, even for millions of users.<p>Anyone care to educate me as to how they get user%num_shards working in practice?",1235728948
