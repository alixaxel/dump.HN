465235,comment,464342,464342,0,0,nshah,,,"To me this argument itself is wrong; One of the reasons why using CSS is considered difficult by some developers is because of the different levels of support shown by different browsers.<p>The whole argument that CSS has a learning curve, or that we need hacks, etc - all point to the same problem. The reason it takes such a long time to get the layout just right is because there is some browser out there (typically IE6) that does not behave the way you want it to.<p>We would not even be having this ""war"" if all the browsers were standards compliant, so my gripe as a developer is - why are we not fighting the correct war? As a developer, I must be able to write code, whether using div tags or table tags, and expect that it works just as it is supposed to, and not have to waste hours trying to hack it to work with non-compliant browsers!!",1233719937

The part after the hash not part of the URL, it is a fragment or anchor.<p>It breaks my firefox extension that nukes searchwiki.<i></i> It breaks my custom CSS for the search results page (see userstyles.org).<i></i> I often bookmark google search results in del.icio.us. Depending on how such services are implemented, different search results pages might show up as the same page.<p>I'd guess there's just a lot of code out there that assume search results are separate URLs, and that's going to break.<p><i></i>Those two breakages are simply due to the regex identifying the search results pages not matching anymore, and are easily fixable.",1233719430
465226,comment,463746,464065,0,0,patio11,,,"Its interesting to me on an intellectual level to compare your way of describing the peeler to his way of describing the peeler.  You describe breakage as an intrinsic feature of peelers, much like 1970s Ford might describe defects as an intrinsic feature of cars.<p>He describes his peelers as being remarkable accomplishments of Swiss engineering that do not break, period, and repeatedly contrasts it with the peelers you can buy in most supermarkets in Europe and Asia.  I can just about quote it from memory: ""This isn't a cheap peeler.  If you want a cheap peeler you can buy one at any dollar store.  This peeler was made in Switzerland and nothing from Switzerland was ever cheap.  You don't buy this peeler because it is cheap and you can replace it when it wears out, you buy it because it will be the last peeler you ever buy.""<p>Now it might be the case that you and he are still talking about the same peeler.  I think that this demonstrates one little technique which makes him a really good salesman for the peeler.  I think that this technique is a useful one to stick in the quiver -- it works with positioning software, too.  He is so consummately good at selling that I think we could learn a lot from him, including this one little technique, which is why I consider him noteworthy to HN.<p>On being the Last X You Will Every Buy: I use a variation of the same to position my software.  Most software in my vertical is licensed in such a way that it requires repurchase every year.  There are a bunch of reasons for this -- suffice it to say that most IP in my vertical is treated that way, software is largely produced by the existing IP makers, and they ported their license terms from their existing businesses without much regard to how software changes the game.  I think my customers hate that business model with a burning passion, largely because my customers tell me they hate that business model with a burning passion.  I licensed my software perpetually and position it, very explicitly, as The Last X You Will Ever Buy.  I think this is one reason why I can get away with charging more than almost any of my competitors, announce a price increase, and have customers send me mail telling me how cheap I am.",1233719414

One key component of an open source search engine would be a sort-of peer-to-peer distributed infrastructure. When I suggested this in an earlier thread, people were quick to point out the liability concerns here... but maybe it could work somehow... but then how do you get people to sign up for it?<p>That said, I think this is incredibly interesting stuff.

I assume that even a $400 charge would have a major effect on what applicants end up presenting.<p>Theoretically, you could argue that it keeps away anyone that doesn't believe she's got a reasonable chance of getting funded. I believe it will keep away many idea only ""startups"" that don't have any real substance behind them. It would also keep away those just practising or testing the waters.<p>Again theoretically, it is not even necessarily a problem if it keeps away perfectly good presentations. If they get can get more presentations then they can hear, it's ok to lose some good ones as long as your mean quality rises.<p>What throws a spanner in the mix is what startups (especially those that see $500 as a hit) think of those groups that charge them.<p>I have no idea what the reality is. But the tone on HN always seems to suggest that this is an option for the naive, inexperienced & clueless. That's certainly not the image they should want to project.<p>Again speaking with no experience, that makes some sense.

The amount of productive output is not 2x as much as the 40 hour week; due to fatigue and stress, the productive output only averages out to about 150% more work...in other words, a 25% loss in productivity as compared to just working 2 40 hour weeks.<p>3) The stress of working 80-100 hour work weeks kills the body good.
