I try to avoid his writing, so if other people at Harvard have interesting things to say, I'm not going to find it through Hacker News.<p>The same thing happens with subdomain blogs on github - I can't tell which blog the post is really coming from.

They believe that anything under 100% test coverage in several disciplines (unit, functional, integration, etc) is just as bad as no testing.<p>There is, of course, a middle way. Implement as much testing as makes sense for you. Think Pareto.. just the right 20% of testing could give you 80% of the gains.<p>So.. implement integration tests that test your apps very broadly and as soon as one fails, you know you can start looking deeper. No need to always start with line by line unit tests :)",1233770311
