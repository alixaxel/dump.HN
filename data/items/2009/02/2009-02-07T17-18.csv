That seems obvious but FeedBurner is actually terrible at one of their core features. It's not uncommon for your subscriber count to bottom out to zero from one day to the next as their system fails to work.<p>#2. Find a way to find and eliminate the cheaters. FeedBurner's subscribe-via-email feature is a great way for people to scam the system and raise their subscriber counts. All you have to do is make a bunch of dummy accounts, which is trivial for anyone with any kind of decent hosting package, and then use those accounts to subscribe to your feed.<p>---<p>Subscriber counts are an important metric for both ego and site valuation.

They're extremely dedicated to making your experience with Amazon great. Doesn't that mean the public has less to risk with an Amazon book reader? I'm biased because I have a Kindle and it's a sheer delight to use, but that's kind of the point. Posters here are acting like the Kindle's reputation is undeserved, when in fact it is a superior e-reader in the sense that it's easy and comfortable to use.

I don't have advice on the best way to do it, but I can tell you this: If you're anything like me, then taking money from your friends and family will insure you keep the startup going no matter how bad things get. There's almost no greater motivator not to give up than taking money from your friends' savings accounts. I should have given up several times before we were acquired. I had to ask all the companies interested in acquiring us for a small amount of money if they were serious about entering into 'strategic relationship' discussions -- the money was used to keep the power on, the net connected, and to keep my team from being evicted from their apartments. Honestly, I would have shut the company down six months prior had it not been for the fact that some of my best friends had provided capital. It paid off financially, but took a big toll psychologically.",1234027926

471275,comment,470931,470931,0,0,RobGR,,,"* Incentives for users to post, i.e. beating the chicken and egg problem:  
1) Find a way to offer a payment service, or easily integrate with google checkout, so that the user's ""Buy"" button is automatically hooked to their GC account and the item description, link to menkle.com item, etc is in the GC transaction email.  Don't use PayPal.
2) At least at the start, advertise some posts in other ways.  You might buy google adwords that link to specific items, make a single-page poster listing half a dozen good items and have it put up around college campuses and other place, etc.
3) Attract buyers by buying certain items and re-selling them through the site, trying to break even on the transaction and taking a hit on the overhead of finding, dealing with the customer, storing it in the mean time, etc<p>* Best Catagories:  I am not sure there is anything in particular you can focus on.  If there are catagories that Ebay and Craigslist forbid, that are easy to handle, then you might advertise to buyers / sellers for that catagory, but the only such catagories that come to mind are firearms and used underwear.  You can probably do the firearms, as long as you try to only assist in-state transactions, and you prominently warn parties that transactions are archived on the site forever.  Maybe you could allow someone with a FFL to pay for a special account where they could do interstate firearms posts.  Offering pets for free is another one.<p>* What I wish I could do on Craigslist:
1) Make a good search engine for historical pricing data, so  I can see if something is a good deal, and price my own offerings.  This is hard on CL because there is no way to tell if a posting ever sold, or if the transaction occurred at the advertised price.
2) Archive all posts in a searchable manner.  This is good for pricing, but also for tracking down stolen shit.
3) Don't stop people from selling, trading, or giving away pets.
4) Swap meet - see below
5) Never completely delete posts.  You can make them ""go gray"" YC-style with a few flaggings, but if the poster wants to remove it, or the transaction is done, it should go into some permanent archive.  Access to the permanent archive can be sold at a subscription of $10 a year or something if you need to keep out spammers and etc.<p>* What I would change about your site to make it better:
1) Use a simple, no java script, craigslist like or google like interface.  Look at plentyoffish if you want something a little more featured than CL.  This site (yc) is also good.
2) In addition to searching by zip or region, have a ""special region"" called ""mail order"" for people buying or selling through the mail.
3) Offer a way to do an auction.  Avoid the sniping crap by extending the auction for an hour every time someone makes another bid (i.e., make it a real auction)<p>Here's a way to try to get jumpstarted: hook up with some small flea market to do a ""county wide garage sale"".  Charge $5 to pile your shit in a parking lot to sell it, free admission, the $5 charge is waived if you post all your stuff for sale on merkle 30 days before the swap meet.<p>I would love to consolidate all my meeting of potential craigslist buyers, and all the driving to check out items that turn out not to be as advertised, into one day and one location.  I could tell people I'm interested in the item, and they should bring it to a certain place at a certain time, and then I could do all the haggling and get my business done in one hour and save gas.<p>I like your idea.  The most important thing is to make the interface cleaner, don't use ajax or javascript or anything else that a web designer would think was cool.",1234027828

That sounds crazy low. Even other related positions are not that much better.<p>Are there some tricks to sweeten it for UK army people - like you don't pay taxes/food/rent, extra per-diem allowances, long vacations, good pension?<p>That's for example how jobs in international organizations  can be very attractive despite not particularly high salaries.",1234026693

However, the Kindle sacrifices screen size to make up for a built-in keyboard. 99% of the time that you are using the device you won't have any need for a keyboard, and the Iliad's 8 inch screen would serve you better at those times than the Kindle's 6 inch screen.<p>For me, the ideal form factor for an e-book reader would look like one of two things:<p>1) A larger iPod touch with something close to an 8 inch screen.<p>or<p>2) An EeePC with a swivel screen so you could use it in e-book mode, similar to the OLPC XO.<p>Right now I'm using an OLPC XO as an e-book reader, and although it doesn't have as nice a form factor as the Iliad or the Sony Reader, I do consider it significantly nicer than the Kindle. Of course, the low price doesn't hurt either.",1234026643

I'll try to keep it in mind.<p>I finally got a basic barebones class system up and running in Lua (without inheritance though).  I can see the flexibility and power of the thing.  But with power, well, you kinda have to reinvent the wheel for the tools that you're use to.  I figured it was a good exercise anyway.<p>I was tickled by the name LuaRocks.  RubyGems.

I have several apps running on AppEngine and one of them is a soon to be released location-based game for mobile phones (starting with the iPhone).<p>I have had to jump through tons of hoops in order to eliminate the need for background processes. Not to mention that sometimes you need just a little longer than the request timeout to process a data set.<p>I think that Jaiku is a perfect example of how ""eating your own dogfood"" makes your product better / more useful.

The command to email a page to someone is pretty handy--if it worked most of the time.<p>Also, the algorithm to do real-time narrowing down of commands that you might mean gets slower and slower (seemingly exponentially) the more you type.  After a while, I find it gets bogged down and unusable.<p>The only use I've had for it was to make it easier to twitter something, only because I don't have twitter clients installed.<p>That said, it's still early.  I think the concept is good.  And even better when you can have context specific commands for each web app that you visit.  That way you don't need to download each ubi script as you want them.  They dynamically load and unload with the web application.",1234026107
