(I believe every line north goes into North Station but I've never gone from that direction.) Frankly I can't see a better approach for mass transit. The problem I think is that the high tech jobs tend to be up in Cambridge or parts of Boston that require transfers from the major commuter line stations.<p>Rte. 128 is an old highway that wasn't intended for the traffic on it and I'm not sure if property lines and such prevent further expansion of it. From my perspective, I wouldn't put a company there unless I was prepared to give the employees 100% telecommuting. Having people lose 3 hours of their lives daily to breathing in fumes and looking at other cars' bumpers is an almost criminal waste of their time.<p>Sorry robg, I didn't mean to evade your question.

I guess you hate apt and yum too? Gee, having a list of programs that are installed is really lame.
Right, because the Mac makes so much more sense. The dmg files that you download have to be mounted (lame). Inside the dmg, you _might_ find a folder, a bunch of files, a single file or a setup program. You just never know. Then when you're done figuring that out and you finally get your program ""installed"" on your Mac, you have to unmount the dmg.
Windows is much simpler: Download setup.exe, double click, Next, Next, Finish.

But you'd have to resort to the big concatenated file for debugging in production.<p>Another solution would be to somehow preserve the information about what comes from where, so that via a browser plugin you could browse the concatenated file as if it were the original modular files.<p>Lately I'm getting really interested in ways to preserve information about ""what comes from where"" so that you could point to something in a generated output and ask the system to explain the sum of all inputs and considerations (decisions, transformations) that resulted in that ""atom"" being generated in the output through the various ""semantic levels"".

I guess you hate apt and yum too? Gee, having a list of programs that are installed is really lame.<p>Right, because the Mac makes so much more sense. The dmg files that you download have to be mounted (lame). Inside the dmg, you _might_ find a folder, a bunch of files, a single file or a setup program. You just never know. Then when you're done figuring that out and you finally get your program ""installed"" on your Mac, you have to unmount the dmg.<p>Windows is much simpler: Download setup.exe, double click, Next, Next, Finish.<p>(originally posted by user: wizlb)",1235070670

So far this experiment seems to be working.</i><p>I'm not sure what counts as character and this is obviously subjective but my personal feeling is that HN's quality has taken a slight hit in the past year.  It doesn't seem as unique as it once was and many of the topics that make it to the front page seem to be more formulaic.  Furthermore many newcomers seem to post the same things that were raised here previously.  I've lost track of the number of topics about hosting providers, credit card processing and the like.  Also with the increased volume it's been hard to make effective use of the ""new"" page.  Odd things that may interest me that don't quickly get enough attention are lost faster.<p>Unfortunately I predict growth and network effects will speed up this trend and 2 years from now HN will likely be much less interesting as the HN of a year or two ago.",1235070285
