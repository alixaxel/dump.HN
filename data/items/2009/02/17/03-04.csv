The guy who shot the TwitPic-seen-around-the-world (Flight 1549 on the Hudson) seems to siphon off some HN links and pass them off as his own 'deep web' finds. In his defense, he doesn't change the title - so he's not trying to hide it (totally).<p>I guess I'm a little annoyed that he is using HN as a tool to generate authority links (e.g. feed interesting articles to his twitter followers that will increase his twitter ""network""), without participating in the conversation at all (maybe he is anonymous). Also, he is running the link through Adjix to track his referral count. Yes, there are many lurkers on HN (I used to be one).<p>On the other hand, by ambiguation of the source (HN), he is protecting us from an onslaught of News.YC new readers.<p>What do you think?

484022,comment,483724,484004,0,0,mattobrien,,,"A few things. First, this is a global recession. I would not expect unemployment in the US to be as bad now as it was during the Great Depression simply because the US occupies a different place in the global economy today. In 1929, the US was the manufacturer and creditor of the world - a position China occupies today. I would expect the urban unemployment rate in China to reach the high teens, maybe higher. China is likely already technically in a recession (their 6.8% 4th quarter GDP growth is a mirage. It is calculated year-on-year, rather than annualized, seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter. Hence, their 4th quarter was more likely zero or negative, and the first quarter of this year will be worse). Japan's economy is falling off a cliff at -13%. And Europe is in awful shape too; Germany's exports have died, and Eastern Europe is already in a depression scenario with 10% contraction nearly across the board. The question is where is the demand going to come from? No one can export their way out of this mess. Many sovereign states could default as well - small European countries with large banking sectors relative to GDP are at huge risk - and social unrest will likely only get worse. This is bad.<p>Second, Japan achieved roughly 1% growth annually during its lost decade, and that was with spending hundreds of billions on stimulus programs. Without that spending, Japan likely would have had years of negative growth. That is not a hopeful model of where our economy is headed.",1234840486
484021,comment,481910,482965,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I agree.  Every so often there's a post about something that can change my approach or direction to a problem I'm solving.  Even if it's not relevant to what I'm doing, there's a wealth of information that's worth knowing.  In a nutshell:  HN is an extraordinarily good place for a tech entrepreneur to find out what he doesn't know.<p>However, in practice, I find it still takes a substantial amount of effort to filter the information I'm exposed to into something I can use in the near future.  The amount of due diligence in figuring out if a certain technology (especially if it's new and if you lack experience with it) is a large enough barrier for me to usually continue on with what I'm doing.  I simply don't have time to learn a new language every month, or learn how to migrate to new DB, or any infrastructural changes like that.[1]  On the scale of things, I've prioritized ""get stuff done"" as #1, with ""learn how to get better stuff done faster"" as #2.  HN is good at #2.<p>Like anything, HN is what you make of it.  I personally love the fact that HN is so densely populated with the exactly the type of people whose opinions I actually respect (surprisingly rare for me), and who I'd like to network with.  As a result of the amazing crowd here, I get to learn what I don't know at an astounding rate.  From there I can leave it to my natural curiosity and ambition to fill it in.<p>Edit: [1] Another thing is, quite often people post things on HN merely seeking validation of what they're doing.  So many blogs I read are about ""Here's how I do something, and why you should, too.  (And since I'm telling you to do it, it means I'm right)"" which puts an even huger burden of due diligence on my shoulder.

That's not true at all for VC firms or their limited partners. Twice the profit is roughly twice as good for them, in fact in the competitive industry, it might be more than twice as good. If everyone is getting 15% returns, the difference between 10% and 20% for a VC fund can be tremendous the next time they're out raising funds.<p>By allowing the founders to cash out, it gives them the cushion they need to swing for the fences, rather than trying to sell their company as soon as it will make them independently wealthy.",1234840386

484017,comment,483928,483928,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Many git users say that the problem with learning git is to <i>unlearn</i> all the stuff you know about CVS or SVN, because git is <i>just not the same</i>. Now I understand what they're talking about.<p>Beacuse Eric Sink is a smart guy, but he doesn't understand git yet. He's still following the Subversion workflow. The secret is that ""git commit"" is <i>not a sacred act</i>. Don't be fooled by the words. When you do an ""svn commit"", the result is written in stone in some centralized repository where it can break everyone else's builds, now and forever. When you do a ""git commit"" the result sits on your machine. It goes nowhere. This is <i>distributed</i> version control -- a commit just changes your local repo, and if it doesn't work you just undo it. (Or, alternatively, make seven more commits in your efforts to fix it, then use the mighty ""git rebase --interactive"" to smash all of them together into a single, perfect commit. Then you pretend that it was correct all along. Nobody else will be the wiser. You'll look like a genius!)<p>So, if you want to pull half the hunks out of a previous commit, make a branch (you can make branches more easily than blinking -- <i>this is git</i>), pull out half the hunks, commit the result. <i>Then</i> compile and test. (If you like, you can probably use a post-commit hook to compile and test automatically.) If the tests pass, merge your experimental branch back into your development branch, then do the ""git push"" to the central repository. It is that push -- not any of your commits -- that is the point where you have to be sure that you're not breaking anything. And you can't use git's index to <i>push</i> files that have never been visible to your compiler and your tests.<p>UPDATE: I have yet to actually use them, but another one of Sink's commenters reminds me that git has pre-commit hooks that seem to solve his specific problem. Here's something I googled up on that subject:<p><a href=""http://www.nabble.com/git-pre-commit-hook--best-place-to-make-available--td20907299.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nabble.com/git-pre-commit-hook--best-place-to-mak...</a><p>Again, I don't use such a thing, because I think it's kind of silly to insist that every local commit pass all tests. That's a recipe for failing to make enough local commits. I've been finding that it's better to make a commit every time you make <i>any</i> change that can be described in an English sentence. Then you have a little log of everything that you've done that you can rearrange with ""git rebase -i"" and turn into your final, pushable commits.",1234840216

It works pretty good.<p>Linux is like Lego, not like Windows.",1234839938

We see reports that show that newspapers' customer base is literally dying off. The younger generations don't have the same place in their lives for dead-tree news.<p>The economic downturn and advertising nosedive will decrease the available time window for newspapers to evolve. I think many will not make it. This could be a good thing. If there is a need for their services, something will appear to take their place (and eventually something with a viable business model). Startups will lead the way in innovation, and the smart newspapers that survived will learn to rapidly adopt what works (and hopefully cultivate a spirit of innovation themselves).<p>To be fair, I know a number of ""traditional"" journalists that have made the leap to Twitter, Digg, StumbleUpon, etc and have embraced these new forms to build flow, readership and conversation. I expect these folks to adapt and provide the professional expertise required for in-depth investigative journalism.",1234839746
