Think every day is a launch day. First launch on forums like HN, then get some feedback, then launch on few mid-size blogs, see if they cover it, see if you can handle traffic, then again launch on bigger blogs, and then keep launching to every single person you meet on each and every day. Once you are ready, every single day is a launch day.",1234846791

However, they are connecting people they already know. Even if you were able to figure out what businesses should connect, you will probably need who at those particular businesses should be connected. I don't think you can remove the human element from networking. LinkedIn succeeds because they are a powerful tool for managing a professional network and a lesser tool for reputation scoring (other startups are addressing that - check out <a href=""http://anthillz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anthillz.com</a>). They do have a 'people you might want to add as a connection' but they pretty much remain in the background. LinkedIn is going to be hard to beat - they have the data and have gone beyond critical mass.",1234846320

This is why there are still no programming factories. There are already data-indexing and query processing factories, but you still should think and write.<p>All those methods, form Booch's RUP, Beck's XP, Fowler's Refactoring are an attempts to adapt scientific methods, psychological and human behavior models, and even religious concepts to the process of the writing software.<p>The point is that these common ideas can be also adapted to a business processes.<p>For example, RUP is about planning and circles of iterations - scientific approach. XP is about reuse human behavior - little steps, being sure you hadn't broke anything, look (run tests) at your beloved code 10 times a day. Refactoring is about continuous improvements, little changes, that makes your code easier to understand, which means easier to modify and support. This is, probably, from dictionary and guide-books writing. You're writing the code is for humans, not for compilers.<p>Of course, not one of these methods fits all, but you can make a mix by yourself. Some from there, some from there. It is like cooking.

484111,comment,484051,484051,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"I'm not into Twitter at all too much, yet, but it seems like nowadays any link you post is fair game.  URLs in and of themselves have nearly as much value as the content within them, which is what makes social media sites so valuable.  It's now the nature of the web for URLs to get passed around.  It doesn't seem to matter much from where the URL first got popular.. Digg/Reddit/HN/4chan/etc.. if it's good content, the link has value, and is arbitraged across all of the networks.<p>Anybody can repost links found on any of these networks, and claim they found them themselves.  I've long theorized about how since there's values in URLs, one could profit from being able to detect when a URL is ""underrated,"" that is, poised to become extremely popular, and share the link.  Basically, a ""what's about to be really hot across all social media sites"" URL generator.  If I link to it from Twitter before it becomes popular, I'm doing my followers a service.<p>My question for you: what does ""highest-point"" submission mean?  How are points measured?

That counts as obsession to me. Oh and I forgot to write it before, but financial institutions often <i>need</i> to store in plaintext anyway, for telephone authentication.<p><i>""Why would I as a user care at all if I could retrieve the actual value of a complex password -- and why would knowing I could recover it make me then choose a more complex one?""</i><p>If people know they have to remember it, they tend to choose simpler passwords, or they write it down.

I can't really back that up with a study, though, so it could just be my experience.<p><i>""The user should be given an option of resetting the password via a link sent by email.

It's a possible and valid answer to your question that you have to consider: that you ad is good, but your opportunity is bad.<p>That doesn't help you launch your business, so how about this:<p>What you seem to need to do is pay a contractor to build you a web application you have designed.<p>Think of this as building out an empty strip mall unit into a cafe for fulfill your dream of owning a coffee house. You have a general idea, and with your good credit, you can lease the space, but you need somebody with skills and experience to do the build out: build a bar, install coffee machines, plumbing, electric, internet, interior design, funishing... etc.<p>Assume you have plenty of cash and some rudimentary experience outfitting commercial real estate. Then this is straightforward: you request bids, hire a contractor, they do everything you want, you pay them, and cafe business is entirely owned by you.

Maybe the cafe goes on to be part of the family business.<p>* You save your money until you can pay somebody to do the work.<p>* You get a small business loan from the bank to do the work.

I've never again experienced anything as intense as this, which includes skydiving.<p>I spotted a tiny white moving dot in the sky.  At first, it looked like a satellite in orbit, only it strangely grew in intensity, until appearing to be an airplane.  5 seconds in, it began to flicker, grew brighter, and grabbed the attention of other onlookers.  From there, small fragments began coming off as it increased in brightness and become more of a white-orange color.  The fragmenting pieces themselves also followed suite, breaking off into more white-orange pieces and leaving glittering trails.  The main object then became quite massive, maybe about half the size of a full moon, with equal to or greater brightness then a full moon.  The ground lit up.  The main object was constantly disintegrating as pieces were breaking off and lagging back into the trail, breaking off into even more glittering pieces, and producing more light.  Still, the main object only grew in intensity and become more distinctly orange.  I can't be sure, because at this point it was burning spots into my eyes, which were adjusted for low light, but I believe there was even a trail of smoke.  At this point I remember thinking ""holy crap, it's going to impact way over there!"" but instead, it dimmed a bit, and flew past the horizon.  Suddenly, it was like the whole thing had never happened.  Surprisingly, there was no sound from it.<p>On a related note, did anyone catch the Leonids several years back?  That was also quite amazing.",1234843561
