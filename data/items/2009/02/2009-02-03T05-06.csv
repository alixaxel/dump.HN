463591,comment,463506,463506,0,0,jaxn,,,"1) I might find it more useful if it was limited to tweets from the people I follow or where the votes were from people I follow. I know that is much more difficult data and that it requires much greater adoption to be viable. But I think that would make it useful for me. (you could also use favorites as votes if you can get the data).<p>2) The design and performance seemed fine. The icons seem less harsh on twitter.com because the row height is closer to the icon size. Also, maybe only display the instructions the first time I visit the page. Go from Popular to Recent and back to Popular. The instructions get in your way.<p>3) I guess I rolled this one into the first answer.<p>Now, it sounds like I may want different things from twitter than your target market since for me it is more about ambient relationships than insightful commentary.<p>Congrats on your launch!",1233640573

However, I know that DHEA, on the other hand, has <i>many</i> downsides. It is important to note that 7-Keto (7-oxo) is <i>not</i> DHEA. It is a <i>metabolite</i> of DHEA. For a complete list of studies and abstracts, including the latest, I would search PubMed: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&term=7-keto+dhea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&term=...</a> (7-Keto search; 14 hits.)<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&term=7-oxo+dhea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&term=...</a> (7-oxo search; 47 hits.)<p>There was an LEF (Life Extension Foundation) magazine cover story on 7-Keto (7-oxo) in the May 2005 issue: <a href=""http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2005/may2005_cover_keto_01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2005/may2005_cover_keto_01.ht...</a><p><i>Scientists have documented DHEA’s wide-ranging benefits in numerous clinical studies. DHEA helps to retard the effects of aging and promotes enhanced longevity, exerting a multitude of effects through its conversion to some 150 metabolites, each with unique actions within the body.<p>One of the most important of these is 7-Keto DHEA (commonly referred to as 7-Keto), a hormone metabolite that can safely boost immune function and help reduce body fat. Unlike DHEA, however, 7-Keto does not convert to estrogen and testosterone. Because DHEA and 7-Keto have separate and unique functions and properties, it is important to understand the differences between these two popular dietary supplements. [...]<p>A study with mice suggests that 7-Keto can boost memory as well.17 In this experiment, researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison trained young mice in the use of a water maze. They found that a single injection of 7-Keto (at 24 mg/kg of body weight) reversed experimentally induced memory loss. The scientists then fed 7-Keto or DHEA to old mice that had learned the maze. They discovered that memory of the water-maze training was retained during a four-week test period in the mice receiving 7-Keto but not in those treated with DHEA.</i><p>The article includes 18 references.",1233640324

463553,comment,462531,463467,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, it's not even so much that. In general, corporate actually knows better than the local guy how many of an item are selling, they see it in the reports. Local guys don't have any better information.<p>Local guys don't control pricing either, in general. That too is set by corporate.<p>What was common, and I think what he may have been talking about, was employees discounting things for certain people. That's the only time I can think of when you'd look at profit margins. Maybe something placed in clearance, or resold open box after a return. Or, for instance, we'd give our bigger clients a discount on bulk orders of printer paper if they asked. Paper was pretty close to a loss leader anyway, so we'd sell it at ""cost"" or maybe even very slightly below.<p>The other thing that's ambiguous about what he said (and Wal-Mart's numbers in general) is exactly how they compute margins. Wal-Mart runs their own distribution chain, so unlike a mom and pop, who simply buys a product for a set price including delivery, Wal-Mart buys the product for a lower price and deals with getting it to the stores themselves.<p>So they pad their ""cost"" as seen by the employees by some amount to account for the supply chain, which can include a profit, or so I was told. Meaning that a store could still sell an item at what they consider cost, but corporate Wal-Mart might still make money on it.<p>Also, the lowest level employees are not empowered to change prices, though the supervisors (next to lowest level) generally can. However it's very common for the average floor person to ask the supervisor ""hey can I sell this to this guy for $x because it's open box and I need that space for the new seasonal products tomorrow anyway"" and the supervisor to simply approve it.<p>Wal-Mart pays generous bonuses to stores for achieving certain profit amounts, so employees, knowing the margin, are encouraged to not dip below it where possible. Otherwise for all an employee cared, he'd sell everything for $1.",1233638300
