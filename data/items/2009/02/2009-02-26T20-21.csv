There is no such thing as conventional wisdom on such topics, there are just widespread opinions:<p>Note, there are two points we are discussing here:<p>1. Is there a way of saying that some grammar is more complex that others - objectively?<p>2. Does writing influence the complexity of the grammar?<p>Now, for both cases, I base my opinion of observation, and not off any scientific papers. Since you are doing the same, the only way we can settle this duel is by trying to show as many examples one way or the other to resolve the issues.<p>Regarding the first question, I'll just assume that we both accept that there is difference in complexity in grammar between languages. Or do you not think so?<p>Regarding the second question, I'll say this:<p>* Chinese Grammar is simple, but it's very clear that Chinese style writing cannot have the same influence. If you do not know a chinese word, you cannot write it, and you cannot read it. As such, you are not likely to use it, and the word will tend to die. In western style writing, you can attempt to write a word from having heard it once. It's also much easier for words to live on, because words are easily copied.<p>* Unwritten Creole and Pidgin Languages always do very similar things to western languages - they strip it of certain grammatical constructs, and it ends up being like most unwritten languages - past tense and future tense are created by adding words, and not by changing words.",1235681981

EDM genre is all based on promotions. Promoting music through live sets, DJ sets, and weekly podcasts. The problem is how these sets are distributed. iTunes is a great source for podcasts but they way it distributes these live sets is inherently flawed in terms of a good user experience.<p>As a EDM fan you want to know what track is playing, so you can come back to it on a later day and listen to it again. Or perhaps you want to buy the song you are listening to on a set/podcast. What we have done on Mugasha is built a player that streams these long (1-2 hours) podcasts on-demand and allows the user to listen to them as if the set was an album.<p>Embdeeded in the track listing for each set is a buy button (through amazon [iTunes and Beatport](coming soon). We are partnering with Bandsintown to provide live event(tickets) information for the artists that you are listening to i the set. This is not the best way to monetize (for us), but it is great for the artist (thats the goal). We are here to promote EDM in a more effective way and make it easier for users to enjoy this kind of music, as well as for them to easily buy and support the artist.<p>So if you like dance(including trance) music, please check out Mugasha.",1235681792

The question for this approach will be how to achieve scale (of if they even want/need to) to achieve their goals.<p>While profitability can be achieved on $15k, is it sustainable and can it achieve scale on that money? Cloud computing may help, but may not solve it all. Facebook, Google, etc. all needed VC $ to fuel scale.<p>Implications exist for founders and early investors if future capital is needed for scale or an exit. If the goal is to either sustain the profitable model and owner control at lower revenue, then this model works. Also, if the goal is to sell to a larger company to achieve an exit and return, then it also works. All depends on the market opportunity and founder goals, but don't think it kills the need/importance of VC.<p>If the goal is to capture a significant market and be the leader, and software markets tend to be winner take most markets, then achieving scale fast is necessary and VC$ necessary even in a cloud model. Under the new landscape articulated by PG here, the underlying platform could be built & proven with angel money or no money, and thus preserve more upside and better terms for the founders that choose to seek scale in large markets.",1235679242
