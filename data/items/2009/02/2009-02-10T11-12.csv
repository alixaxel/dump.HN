475047,comment,474919,475018,0,0,ntoshev,,,"He is actually correct that <i>in an OOPL data type definitions are spread out all over the place</i><p>In a typical OO language all the code belongs in classes, and there is no way of telling which classes define the essential data types and which are mostly placeholders for code. There is no way to tell at a glance what are the important data structures. Just look at any open source Java project.<p>I use python and I find myself using more functions and fewer and thinner classes recently. In particular, if some state is transient, I find it is much better to keep it in local variables of the more abstract functions than obscure it as object state.",1234267193

475045,comment,474919,474919,0,0,gojomo,,,"This article is easier to appreciate if you view it as a window into the thinking style of a another programmer, rather than an actual argument about what is right or wrong. (That is, patch your local branch of the headline to ""Why OO Sucks For My Way Of Thinking"".)<p>The impressions I get are that Armstrong likes to stay close to a core set of raw data structures; he's more about the flows than the stocks; he finds delegation and specialization more frustrating than helpful; and he would rather build a combustion engine than an office building.<p>(He's probably an ISTP personality type at work but has put on his ISTJ hat for the purpose of writing this article.)",1234266593

It's like going to a train station, and there are 300 free but slow trains, and 1 slightly faster train where you have to pay money. Only a very few people will pay to use the fast train, and it will soon go out of business.<p>The newspaper business is going to have to become free. There is no other alternative. Writers are what are valuable, people with insight, and not the name or brand of the paper. Those people will survive, but the aggregator of their information, has to be free.",1234266434

I wouldn't be surprised if in addition to something like that, they just up and give you whatever username you want, causing all sorts of havok and things.

475038,comment,474808,474808,0,0,jonasvp,,,"Funny, I just put a somewhat similar site online. It depends on people putting in their current meter count regularly by hand and obviously can't be as precise. Still, for most people who don't have a smart meter (in Germany that's everyone), it can work well, and provide at least a monthly usage chart.<p>I developed it to scratch my own itch: we share a flat and had to pay a lot for electricity at the end of one year because the the advance payments we pay monthly didn't cover our usage. Since then I noted the meter count monthly so we could split the extra charges every month.<p>It's only in German for now, ugly, and probably still buggy.

The win there is that businesses can start their own federated Laconi.ca instance to talk to other Laconi.cas out there.<p>But, there's still the problem of Twitter. There are so many Twitter based apps out there, that spread their brand which means there's about 6 gazillion sites other than blogs, and now news sources like CNN, that actually promote the use of Twitter.

It's got lots of dimensions and facets, and each implementation interprets these in it's own way... e.g You could argue that SmallTalk's message passing metaphor was the precursor to Erlang's model.",1234265381
475030,comment,474591,474980,0,0,Xixi,,,"You are completely wrong about Erlang, which is absolutely not a research language, but when combined with OTP a very pragmatic tool designed by Erlang to answer their specific needs.

475022,comment,474998,475016,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I've seen this happen a couple of times. I think one of the easiest mistakes to make in business is to partner with people that do not have the same motiviations / work ethic as you do. That means that from day 1 your goals are mis-aligned, eventually this will result in some sort of split.<p>That split may go well or bad, but it's a toss-up, and because of that something that you'd do best to avoid.<p>I've learned this the hard way myself, and since then I've only partnered with people once I had verified that our goals were suitably aligned. It's amazing how much friction and irritation you can avoid that way.<p>Think of it as a budgeting problem, the more of the budget you can allocate to productive stuff the more likely you are to succeed, friction between partners can eat up an enormous amount of that budget.",1234264515

475018,comment,474919,474919,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"IMHO this is a pretty poor rant. Let me argue each point:<p>* Data structure and functions should not be bound together<p>In some cases encapsulation works really well. For example GUI elements. It is less true for ""process-oriented"" components. But the arguments he makes don't seem very well thought out.<p>* Everything has to be an object<p>I actually agree here. To my mind, the biggest problem with OOPS is that is slowly devours all other concepts until we are left trying to force-fit all problems into <i>the</i> OOPS mould.<p>* In an OOPL data type definitions are spread out all over the place<p>This just ignorance.<p>* Objects have private state<p>This is also a good point. Having state actually tends to being a ""bad"" thing to do. Of course, the entire purpose of the object is to capture some invariant, but an object doesn't make that clear. Many objects contain instance variables that should actually be parameters.<p>* Why is OOPS popular?<p>Because it makes it easier and safer to get programmers working together as a group. The vocabulary of available objects is a simple and somewhat elegant way of communicating.<p>(EDIT: Corrected layout.)",1234264353
