That is, rather than delivering (and queuing) arbitrary messages, allow the one message, 'user X wants you to contact them'. It would be up to user X to ensure contact info is in their public profile.<p>- A threaded 'private reply', in public conversations, that only the author of the parent comment can see. My main use for this would be to politely point out little things (typos, broken links, etc.) the author may want to correct during the 2-hour editing grace period. There's no need to clutter the main thread with these, especially if the correction is quickly applied.<p>If such 'private threaded replies' were abused in either content (insults/harassment) or volume (long private threads that should be shared with the community or taken to other channels), checks could be added. Perhaps the target could choose to make the comment public, or they could limited to N replies deep, etc.",1235674561

Especially among the current generation, writing is something done online; a blog, an email, a tweet, writing on someone's wall.  At some point, it stops making sense to have a word processor distinct from the web.  Right now, Word has more features that people like than online writing tools, but that will change over time.  Online writing tools are a more natural fit for collaboration and integration with words' final destinations.<p>Microsoft could make the online tool that replaces Word, but it is probably too dangerous to their current revenue stream.  I don't think they can get the same revenue for an online version of Word, and it would be difficult for them to rationalize trying a new business model that may never regain the revenue they get now.<p>(And yes, I'm basically just making the Innovator's Dilemma argument for word processors.)",1235674475

I believe a software update since then has added emoji, but the price has apparently not changed since August until now, so there is reason to suspect that sales are still slow... especially since Apple is not eager to divulge the numbers.<p>The number of iPhone apps created by Japanese developers is not necessarily an indicator of popularity in Japan, since many of the apps could have been developed with the intent to eventually sell on the global marketplace (or locally for the iPod Touch).",1235674474

I don't think this is entirely true. The company is giving you a distribution channel, helping you accept payments and lots of other things in general. The very popular musicians with a dedicated following may be able to sell on their sites easily but I am not sure about the other 90%. I think these companies provide a lot of value to them<p>* They don’t ask you to prove you’re the author or that you’re “signed”. 
I agree about the signed part but I don't think its a good idea for the sites to allow people to sell whatever they put up and assume they are not selling someone else's stuff.<p>Another problem that I have certainly seen in places like India is the fact that bands really crave for an audience and give out their music for free a lot of times. The same music is also available for purchase on some other sites. I feel thats cheating the guy who is buying music. He should know that he can get the same music for free elsewhere and then pay if he wants to. I think this is where the companies providing such services will have a lot of overhead and they do need to take a cut out of the sales.",1235673037

496186,comment,495830,495830,0,0,anuraggoel,,,"This is not surprising. The concept of customer service in India is very different from what we accept as the norm in the States. Indian businesses have always treated consumers like crap. The socio-economic reasons for this are beyond the scope of this post, but I do want to point out some examples to illustrate the general attitude, and help align the frame of reference better.<p>My mother lives in New Delhi and often visits me in the States. She still can’t get over how easy it is to return stuff to stores here. In India, once you’ve purchased something, it’s yours for life. You can’t get a refund if you are not 'completely satisfied with your purchase’. Keep or trash; there is no ‘like’. This applies even if the product is defective. If you are lucky, or willing to yell at the store manager, you might get store credit.<p>You don’t like the movie selection on Delta? I once flew a ‘discount carrier’ from Bangalore to Delhi and had to stare at a 6"" display ad for a refrigerator three hours straight, because it was pasted on the back of the headrest in front of me, and the seat next to me, and every other seat on the plane.<p>If your server in a San Francisco restaurant isn’t friendly, you give the restaurant two stars on Yelp. In India, if my server is friendly, I have reason to be suspicious. Surprisingly, I have seen this attitude towards customer service even in Indian stores and restaurants in the Bay Area. Note: if you’re white, your Indian server in an Indian restaurant is more likely to be friendly and hospitable. Not so much if you’re Indian, perhaps because they know you know, or perhaps because awe of the ‘white-skinned colonizing foreigner’ is still deeply entrenched in our culture.<p>Airtel, and pretty much all wireless carriers in India often send you ‘free’ text messages advertising their newest ring tones, pricing schemes and partner offers. ""AT&T does that too!"" you say, but not twenty-five times a day. I don’t know if people even understand the concept of opting out.<p>Let’s talk about less superficial issues - landlines stop working arbitrarily. There are times when I can’t reach my mother because her phone (and hence DSL) service has been knocked out by rain or wind or the latest ‘big dig’. Even when the phone lines work, DSL doesn’t work well and VoIP is spotty. Hour-long power outages are common. Four hour outages are even more common (and I'm talking big cities here). Running water around the clock? Only for the tiny new economic class that gets written about in the New York Times. I think it was the mid-nineties, when I heard about a week-long power outage in a Delhi neighborhood and the consequent lynching of local power grid officials by an irate mob.<p>Having grown up in the Indian middle-class, I am used to bad customer service, though I must admit the States is softening me. So when I see complaints about Airtel intercepting client HTTP requests, I can empathize, but it makes me wonder about much bigger customer service issues that never make it to the front page of HN.",1235672652

A story that stuck in my head was of a British magistrate who fought mightly against the South Sea Bubble, publishing pamphlets, launching investigations, militating in the streets and before Parlament, etc.  He tried to move all his money into land, but the general inflation of the bubble caused land prices to explode, and the cost of maintance and taxes also rose; as the bubble churned on year after year and kept failing his predictions of it being about to collapse, he eventually declared that ""if the world has gone mad one must at some point go with it"", gave up, and put all his money into stock.  Then it crashed.<p>I've been thinking residential real estate was abotu to crash since 1999.  If I had tried to speculate on that in anyway, I would have lost year after year before the present contraction.  Bubbles being figments of crowd psychology, they can go on as long as the participants want.<p>But, it is a bad idea to give up in disgust and walk away.  While your money may not survive the next five years, business connections and experience and even whole businesses probably will.  Like a woman trying to re-enter the workforce after spending some years raising children, it can be hard to re-start, so I suspect there is little advantage to being a hermit somewhere for a while.  Unless you are retiring anyway.<p>That said, there is no reason not to hold long memories against the individuals who are doing the most damage in this nonsense, both in business and in politics.",1235672026

For one, there is a dramatically longer history of sailing and boating such that the occasional accident, even one on a massive scale, doesn't shake confidence so readily.<p>With respect to airplanes, I think it is again a proven volume/historical problem. Zeppelins (and blimps) have very low maximum speeds and limited capacity. As for airplane accidents, I don't think they are very frequent so much as it is just that they are generally so heavily broadcast (for good reason).",1235671587
