- Vote weighting (Karma or average Karma effects the weight of your vote)<p>- Include ""Downvotes"" next to the total.

If these kids could learn how to program and had access to computers with Internet access, I think there could be a way for them to earn some money and gain early job experience. And if the programming/computer lessons are related to physics, you could teach both at the same time.<p>I know some people would find this controversial since this is a high school classroom and not a vocational/trade school - that the kids need to focus on learning and building a strong educational foundation. But I'm from India and know how bad the situation can get... these kids are probably under a lot of pressure to earn for their families. Besides, I'm guessing there are people in the US with PhDs that are struggling to find jobs in this economy... if one benefit of a strong, pure educational foundation is some guarantee of job security in the future, it certainly isn't always the case.<p>Can anyone think of realistic ways that kids in this situation could make money by coding, or doing something computer related, on the Web?

You tie a string from the wall to a motor. Ideally you should be able to control the frequency of the motor, but if you don't have this equipment, it's okay. The string will vibrate rapidly. You then close the lights and put a stroboscope on the string. You tune it, by trial and error, to the same frequency of the motor. Then you see the string frozen in a wave form. You can change the freq slightly to make it move slowly. You can have the kids touch the string at the proper places to make standing waves.<p>2.
This one is really simple to do. You take a small object (like a soda can) and tie it with a string to the ceiling. (Let's say the string's length is about half the height of the ceiling.) You pull back the can and release it, making it swing from left to right (Without a circular swing.) Then you hand out ""half-sunglasses"" to the kids. It could just be a piece of dark film, or a partly opaque glass. As long as it's a bit dark and you can see through it. You put the film on one eye, you see the can going in a circle. You put it on the other eye, you see it going in a circle the opposite direction.<p>This happens because the eye with the dark film gets a lower refresh rate. The image on that eye is of the can in a slightly retarded position than the other eye. This messes with the 3D analysis that the brain does, and makes it look like the can is getting closer/farther from you.",1233828270

- Measuring gravity using a pendulum (using T=2.pi.sqrt(l/g))
- Measuring the resistivity of wire
- Measuring values for specific latent heats, specific heats of fusion etc<p>When doing experiments, I always found the ones where we were trying to calculate a known value experimentally (g, specific heats etc) to be the best.",1233828181
