I was mainly using it as a play on Jeff's original post about him ""jumping the shark"" but I guess it's easy to miss that if you're not altogether familiar with his body of work.<p>Either way, my point wasn't that Jeff Atwood is a moron and whatever he says should be disregarded.  Sorry if it came across as that.  The point I was trying to make was that his disregard for code quality and the SOLID principles in specific is dangerous and that the massive amount of readership he gets and the support they have for his beliefs makes that doubly so.",1234403836

They get to keep the IPN and Google payment notification interfaces, an email server to send out registration keys, bunches o' reporting code, and integration to the company that stamps CDs for me.<p>The cart posts directly to them, so hypothetically assuming I generated a secret and passed it over, they'd process the order anyhow and then tell me ""By the way, your website passed this secret with the order -- do whatever with it"", after which point a) the customer would have a registration key and b) if they ordered a CD, it would be scheduled to ship already.<p>Which is a long way of saying ""There are ways to make this setup more secure but they'd involve me having to rewrite large portions of my business processes.""

Even without looking the code, it's pretty obvious what you are doing here -- selecting the users who have recently joined a project.  The code doesn't matter, all the clarity comes from the identifiers.<p>In the Erlang example, you use the identifiers M, T, smonth, Dt, and Acc.  It is a bit harder to reason about, because there is no context and your variable names don't mean anything.

You pay for all the routine stuff yourself, and for the initial hit for anything bigger.  If you encounter a catastrophic situation, you are covered (beware of pre-existing conditions when you sign up).  The risk of that is relatively low.  Rates are commensurately lower.  This corresponds more with how medical insurance was for many some decades ago, before coverage was in practice extended to routine expenses.<p>It's the expense of a catastrophe you need to worry about.  If you end up tapped out, families and, if necessary, friends can usually find a way to cover a few thousand dollars until you hit your out of pocket limit.<p>Most likely, there are people who care about you.  Carrying health insurance isn't just about you, it's also about them.  You prevent putting them in a bind where they must exhaust their own finances to take care of you.  (Of course, these days the way insurance companies reprice and drop policies limits the longer term efficacy of self-insurance while unwell, but it's still a valid argument.)<p>Years ago, I heard that (again, in the U.S.) the IEEE had some group plans that weren't terrible.  But that was second hand information, from someone well into middle age (and so in a different part of the market), and times change.<p>Finally, a number of people I know with their own small businesses obtain their coverage through their spouses or significant others, who work a job that provides a group plan.  I'm not saying Plenty of Fish nor eHarmony is a plan of approach, but if you are in a long-term relationship with someone having coverage, even if not married, it is worth exploring what that plan may offer.  My last employer covered long-term partners (although I'm not sure how that was qualified; I believe sharing a household may have been a factor).<p>EDIT:  One more thing:  I think that COBRA may now cover students for some number of months after they leave school, as a continuation of their coverage e.g. under a parent's group coverage from work.  I could be wrong; perhaps someone else can speak to this.<p>If you are just leaving school, this would be looking into; it would give you a year or 18 months or whatever, as long as you can pay the monthly premiums.  However, you must elect COBRA coverage within a relatively short period of the time at which you qualify, or you lose the option -- at least that's how it is when electing COBRA after leaving an employer.",1234400409
