In both Taiwan and Japan, literacy is very nearly 100%.  The US doesn't fare as well.<p>Blaming China's ""low levels of speaking proficiency in the national language"" on characters doesn't make much sense either.  Dozens of languages are spoken in China and Mandarin has only really been a standard for about a hundred years.  You might as well be condemning the EU for having so many people who don't speak English well.",1233643888

463638,comment,463234,463234,0,0,jrockway,,,"I agree with this guy -- CSS is horrible :)<p>One of my Great Plans For The Future is to write a language that abstracts away HTML, CSS, and (some) JavaScipt.  You describe your layout in a format that makes sense, and the compiler will decide whether to use tables, CSS hacks, or whatever.<p>Ideally, this wouldn't be necessary, but I've never written CSS without the knowledge of the HTML it's going to be applied to, nor have I written HTML without considering how to style it.<p>I am not being dumb, either.  HTML needs all sorts of hooks for styles (classes), since HTML doesn't have any meaningful elements.  (Oh boy, I get <p>, <strong>, and lists.)  When I have done three-column layouts, my HTML has always needed tweaking -- the content has to be in a certain order (usually left/right/center, which is stupid), and it has needed hacks like <br class=""clearfix"">.<p>So clearly we don't live in an ideal world; we are stuck with HTML and CSS the way they are.  It is time to abstract away the stupidity like programmers abstract away the computer with high-level languages.",1233643569

You try to write cross-OS GUIs in Java and Swing and find out how easy that is (it isn't, obviously).<p>The reason people advocate CSS is that it presents some real tangible benefits. CSS was specifically designed to present the semantics of layout rather than HTML tables. The author doesn't even talk about CSS tables (<a href=""http://thinkvitamin.com/design/css/tables-the-next-evolution-in-css-layout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkvitamin.com/design/css/tables-the-next-evolution...</a>).<p>Again I wish people would talk about technologies they were familiar with and had even made spent time with.

When walmart might jump ship on sourcing from you (their purchasers are known to have zero loyalty) because it costs you $0.25 more per decorative lamp than the guy using questionable labor practices, you don't really have a choice on what to do.
