A few years later companies moved into that same space and was able to succeed because the companies that failed opened people up to the idea but were just too far ahead of the public's willingness to adopt.",1233651451

I never was able to maintain a traditional exercise program like that for any length of time. However, I have recently found the secret to getting addicted to exercising: sports.<p>I fell in love with rock climbing about a year ago and feel the need to go at least three times a week. I would go more often, but I am usually too sore from the intense work out. Climbing creates a physical and emotional high that is unmatched by anything I have ever experienced.<p>I lifted weights in college, but never achieved the muscular definition and level of fitness that I have achieved through rock climbing. It helps create a balance of strength, endurance, and flexibility throughout the entire body. With weight lifting, I could never acquire the discipline to strive for the next weight increment. But with rock climbing, I yearn to be able to complete the next route and am singularly focused on reaching that goal.<p>It also helps that rock climbing can sometimes be a more social activity that weight lifting.",1233650021

It is evident that person can use CSS for other layouts (even using floats) without ever encountering the problems he describes.

Now, before you actually get angry... there's nothing wrong with that! You're a coder! Do what you do best - write awesome useful stuff! ...and don't be afraid to acknowledge that there's a language out there that looks like code, but that you don't have a handle on.<p>As someone who has spent the last several years doing nothing but writing HTML and CSS in a professional capacity, I am here to tell you that if all you beautiful, intelligent hackers out there (I'm only being facetious about the beautiful part, 'cause I've seen some of you ;) really understood front-end layout the way you understand all your programmy stuff (which I do NOT), we wouldn't be having this discussion.<p>If you're just working on a personal project, or trying to hammer out the beta version of your web app... sure, use tables, so you're not wasting time trying to do something that's not your core competency. However, if you're taking it beyond that, or trying to get into front-end stuff in a professional capacity, you need know CSS like the back of your hand. Someone who's competent at layout should be able to write something from scratch that does whatever they want it to without having to debug it for hours.<p>If you're at the point where your biggest problems would be solved by using table layout instead of CSS, you're probably not at a point on the CSS learning curve where it's appropriate to make assertions about which layout technique is superior.<p>All that said, if you're a coder, why do you want to get into layout anyway?
