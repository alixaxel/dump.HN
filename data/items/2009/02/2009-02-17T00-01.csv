I'm interested to know which points you think are off & why.<p>The conclusion was that VCs are in a worse position. Investment needs to get smaller & to maintain their investment sizes VCs will need to buy shares from founders.<p>1 - Software Startups need/want less capital because of (a) lower technology costs (b) lower promotional costs (c) smaller teams.<p>2 -  IPOs are less likely. This results in (a)the lower risk/reward goal of acquisition being set as a target. (b) less capital needed for the IPO process. <i>I've added in point b</i><p>3 - Sellers' Market. (a)VCs' structure dictates investment size & fund size  (as mentioned above) creating a surplus. (b)VCs are competing with acquirors offering a lower risk option. <i>I imagine the current climate dampens these</i><p>I suppose the last point is most debatable. It may be temporary. The VC industry may contract or move away from Software. But if 1 & 2 are correct, this should result in smaller investments, founders cashing out or some combination of these.

There are web-startups that aren't tech centered and there are medium and big companies that solve hard technical problems that startups don't (or can't) encounter.

I think the YouTube channel look can work IF it's matched by a really personal editorial voice, but this site is kind of ""crowdsourced,"" so the design should probably be adjusted for that.<p>Idea: Stackoverflow, but for retail.<p>As others have pointed out, you need to entice people to join in, and I will make a radical suggestion here that will kind of disrupt your entire model:<p>Make it problem-centric, rather than product-centric.<p>As many other other sites have proven, when the ""social object"" is a question, it invites participation.<p>People asking what they should wear to a party, how to get rid of acne... all the same items at play, but just a different paradigm. Kind of like Stackoverflow.com, but for retail stuff.

Further, he may not have the resources to live for six months without a salary.<p>I don't think these are necessarily bad situations, just that your goals seem unrealistically high.<p>To answer your question, I would work for equity if I had an expectation of a market rate salary within a year and a large payout (5-10x yearly salary) within three years.

One of our big financial clients has an automated tool to scrub such data, but then they have social security numbers as well as lots of other juicy financial data. So they're worried about all sorts of stuff that most of us never ponder as a business risk.<p>One of the santizing steps is to replace all passwords with a set value, such as six/seven of a letter (like ""A"") or a number (eg, ""111111""). Another sanitizing step is to scramble names and addresses. Usually the first letter gets preserved, and the rest gets replaced with a hash (say, MD5 it, and then base64 it and truncate it to length, that way it preserves max lengths and typical size of words).<p>example: 
John Doe, 1313 Mockingbird Lane might get munged into
Jiqw Dyh, 1313 Masdfasdfas Lfds<p>We just have username/password/address/phone, so all we do is set all passwords to a default value (all emails, if any, get set to mine), and munge up telephone numbers. Later this year I'll cobble up a better sanitizer.
