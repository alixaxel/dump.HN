How do they fit with your personality or problem space? Which parts seem to add value or prevent mistakes?  Which parts are getting in your way?  Which parts add value some of the time but not if you have to try too hard to follow them?<p>Any idiot can come up with a set of ""rules"" that other people should follow, but there are also plenty of incredibly intelligent, experienced people who have attempted to distill their knowledge for other people in that form.  Dismissing them out of hand and then patting yourself on the back for it (""I'm an awesome programming precisely because I don't follow other people's rules"") is not the way forward.<p>To me, part of being a good programmer is being able to temporarily put aside your existing notions of what's good or bad, what will work and what won't, in order to try out someone else's way of working so that you can truly internalize it and hopefully learn something new.  That applies not just to following simple ""rules"" about how to structure your code, but to trying out new styles of development, new programming paradigms or languages, new toolsets, etc.  All of those require the ability to temporarily suspend your judgment about what works and what doesn't and to just try to do something ""by the book"" for a bit in order to hopefully come out the other side an even better programmer.",1234392988

Did they take more time than the equivalent 15%-35% increase in dev for the TDD teams? Perhaps it was a wash? I don't know.<p>How accurate is to compare the various project teams? It always seems to me that no two projects and no two dev teams are ever the same. How do you account for the differences? The researcher somewhat addresses this but I am not fully convinced:<p>>>""...The projects developed using TDD might have been easier to develop, as there can never be an accurate equal comparison between two projects except in a controlled case study. In our case studies, we alleviated this concern to some degree by the fact that these systems were compared within the same organization (with the same higher-level manager and subculture).Therefore, the complexity of the TDD and non-TDD projects are comparable...""<p>Perhaps more data needs to be collected.",1234390322
