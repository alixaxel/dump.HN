483399,comment,483187,483353,0,0,danteembermage,,,"Maybe there's ground in the middle that looks something like this: VCs have a stronger bargaining position in capital intensive startups than in software. Stronger bargaining leads to more power to direct the returns to their pockets rather than the founders'. So the model is VCs maximize their after-costs (founders and otherwise) rate of return which is likely to be higher in non-software <i>ceteris paribus</i>.<p>However all is not equal, the extraordinary  returns in recent memory have come from the web, and so venture capital firms will likely still be putting their thumb in the pie, even if it means cashing out to founders, letting them be CEO, giving them smaller rounds, etc. for software start-ups.",1234810720

Her take was that the dealers on the street weren't going to stop just because the cops/city government wanted them to, but if you could find a way for them to take the money they made and channel it into legal businesses, most of them would rather do that because they knew what their life expectancy was otherwise.<p>In her words ""they're already businessmen. They know how to make money and talk to people but everybody looks down on them for what they do."" I thought it was a very insightful comment even back then.<p>The thing that drove it home for me was when driving through the projects some years later, I saw a well-dressed (complete with walking stick!) elderly man selling heroin on the street.

483363,comment,482966,482966,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"I completed my BS degree several years ago. I carried a full-time school load and worked full-time. I got 90% of my school work done on the weekends. During the week I was too tired from work to do much more than the absolute minimum required of me for school. Not having a wife and kids helped too--no distractions at home.<p>Different people have different ways of coping. I am a morning person, so it's not difficult for me to get an extra hour in the day by getting up an hour early, but some people can't function like that. If you live in an ""active"" house, you may find it easier to set your alarm for an hour or two after everyone else is asleep, and get up and get some studying in (if your biological clock will let you). I find that four hours sleep is all I require for the short-term, so I could get up and get a little more work done and then get back to sleep. I sometimes do that when I have insomnia anyway--why toss and turn for an hour or two if I can get up and read for a while?<p>First thing to do is a little self-analysis? Are you the kind of person who can get a little bit of work done in various bits and pieces of available time, or do you need a sizeable chunk of time to set aside? Are you better in morning, afternoon, evening, or late night? Do you need as distraction-free a place as possible, or can you put up with household noise while studying? I bought a nature sounds CD set a while back, and putting one of those on while wearing headphones helps me to concentrate. Another thought would be a white noise generator (or pink, brown, etc. type of noise) to help block out distracting noises.<p>I've found that especially when learning something technical (programming language, data networking, etc.) the more different ways that I can approach the subject, the better. Reading is a passive activity and only activates certain parts of the brain. Writing is an active activity and activates different parts of the brain. I'll read a little bit of material, then re-write it in my own words to ""burn"" it into as many different neural pathways as possible. I also create mind-maps, limericks, stories, etc. to create as much mental diversity as possible for remembering the material. It helps.",1234809336

The original business model focused on charging people for a membership, which let them access 3x as many domains as non-members. This was moderately successful, but after some analysis I've decided to focus solely on affiliate revenue. It's not clear that it'll immediately be more profitable, but, it does make it a better service for people looking for domain names...which will hopefully make it more profitable :)<p>Secondly, one of the major complaints about the site was that there was no clear schedule indicating when new domains would be released. With the latest iteration, that has been resolved: Twenty domains are now automatically to the homepage every 20 minutes throughout the day (60 domains/hr or 1440/day). This'll likely change based on how my poor Dreamhost server does...<p>Thank you all for your initial feedback. I hope you enjoy the site.<p>Matt",1234808168

If you don't have kids, and don't have a spouse or partner and at that period of time you're content with it then I say go for it.<p>However, I wouldn't idolize someone who does do that. The true hero is someone who can work for 10 hours a week and get done what the man doing 100 hours a week does.<p>Sadly an addendum to this, as a writer my output is directly correlative to the time put in. However there's a limit to how much I'll actually get done. Sometimes ignoring my writing seems to get more done. I've sat down and written for 6 hours in a row and only been snapped out because I was dying from hunger and I'd drank like 4 sodas and hadn't gone piss. I got more work done in those 6 hours than I normally do in 30 hours.",1234808159

Right now, it's basically vaporware.<p>Even if it were available right now I don't see how it could be a Kindle killer. As far as I can tell it doesn't have an answer for the Kindle's biggest selling point- Amazon integration and Whispernet. This isn't to be underestimated. The Kindle is basically the iPod/iTunes monster of ebook readers and won't be displaced easily.<p>Sure, the Plastic Logic supports a bunch of formats and it's slick looking, but so are the Sony devices. And the Sony readers are available now. This thing isn't bringing anything to the table that isn't offered by either the Kindle or Sony so unless they absolutely kill the competition on price they're going to have a very difficult uphill battle.",1234807576

483311,comment,482257,483202,0,0,Retric,,,"Read up on the government of 1908, it was extremely corrupt.<p>Anyway, Technology is driving most of the social changes you're talking about. Something like 50% of the average persons medical expenses occur in the last year of their life which makes insuring the old extremely costly.  The government pays for ~50% of all medicine in the US and most of it would not exist if a) it where not available and b) people where not living as long.  The world would probably be more wealthy without that drain, but I don't know if it would be better.<p>I expect the government of 1908 was more corrupt than the government of today, people did not have the money to let government take that much off of them. 1908 introduced the Model T, before that  modern roads where pointless in most places.  I think the streetlight best summarizes government involvement, when 1000 people per hour are driving underneath them it's a extremely useful, but they are pointless in the middle of a corn field.  Nobody is going to pay per light to see at night so it's really just a question of government/local groups or nothing.  Saying public infrastructure is best served by private companies seems to miss the poor service they provide.  EX: Cellphone coverage in the US.  So yes taxes are up, but it's not like the money is set on fire we are getting a lot of services from that money.<p>When it comes to social organizations things like MMO guilds and facebook let people be far more social than the average pre car social club.  While face time might be decreasing the average person is far more social today than at any other point in history.  And considering how much more free time people have facetime might also be increasing.<p>Edit: Over the last 100 years the middle class and the wealthy have left city's and have only recently been returning.  Murder statistics among the poor and they have always been high so correlating it with city living is missing the point.  You can look at the murder rate in inner city's or the murder rate among high school dropouts and see the same trends.<p>PS: I think human nature has changed little over time, most social changes are a reaction to increased technology / prosperity and throughout history the rich tended to become fat, self absorbed, and decedent.  The powerful / well connected become corrupt.  And working people get stepped on.",1234807205
