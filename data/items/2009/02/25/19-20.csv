494823,comment,494632,494632,0,0,RobGR,,,"I don't write javascript, because I don't run javascript (with a few exceptions). I associate javascript with crap websites.  It is slow and it causes the browser to use up a lot of memory.  The functionality gained by it is usually pointless fru-fru, the doilies and tailfins of the internet.  I fully realize that to some people those doilies and tailfins are very important, but perhaps I can achieve my business goals by selling things to other people.<p>The notion of writing a program to run on someone's desktop is reasonable; the notion of writing a program to run on my server, but send it's display information out to a browser, is also reasonable.  The idea of having most of a program be on my server, but some random chunks be on the user's computer, seems like a bad split.  I realize that in some cases such as input data validation it can remove a browser-server round trip, and in some cases it might be an over all win; but as a general rule it's a bad idea.<p>There is an idea that you can avoid the load of running everything on your server, but also avoid the problems of writing client programs for all the variations of operating systems, by writing code that runs in some wrapper, usually associated with the browser.  These attempts - flash, java applets, javascript, active X objects, etc - are all bad ideas.<p>I realize that the majority of the population uses javascript enabled browsers.  I didn't ""miss the memo"", I was there when the memo came out: I remember attending free lectures given by Sun Java evangelists when Java was first released, in fact I still have a free coffee mug with ""headstart java"" or something on it around here.  I got excited, did the ""hello world"" app and then a calculator, and then suddenly had to disable java applets to keep the ads from crapping up my browser.  Javascript came after that, then flash, now it looks like Microsoft is pushing this silverlight thing which sounds like v5.0 of the same bad idea.<p>Now, just so I don't totally seem like an old grouch, here's some constructive advice:  write your web app so it's interface is all very standard, very minimal html.  Then, write an iPhone program that does the client-side stuff you think is so great.  If you are still in business after that, take the iPhone app and make it into an OSX desktop program and announce your iPhone app is now available on the desktop.  Presuming your idea is not the friendster or geocities of it's age and already dead, and presuming that people find these client-side features appealing enough to download and install something, then move on to making your desktop client work on other platforms.  Do not take the shortcut of presuming that the browser is an appropriate platform.",1235591173

494805,comment,494730,494730,0,0,socialtistics,,,"It is not unheard of (i.e. DEMO is a good example).  However, comparing this event to DEMO is like comparing apples and oranges.  The visibility of DEMO makes the fee a little less hard to swallow.  The visibility of this event is limited primarily to a particular state.  They would be better off marketing this as a ""conference"" or ""exhibit"" where up to 40 companies can participate and a Top 10 will be selected.  To say it is the Top 40 in Georgia though is a little deceiving and false advertising in my opinion.  For example, what if I am legitimately selected as one of the top 40 and cannot afford to participate (and assuming I do not qualify for a ""scholarship""), does the next company in line take my spot or are only 39 companies exhibiting?  If the next company takes my spot, then you really can't say it is the Top 40 in Georgia, it is more like the Top 39 and a company that could afford to pay.  Yes, I know it clearly states that I will be charged a fee if selected before I apply, but that in itself destroys the notion of a ""Top 40"" since obviously the only 40 companies there are going to be ones that can either afford to pay or qualify for a scholarship.<p>The better option in this case would be to setup something like TechCrunch50 where the top 50 get to present for free, BUT other companies can exhibit for a fee.<p>The bad part about these events being marketed like as a ""Top XXX"" competition is that people generally assume, based on the title of the competition, that if you aren't exhibiting then you are not a ""Top Company"", when in fact you could have been selected but unable to afford the cost of exhibiting.<p>Sadly when events like this are held and marketed this way I think good companies are often overlooked.  My technology may be the next great thing, but will be overlooked because I can't afford the ""entry fee"" to exhibit and be viewed as a ""Top 40"" or possibly a ""Top 10"" in the state.",1235590408

They blew off all the NeXT veterans when they destroyed it as an objective-c development platform, but didn't finish the job of porting it to Java for five years so you ended up working on this platform that feels like a developed-in-isolation mainframe monster. Dev tools looked nice but made you want to slit your wrists from random crashes and other strangeness. There were a couple of periods where they looked like they would kill it which was stressful for people with codebases on it. All efforts at documentation did a very poor job of selling its incredible patterns and features.<p>But everyone I know who stuck at it has done well - many ended up at Apple working on very cool projects. I'd love to read a history of whoever wrote it one day - it was so far ahead of its time - I've got a theory that they had some people on it who had done serious research and practical time on some sort of web-like thin-client platform that pre-dated the web.
