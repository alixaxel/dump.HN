478203,comment,477113,477272,0,0,moe,,,"<i>Twitter is a particularly difficult problem</i><p>Excuse me?  Twitter, at its core, is a large-scale pub/sub system with a bunch of frontends. Such systems are well understood and, frankly, quite trivial as far as the non-existant constraints of the twitter-app are concerned. After all no ordering guarantees or fancy routing are needed and obviously they don't give a damn about fault tolerance or latency either.<p>Their constant failure to keep that thing online just screams incompetency very loudly...<p>There are plenty of mature building blocks available in the OSS world to implement such a system. RabbitMQ and the spread toolkit come to mind.<p>Or, if you have the dough, you could buy a shrinkwrapped solution from TIBCO, Solace or the like. The latter will even come with fancy functionality and availability guarantees in writing because those are normally deployed in ""mission critical"" industrial systems, such as logistics, banks, stock exchanges.<p>Now, twitter is not SWIFT and doesn't need five nines of uptime.
But saying that this is a ""particularly difficult problem"" is, sorry, ridiculous.",1234425228

478184,comment,478086,478086,0,0,patio11,,,"Few experiences of my life were as frustrating as the times when part of my brain was on the fritz and I possessed enough introspection to say ""This behavior is not normal!"" but wasn't capable of correcting it.<p>Example: Back in high school I once got severely ill with drug-resistant something-or-other and got put through the ringer for a month, eventually getting moved on and off four different antibiotics, including two which included the side-effect ""mildly psychotropic"".<p>I was a very quiet guy in high school.  Bit of an introvert -- had some close friends, kept my emotions in check, generally did not run through the hallways singing Christmas carols at the top of my lungs.  Except there were presents out for Give-a-thon and presents mean Christmas and Christmas means I'M SO HAPPY hey that was loud DECK THE HALLS.<p>After running a the length of a football field to biology I burst in the door and saw a rather pretty female classmate who I had, perhaps, spoken two words to in four years.  She said ""Oh, Patrick, nice to see you back in school.""  ""ITS GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO KATIE.  <i>tackle hug</i>  THIS IS NOT LIKE ME AT ALL IS IT.""<p>It felt... I don't even know how to describe it.  Like my normally tightly-functioning sense of self-control was on, operating, and evaluating things perfectly normally and I was appalled with my own behavior and yet that was totally unconnected to <i>me</i> at the same time.<p>I also had another incident in middle school where I had full control of my faculties but <i>could not stop laughing</i> for about an hour during a history lecture.  This was despite the fact that it was disturbing the Civil War re-enactors who were explaining, e.g., that gangrene smells like nutmeg.  (That set off a gale even though I thought ""thats not funny"" and moreover ""that is monstrous to laugh at"".)  I excused myself to the bathroom and spent the better part of an hour with my brain terrified to go back to class for fear of what I would do and the rest of me laughing at the patterns cracks made on the toilet walls.<p>And then a switch flipped and I was me again.",1234423357

The fact is, an entire generation of hackers got their start through tinkering on a gaming console in their pre-teen years.<p>I think you're just so out of touch with how a 10-year-old learns that you can't comprehend what the article is addressing. A kid that age doesn't pick up programming the same way that a person in their 20's does. He's still mastering reading, figuring out the fundamentals of his operating system, and making real-world analogies for objects on his computer that you might already have at 24. He doesn't understand what an algorithm is, he doesn't even really know what a programming language does or what role it plays. He doesn't know algebra.<p>Most kids are not scholarly. They don't seek out information and work through tutorials. They're never going to hear about alice/scratch/squeak/LÖVE. They stumble upon things and their curiosity drives them, but their attention span is relatively small. They do things because they're fun and not because they want to learn.<p>When you began programming you probably read books and tutorials, followed-up on documentation, and relied heavily on examples. Learning through your teenage years is evolutionary. It's almost all trial-and-error at that stage.
