A few thoughts:
* Can you run a short distance without collapsing?
* If you're helping a buddy move furniture - are you able to take the heavy end?
* If the lift goes out - can you walk up a few flights of stairs without too much effort?
* Can you play backyard sport well?<p>Not everyone wants to be a bodybuilder, and you're probably better off than a lot of overweight hackers, but there's something to be said for being fit.<p>Or for the opposing view, see Linus (<a href=""http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/11/healthy-lifestyle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2008/11/healthy-lifestyl...</a>):

I suspect you don't, so let me help illuminate where your argument goes wrong.<p><i>""Higher tax rates for the upper brackets don't lead to less taxes paid by the poor - they lead to more taxes paid by the poor.""</i><p>You're confusing correlation (or, perhaps more accurately in this case, coincidence) with causation here.  You correctly point out that ""the fraction of tax revenue paid by the richest 1, 5, and 10% are much higher now than they were when the top tax rates were higher"", but this obviously can only be the case because the income gap has widened.  Despite paying lower marginal rates than they have through much of recent history, the richest 1, 5 and 10% of Americans now make so much compared to the other 90% of Americans that they still account for a larger share of revenue.  If the income gap had remained stable or shrunk, the opposite would be the case.  Now don't get me wrong... I'm certainly not anti-income gap and I have no agenda around redistributing wealth.  I'm simply explaining why your statement is dead wrong.<p>What I do have an agenda around is making the tax burden distributed in the way that is best for society (and, thereby, individuals within that society, including myself).  I feel that this involves heavily graduated taxation, despite the fact that I'm in that uppermost bracket.  I'm not being selfish and looking for a handout and I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with making obscene amounts of money... I simply feel its better for society to impose higher taxes on those who can more easily afford it.  Warren Buffett (and countless others) agree with me.  You obviously don't, but that's no excuse to twist facts to support your agenda.",1233711522

I love the atmosphere and $4 drinks'.<p>I know HN karma isn't important as we make it out to be but I feel pretty good that I was able to reach and communicate what I feel is something important but not essential for some, not all situations.<p>> Many more people are hurt or killed out of an outburst of raw emotion than are out of an outburst of rationality.<p>This is true. Situations can escalate to life threatening in a matter of moments. Remember the LA highway shootings in the 90s? Trained telemarketers and customer service representatives are taught never to escalate their voice, remain calm - let the customer vent. Even the most logical person can revert to sheer illogicalness in the heat of the moment. I recall many arguments with my dad that started with something simple like not pulling into the center of the intersection at a traffic light for a left turn and went to heated words/tension, ending with him googling up the official state driver's manual (for the last word, on it).<p>> I can't help but feel that you are blaming the people who are less emotionally driven for the distance and disharmony in society.<p>I'm a very strong ISTJ. I try to learn more about relationship 'technology' because I get tripped up on simple social pleasantries. For example, I was at the bus stop the other day and the guy who I've seen there before was asking if I bought my monthly transit pass yet. Since it wasn't the end of the month yet or even end of the week (at that time), I was puzzled. I told him that and added that I don't have to buy it just yet. He was just trying to make small talk! I tried to apologize later but he was like 'that's done.

That's why I love niche communities like HN.<p>I can go to a bar and just people watch. I don't understand why people like to go to movies in large groups - you're not talking during the movie. Protection in numbers? Even with my friends, I can be a wallflower's wallflower, even though I want to be the opposite. The few times I've talked to everyone at a party (sun and moon aligned and brain/self-consciousness disabled) - I've had the best nights ever. Usually, when I go to a party, I don't talk/mingle and wonder if it was a net loss (e.g. if I didn't go to the event and stayed home, would I have felt better and the people there, been better off). I don't know if I have a goal for all my relationships - I tend to bounce around various niche groups (salsa dancing, improv comedy, hackers, entrepreneurs) so I don't get bored. I think the goal for 2009 if I had one (I hate the thought of New Year's Resolutions) - is to <i>initiate</i> more relationships. Commit. Be accepting.<p>Thank you for your feedback.

But I think it actually does matter whose fault it is to a certain extent though, only becuase people seem to be so quick to jump on the W3C while they give other organisations who sat on a crippled browser for years before Firefox freaked them out enough to get moving again, a comparitively free pass. I agree that moving forward, it really doesn't matter, but for the sake of historical accuracy, yeah it does.<p>Your argument appears to be that you are unwilling to make use (or at least very much use) of CSS due to the lack of support from IE and that you cannot sufficiently support IE6 with CSS.<p>I have been making sites with pure CSS that support IE6 for years. For sure it would be easier if IE supported display: table, but it's absolutely possible <i>right now</i>.<p>Your initial quip implies that it is not possible right now and this is incorrect. If you wish not to implement a pure CSS layout due to not having the time, knowledge or inclination, that's your choice to make with your projects. But understand that this is all that holds you back.<p>Incidentally, 38% is a pretty low IE6 stat, I envy you... If any of the sites I support hit that mark, I would seriously start thinking about dropping support for IE6 on that site all together, or at least looking at graceful degredation/progressive enhancement possibilities.",1233710199

The internet can't compete with real life in surrounding you with competent and experienced people.

Hiding a query string isn't ""privacy"" in any meaningful sense. It's beneficial for you to tell a webmaster what it is that you have come looking for.<p>I'm in two minds about the issue though. Google don't have a contract to supply the searchterm on outgoing links (via the referrer or otherwise) but for many applications it was a pretty useful thing for them to do. Arguably their only resource there is a single search page which is dynamic depending on your query string - to me this says ?q=searchterm is the semantic way to represent it, but hey it's their application so they can ""design"" it however they want. On the other hand, urls are about as explicit as you can get on the web and google's are more publicised than most. Changing your public API is asking for trouble.",1233709785

I'm assuming they still get false positives; do they know of any traits/behaviors that seem to go either way, and ways to gauge which way those traits are more likely to tend?<p>* On the same thought as the previous question, do they think their 25 year old selves would've made the right instinctual call in recent encounters they've had? I ask because of the possibility of a hindsight bias. It seems possible that along with learning to trust their instinct more, they've had more data to train their instinct.",1233709690
