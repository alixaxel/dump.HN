IMO, it's going to be hard to teach to this test and next years test without covering the subject in some detail.  Also by inspiring students to really enjoy the subject you will improve their long term performance.  Basically take 30 students at 50% up to 55%, that's great, and if they keep getting 55 percentile for the next 5 years you probably did a great job.<p>PS: Students at the edges students will tend to regress to the mean, so you can still measure performance on a class that scored 95% last year.",1233597531

462584,comment,460555,462540,0,0,redrobot5050,,,">We're not seeing new antibiotics.
Feel free to explain why Viagra is more profitable than a new antibiotic.<p>Because of the same market forces you're arguing for. 
And we are seeing new antibiotics. SARS, for example, didn't kill everyone. Although as a side-effect, the drug used to treat SARS killed all their living bone marrow.<p>So developing a curative anti-biotic that germs aren't already resistant to, that doesn't box liver/kidneys/bone endocytes is a largely complex, potentially intractable problem.<p>The two new techniques we're seeing is RNAi ""wipes"" to prevent transmission of the Herpes Simplex Virus (a potentially new anti-viral drug -- and a technique to develop more anti-viral drugs), and studying Alligator Blood. Alligator's ""White Blood Cells"" are extremely powerful, and we may be able to synthesize proteins that are safe for humans, and yet equally powerful.<p>So yes, new antibiotics are here, or they're coming. They just don't warrant commercials because you're not going out to ask your doctor about the new antibiotic the same way you're going to ask about Viagra. You could argue that ""nothing new is happening with battery technology? Where are all the new battery technologies?"" You'd be right (nothing new worth marketing about) but you'd also be wrong (plenty of incremental improvements over the last 20 years that've dramatically changed battery performance.)<p>>Their growth was stunted by govt action because they weren't meeting their ""lend to folks who can't pay back"" quota.<p>Again, wrong. BB&T's CEO has stated they didn't join in the Bubble for reasons other than government regulation. Their growth was stunted in the sense that you were getting a sensible 6% return instead of the 9% you'd get with BoA or Citi. Except now your investment is still around, your competitors isn't. Its one of those ""When I'm excluded from the bubble I'm losing money, but now that its over I'm raking it in"" things that just happens. Its also what fuels bubbles: If your competitor is shortchanging his customers, but delivering superior returns, your customers will seek him out. So you can lose business, or your engage in short term, unsustainable thinking just like everyone else. They choose the former.<p>>Huh? Somewhere north of $2 Trillion is being pissed away because of govt regulatory failures and you think that my money is safe?<p>Again, Investment Banks != Deposit Account Banks. If you were investing in a mutual fund, there was risk. That's what you were trading higher returns for -- the risk you might lose money. If you simply dumped your money in a depository account -- something FDIC and 0% risk, then no, you couldn't have lost money. Nobody has.<p>And again, that's one of the reason why depository banks have been incredibly stable since the last great depression: They can survive bank runs, and even if they become insolvent, the government has $44 million of insurance money to ensure you get your money back with little hassle.<p>Again, after reading the URL you gave me, I think you're babbling non-sense. Yes, I get the point: The CRA allows the bank to lend to people who otherwise couldn't get loans. But the claim ""Wells Fargo took a huge hit when it stayed out of the subprime mortgages. Regulators refused to let WF enage in unrelated activities (acquisitions, opening branches, etc.)because WF didn't ""play ball"", activities that said regulators let cooperative institutions do."" is <i>NOT</i> substantiated by the article you linked.

462575,comment,462229,462493,0,0,socialtistics,,,"PR companies can charge anywhere from a couple hundred to thousands of dollars.  It all depends on what you are looking for and the services you require.  If you just want a simple press release and it distributed to the major wires you are looking at a few hundred (the wire services charge a fee based on the length or number of words in your release).  Contrary to popular belief you do not need a PR company to get your press release on the wires.  Where a PR company can be helpful with press releases is to get major reporters to cover your story.  They do this typically through preestablished connections with those reporters.<p>While press releases are not the only service PR companies offer they are a good part of it.  Many PR companies offer additional services such as website review (functionality & design), copy editing for your website, media training, and help with your overall marketing efforts.<p>As I said before costs can range from a few hundred to several thousand, but most PR companies will want you to engage them with a monthly retainer.  The retainers for reputable firms can run from $10-20K a month.<p>For startups I would highly recommend against engaging a PR company.  Everything you will need as a startup you can do yourself or by hiring a college student to handle for you.  Your main concerns in a startup environment typically will be to make sure your website makes sense and is clear, building connections with bloggers who have an interest in your space, and utilizing those connections to get the word out.  The wire services are a waste of time really.  Your story is not going to make it in the NY Times are Washington Post by releasing a press release on the wires.",1233596515

462573,comment,461720,462494,0,0,jganetsk,,,"That the amount of debt in the world grows unchecked.<p>The video did not do a great job of explaining what happens when debt is repaid. Let's say that the amount of bank-created money is defined as the total amount of money in everyone's account, minus the total amount in the bank's vaults. When one makes a payment on a loan, the payment is always part interest and part principal. The latter is dropped into the vault, and does not appear in anyone's account. So, this actually constitutes a removal of bank-created money from the system. The interest becomes revenue for the bank; the bank is a business and it should make money just like any other business. That revenue is used to pay the bank's operating expenses, dividends to the shareholders, and interest to all the depositors. So, it's not constantly accumulating in the hands of a wealthy few.<p>And that brings up another important point that the video neglected to mention. Debt may increase exponentially, but so do savings.<p>The other important detail left out is that payments are made with government-created money. Banks cannot print paper money... only the government. So the money in your wallet was not created by the bank. When your ATM served that money, the bank had to provide real cash. When you write a check, the bank has to transfer real money (entries on the Fed reserve's books) to the other bank. However, there are systems in place to reduce the amount of government-created money necessary (intra-bank transfers don't require any at all... inter-bank transfers are aggregated and canceled out where possible). So, the payments you make paying off your mortgage happen with government-created money, and do decrease the total amount of money and debt in the system.",1233596450

I've been trying to move parts of my agencies' infrastructure to the Cloud for some time so let me dispel a few myths.<p>(For the record, contrary to this article's title the bottleneck for me has been management all the way)<p>Cloud Computing is not easy: The person below who claims you can get a cloud application up in a week has clearly never tried to put a mission critical cloud application up at all.  Managing virtual servers can be as hard if not harder than actual servers in many cases because you have to automatically track a bunch of items that would normally be static (is the server active, does it have an ip, if so what is that ip, if not you need to assign an ip and then automatically track that ip, etc...)<p>The Cloud is not necessarily standardized: The above example looks at environments such as Amazon which are hard to maintain because of all the virtual up and down happening.  The other end of the spectrum would be services like Microsoft Azure.  Azure is easy to use but it's a platform that has to be written to.  You write an application in Azure and you have to rewrite significant parts of it to take it somewhere else.<p>The Cloud is not always cost efficient: The Cloud is only cost efficient up to the point where you can afford to fill a server person's time.  Once that happens having a full time server person becomes more cost effective.<p>Management IS NOT going to be the one pushing this: The article claims IT should adopt Cloud Computing or Management will.

Out of seasoned hickory he fashioned them, with the help of a draw shave, a chisel, and a supply of sandpaper. Carefully was each handle weighed and balanced. No two of them were alike. The curve must exactly fit the hand and must conform to the grain of the wood. From dawn until dark the old man laboured. His average product was eight handles a week, for which he received a dollar and a half each. And often some of these were unsaleable--because the balance was not true.<p>To-day you can buy a better axe handle, made by machinery, for a few cents. And you need not worry about the balance. They are all alike--and every one is perfect. Modern methods applied in a big way have not only brought the cost of axe handles down to a fraction of their former cost--but they have immensely improved the product.</i><p>Like the machine-made, to the artisan-made, axe handle, recorded music is vastly superior to live music - especially given today's digital recording and distribution systems. Leveraging mass distribution, a musician today can afford the luxury of honing a fine product. A live performance is rarely a fine product. It is usually middling in quality, and often below middling. It is usually expensive.
