477476,comment,477173,477173,0,0,cchooper,,,"> Wouldn’t having functions be first class citizens be locking them in the same cage with data structures as well?<p>An important difference between first-class functions and objects is that first-class functions are still <i>functions.</i> Closures are also functions, even though they merge data and code together just like objects do. But objects merge data and functions to form something that's neither data nor a function.<p>This, I think, is a shame. Data and functions are the most important abstractions in computer science. Objects not so much. If you aren't simulating something, then there's no natural ontology that you want to model with objects. By comparison almost <i>every</i> system needs to process data. The data about an object is not itself an object, and it doesn't help matters to conceive of it as an object.",1234382087

477474,comment,477177,477177,0,0,MaysonL,,,"The difference between the hacker style and the Dijkstra style is more apparent than real. Both rely on successive approximation.<p>See for example <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EW...</a> where Dijkstra goes, in painstaking detail, through the process of solving the ""8 Queens"" problem, building up the solution piece by piece.<p>A hacker would probably come up with exactly the same algorithm, though probably written more quickly in another language, and with a few more compile/run/debug cycles.<p>The thing is: the mode of attack - breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems, solving one at a time, and in such a way that you're pretty sure that each step is correct - is used by both successfully. It reminds me of a study I read many years ago in Gerald Weinberg's <i>Psychology of Computer Programming</i>. The investigators studied the work patterns of many good programmers, and one of the variables they studied was number of runs per day (this was back in the day when one submitted ones program as a deck of punched cards to be compiled and (possibly) executed. They found that the good programmers tended to divide into two groups. The first (more akin to Dijkstra) mostly submitted a program which compiled cleanly, and executed, followed a significant time later by another. The second group submitted a program, got either compilation or runtime errors, quickly submitted a fixed version, perhaps iterating a few times, then went off for a while till they went through the quick cycle again. The point is: each group consisted of equally good (as far as could be measured) programmers. Both styles are usable, both styles are necessary to have in your arsenal: you need to be able to think through a problem, and prove your solution correct; and you need to be able to tackle it piecemeal and experimentally when it's too tough to tackle all at once.",1234381992

Games these days have crazy production values (GTA IV took 3.5 years, 1000 people and $100 million budget).<p>I know, there are also some very good indie games, but you have to be very creative to be able to compensate for a lack of production values. Not everybody is so multitalented.<p>One possible solution is to get into programming by modding existing games (instead of starting from scratch). Many cool games have very good scripting engines (for example Unreal, Civilization or Half-Life).<p>If you mod an existing game, your work is incremental, you can play with all these expensively produced assets.

Microsoft has probably spent about half its current market capitalization on MSR (very rough estimate based on its budget for the last few years: 7-8 billion, and the fact that it has existed for 18 years.

Well there is ""one"", but it sounds stilted. Some authors alternate between he and she,  I sometimes use s/he.  But s/him, s/his?  In informal writing, I find myself using ""you"" a lot.  Others are trying the plural for the singular. It sounds uneducated, but I bet it's the one that will take.",1234378963

By taking on a project without approval you are basically putting your job on the line.  If your manager approved the project, he would be on the line.  Unless he really believes in the idea, it's unlikely he will do that.  Better to wait and see how you do and then pile on once success seems more assured.  You will find the same thing with investors -- noone wants to give you money until you are already successful.",1234378827
