479755,comment,479689,479744,0,0,davidw,,,"So the way to figure out whether that means anything at a large enough scale to matter, is to look at how many angels might invest how much money.  I honestly have no idea, but here are some random numbers:<p>10,000 investors invest 10,000 dollars each is 100 million dollars.  You could vary that to 1,000 investors doing 100,000 of investment each.  1,000 investors each doing a million dollars would be 1 billion dollars.  What relationship do those random numbers bear to reality?  Has YC even spent a million dollars on all the companies involved?  And there are several people investing in YC, so I think it probably comes out to less than a million a head, and they've been doing this for a while now.<p>The real impact of startups is not likely going to be in hiring in any case, but still, it's worth looking at some numbers to get an idea of the order of magnitude that we're talking about.",1234526258

Perhaps they have independently verified what you have to say, or otherwise arrived at the same conclusions, and agree with you because of that.  The problem is the 'information cascade' when more people start agreeing with you just because ""all those other people do too"".",1234525959

I don't think the intro text ""your life in pictures"" explains it well enough, but if people see even just a 5 frame  animation they'll immediately recognize the concept.\nIn fact, I'd stick the picture taking app on the front page and allow them to take a first snapshot before even signing up. Having the first picture there would provide a great incentive to follow through with the sign-up.<p>Also, if I may, and I know from experience it's harder than it sounds: It seems your concept got way more complex over time, when you really should have launched the simplest possible version as fast as possible and worried about widgets, following, minifeeds, comments, a proper logo etc. later on.

Converting between the relational and OO models of data is a time-consuming pain. If this is widely realized, it could give FP a boost.<p>>> Is the Relational Database Doomed?<p>Ah, linkbait! Sorry, no sale. Using a (pre-compiled) stored procedure to do a key value lookup will likely be about as fast as a lookup in a key/value DB. In any case, it's easier to add a key/value lookup capability to an RDBMS than it is to add efficient query capabilities to a KVDB.<p>The article focuses on scaling, which is rarely an issue. KVDBs win on simplicity and flexibility (no need to pre-define a data model) and a better impedance match with OOPLs. RDBMSs crush on querying, which most (though not all) applications need.",1234523796

Doesn't the WHAT have to be the same in both cases to be able to say which is more or less?<p>Perhaps before we talk about being more or less productive we need to identify what it is that we are producing. We should make sure its real, meaningful, and relevant to our purpose and that we are all talking about the same thing. Then finally, we must measure something that can't be easily inflated or faked. Only then can we talk about more or less comparisons and be saying something other than words without real meaning.<p>As I see it we have two questions to answer:<p>What is it that we are actually producing when we write software?<p>How can we reliably measure it?<p>We don't have good answers for either.
