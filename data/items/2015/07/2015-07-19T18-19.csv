9912358,comment,9912016,9912016,0,0,blincoln,,,"Back when I was a systems engineer, I built a couple of systems that come as close as I&#x27;m ever likely to see to zero-maintenance.<p>One of them is a piece of automation that looks for Active Directory accounts that are &quot;inactive&quot; based on a variety of criteria (including correlation with data not stored in AD). If they&#x27;re considered &quot;inactive&quot;, then they&#x27;re disabled and their description is updated to indicate when they were disabled and why.<p>I originally wrote it as a 6-12 month stopgap until it was replaced by a fancy commercial account lifecycle product. I believe it&#x27;s now 7 years later and it&#x27;s still in use by the team I used to be on when I wrote it.<p>This may sound like a relatively simple task, but it actually wasn&#x27;t, which is why (IMO) almost no one ever succeeds in building low/zero-maintenance systems.
Some of the challenges I ran into:<p>- Some users only use their accounts in ways that don&#x27;t update the last logon timestamp in Active Directory. I can&#x27;t remember all of the specifics offhand, but one was that at the time, there were still BlackBerry users, and if they only ever used their AD account for email, and only read email on their BlackBerry, the timestamp wouldn&#x27;t be updated, so the automation had to query the BES database to look at their last usage their too and use the most recent of that vs. AD. I think there were 3-4 things like this, and the automation used the most recent of them all.<p>- Employees go on maternity and military leave, and disabling/deleting their account would make for them being really unhappy when they got back. So the automation also has to check the HR system to see if their record is flagged as being on some sort of extended leave.<p>- The government requirement that spurred the development of the automation only applies to accounts for people. There are plenty of service accounts that log on infrequently enough that they would be disabled, so the automation also has to differentiate between those accounts and accounts that represent people.<p>In addition to the basic functionality, I also felt that it had to have significant safety features in place, because if something goes wrong and <i>all</i> accounts get disabled, then no one can log on to fix the problem. Among some of the other safety features:<p>- With each iteration, the automation calculates how many accounts will be disabled during the next iteration as well. If that number exceeds one threshold, warning emails are sent to the account administration team. If it exceeds a larger threshold, it will refuse to operate altogether.<p>- If no information was obtained from one of the data sources that it uses (e.g. a database was moved to a different server and the connection string wasn&#x27;t updated in the account automation config), it will refuse to operate and generate warning emails.<p>- I don&#x27;t remember the details, but there are special conditions for things like &quot;too much time elapsed between iterations&quot; and &quot;the last iteration took place after the current iteration&quot; to catch edge cases where there are problems with time synchronization.<p>I was able to build the automation in a way that made maintenance as close to zero as possible. In the ~7 years it&#x27;s been running, AFAIK the only thing that&#x27;s needed to be changed were the thresholds for number of accounts disabled in a single iteration, because the company expanded its use of AD and suddenly it became normal to operate against a thousand or more accounts at once instead of e.g. 200. A database connection string might have been updated when a DB got moved to another server as well.<p>Anyway, trying to predict all of the things that can go wrong even for such a simple system turned out to be a <i>lot</i> of work. My experience is that it gets dramatically worse as the system itself becomes more complicated (e.g. complicated enough to be a commercial product as opposed to an engineering maintenance task). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really practical to do it with significantly more complex systems - modern computing involves too many changing variables.<p>For an analogy, consider trying to build a zero-maintenance system that waters and fertilizes a garden in a way that keeps the plants healthy. It wouldn&#x27;t be <i>that</i> hard to build one that would handle the current garden. Imagine trying to build one that would handle literally any plant that someone could put in the garden. It&#x27;s not <i>impossible</i>, but you&#x27;d need all kinds of wacky sensors and logic to figure out what each plant was and how frequently to water/fertilize it. It&#x27;s much easier and less error-prone to just require that the gardener update a table that lists what types of plant are in which part of the grid, and <i>maybe</i> generate an alert if something changes that indicates that the table may no longer be up to date.",1437332048

9912352,comment,9912016,9912016,0,0,_pdp_,,,"I think I should have been a bit more clear but I also like that the question was a bit vague because there is a lot of interesting comments highlighting things I never thought about it.<p>I believe that software engineers failed in some ways because we always factor the maintenance as part of the development cost. In other words, we assume that we have to maintain a system once it is built. It is even more relevant with web applications which give the impression that they are in a constant flux. I don&#x27;t buy the idea that web apps needs to adopt because standards don&#x27;t move that fast and almost all browser are backwards compatible with sites that were developed in the 80s. I don&#x27;t know what is behind HN but its simplistic, non-fluid interface hasn&#x27;t been changed (I don&#x27;t know actually) since it was made which for me shows that it is possible to make something useful without the need to constantly change. There are many example like that.<p>I also like the analogy that some of you wrote about physical systems. Indeed, there are physical systems that hasn&#x27;t been changed for years and they still work. There is also a lot of software systems, mainly SCADA stuff, that are also designed never to be changed. Not long ago I heard a story about a pentest on a SCADA system that was controlling a dam. Despite that the pentest found a bunch of vulnerabilities, it was not possible to change the system because its author was dead long ago. The dam operated just fine even with the vulnerabilities in its software.<p>Another point I wanted to bing about is about defining time and version constrains. Back in the days software was not continues. In other words you get Doom 1. Doom 2 is a different story. Therefore, Doom 1 source code can go free. I would say that Doom was very much low to zero maintenance system, albeit a software one. Bugs were part of the character of the software. Hacking the software through its bugs was as close as it get to magic in the digital world. As we get more connected we require to maintain the software.<p>These are just a few things that came to my mind. I will add more thoughts as I go over your comments.",1437332000

In the essay, the illustrations of the &quot;difficulties being rich&quot; were really this flimsy straw man meant to show that the difficulties are actually huge benefits.<p>So, in a way it is a humblebrag, in that the &quot;difficulties&quot; are really &quot;benefits&quot;, though I don&#x27;t think the reader is meant to believe that the author is really having a very hard time with the &quot;difficulties.&quot; You get the feeling that the author is very pleased with himself about his choice to travel, based on the whole theme of the article being &quot;it&#x27;s so good you can&#x27;t stop and nothing else will ever be good enough.&quot;<p>If we are really supposed to empathize with the author about his troubles and the article is meant to be serious, than it&#x27;s a very bizarre post and I basically share your sentiments.

More cones generally means fewer rods, which means poorer night vision.  You can see this for yourself at night, because cones are concentrated at the center of the field of vision and rods are more common at the periphery.  A common trick in astronomy is to look next to a star rather than directly at a star, it is not too hard to find stars which are invisible when you look at them directly but which become visible when you look to the side.  Various nocturnal and deep sea creatures also feature a number of different adaptations, such as the tapetum lucidum (which reflects light to pass through the retina a second time) and special inverted rods which increase light sensitivity.  These structures come with their own various tradeoffs.  For example, the tapetum lucidum reduces image sharpness.<p>In spite of this, humans have very good eyes, with a balance of good low-light vision, good color vision, and good image sharpness.

There certainly are systems that require very low levels of maintenance. I have a friend who built a program in Erlang that is still running, 10 years later. (I don&#x27;t mean that <i>the code</i> is still in production. I mean that <i>the program itself</i> is still running.) Of course, Erlang allows the definition of &quot;a program&quot; to span multiple machines, and we&#x27;re debating terminology here...<p>Pay-as-you-go maintenance is best. Don&#x27;t allow technical debt if you can help it, push back against The Business on deadlines, certainly don&#x27;t allow that micromanagement under the name of &quot;Scrum&quot; to get in or else you&#x27;re just fucked when it comes to quality because you&#x27;ll get a fuck-quality-I-need-to-complete-story-points culture, and create a culture of doing things right the first time.<p>Not that you&#x27;ll necessarily use them, but learn a few things about strong statically typed languages like Haskell or Ocaml (Java doesn&#x27;t count; that&#x27;s shitty static typing). One of the great things about Haskell is that it allows safe refactoring. You&#x27;re not holding your breath every time you change the code, because the compiler will usually tell you where your change broke things, and you can just go in a fix them. It is possible to write highly reliable software in dynamically typed languages (such as Erlang, mentioned above) and I don&#x27;t mean to denigrate those tools at all, but it&#x27;s a bit harder, especially when you&#x27;re fairly new to programming, to do so.<p>Finally, once your system reaches a certain size, you will need tests no matter how good your type system is. They start to become an obvious win around a thousand lines of code. Consider generative testing (e.g. QuickCheck) rather than hand-written tests if you can.",1437331115

The truth that an individual knows inside of the themselves can only talk about themselves, it can not describe how another individual feels about their own self awareness.<p>People may share empathy between similar feelings, but this does not mean that one person should try to project their way of having emotions onto another person, as if there is a &#x27;right&#x27; way to have emotions and a &#x27;wrong&#x27; way to have emotions.

Allow me to explain.<p>A sun-dial, requires little maintenance after it has been set up. Cleaning off the bird feces and the leaves is all. It is not &quot;zero&quot; maintenance though. A trail duck is just a pile of rocks, and in the absence of getting knocked over requires no maintenance, but may require repair from time to time. A spacecraft on a mission to Pluto might require a software change or a course correction, but its hardware is not changed once it launches. A humming bird feeder sits on my porch and provides sugar water to birds in the neighborhood, when it runs out I pour in more.<p>So there are three things people often lump under the general heading of maintenance:<p>Repair - making something work after breaking.<p>Resupply - replacing consumable supplies, cleaning, and adjusting<p>Renew - giving something new capabilities or changing its operation by replacing parts or software<p>If you&#x27;re being pedantic about the term, there is no such thing as &#x27;zero maintenance&#x27; if you want a system to remain stable. Entropy is a thing.<p>So perhaps the more crisp question is, are people working on systems with really low maintenance requirements? Where &quot;low&quot; can be defined as hours of maintenance vs hours of operation or skill level of maintainers vs skill level of the builders, etc. Sure there are some really famous ones like the clock of the Long Now. Every museum in the world with interactive exhibits tries to design systems that will run with very little maintenance for a long time.

Modern SQL databases remain general supersets in terms of functionality, but the value of NoSQL is tuning features for data structured outside the relational model. It&#x27;s by no means a generic tool, nor necessarily innovative, as you portray it.<p>AJAX everywhere has been going on for quite a while. It&#x27;s not necessarily relevant for all web-based CRUD and no, it&#x27;s not expected universally. The boring truth is that most web apps are still best suited to standard server-side pages with more dynamic content sinks for certain parts of the app (though there&#x27;s been a concerted effort to redefine &quot;web app&quot; as SPA). HTTP is a dumb file server, at the end of the day. Rest is very flimsy client magic.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s nothing special about Slack. It&#x27;s successful.
