9869312,comment,9866755,9869132,0,0,growupkids,,,"Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something.  How would you know if someone is an excellent censor (I.e. They only censor &quot;bad&quot; speech, and not &quot;good&quot; speech) if then intent is to shield you from the &quot;bad&quot; speech.  Wouldn&#x27;t you then not know what they censored?<p>Specifically, it seems to me that if you&#x27;re shielded from seeing that they censored, then they could also be censoring &quot;good&quot; speech too.  So the only way it seems you could ensure they weren&#x27;t do this poorly or deliberately would be to allow everyone access to what they&#x27;ve censored.  Which inversely seems to defeat the purpose of having a good censor.  Now essentially nothing in censored.<p>Again, perhaps I&#x27;m missing something but if I&#x27;m not then I don&#x27;t understand how you resolve this conundrum.<p>Edit: Unless you&#x27;re referring to ex post facto censorship, where everyone sees the &quot;bad&quot; speech, and the speaker is banned for violating &quot;community standards&quot; To pre-emptively ban future speech.  But this too still allows &quot;bad&quot; speech, and I suppose you also have the problem of deleting the bad speech.  If it&#x27;s gone, then what substantiates the ban/censorship?  Because again, what if the action was either done in error, or maliciously to ban &quot;good&quot; but unpopular speech/speakers how would you know?",1436612139

9869307,comment,9867465,9869178,0,0,IngoBlechschmid,,,"You are right that for a particular formula p, the implication (~p ∨ p) ⇒ (¬¬p ⇔ p) is an intuitionistic tautology and that the reverse implication is not (in general).<p>However the situation is different when you quantify over all formulas. If you have (¬¬p ⇔ p) for _any_ formula p, you also have (~q ∨ q) for any formula q (written with a different letter to not get lost in variable capturing issues).<p>This is because, for any formula q, we have the intuitionistic tautology ~~(~q v q). (Proving this is a fun exercise. If you get stuck, see page 26 of <a href=""https://github.com/iblech/talk-constructive-mathematics/raw/master/negneg-translation-notes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iblech/talk-constructive-mathematics/raw/...</a> or elsewhere on the Internet.) So, if you assume the principle of double negation for all formulas, then in particular you assume that, for any formula q, the implication ~~(~q v q) ⇒ (~q v q) holds. Since the antecedent is unconditionally valid, the consequent is as well. Thus you have the law of excluded middle for q.<p>I highly recommend Andrej Bauer&#x27;s blog for such matters.

9869290,comment,9866755,9868819,0,0,intopieces,,,">On a side note, I dislike the term &quot;women&#x27;s rights&quot;. Is it so hard to represent &quot;people&#x27;s rights&quot;?<p>I want to pull this quote out and address it directly, because it&#x27;s a valid concern with a real answer. The reason we don&#x27;t represent &quot;people&#x27;s rights&quot; is because all people do not need their rights defended. To use an analogy, think of our system for measuring the level of endangered for animals, from &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; to &quot;Least Concern.&quot; Is it sensible to say, &#x27;Well, aren&#x27;t all species important to the ecosystem? Why do we seek to protect Garrulax courtoisi but not Megascops watsonii?&#x27; This is because the former is nearly extinct, while the latter is ubiquitous. The cause of &quot;social justice&quot; -- the oft-derided &#x27;warriors&#x27; of anti-sexism, anti-homophobia, etc -- is to correct years of disadvantage. It&#x27;s not accurate to call, say, attempts to further women in technology as &#x27;sexist&#x27;. In fact, that&#x27;s co-opting the term to obfuscate the original issue.<p>Overall, your heart is in the right place -- it does seem like our attempts to further minorities comes off as patronizing (like affirmative action). But, in the end, the good that is done outweighs the bad so long as we adequately train the individuals we put forward through these initiatives such that no one believes they only &#x27;got it because of their gender&#x27; (which to me is no different than &#x27;got here through someone she knows&#x27; -- this is how most business seems to be done in the world!)",1436611298

When I eventually spoke up about it I was further rebuked.
I felt trapped. And my health actually suffered. I slept poorly, woke up with anxiety, and one day I burst into tears in the office.

The problem is that your monitor works in non-linear colourspace - sRGB, while the image is generated in linear RGB but not converted to sRGB afterwards. If you want to show proper colours, you need to convert the final value from RGB to sRGB. For people writing shaders, here are two handy functions I keep around:<p><pre><code>    vec3 srgb_from_rgb(vec3 rgb) {
        vec3 a = vec3(0.055, 0.055, 0.055);

        vec3 lo = rgb * 12.92;
        vec3 hi = ap1 * pow(rgb, ginv) - a;
        return mix(lo, hi, select);
    }

    vec3 rgb_from_srgb(vec3 srgb) {

There are two major angles I think: economic and moral.<p>Economically, there are a lot of costs that are taken out of the system if we implement basic income, everything from means-tested support (the means testing is very expensive and prone to fraud, etc), to crime that you mention, to the terrible and yet unmeasured opportunity cost of still having the majority of the population working in jobs they hate but need to survive. Imagine a world where everyone is working on something they&#x27;ve chosen to do, which they can feel passionate about (and yes, I do believe people can feel passionate about any job that has a useful purpose, including picking up trash, cleaning the streets, and all those other currently low-status jobs).<p>The moral side is equally important, though. We live in a society where we don&#x27;t need everyone to work, not even close. A great many people today work in jobs whose only purpose is to exist as jobs, which don&#x27;t actually have a net benefit to society other than keeping people out of unemployment. Many others are unable to contribute to society because their skills are not in demand, thanks to automation, outsourcing, etc. Those people are currently made to feel morally guilty for not working, their self-worth as human beings is attacked, debased. This is fundamentally wrong, and is the major challenge of our generation: transforming from a society that liberally distributes shame to people who are not in a position to work for money, to a society that accepts that paid work is just one of the activities a human being might partake in in their life, and neither necessary nor the highest.<p>If we fail at this challenge, the cost will be unrest, perhaps revolution, probably a regression in the progress of mankind.<p>We have a tough few decades ahead.",1436608957
