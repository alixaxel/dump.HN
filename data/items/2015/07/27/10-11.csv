9954399,comment,9951672,9951672,0,0,bemmu,,,"We had our first child 2 weeks ago. I&#x27;m a Finnish expat living in Japan.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit loaded topic, as people have pretty strong opinions about how to do parenting right. I know at 2 weeks, I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing yet.<p>So far it seems things haven&#x27;t changed as radically as I would have expected. It&#x27;s been continuous, not a sudden jump into an unknown world or anything like that. Based on stuff I read online, my expectation was that this 24/7 crying ball of torture would enter our house, with poop, pee and drool flying everywhere.<p>But in reality he&#x27;s mostly quiet and sleeping. And he&#x27;s really cute and it makes us happy to &quot;play&quot; with him when he&#x27;s awake. He doesn&#x27;t even drool.<p>In Japan it&#x27;s usual that grandparents help out at first. So we&#x27;ve had our mother-in-law living here for 2 weeks, which means that with all the attention on the baby, I have as much time as before for my work. This has somewhat eased the transition.<p>Today was the first day taking care of the baby by just the two of us. I cooked, bottlefed him formula, changed a diaper and did registration paperwork. If I hadn&#x27;t been doing that, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d been working or just wasting time on something else.<p>One thing I hadn&#x27;t completely realized was that being the breastless parent, you can&#x27;t really do everything for the baby. There&#x27;s formula you can feed of course, but it&#x27;s apparently better to use breastmilk as much as possible. The baby also doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as satisfied with a plastic bottle of formula as the real thing.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m not really allowed to comment much on parenting, as 80% of the work is done by my wife, not me. And for the first 2 weeks, maybe 15% of the remaining work was done by my mother-in-law. Maybe after some more time passes I&#x27;ll try to write a proper blog post about this.<p>Sleep schedule of a baby is such that every 2-3 hours he wakes up and starts making dissatisfied grunts. Feed, possibly change diaper and soon he gets sleepy again. I&#x27;ve spent just the normal (short) hours working on my stuff, even having time to read some tutorials, study Japanese and take trips to the beach for swimming. But this might be just a temporarily happy situation, will have to see.<p>Now cue the people about to comment &quot;oh no you don&#x27;t know how hard it will get soon!&quot;. Maybe. But this is what it&#x27;s been like in the beginning for us so far. I just wanted to contribute a positive non-scary experience.",1437994011

Any one of us can think of counter-examples where a company which was late to a market ended up dominating it. This article&#x27;s opening statement allows the author to deflect these repostes, saying &quot;Ah but in that case, company x&#x27;s execution was much better&quot; or &quot;Company b&#x27;s marketing push came at a really bad time&quot;; i.e. All else <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> equal and so your counter-example doesn&#x27;t detract from the author&#x27;s point.<p>This reasoning is problematic. Imagine the equivalent phrase: &quot;If you have two Ferraris, identical in <i>every single way</i> except that one has a higher rate of acceleration than the other, then the faster Ferrari is better&quot;. In a vacuum, this statement is so obviously true that it doesn&#x27;t need to be said.<p>So the author starts with this statement. As every reader will intuitively agree with it, the author gets them &quot;on side&quot;. They then go on to make unsupported claims, which the reader is now happilly innoculated to.<p>The article&#x27;s opening is misleading because, effort being a finite resource, all else <i>cannot</i> be equal when it comes to human endeavour. By focusing on speed you inevitably sacrifice time spent on something else such as the rollcage, the breaks, or the looks.<p>The prediliction for speed and fast execution is systemic in the startup scene right now and it can be very damaging. Don&#x27;t ignore that risk when pushing to deliver.<p>We didn&#x27;t put men on the moon quickly, we did it as safely as we could. Google didn&#x27;t become the pre-eminent search engine because it was first (it wasn&#x27;t), but rather because it was the best.<p>EDIT: It has been pointed out to me that misuse of &quot;All else being equal&quot; in this manner is fairly common. That being the case, it is unlikely that the author was purposefully attempting to support an argument they knew to be weak (why would they do so, afterall).

Maybe the abstraction of treating light and the rest of the Universe somewhat separately will break (of course we describe the coupling too). Maybe the abstraction of treating light as a non-dividable entity in the Universe will break.

It could very well be that you can&#x27;t divide light any further and I would be satisfied with it if we can describe its behavior fully.

Model-building is only one aspect of science, and happens to be the most prevalent in some (though not all) of today&#x27;s mathematical and statistical based studies of physics (which are often criticized as an exercise in curve-fitting).  One example is how string theorists are making a valiant (though perhaps errant) effort to understand matter; they are not simply modelling well characterized behaviors.  There are many physicists and other scientists who are continually trying to understand their subject matter (pun intentional) at a deeper level, such as those who discovered and described DNA.<p>I am not interested in whether these scientists reveal &quot;some fundamental truth or not&quot;, but we cannot say that we understand all there is to know about electromagnetic phenomena because we can make a few simple predictions.  It would be tantamount to saying that we understand the sun because we know where it is relative to us, and how bright it is, and can predict both of these parameters for a while.  Understanding that it is a star, how it was formed, how it will cease to be, that it is made up of a number of elements, and converts large amounts of matter to energy are all very important discoveries, and we must continue to seek this kind of advance in the frontiers of our understanding in electromagnetic phenomena, matter, gravity, and many other areas.",1437993548

The helper also supports aFarkas&#x27; lazySizes javascript library (https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) to optionally lazy-load specific images. Finally the default configuration of the theme boilerplate also includes anselmh&#x27;s object-fit polyfill (https://github.com/anselmh/object-fit) to allow you to use the object-fit css properties on your images. (btw please vote for this feature to be included in IE Edge!: https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6263790-object-fit-and-object-position)<p>That&#x27;s all.

It was always a bear to train new developers on it and it wasn&#x27;t documented anywhere (until I created a flat file documenting it).  In a situation like that I&#x27;d have loved inline tabular comments.<p>Similarly, if a table or a field has become &quot;legacy&quot;, that is, no longer actively used but kept around because there&#x27;s old data in it somewhere, that should be commented, too.  Or, if a column has it&#x27;s datatype changed for some reason while there is data in the table, that should probably be noted, too (e.g. char --> varchar, int-->string, etc).<p>Schema versioning is a huge problem at many companies, especially non-tech companies where the developers are completely at the mercy of their &quot;business stakeholders&quot;, and since full-fledged data dictionaries don&#x27;t exist for almost anything, using simple comments like this could be a boon.

Sometimes you&#x27;ll see a howto that has different steps for each of the past four or five releases (6mo apart). Debian is much more considered in it&#x27;s changes, and is better suited for server environments. The Debian philosophy is quite clear, and you never have to keep an eye out for encroaching adware or phone-home stuff in the core systems. Debian also does less &#x27;magic stuff&#x27; for you; for example, if you mistype a command, Debian will just &#x27;not found&#x27; it, whereas Ubuntu will suggest-sell you a command... which takes time for the results to be parsed and presented.<p>On the desktop, Debian has quite a few more rough edges, and you wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it for a newbie.<p>Regarding redhat being out of fashion, part of that is that Ubuntu was a big drawcard to bring devs to linux because they focused on polishing the desktop, so the debian family got an influx of users. Personally, I don&#x27;t like redhat tooling as I find them full of gotchas and their output is usually full of chaff and hard to parse. That may be just a personal taste issue; I&#x27;m sure plenty of redhat admins find debian tooling weird and odd.",1437991356
