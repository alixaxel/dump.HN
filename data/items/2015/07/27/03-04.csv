The momentum gained by the EmDrive plus the momentum lost by the electromagnetic wave equals zero.

You wake up everyday full of fear, knowing this little person depends on you for food, shelter, and guidance. You&#x27;ll see them grow up, want to become involved in their hobbies, learn that leaving at 5 and making the nightly family dinner is very important to you.",1437966300

I just looked over the site and the last post and accompanying blog made me feel better about jumping into this next round of treatment. Thanks so much. I&#x27;ll definitely share this.",1437966258

Investigating an alternative monetary system -- at the request of the prime minister -- hardly seems like treason.  Especially if you&#x27;re the finance minister.  Keeping it a secret doesn&#x27;t make it treason either.<p>Treason would be to defect from Greece to the IMF or ECB or Germany with information to sink Greece and eliminate any kind of negotiating power that they might have.",1437966044
