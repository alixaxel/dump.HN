It&#x27;s a matter of skills, for example, in 2001 there were more than 16,000 Asian Americans who scored more than 700 on the math SAT. While there was less than 700 black Americans who scored more than 700 on the math SAT. 
So sure, in aggregate black males earn less than asian American males and white Americans (asian Americans also earn more on average than white Americans, are whites being discriminated against?), but if you compare apples to apples (similar education, experience, test scores, etc) then there is virtually no gap.
The dogma is that statistical disparities demonstrate some form of discrimination, this assumes that there is an equality of performance which is virtually impossible to find in the real world.",1437220785

I&#x27;m a technical person, but 2GB doesn&#x27;t really mean much to me. What bitrate are my songs encoded at on average? Do I use VBR? What bitrates can I get away with? etc. I&#x27;d have to do a rough sum in my head, and the only answer I&#x27;d get is &#x27;in the 1000s&#x27; anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t give me any extra information. The fact is, even for technical people, approximations and hand waving are great as starting points. They set expectations.<p>I feel like anything more complicated than that (hard numbers) only have the potential to be misleading anyway, because they let us think we have more information than we actually do. It&#x27;s only when you actually start working things out that those numbers (so how many GW does a city need? a typical house? what&#x27;s the variance in these numbers?) become more relevant, but that&#x27;s not the sort of thing you can do in your head anyway.",1437220631

There are properties that are only properties of an organization, not of the individual.<p>I think a lot of philosophical hurdles will be gone when respecting boundaries more. In this case not so much physiological or neurological boundaries, but &quot;(machine) learning&quot; boundaries. A system is separated from its environment by a Markovian boundary.

The race to get the best deal emerges from the need not to fall behind the few peers who decided to be greedy (or business-savvy as some like to call it). It goes viral. There are many interesting insights around that in sociology and game theory. Like the playouts of the pirate game <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_game</a>.<p>2. Well, yes. And whoever is pissed off just go find another job. This way everybody gets to see who is right and who is wrong and learn to respect each others jobs more. It should be noted that a mismatch in the understanding of ethics is just as bad as salary mismatch. Tech workers are encouraged to share all their knowledge while sales/business keep their knowledge and connections private, which naturally makes them more valuable. For example, there is no such thing as open-source business development or open-source sales leads database. Tech workers kind of made the leap, but in terms of sharing the business people are essentially assholes. There is no right or wrong here, it&#x27;s just an ethics mismatch.",1437220086
