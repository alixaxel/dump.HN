As a powerlifter I used to hate everything about crossfit, but now I realize it&#x27;s a great way to get people away from pseudo body building and into the rack / onto the platform. I think a lot of people find technical lifts like the squat or clean to be very intimidating, but crossfit helps people get over this fear in a group environment. Once this has been accomplished and someone gets comfortable, it&#x27;s fairly easy to steer them towards olympic lifting or powerlifting.<p>> More places for me to train, suddenly people understand you why its fun<p>It&#x27;s so nice to now be able to travel and not have to worry about being stuck in some crappy commercial gym where people yell at you for using chalk and making noise while deadlifting.",1437829180

9947421,comment,9947146,9947336,0,0,tete,,,"What defines UI / UX design? I am not a KDE user (currently). Well I use it once in a while, but compared to Windows, Mac OS (old and new), Android and iOS, which I all have used the only two things I&#x27;ve seen working well, as in being easy to understand and still efficient to use are KDE and XFCE. Oh and Squeak/Pharo.<p>Both Android and iOS are horrible when it comes to easy of use and know what you are doing in my opinion. Everyone using those systems ends up just using a bunch of patterns of clicking and swiping that they repeat every time, because they don&#x27;t know which of the things they just did actually causes the effect they wanted.<p>In my opinion UI/UX are huge research fields, which you can see when you look at how the paradigms and &quot;dogmas&quot; from two years ago are now known to be the exact opposite of what you want. I think the only reasons things appear easier these days is that people have been exposed to technical interfaces way longer and more intensely.<p>I am not saying that things don&#x27;t get better, but I think there are a lot of misunderstandings. Users just get used to certain systems after time. They adapt. They adapt to their CLI-based interface, their Macbook (they need too, else they&#x27;d have spent thousands of USD for nothing), to new versions of Windows and do KDE/Plasma.<p>Show a completely new computer user (maybe generation 70+) various interfaces and they will learn each of them efficiently after a while. (yeah, I have done that with older people)<p>I think the main thing stopping people from using KDE and having troubles with it is that it&#x27;s not the common thing that one usually starts out with. It used to be and people were happy until KDE4, which was something new to learn again.<p>This sounds way more defensive of KDE than I intend to. I am not a fan. I use it when I have to choose between Gnome/Unity or KDE (but would probably choose another option, if there is one), just because it feels way more intuitive and easier to use. I never managed to get along with Gnome, but I think that&#x27;s all based on what I said above. If you are exposed to one thing you will probably stick to it.<p>However, I am happy about every alternative coming up, because it means there is a chance for them improving status quo.",1437828000

9947396,comment,9943069,9943069,0,0,throwawaythisis,,,"I started drinking in a student-life context, around the age of 23 (bit late, I guess). Everyone drank. I joined in, and it was a lot of fun.<p>Post-college, many of the people I knew just sort of grew out of it. Stopped getting drunk every weekend, and only drank a beer or two with a meal, or only with special meals/moments. But because I became an expat/freelancer/traveler, I kind of maintained a bar-centered, beer-centered life, and naturally ended up with friends who were the same.<p>It never occurred to me that this might not be &#x27;normal&#x27; for everyone. The dynamics behind this are fascinating, but not so relevant at this point. Suffice it to say that most drinkers overestimate how much &#x27;most people&#x27; drink.<p>All this was not a problem until it suddenly was. At some point I&#x27;d started drinking to relieve stress, or deal with depressive episodes, and one day I &#x27;woke up&#x27; and realized that I&#x27;d been drinking to the point of &#x27;being drunk&#x27; almost every single day. This was particularly shocking to me because I studied psychology <i>and</i> always had a fascination with addiction. So I knew about the dynamics. I was high-functioning, and doing pretty well all in all, but I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable knowing that I had a &#x27;dependency&#x27;.<p>It took me a full two years to actually properly get things under control again. There were four things that I believe were crucial:<p>1. I realized that simply thinking I might have a problematic relationship with alcohol was enough reason to treat it as one, and at the very least &#x27;test&#x27; whether I had one. I now believe that if you&#x27;re not entirely happy with your drinking habits, then that should be enough reason to try and remove that habit for a while, since there are no real downsides to sobriety, and there are definite downsides to drinking regularly.
2. I started frequenting /r/stopdrinking subreddit and #stopdrinking chat room.
3. I found for my &#x27;down-time&#x27; drinking periods and drinking social circles: I started meditating and diving into zen buddhism, I started reading and actively doing things again that I knew made me happy in the past (without pulling significant energy and willpower, like programming does[1]), and I took time off from my drinking friends. Meditation was perhaps one of the most important things, all in all.
4. I actively looked into sources of unhappiness and stress, and did my utmost to cut them out or minimize the negative effects.<p>[1]: interestingly, while my &#x27;craving&#x27; for getting drunk is almost entirely gone these days, one of the few times that I feel the pull is when get caught up in a programming project. After spending hours doing that, sometimes forgetting to eat or take a break, it&#x27;s like my mind is exhausted beyond a healthy point. I&#x27;m starting to think my active coding life played a big role in my alcohol dependency issues.",1437827316

We&#x27;ve all heard that phrase &#x27;design by commitee&#x27; but that&#x27;s what you get when everyone wants a say in the way the UI works.<p>I can understand why this happens even though the outcome is often an unfriendly UI. Imagine you&#x27;re a developer who&#x27;s spent time and effort contributing to an open source project. Naturally you&#x27;ll have an opinion on the UX and what suits your preferences. Everyone else using or contributing will also have a strong opinion. The moment you try and delgate visual and interaction design to a small, dedicated team is the moment the whole project generates enormous resentment from the &quot;community&quot;.<p>Plus, any attempt to (sincerely) improve or simplify an interface will always be met at some point with the charge of &quot;dumbing down&quot;.<p>Open source and design have never had a good relationship.
