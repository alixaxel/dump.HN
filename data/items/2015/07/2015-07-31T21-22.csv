9984769,comment,9974418,9976537,0,0,norea-armozel,,,"A site which is public cannot restrict access to its content as such. I think you don&#x27;t understand the nature of public/private space in civil law. I can go to any grocery store during operating hours, zip through the aisles, then leave without buying a blessed thing. Mind you, if I did that in a manner that was obstructing actual customers from buying groceries or I was being a jerk in general they could ban me from the store. But prior to any interaction with the grocery store, its staff, and its customers, there is no legal obligation for me to not go into the store. You can&#x27;t make a store that&#x27;s open to the public magically private at the same time. Either it&#x27;s open for business or it&#x27;s closed to the public.<p>A website without the requirements of logging in to see its content is the same as an open to the public grocery store. All of its resources are legally free for access. It&#x27;s up to the web site&#x27;s administrators to decide to block access to abusive users and bots. But if a random user comes to the site with any sort of agreement text on the index page that agreement is not a contract as the user cannot be verified nor can consent be verified either (IP logs are generally not considered sufficient to identify a user in related case law). So, you as the website owner have to figure out how to display your content and how to make sure the adverts don&#x27;t interfere in the operation of your public site. It&#x27;s not a legal obligation of the user to see your adverts anymore than it is the legal obligation for you to make your site public. If you don&#x27;t want adblocking users then make the site PRIVATE. Otherwise, you&#x27;re open for business like the grocery store. And like the grocery store, you&#x27;re on the hook for jerks like me who are looking but not buying.",1438379936

There&#x27;s a lot of frickin&#x27; ocean, and they&#x27;d have to saturate it, one missile for every 20 sq. miles, in order to have a hope of hitting a carrier.

China can talk trash all they want, but there&#x27;s not much they can do–or would want to do, really.<p>The fact is, the United States is effectively guaranteeing the trade lanes for everyone. They have not tried to own the oceans for themselves as others did. They have not tried to own resources or markets for themselves the way the Europeans did in the age of mercantilism.<p>China does what it does out of paranoia. And because people have been jerks to them in the past. But they know that what they have is not effective for waging expansionist war. Those missiles could make it really, <i>really</i> hurt if the United States were to try to take a military action against the Chinese mainland, because that would place a number of CBGs in close proximity to the mainland, where it&#x27;d be <i>much</i> easier to track and launch said missiles at them.

They are a military <i>liability</i> rather than an asset. Unlike Guam, etc., they are not useful as a staging point, because the range of modern ships makes them kind of useless as a staging or refueling point. They are small–they don&#x27;t even have fresh water–and thus they are easy to saturate with a few cruise missiles (the USN has 3000 tomahawks in inventory, last I checked?), so, forget about trying to put serious static defenses there. When you look at the fluff, yea, it seems alarming, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for. It&#x27;s <i></i>politics<i></i>.

I support it in regards to allowing people who have served their time (post-probation) to be forgotten/forgiven in regards to their crimes. And the way we use the Internet today makes that nearly impossible. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s job to erase or censor data other users create as that would set the precedent that anyone can ask for anything to be removed from the index. This is both bad on the basis that Google&#x27;s reliability depends on indexing all it can (but respecting the robots.txt no indexing rules) and to harm that reliability for reason, even good ones, could mean that what the general public knows is being actively censored. Governments would love to make Google into the memory hole in that respect. And corporations already have that sort of functionality via DMCA which isn&#x27;t any better.<p>In a perfect world, Google wouldn&#x27;t index criminal records because they wouldn&#x27;t exist online (imo, unless it&#x27;s a crime that is as serious as rape, murder, assault, or major larceny it shouldn&#x27;t be in the public) and folks who have naughty pictures on their Facebook wouldn&#x27;t be shamed by society (at worse they would just be embarrassed). But we don&#x27;t live in that perfect world, so I hope we can come up with as close to perfect solutions to the problem. I think the first step is to make sure we have better privacy advocacy on government and corporate information. Google can help foster that front with their own lobby efforts if they have any. It wouldn&#x27;t be against their best interests, imo, since Google has no real need to freely share user information other than metadata.

So let&#x27;s take a typical web application that does:<p>1. Boot, setting up system wide resources like DB/memcached connections<p>2. Start doing work<p>Then any process forked after step #1 is sharing those sockets and can accidentally corrupt the work that the parent process is doing. With threads, you can share the connections through a pool that can be simply mediated within the process.<p>Yeah, you can design around it. But with threads, you don&#x27;t have to.<p>Here&#x27;s another: serialisation. If you want to parallelise any processing that builds up any complex data structures, you have to serialise them between your parent/child processes which can make it hard to keep the &quot;richness&quot; of the objects like interdependencies between processing runs. In addition, now your processing bottleneck becomes how fast your single-threaded parent process can deserialise the responses (which in Python in particular can really be quite slow).<p>And not everything can be serialised. It&#x27;s not trivial to share sockets with other processes that have already been started. You can&#x27;t easily accept a connection in one process and pass it to another to do the work and send the response (it&#x27;s possible, just not as easy as passing an integer around like you can do between threads).",1438378104

This is a problem because architectural tricks like doubling the vector registers without commensurate improvements in bandwidth, cache sizes, load/store/gather/scatter produce huge (nearly 2x) benefit for HPL and little or no benefit to a large fraction of real applications.<p>HPGMG is representative of most structure-exploiting algorithms in that it does not have this abundance of flops, thus theoretical performance is actively constrained by both memory bandwidth and flop/s.  We see many active constraints in practice; e.g., improving any of peak flop/s, memory bandwidth, network latency, or network bandwidth produces a tangible improvement in HPGMG performance.  Depending on the fidelity of the performance model, these dimensions can be a fairly accurate predictor of performance, but ILP, compiler quality, on-node synchronization latency, cache sizes, and similar factors also matter (more for HPGMG-FE than HPGMG-FV).<p>I think it is actually quite undesirable for benchmark performance to be trivially computed from one parameter in machine provisioning.  No computing center has a mission statement asking for a place on a benchmark ranking list (like Top500).  Instead, they have a scientific or engineering mandate.  Press releases tend to overemphasize the ranking and I think it is harmful to the science any time the benchmark takes precedence over the expected scientific workload.  HPGMG is intended to be representative in the sense that if you build an &quot;HPGMG Machine&quot;, you&#x27;ll get a balanced, versatile machine that scientists and engineers in most disciplines will be happy with.  I&#x27;d still rather the centers focus on their workload instead of HPGMG.",1438377625

If you think the end of the boom part of the cycle is 4 years away, you want to offer the shortest-term leases the tenant will accept, because they will then be forced to renew at a higher rate.<p>This is very similar to the dry-bulk market.  It should be instructive to look at how companies like DryShips and Diana Shipping handled the enormous spike in the Baltic Dry Index several years ago, how they&#x27;ve fared since, and how they&#x27;ve managed their businesses afterward.
