Sensory feedback after completion of a goal-driven task is compared against output from an emulator that has been asked to complete the same task, in parallel The emulator runs faster, partly because the circuitry will simply be shorter.<p>This is suspected in musculoskeletal control, and I believe it may happen outside the musculoskeletal domain too.<p>Consciousness may only lag behind the emulator, not the &quot;real world&quot; sensory feedback.<p>This may offer a counter, or adjunct, to the proposal that consciousness is simply the brain experiencing itself.<p>The lag may be back propagation. It certainly seems to be some sort of computational overhead.",1437641842

Big companies using a lot of contractors normally go through intermediary contractor agencies simply to avoid the risk that the contractor become legally recognized as employee. The cost of those intermediaries can be as much as an extra 20% of the contractor rate - that&#x27;s significant.<p>As a small startup, initially Uber could operate directly with contractor driver and save that amount.

9934649,comment,9933226,9934620,0,0,wolfgke,,,"First: What I wrote it only for the GPU, since you only asked about that part. I wrote nothing about the other parts of the SoC or Raspbian, though there are lots of things to say, for example:<p>No public documentation (without NDA) is available for the USB controller of the RPi (there is still an open source driver in the Linux kernel for it that is based on this non-public datasheets) made by Broadcom. I personally consider the action that the Linux developers also include drivers based on secret datasheets into the kernel as a violation of the spirit of open source, but I digress.<p>Also the Raspbian developers (from the Raspberry Pi foundation) include proprietary software into Raspbian, say, Mathematica. While probably useful, this surely isn&#x27;t open source.<p>So there are more criteria on which to judge a SoC than whether it is open source, say, whether there are complete and free datasheets (no NDA) available or whether the SoC is also available in small amounts for hackers (Broadcom is said to be very compicated in this area). Or how much open-source the de-facto standard GNU/Linux distribution (since this is what you&#x27;ll probably want to use) for the SoC is.<p>TLDR: Openness or open-sourceness is much more complicated.",1437641470

What I worry about when selecting tenants is<p><pre><code>  - will these people keep 15 cats, despite the contract saying they can&#x27;t, who will piss all over the place requiring new carpeting after they move out, or a rottweiler who will chew up all my door stiles (and good luck suing for and collecting damages from someone who doesn&#x27;t have a regular income or even regular place of residence);\n\n  - will this person come home drunk, loudly, at 2am three times a week, causing the neighbors (who pay in time and never give trouble) to move out, leaving me with the vacant property for some time and the work to find another tenant;\n\n  - will this person pay in time, or will I have to call 3 times every month and even then only get paid in chunks most of the time;\n\n  - will this person stay for a while or want to move out after 4 months, despite having signed a one year lease, leaving me with the trouble and time investment.\n</code></pre>\n(all of these, and more that are too specific to mention publicly, actually happened to me)<p>Renting out property is not a high-margin business. &#x27;Inefficiencies&#x27; like a unit being vacant for 2 months out of the year are the difference between &#x27;better return than savings account&#x27; and &#x27;I should have stuffed the money in a sock under my mattress&#x27;; and that&#x27;s not even counting the work you have to put into it (advertising, showing people around, chasing payment, fixing things, court sessions, ...) (OK the last few years savings accounts yield 0, I&#x27;m talking about longer terms)<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is - most renters think of their landlords as fat cats to whom they have to hand over 1/3rd of their monthly income for doing nothing. The reality is much more nuanced - yes it&#x27;s a business, like any other, but a highly competitive one at that (in most markets); if I was &#x27;rich&#x27; as most of them seem to assume, I sure as hell wouldn&#x27;t be dealing with the hassle of being a landlord.",1437641058

9934606,comment,9933226,9934502,0,0,wolfgke,,,"> But is the graphics of CHIP comparable to the one on Raspberry Pi?<p>The CHIP uses an Allwinner R8 SoC, which uses a Mali400 GPU (source: <a href=""http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/06/07/allwinner-r8-module-datasheet-and-price-is-the-9-c-h-i-p-computer-selling-at-a-loss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/06/07/allwinner-r8-module-d...</a>). RPi uses a VideoCore IV GPU.<p>While there is no open source driver for Mali400 available, it has been partially reverse-engineered (lima). For the VideoCore IV there is an open source driver available, but the SoC on the RPi is special in the sense that when booting the VideoCore IV is the core to start, which later in the boot process starts the ARM core(s). On the VideoCore IV there runs a proprietary OS (probably RTOS) that is based on ThreadX. So most things the open source driver does are simply calls to this RTOS via a mailbox.<p>Nevertheless the RPI developers market the VideoCore IV GPU as the most open embedded GPU available. Indeed it is the only one, where an official open source driver is available and thus it is more friendly towards bare-metal programmers that want to write their own OS. On the other hand, the RTOS running on the VideoCore IV is a large blob in an instruction set that has not yet been deciphered.",1437640481

9934590,comment,9926345,9930430,0,0,roel_v,,,"Hi,<p>(First, rereading my post, I didn&#x27;t mean to come across as asshole-isch as I was - it&#x27;s just what happens when I type stream-of-consciousness style and don&#x27;t edit...)<p>- &#x27;premium&#x27; - sorry that I have to cop out here, it&#x27;s one of those &#x27;know it when you see it&#x27; things, I&#x27;m not experienced enough to be able to consciously tell how to improve... For example the photos - they&#x27;re high-res, functional, definitely above-average - maybe what I&#x27;m missing is some emotional appeal? I know this is weird coming from someone who complained about &#x27;Japanese sword master mysticism&#x27; before, and while I do appreciate high-res zoom shots, the product pages don&#x27;t make me feel that my life will be better with one of these knives. Again, sorry that I don&#x27;t have actionable advice and I do know that I sound like a whiner, I&#x27;m just trying to articulate why I don&#x27;t hit the &#x27;buy&#x27; button right away, and I&#x27;m having a hard time (marketing is hard, of course). Maybe let me say it this way - when you look at the BMW website, you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding functional photos of cars or interiors; it&#x27;s mostly &#x27;action shots&#x27; and closeups of interior details. I tried to find out once, before buying one, how the trunk was organized - and I had to refer to photos on second hand sites to get an idea, because I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it in the official materials. Now, rationally, I was annoyed about that - but the detail shots of fine chestnut interior veneer did more for building a mental image on what it would be like to own one than &#x27;functional&#x27; shots would have... Again, not saying you should ditch the functional shots, just trying to convey how it feels as a &#x27;visitor&#x27;, which (as I know from firsthand experience) is impossible for you to do when you&#x27;ve poured 10&#x27;s or 100&#x27;s of hours into putting all of this together...<p>- Come to think of it - maybe you can try to experiment with the &#x27;add to cart&#x27; text on the button. That feels so... Amazon... which feels cheap and everyday to me (again, personal opinion), not something I&#x27;d associate with a luxury purchase. Same with the &#x27;Showing all 12 results&#x27; text - there are only 12 knives (as far as I can tell?) so this seems so... boilerplate.<p>- About texts; take this one: <a href=""http://www.buttermilksupply.com/shop/knives/shigehiro-suminagashi-petty-135mm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buttermilksupply.com/shop/knives/shigehiro-sumina...</a> ; one paragraph: &quot;The cutting edge is wrapped in a beautiful hand-built suminagashi (damascus) steel from Yoshikazu Ikeda. Ikeda-san’s damascus is even more beautiful in person. It’s a beautiful pattern, and my favorite damascus pattern, that is specific only to Ikeda-san.&quot; Uses &#x27;beautiful&#x27; three times in three sentences; uses &#x27;Ikeda-san&#x27; which you have to know a bit of Japanese language/societal peculiarities for to know how to relate the &#x27;san&#x27; to the name mentioned earlier; and it doesn&#x27;t say what&#x27;s unique about the pattern. Probably people who have had several of these knives in their hands think this last point is silly and obvious, but to me (the buyer who is trying to figure out what the difference is between the 12 knives on the &#x27;knives&#x27; page), it doesn&#x27;t take away any confusion - maybe even adds to it.<p>- At the bottom of each page: &quot;Buttermilk Supply is a carefully curated shop of handmade knives, tools, and lifestyle goods all in the name of good food.&quot; Except you also sell hair cutting supplies? Which is fine, and this is a really minute point, but it&#x27;s all little, tiny details like this that take away the illusion of laser-like focus on one specialty, that one thing you want to signal &#x27;we are the best in the world at this&#x27;. (which might be &#x27;suppliers of sharp things&#x27;, not saying you should ditch the scissors, but then your tag line doesn&#x27;t fit any more)<p>- As to presentation - the blog posts about different types of knives and steel were buried at the bottom I saw later. Maybe at the top of the &#x27;knives&#x27; page, add a few sentences: &#x27;looking for a great knife for hobby cooking? pick either a, b or c. Looking for the best knife money can buy for cutting meat? Go for d or e. If your hands are < 10 cm, buy size xyz1, otherwise xyz2&#x27;. Then you can link each of these to the more detailed posts. (obviously just examples of selection criteria)<p>- The selection criteria on the left (gyotu, petty, santoku, nakiri) mean nothing to me, and I suspect many of your visitors. I just clicked through each of them and only today noticed the description at the top on those sub-pages (which you mention in your reply). . You could measure how often people click there with analytics tools, but I&#x27;m not sure if click rates would say something about how well people understand it; maybe there&#x27;s research about it somewhere. Either way, I guess this is a trade off between &#x27;functional&#x27; style navigation and &#x27;selling high-end product&#x27;. Maybe a &#x27;what knife should I buy&#x27; link at the top of the navigation on the left would be enough to take away the indecision point, where people are interested but don&#x27;t know what to choose? A sort of &#x27;escape hatch&#x27; for those moments you&#x27;re not quite sure where to next?<p>- I have these silicone sheets: <a href=""http://www.bol.com/nl/p/bisbell-magmates-mesbeschermers-2-delig-160-x-25-mm/9200000036927729/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bol.com/nl/p/bisbell-magmates-mesbeschermers-2-de...</a> , albeit in different colors . They can be cut to any length with any normal pair of scissors, to make them fit knives of different lengths. I&#x27;m sure there are many more products like this out there, though.<p>I hope this helps at least a little bit - not a lot of &#x27;hard&#x27; advice or facts, I&#x27;m afraid... If I knew the secret I&#x27;d probably be on a beach in the Bahamas right now instead of procrastinating in an office :) I love high-quality, specialty items but for me they also have to be functionally better; I&#x27;d never buy a mechanical Rolex because mechanical watches are inferior in time keeping quality to electronic watches (I wouldn&#x27;t buy a Rolex at all because I can&#x27;t afford them :) , again just an example). What I&#x27;m trying to say - I not convinced that a Japanese knife cuts <i>better</i> than another one, because I have a hard time imagining what there is to be &#x27;better&#x27;.<p>Just had another thought (after that I&#x27;ll just hit &#x27;reply&#x27; before this turns into a book) - something I, as a hobby chef, would like to learn/be able to do is prep as fast as a real chef, or at least faster than my current &#x27;1/2 second per cut&#x27; technique. How about adding some &#x27;knife skills&#x27; videos, showing off why your knives help to cut faster? One of my personal problems is that the part I just sliced off clings to the right of the blade, and then on the next cut, they get pushed off and roll all over my kitchen. Chefs on tv just seem to slice and the chopped bits stay nicely on the chopping board. A &#x27;knife skills&#x27; video tutorial series could show off your offerings (and even if your knives aren&#x27;t better than many others at this specific thing, they could still drive traffic to your site).",1437640161

It does nifty stuff, for sure. But do i need all of that? Hardly.<p>For example, i am wondering why i would want to put compression into the file system. Or deduplication. Or the possibility to put some data on SSD and other on HDD. If i have a server and user data, it should be up to the application to do this stuff. That should be more efficient, because the app actually knows how to handle the data correctly and efficiently.  It would also be largely independent of the file storage.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some cases where we had a storage system, pretending to do fancy stuff and fail on it. And debugging such things is a nightmare (talking about storage vendors here, though).\nBut for example, a few years ago we had major performance problems because a ZFS mount was at about 90% of space. It was not easy to pinpoint that. After the fact it&#x27;s clear, and nowadays googling it would probably give enough hints.\nBut in the end I would very much like that my filesystem does not just slow down depending on how much filled it is. Or how much memory i have.<p>edit: Also, just to clarify. I think that Sun had one of the best engineers of the whole industry. Everything they did has been great. Honestly, i have huge respect for them and also for ZFS. I still think that ZFS is great, but in the end, i am wondering if it is just too much. For example, nowadays you have a lot of those stateless redundant S3 compatible storage backends. Or use Cassandra, etc. Those already copy your data multiple times. Even if they run on ZFS, you don&#x27;t gain much. If you run ext4 and it actually loses data, the software cares about that. That&#x27;s just one case, and of course it depends on your requirements. Just saying, those cases are increasing where the software already cares for keeping the important data safe.",1437639713

I would want to setup my own server with option to scale it to remote pollers.<p>In my org we ended up choosing another nagios replacement, but not because of any flaw in bosun.<p>I love iterating over the main points that we look for in a monitoring solution.<p>Self-hosted. Scalable, remote pollers that can plugin to the central servers. Locations, remote pollers can add locations to monitor from. Collector agent that runs periodically from monitored servers instead of the nrpe model that listens to connections. The collector OS agent is windows compatible and backwards compatible with nagios scripts. Monitoring focuses on sending metrics first and foremost, so you can set thresholds for metrics, just like bosun does. And of course, with those metrics the web gui draws fancy graphs for everything.<p>And last but not least, all of this, monitoring agent, pollers, they all use a standard API like REST or xmlrpc.",1437639200

I&#x27;ve been using the Algolia HN Search &quot;experimental&quot; interface for months and it works really well. You can turn on the experimental interface through the &quot;settings&quot; link [1] on the bottom of the search page.<p>Some people love to see &quot;thumbnail&quot; images of the sites in the search results, and they most likely have all the required bandwidth/speed/latency needed to view the images without discomfort. For people on slow, high-latency Internet connections, the thumbnail image loading is slow and annoying. The good news is, after you select &quot;experimental&quot; mode in the settings, you can then turn off thumbnail image loading.<p>[1] <a href=""https://hn.algolia.com/settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hn.algolia.com/settings</a>",1437639169

I personally think Sun&#x27;s engineers did an amazing job with ZFS. Plus while the file system is hugely complex, management of it is remarkably straightforward - which leads to less user / sysadmin error when running it.<p>Sadly though, I do agree with your judgement of Btrfs. I trialled it for about 6 months and found it to be conceptually similar to ZFS but very much it&#x27;s practical polar opposite.<p>However, like with any software decision, the right file system choice depends as much on the platform&#x27;s intended purpose and the administrator, as it does on age and features. For file servers, ZFS is an excellent choice; but for low footprint appliances, you&#x27;d be better off with ext4 or xfs. And desktops is just a question of personal preference.",1437638976

A player being too good makes the game boring, and so it is discouraged.<p>I think this misses the point that in many games, for many players, they simultaneously have the role you describe as &quot;player&quot; and &quot;spectator&quot;; while they want to win the game, they want the game to be entertaining and not boring, as well.",1437638895

A couple of years ago I started hiking around the city where we live and discovered a whole wealth of beautiful nature of different kinds I never even knew was there. Which made me feel stupid and enlightened at the same time. Stupid because of not knowing it was there and being sucked into the &#x27;you must travel at least x times a year to visit nice stuff&#x27; which lives strong amongst many people I know. Enlightened because of knowing it was just there for us to visit whenever we feel like.<p>We took this idea a bit further and instead of travelling abroad we set our minds on discovering all beauty around us by simply taking the bike and doing a short trip (say 20 or 30km) to an area we&#x27;ve never been before. It is simply amazing what we found already.<p>Granted, this is not for everyone, for starters because not everyone lives in an area where there actually is easy to reach countryside/rural area, but I highly suggest to look at sattelite images of the area around you, look for green spots and ask yourself if you know what they look like.
