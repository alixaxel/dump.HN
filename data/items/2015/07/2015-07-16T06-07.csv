9895758,comment,9894213,9895486,0,0,Billesper,,,"Agreed.<p>I remember being a freshman and having my first real exposure  to proofs and pure math, a calculus class. We used the text &quot;Calculus&quot; by Spivak. The first actual calculus topic was one of, if not the most difficult concepts in the course: the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. That was a struggle. I had no idea about the significance of logical qualifiers and precise mathematical language like &quot;for all&quot; and &quot;there exists,&quot; or what it meant to &quot;choose&quot; or &quot;fix&quot; a value, much less the ability to parse all of the those things combined in a complex statement. Even familiar and elementary concepts like absolute value and inequalities were sort of difficult in that context. We very briefly covered basic proof techniques and formal logic, but overall it was intractable at first. But one by one, you learn individual concepts and notation, such that you are eventually able to understand their fully significance without really having to think. Looking back, and after taking other courses and studying proofs/logic/sets/functions more in depth, epsilon-delta makes perfect sense.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to tackle theorems and proofs (or any kind of problem, really - in math or otherwise) by starting with working out a few of the simplest possible meaningful example(s), or just any valid example if you can&#x27;t quickly determine that. If you are learning a new formal concept or idea, I find that it&#x27;s often very helpful to do a few applied problems first if you have any trouble. If you can identify individual concepts used in a theorem, try to master them first in isolation before tackling the overall problem, if need be. The key idea is to break things down to their smallest units of understanding.<p>I find this comment by Terry Tao fascinating:<p>>&quot;Ramanujan, for instance, apparently performed a tremendous number of numerical computations, and derived much of his intuition from the patterns he observed from those computations.&quot;<p>I think I used to assume that most of the best mathematicians could read a new theorem or idea, and internalize all of the significance and intuition by simply using logic and working only with the abstractions. People have different ways of thinking, but now I&#x27;m not sure if anyone, even a genius, can do that on a truly difficult problem. One needs to avoid blindly &quot;plugging in numbers&quot; or over-generalizing from examples, but working out concrete things and then asking questions, considering cases, inferring, and making hypotheses based on examples seems to generally be the most efficient way to tackle a new problem or idea.",1437029513

I no longer think in complete sentences; any concrete idea that shows up in my head is a potential target for the OCD monkey. Instead, I tend to think in word clouds, sort of, as well as more impressionistic images. I have to always focus on keeping my mind blank; there&#x27;s simply no room for meandering thoughts. In a strange way, I don&#x27;t mind it; I think it&#x27;s actually boosted my creativity quite a bit, even if it&#x27;s at the expense of more linear, rational thought.<p>The &quot;psyche hack&quot; rings so, so true. One of mine is, oddly enough, the buzzsaws from Half-Life 2. (Probably because I started to defend myself psychologically against OCD around the time when that game came out.) Whenever a I get an obsession/compulsion, I imagine a stack of those buzzsaws falling to one side of my body and taking the &quot;weight&quot; of the compulsion with them. I can add more buzzsaws to the stack to speed up this process. However, if the compulsion turns out to be too strong, the buzzsaws can turn into a obsession/compulsion in and of themselves, and then I have to spend a few minutes or seconds &quot;grabbing hold&quot; of them in my head. Fortunately, I have not yet had a need to create a new psyche hack to counteract this; it seems the buck stops at the saws.<p>80% of the time my OCD does not bother me, but I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve basically internalized a whole bunch of &quot;psyche hacks&quot; and unconsiously use them continuously throughout the day. Sometimes I wonder if I can train my mind to avoid the obsession/compulsions altogether; depending on the day, and especially if I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of rest, I can clear my mind and be free for a little bit. But it doesn&#x27;t really last. (On the other hand, when my mind is completely immersed in another task — when I don&#x27;t have time to think — I rarely go into OCD mode. It also doesn&#x27;t happen in my dreams.)<p>I&#x27;d really like to write an article like this one at some point, because I think OCD can really illuminate the way we think — particularly in regards to the way we form connections between ideas. In OCD, this mechanism is a bit out of control and tries to grab onto anything it can find. The strange, insane, recursive leaps of logic that result from this have a terrifying poetic beauty to them. It&#x27;s a very visceral disease; I imagine that few people can describe their specific thought processes as easily and vividly as those who have OCD.<p>What a weird disorder.",1437026571
