Only an elite few, such as me, can do this right, so most of you out there DON&#x27;T DO IT!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s bullshit.  Mainly because it&#x27;s no harder than anything else, and has just as much pitfalls as every other type of programming.  Yes, to a certain degree multithreading is hard, but it&#x27;s not rocket science.  But PROGRAMMING is hard.  Not just multithreaded programming.  There&#x27;s nothing very special about multithreaded programming that should scare off people from trying it.  Sure, you might fuck up, but that&#x27;s<p>For example, our entire company was almost completely brought down a few months ago by our &quot;architect&quot; implementing a feature so poorly that it caused massive system instability.  What was this feature?  It essentially boiled down to a 1 or a 2.  Customer accounts were tagged with either a 1 or a 2, an it&#x27;s supposed to take a different code path for each, but he made it so fucking complicated and he didn&#x27;t do his due diligence, the entire weight of his code cause significant downtime, and a customer that accounts for 60% of our revenues almost walked.  And none of this is rocket science.<p>Of course, I worked at another company where one engineer thought &quot;oh, asynchronous APIs are faster than synchronous APIs&quot; so they implemented the entire API asynchronously.  Of course, that required mutexes on the server side.  And then more mutexes.  And it got to the point where the performance was hell because of the unintended consequences of trying to make things faster.  You would write a new API and the server would barf saying &quot;You took the locks in the wrong order&quot; but there was no indication of you ever doing anything wrong.  It was a mess.  So I get what the OP is saying, but it&#x27;s not specific to just multithreadedness.  I bet the same programmer would have made a mess of a single-threaded app as well.  They are just shitty or careless programmers.<p>If you&#x27;re careful, multithreaded programming is helpful and you can see some significant performance boosts from it.  But like <i>every other paradigm in programming</i>, don&#x27;t overuse it.  A judicious use of simple multithreaded programming might help a lot, but there are few apps that benefit from an extremely complex system with hundreds of threads, massive amounts of mutexes, etc.",1437187965

All of the obvious tests are fraught with ethical issues, but testing for behavioral responses seems pretty easy, I think. For instance, consider this thought experiment: set up a rogue, landed, state; have that state attack the U.S. Can we predict a response? Surely! So, we know the U.S. responds to very simple &quot;acute pain&quot; stimuli. We know it responds to chronic pain stimuli: if a certain economic activity is no longer justified in a subregion (Detroit:cars), then that region atrophies.<p>Really, I think the major issue is to determine how to talk to the U.S. What&#x27;s the sovereign state equivalent of &quot;how&#x27;s it going?&quot; It seems that the only obvious attributes of the state we to acquire resources---usually by cooperating in s semi-symbiotic fashion with similar states, and responding to basic pain-like stimuli.

9906379,comment,9901511,9903408,0,0,jstedfast,,,"> * designed a lot more around server side sort/search, because UID ordering sucks in various ways - try moving some messages into your INBOX and noticing that iOS mail displays them in APPEND order rather than date order.<p>Why not just sort the messages? Just because iOS Mail shows the message in APPEND order doesn&#x27;t you have to show them in that order. You would expect to see them in APPEND order if you are listing them in APPEND order.<p>As I&#x27;m sure you know, IMAP also has server-side SORT extensions. I will agree that they could be expanded a bit, but you can do client-side sorting just fine (and in fact need to if you want offline support). JMAP doesn&#x27;t fix that.<p>SORT is really only needed on the server side for calculating which subset of messages to FETCH summary information for (to display in your message-list) if you are incrementally displaying messages as the user scrolls and you have a sort-order applied that isn&#x27;t &quot;APPEND order&quot;.<p>> * connectionless / stateless as far as possible, because connections drop in the IMAP world, particularly in mobile, and the cost of a new SELECT is high, even with QRESYNC. It still has to create a COW view of the message space because it has to keep message numbers that don&#x27;t track EXPUNGEs just in case the client wants to run a pipelined command.<p>It&#x27;s really not that bad.<p>I already mentioned the EXPUNGES being tied to sequence id&#x27;s (aka indexes) as being a wart, but IIRC a newer extension replaces EXPUNGE events with VANISHED (I think it was CONDSTORE or QRESYNC) which uses UIDs and vastly reduces the chattyness of a large number of messages being expunged because it gives has a uid-set argument rather than getting 1 EXPUNGE event per message.<p>You argue that a stateful protocol is bad because it forces the client to re-sync with the server by re-SELECTing the folder and that it is slow even with QRESYNC. Okay, so.... what? A stateless protocol means that new messages can&#x27;t arrive if I get momentarily disconnected? And no other client can change flags on messages while I was momentarily disconnected?<p>That&#x27;s ridiculous. You need to re-sync even with a stateless client to make sure your local mirror is identical.<p>Sure, with a stateless protocol you don&#x27;t need to do that, your client could blissfully ignore the fact that another client could have changed something, but then again, you could do the same thing with IMAP - nothing forces you to have to do anything more than re-SELECT a folder and just blindly assume everything is identical to where you left it when you got disconnected. It&#x27;s foolish to do so, but it&#x27;s foolish to do so even with a stateless protocol...<p>> Go watch the video at <a href=""http://jmap.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmap.io</a> (recorded in Australia against a server in New York) and tell me you could do that via IMAP.<p>Okay, I watched the video. The IMAP client on the right was fetching far more information than it needed to which is why it was so much slower. You are comparing apples to oranges.<p>What do I mean by that? Well, it was pretty clear that the IMAP client was fetching information for far more messages than just the 5 or 6 that it was showing on the screen which is completely unnecessary. The &quot;snippet&quot; portion is slow, yes, because unfortunately right now, the client must wait for the initial FETCH request to return the BODYSTRUCTURE of all of the messages so that it can figure out which MIME part contains the message text and then issue FETCH requests for each of the messages one at a time (which is why you see each snippet load individually).<p>There is a current discussion on solving this problem with a SNIPPET extension for IMAP so that the client could request it in its initial FETCH request to get the summary info for the messages it will be displaying on the screen.<p>A lot of IMAP clients are extremely inefficient in the requests that they make and the fact that very few make use of PIPELINE&#x27;d commands.<p>> JMAP is a batch protocol<p>IMAP is also a batch protocol.<p>Let me ask you this: you say that IMAP is really chatty, and I will agree that some parts of it are, but fetching summary information needed to populate a message list is really not that bad.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at a FETCH response for a single message:<p>* 1 FETCH (UID 1 ENVELOPE (&quot;Fri, 17 Jul 2015 10:49:03 -0400&quot; &quot;This is the subject&quot; ((&quot;Example From&quot; NIL &quot;from&quot; &quot;example.com&quot;)) ((&quot;Example Sender&quot; NIL &quot;sender&quot; &quot;example.com&quot;)) ((&quot;Example Reply-To&quot; NIL &quot;reply-to&quot; &quot;example.com&quot;)) ((&quot;Example To&quot; NIL &quot;to&quot; &quot;example.com&quot;)) ((&quot;Example Cc&quot; NIL &quot;cc&quot; &quot;example.com&quot;)) ((&quot;Example Bcc&quot; NIL &quot;bcc&quot; &quot;example.com&quot;)) &quot;<in-reply-to@example.com>&quot; &quot;<message-id@example.com>&quot;) FLAGS (\Seen \Draft \Answered \Deleted))<p>Now let&#x27;s take a look at what this would look like in JMAP:<p>{ messageId: &quot;f123u457&quot;, date: &quot;2015-07-17T10:49:03Z&quot;, subject: &quot;This is the subject&quot;, from: [{name: &quot;Example From&quot;, email: &quot;from@example.com&quot;}], sender: [{name: &quot;Example Sender&quot;, email: &quot;sender@example.com&quot;}], replyTo: [{name: &quot;Example Reply-To&quot;, email: &quot;reply-to@example.com&quot;}], to: [{name: &quot;Example To&quot;, email: &quot;to@example.com&quot;}], cc: [{name: &quot;Example Cc&quot;, email: &quot;cc@example.com&quot;}], bcc: [{name: &quot;Example Bcc&quot;, email: &quot;bcc@example.com&quot;}], inReplyTo: &quot;<in-reply-to@example.com&quot;>, isUnseen: false, isDraft: true, isAnswered: true, isDeleted: true }<p>This is longer than the IMAP response!<p>Do you see why I called bullshit on your video comparison? It was obvious that your example IMAP client is purposely inefficient to make JMAP look good.<p>But let&#x27;s ignore that for a moment... let&#x27;s pretend JMAP is all that and a bag of chips.<p>What now? Since IMAP with all of the latest extensions to optimize/fix all of the problems with the original protocol have been around for years and yet many servers still do not implement them (if they did, there wouldn&#x27;t really be a need for JMAP), what makes you think mail hosts will suddenly jump at the chance to implement a whole new protocol when they couldn&#x27;t be bothered to implement existing extensions that would have drastically improved the user experience for their customers?",1437187051

9906317,comment,9905847,9905847,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"The article and comments miss what I think are tremendously important issues in this discussion: collective memory and group think. People in groups often take on a particular culture with group-specific reactions, activities, <i>and memories</i>. We&#x27;ve seen people get internally divided between their individual thought/reaction and the group thought/reaction on a given experience. Further, although author rejects U.S. feeling pain, Americans as a whole reacted with much of the same pain and shock when they watched planes hit the Twin Towers. Their emotional response mostly went in the same direction with the conflicts coming in on their assessments of what happened and what do do. Much like internal to the brain, conflict resolution and consensus kicked in to converge majority on an overall reaction that all Americans were conscious of.<p>So, groups and even America often act like an individual might even in terms of feelings. The groups memory is spread out among parts of its members. New members, like the author&#x27;s aliens, even get some of that memory through information exchange, stories, sharing feelings, and indoctrination. Their mind can transition to a cross between individual mind and the group&#x27;s mind.<p>So, brain stores its knowledge in neural connections and states updated by certain processes. Consciousness emerges. Details of it have varying levels of internal strength, conflict, and so on. Human groups store their knowledge in individual brains and connections between them via senses. Group&#x27;s consciousness similarly has varying levels of commitment to specific ideas or actions with conflict. The question is, &quot;What&#x27;s the real difference here and how far can it go?&quot;<p>If it can go far enough, then the U.S. might be conscious, have a collective memory, have the ability to feel pain collectively, and have an intent formed of members&#x27; consensus. That&#x27;s stronger than the author&#x27;s own claim. Yet, I think I&#x27;ve cited examples to back some of it up. The U.S. itself doesn&#x27;t need a brain: its identity can be made of pieces of other brains, both storing knowledge & having feelings, plus their interactions with each other.<p>Note: I&#x27;ll end with a possibly controversial view that I don&#x27;t think all of U.S.&#x27;s members make up its consciousness. I think it filters out a lot of them.
