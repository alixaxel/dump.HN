I believe the appropriate term is &quot;Quid Pro Quo.&quot;<p>> ... it disguises the fact that YT arent the ones who are suffering from the consequences of this trend - publishers using it as a platform are.<p>Cannot the same thing be said to the people employed by content producers such as Viacom et al?  When Youtube used the same &quot;we&#x27;ll take this stuff down, but drag our heels doing it&quot; tactics Facebook is doing now, were not real artists impacted?  How is &quot;publishers using it as a platform&quot; in any way different than &quot;publishers using Viacom as a platform?&quot;<p>> By bringing up Facebooks privacy policy you are adding nothing to the discussion of the culture of FB users stealing YouTube users&#x27; videos sans accreditation.<p>I brought up Facebook&#x27;s &quot;Terms of Service&quot; because I find it repugnant.

It already has contention on a queue (the chan), it&#x27;s just the chan-chan-Worker rather than chan-Job. In practice, go channels happily handle millions of messages contending to multiple workers just fine. Consider this test example where you aren&#x27;t even actually burning any CPU to perform the work:<p><pre><code>    package main\n    \n    func main() {\n        q := make(chan int)    \n        for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {    \n                go func() {    \n                        for x := range q {    \n                                x = x * 10    \n                        }    \n                }()    \n        }    \n    \n        for i := 0; i < 1000000; i++ {    \n                q <- i    \n        }    \n    }\n</code></pre>\nOn my laptop, it runs in 0.333s single core, and it&#x27;s slightly slower when you set GOMAXPROCS > 1. But not much slower, the total runtime goes to 0.4-0.5s or so. (Measured with go 1.4).

My initial thoughts:<p>- Do taxis really modularize payment while Uber integrates it? Why is there an additional value capture for Uber in this part of the chain? Taxi drivers have to pay taxi companies heavy rent anyway - which is equivalent to Uber taking a large cut of revenue.<p>- Do hotels modularize reservations while Airbnb integrates them? I think it&#x27;s arguable that Airbnb is banking on its differentiated offering (homes vs hotel rooms) and lower prices to attract customers to its &quot;integrated&quot; reservation system. But hotel chains have &quot;integrated&quot; reservations too - they just also choose to distribute rooms through other channels (and Airbnb probably does as well).<p>- The Christensen hypothesis that profits lie in some uncommoditized part of the value chain looks like a bit of a truism - some part of the chain has to offer some supernormal profits, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be much of an industry to run a business in. (And there are probably exceptions: industries massive enough that virtually every part is commoditized.)<p>That said, as an Econ/Business major, I appreciated his analysis.

There are some advanced materials that are basically very advanced diffusers with a defined scattering distribution.<p>But BEFs are dirt cheap and do a very good job for this, your run-of the mill backlighting setup for screens is a very simple, effective system. Also: Using two linear BEFs (rotated relative to each other at a right angle) is more efficient than one pyramidal film.<p>The losses I mentioned are because of the light-recycling: You get lots more back reflections into the system - every ray that doesn&#x27;t have the right exit angle gets reflected/refracted back into the system, the phosphor will absorb/re-emit/scatter, randomizing the ray&#x27;s direction again and the ray &#x27;retries&#x27; to get out of the system with a different angle.<p>These processes naturally induce losses (non-radiative decay in the phosphor, Fresnel losses at one of the BEFs, no perfect reflection on the back mirror). Even if you only lose a fraction of a percent, you lose that fraction lots of times before a ray may make it out of the system. It adds up - still, the collimation is very good for such a simple system (i.e. slap two films for a few dollars per sqm over your emitting area) it should be very easy to test.<p>Edit: You&#x27;ll get the best collimation for 90°-angle prism films - there are other BEF types that&#x27;ll smooth the angular distribution of the light recycling for wide viewing-angle displays.",1436426243

The reason of the behavior of Gmail with your domain is not easy to understand, a theory could be that in the past someone has used it for sending spam, and even if it was not your server, you are paying for this.<p>The solution we have used, it was bring Gmail to understand that your emails have been sent from a real user. You can simulate a conversation between your domain and other Gmail accounts. Send a first email, with a realistic text, to a Gmail account, if it goes in spam, mark as safe (remove it from spam), and reply to it, always with a realistic text. Continue to simulate a normal conversation, sending 4/5 emails between the 2 account. Re-do the operation from another Gmail account, but this time do the opposite:\nstart from the Gmail one.<p>It not bulletproof, but it has worked in the past for us.",1436425494
