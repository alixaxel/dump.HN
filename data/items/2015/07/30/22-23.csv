I&#x27;m not happy with the design of my part of my current project, either, and I&#x27;ve been doing this for thirty years.  (You <i>will</i> get better at design with more experience (and more input from good software designers).  I&#x27;m <i>way</i> better at it than I was in my twenties.  But there&#x27;s still plenty of places that I&#x27;m not satisfied with the design.)<p>Are you by any chance a perfectionist?  There always will be places to improve your designs, especially if you&#x27;re a perfectionist.  Part of the answer is to not be such a perfectionist.  You can scale perfection (or almost perfection) up to a point, but not beyond; 2000 lines seems like reasonably close to the breaking point.<p>Everybody&#x27;s more comfortable in their preferred environment.  Learning a new set of tools is not fun, because you&#x27;re less effective than you would be in your normal environment, and you know it, and you compare your clumsiness with the new tool to how well you can do with the old one.  But you sound like a pretty smart person, and you should be able to learn new things pretty readily.  It sounds like you&#x27;re unwilling to ride through the phase of uneasiness, of I-don&#x27;t-know-how-to-do-<i>anything</i>-with-this-stupid-new-tool, of feeling dumb and clumsy, for long enough to become proficient.  Look, I don&#x27;t like having to do that, either.  I usually kind of resist doing so for a while.  But don&#x27;t let it stop you from learning new stuff; <i>whatever</i> you go into, you&#x27;re going to have to do that.",1438297154

Signing long lease with them just doesn&#x27;t make sense.  By definition a startup is an experiment to build products and a business in a short amount of time, with one to two years of funding in most cases.  9 out of 10 these experiments fail, so 9 out 10 startup tenants will move out after a short time.  Commercial landlords want long term tenants, not people going out of business in one or two years.<p>Commercial lease is really only applied to companies that can stay in business.  A long lease is often not enforceable.  The incorporated company simply declares bankruptcy and it&#x27;s hard to collect the money on the full term of the lease.  I remember in the Dot Com bust days some failing startups simply stopped paying rents but stayed on, to stretch that last dollar or to burn out that security deposit.",1438297033

Hashes aren&#x27;t the ultimate solution.<p>Certainly hashes will make things a lot better, but a lot of people I know (including some of the people referenced in the article) are heralding them as the second coming of the web.<p>I disagree because they present more problems, ones that are harder for humans and easier for machines. First off, in order to find the data you practically speaking have to already have the data. Second, if you don&#x27;t have the data, then you have to know the hash, but how do you know the hash without having had the data OR trusting some authority for the hash? Now you are back to centralization.<p>Third, and most important from my perspective, a hash often times will point to outdated content because by the time you find it it might have changed (this of course is a good thing but can be problematic). I know they addressed this a little bit in the article but it is worth reiterating. The point is that it is hard to do synchronization on hashes and I would argue that sync is the more important problem and that is what I am trying to address in my open source database.",1438296964

One of the things Amazon does really really well is the logistics of shipping the product to the customers and while a bunch of people coming together to buy goods straight from the producer would cut out the profit taken by the middleman it wouldn&#x27;t help with getting the items to your door. Individual manufacturers simply can&#x27;t negotiate the contracts that Amazon has with UPS and individual manufacturers don&#x27;t have the the warehouses and the massive infrastructure Amazon has. If a producer made 10,000 widgets and sent them out to 10,000 people that is a lot more difficult than simply sending a pallet to Amazon and having them sell the items and send them to the customers. They aren&#x27;t just some website that lets you buy things, there is an enormous infrastructure that supports the commerce.<p>This is something you can get a better sense for when you back Kickstarter projects and see just how much time is spent around packaging and shipping. It is a huge task that a lot of inexperienced companies get totally swamped by.<p>Edit: I would also like to add that if we bought goods straight from the manufacturer then we would have to deal with greater ship times as well. If you&#x27;re ordering something from a factory across the US it&#x27;s going to take a week to get to you. But if Amazon or another marketplace has already purchased the item and stores it a day away from you or in the same city (knowing that there is a chance someone like you is going to order one soon) then you can get the item much faster. That convenience is something that really only a logistics and warehousing middleman can do effectively and people pay for that convenience.<p>Edit 2: I don&#x27;t work for or am affiliated with Amazon.com - I just have seen into the belly of the beast at a few online retailers and have good sense of what goes on in there.",1438296561

That&#x27;s several gigabytes of memory and storage at the very least, and you&#x27;d need a copy of that for every spoken language you&#x27;d want to support. Plus you need to keep that up to date with new words and phrases; it&#x27;s much easier to keep models fresh on a server than on everyone&#x27;s computer.<p>Power and CPU time are also a concern. Big beefy server farms can have trouble keeping up with state of the art speech recognition algorithms; a laptop, tablet or phone is going to struggle, especially when running off a battery, is at a huge disadvantage.<p>But the biggest advantage to server-based speech recognition is indeed that more data is critical to improving accuracy and performance.

I would like to see a picture of an eel when I move my gaze vertically or horizontally. So there must be at least one eel in the vertical column and at least one in the horizontal row.”</i><p>It does not mention each canvas must be a unique sea creature - merely that it must be single (one sea creature per canvas). I&#x27;d paint an eel on every single canvas, out of laziness.<p>Introducing a bet to not paint in the corner means I would paint on 5 canvases, not including the corner piece. This changes what I am predicting though by skewing my decision. It&#x27;s asking a completely different question. As catbird pointed out, this is like asking the probability of flipping a coin. Then asking what if you knew the coin was biased to always land on heads and you placed a bet with a friend about the result being heads or tails, what would you vote?<p>The probability is 1 in 6. Their are 6 canvases and only a single corner piece. When introducing the bet, do we assume you want to win $2 over paying $1 100% of the time? If so the probability turns from 1/6 to 0/6 - as the artist, in their best interest, would never paint an eel in the corner.<p>The probabilities of 1/4 and 1/3 are asking different questions. It&#x27;s no longer asking if the piece is a corner piece but whether it is at a specific end of a row or column.<p>It&#x27;s extremely naive because it doesn&#x27;t say which end of the row or column forms the L with the column or row. Therefore both ends are valid and it would be 2/4 and 2/3 because the eel could be at either end and still form an L.<p>So it&#x27;s 0/1, 1/6, 1/3, 1/4, 2/4, and 2/3 depending on the actual question being asked.",1438295701

To me this suggests perhaps some room for growth as well.

9978642,comment,9974374,9976173,0,0,danharaj,,,"I think the solution is fewer solutions. When I am working well with others, there&#x27;s nothing much to fuss about. When there are conflicts, it&#x27;s not ideology or a system that wins the day. I think we two would collaborate just fine without such stuff, for instance. What works in conflict is the willingness to discard systems and ideas. Or, even better, the lack of willfulness to enforce systems and ideas in the first place.<p>Being conceptually slippery enough to get out of any problem comes naturally to skillful people in their fields. The situation at hand provides all the impetus for theory and practice there is. Conflict thrives off of superfluity: superfluous methods, superfluous justifications, and superfluous issues. Methodology and structure gets in the way of skillfulness.<p>I know that real human power scales on its own without armies and guns forcing it into a certain shape. People collaborate and collude very easily. People form groups very easily. People associate with people. It&#x27;s probably the only culturally universal thing people do (well of course; culture only makes sense when there are associating people).<p>If we want association to work well, groups need to be able to disintegrate as easily as they come together. People need to be slippery, too. Without what makes groups cohere, they disintegrate on their own. When you see violence and hierarchy used to keep groups coherent, it means they&#x27;ve lost the essential power that makes them useful.<p>People like achieving status. Status is a social signal, and it communicates both ways. Status is not held like a title. Titles wax and wane in the status they confer just like every other human object and activity. When we pretend status can be held, that it can be concentrated and preserved, we get problems. If we let status come and go by its own logic, we&#x27;d have no problems with status. A society where status is maintained by a legal system will have hierarchies, and it will certainly have problems.<p>So ways that our current systems-- not just capitalism, fail:\nLabor is not free.\nAssociation is not free.\nStatus is not free.<p>Even skillful people who believe in property as an organizing force wish to be locally free in these ways. Skillful people want to work unimpeded by the politics of labor, associating with likeminded people unimpeded by the politics of social groups, praised for the inherent virtue of their actions and unimpeded by the politics of status. They only believe in property because it helps them manage the world that is beyond their control, beyond the means of their skill. They use property to create a bubble in which they can live that is free from its control.<p>People who believe in property because they enjoy its logic, enjoy the wheeling and dealing, enjoy the frantic rush to get more of it, who feel more worthwhile the more property they have are nervous people, who can never be fulfilled, because property&#x27;s logic does not lead to fullness, the only conclusion is &#x27;not enough&#x27;, the only purpose is &#x27;more&#x27;.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many people in the latter category actually exist. I suspect enough to cause a great deal of problems. In any case they require the assent of everyone else. I think all I have to say to everyone else is this:<p>The world without property is still full and whole, is still just, is still full of vitality, is still nourishing, and receptive to human power.",1438295065

Basecamp is entirely remote with an office just for show. They only use it a few times a year. Unless you build hardware, an office is unnecessary. A dumb waste of money, especially early in a startup&#x27;s life. I do some side work for a major international medical lab and their entire Dev team is remote -- and this is enterprise. I am not sure some flower delivery app that aggregates social sharing metrics using Go really needs to have an office. As far as &#x27;access to talent,&#x27; that&#x27;s a bulkshit metric as well. Remote workers can be anywhere. You can even hire foreign workers without needing visas. Most engineers aren&#x27;t living in San Fran except for their jobs. Making $140k per year is the San Fran equivalent of minimum wage, especially if you have a family. Compare that cost of living to any other place in the country and San Fran engineers actually don&#x27;t get paid very well at all. Add California taxes into it and I&#x27;m just not getting the attraction.<p>I live in the South of France in a big house that costs me $800 per month. I am about a 10 min walk from the TGV station that can take me to Paris in just over 2 hours. My kids are in French pre-k, I have top notch medical insurance that costs $139 per month to cover the whole family beyond the government insurance and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my wife getting harassed by urine soaked homeless people at BART stations.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for all engineers but given that there is an entire word outside of San Franscisco, I can see zero advantage to living there. Talent is there because they have to be. I&#x27;m sure a huge percentage would rather be working from a beach in Thailand or Tulum.<p>As far as investors, who cares? If you have a product people want to buy, investors will come to you. It&#x27;s a myth that proximity matters. There were investors long before Silicon Valley startups were a thing. Plenty of billion dollar companies founded everywhere else. At this point, San Fran and the valley are prestige locations as opposed to offering any competitive advantages.",1438295047

Specifically, that the update experience appears to have been designed to throw away the choice your customers have made about the Internet experience they want, and replace it with the Internet experience Mozilla wants them to have.<p>When we first saw the Firefox upgrade experience that strips users of their choice by effectively overriding existing user preferences for the search engine and other apps, and forces the integration of Pocket and Sync, we reached out to your team to discuss this issue. Unfortunately, it didn’t result in any meaningful progress, hence this letter.<p>We appreciate that it’s still technically possible to preserve people’s previous settings and defaults, but the design of the whole upgrade experience and the default settings APIs have been changed to make this less obvious and more difficult. It now takes more than twice the number of mouse clicks, scrolling through content and some technical sophistication for people to reassert the choices they had previously made in earlier versions of Firefox. It’s confusing, hard to navigate and easy to get lost.<p>Sometimes we see great progress, where consumer products respect individuals and their choices. However, with the launch of Firefox 38.0.5  we are deeply disappointed to see Mozilla take such a dramatic step backwards.<p>These changes are unsettling because there are millions of users who love Firefox and who are having their choices ignored, and because of the increased complexity put into everyone’s way if and when they choose to make a choice different than what Mozilla prefers.<p>We strongly urge you to reconsider your business tactic here and again respect people’s right to choice and control of their online experience by making it easier, more obvious and intuitive for people to maintain the choices they have already made through the upgrade experience. It should be easier for people to assert new choices and preferences, not just for other Mozilla products, through the default settings APIs and user interfaces.<p>Please give your users the choice and control they deserve in Firefox.",1438294547

Politically, it becomes explicitly a welfare system for people that did not save for retirement and penalizes those that do save. Once Social Security is perceived as &quot;unearned&quot; it becomes an acceptable target for reduction or elimination to the population at large.<p>Social Security is in fact a welfare tax and no one is entitled to receive it (see: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemming_v._Nestor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemming_v._Nestor</a>) but its political viability is dependent on the popular perception to the contrary.",1438294534

It doesn&#x27;t say they will send audio data, it at most says &quot;associated input data&quot; which for all I know could be a database from their algorithms, or it could be a live 24/7 stream from my webcam and audio device.<p>I guess the thing is that some things are not acceptable, and whether there&#x27;s a disclaimer or not, people aren&#x27;t going to like it if we find out that all of our audio is being recorded and uploaded to Microsoft.

Or they could just not mention it at all.<p>The question is are you willing to trust the OS.  I mean, hell, Ubuntu Linux went and sent all of your search information to Amazon without even giving you the option to opt out in the install process at one point.  It could be disabled, but unless you knew about it in advance there was no option to do so.  And Ubuntu is open source.<p>I can see use cases for it, and one actually ties into the location services.  Say you&#x27;re from a region with a specific accent.  If the system can tell how you speak, and how other people speak around you, it might be able to create an accent subset for you based on the collective data from all of those speakers.  It might be able to guess from a few sentences and your location that you&#x27;re Glaswegian and start to understand you, not because you trained it, but because across the region many people have trained it a bit.   Then with the location to tie the regional accent together, even if you&#x27;re in the US once you&#x27;ve spoken a few phrases it might be able to identify you as belonging to that regional language group.<p>But uploading of all spoken data to Microsoft would be silly, not just because it would piss people off, but because it wouldn&#x27;t be something you could hide, and it would end up being quite a lot of data that&#x27;s really not that useful.<p>But could it be possible?

We don&#x27;t sweep the radar side-to-side, but since it&#x27;s on a moving platform, we see the same thing from multiple angles. In the data I showed, there has been some very limited stacking applied, mostly just to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The next level of processing would be focusing/migration (depending on whether you&#x27;re in the radar or seismic world) - it reasons about possible incident angle and collapses the hyperbolas to a single point.<p>Unfortunately, this only improves the resolution along the flight track; features parallel to the flight path and offset to the side are the hardest to filter out.",1438293850
