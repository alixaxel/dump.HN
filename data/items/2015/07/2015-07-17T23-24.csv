9905983,comment,9905475,9905475,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Been down this route with my current company. Sorry if this answer is long winded, but I want to give a full description of why being a single co-founder worked for me personally. I am currently finishing up my first year in business and am only now in the process of bringing on a co-founder. There were some benefits and pitfalls to this approach, but looking back I would not have done it any differently and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about the decision to proceed alone. I should note that a lot of this had to do with complete luck as I will explain below.<p>First, I am building a niche, taboo startup (helping ex-offenders through re-entry). When I first started many of my friends, and people I considered potential co-founders, found the idea a little too risky or crazy for their liking. Many didn&#x27;t understand the market and were skeptical that a market even existed. I was not going to give up though and was bound and determined to get a business model built and launched, so I pressed forward. Bringing on a co-founder just to say you have a co-founder is a the perfect recipe for disaster in my opinion.<p>Out of luck I got accepted into an accelerator program for social impact startups. The overall value of the program is a blog post in itself, but the one enormous benefit that came from it was the connections within city government and other startups. It is through this that I ended up meeting my co-founder. We are still hashing out the exact details of our agreement, but our skill sets compliment each other and we get along good. He also understands the market, has experience in it, and knows the business side of building this type of business. I could not be happier for the way it worked out. The whole process has allowed me to essentially do a &quot;co-founder dating&quot; period without giving up equity or IP secrets, and it allowed each of us to work together and see how we got along before getting into a relationship.<p>Now to give you the flip side and why I believe this approach worked for me personally. I had a previous startup where I partnered with individuals I considered friends. We ended up having an ugly falling out over money and development of the product. The fallout was devastating personally and financially for me, and while I take a considerable amount of the blame for the initial fallout, their actions after the fallout are what made the situation even worse (they divulged company data, were highly vocal to potential customers and investors, etc..). They essentially made it impossible for me to succeed even if I wanted to. While I probably could have sued, I ultimately felt it was easier to lick my wounds and walk away. I also felt that suing would just take me down to their level, and wasn&#x27;t worth the battle (no matter what side you are on, lawsuits are not pretty or fun).<p>Long story short, the experience made me extremely skeptical going into my new venture of who I would bring on as a co-founder. When you hear the horror stories of co-founder breakups or that they are one of the leading causes of potentially good ideas failing as a business, I can attest to the outcomes. Ironically, the only reason I had taken on co-founders in the first place was because of outside pressure from potential investors that I needed to have at least one other person. Investments we didn&#x27;t even end up getting.<p>Having a co-founder has its benefits and pitfalls in my opinion. Nobody can deny that the right co-founder is the ultimate blessing. They are someone who is right there in the battle with you through the good and the bad. They are someone you can call at 4am with a whimsical idea and know they completely understand why you called and get equally excited. They are someone that is in the ring fighting with you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The problem arises though when one of you can no longer afford to stay in the ring and continue to fight. Whether that is due to financial or personal reasons is irrelevant. When the frustration from one side grows so much that communication between the parties diminishes or does not occur at all, the fallout will begin. Each party will begin to blame the other, regardless of who is at fault. When this starts to happen, how it is ultimately handled by both sides together will determine whether the business comes out intact or fails. Best advice I can say here is to have a neutral third-party that can mediate the fallout. This is probably why you see funded companies navigate co-founder breakups easier than un-funded companies. Good investors know breakups happen and are ready to step in and help you navigate that breakup. Without that third-party though it is difficult and the chances of making through successfully are not in your favor.<p>While the building of my current startup has taken a little longer without a co-founder, it gave me some advantages. First, I had no one to blame but myself if the business fails. This gave me great incentive to succeed. Second it allowed me to be in the fight without having to be in the ring. Meaning that I while I was determined to build a business, if at anytime I wanted to quit the decision was fully mine and I could walk away without losing friendships or future business partners. Finally, it is giving me an enormous advantage as I prepare to finally enter the ring with my new co-founder. I have a product developed, it works, and I have people using the service daily. I don&#x27;t have to sell anyone on the idea or business. Is the business 100% or completely finished, absolutely not. But one of the biggest hurdles has been jumped and by bringing on the co-founder now, it is more like tag-team wrestling where I can hand off the product and let him go sell. This doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t have to do anything from here on, it just pulls an enormous amount of pressure off me. It gives me time now to focus on fixing bugs, adding new features, cleaning up rushed portions of code (don&#x27;t deny it we all do it), etc...<p>I should note that there were a few key items that I think made a big difference for me along the way. First, while I lean towards being an introvert, I consider myself fairly good at networking and making connections. As I was flushing out my business model, I reached out to a lot of people in the industry and made some great connections along the way. I also applied to several accelerator programs. Two of the programs that I applied to, while I was not accepted, have gone above and beyond in helping me. From introductions to answering emails at 3am providing design input/advice for my website/product. Neither of these teams had to do this for me, yet they believed in me and my idea enough that they go out of their way to answer my emails directly and provide feedback. I also have a good core group of friends that I can ping ideas off of and support me, and while they may think I am crazy at times they are there for me if I need them. I don&#x27;t think without these pieces that I would have (a) survived the first year by myself, (b) made it to where I am today with the product.<p>So to answer your original question, by all means go for it! The right person will come along, and when they do, you will know it immediately.",1437176414

The main trick is decomposition of the application, data model, and operations such that every process may have a thousand discrete and disjoint shards of &quot;stuff&quot; it shares with no other process. The large number of shards per process mean that average load across shards will be relatively balanced. The &quot;one shard per server/core&quot; model is popular but poor architecture precisely because it is expensive to keep balanced.<p>However, in these models you rarely move data between cores because it is expensive, both due to NUMA and cache effects. Instead, you move the operations to the data, just like you would in a big distributed system. This is the part most software engineers are not used to -- you move the operations to the threads that own the data rather moving to the data to the threads (traditional multithreading) that own the operations. Moving operations is almost always much cheaper than moving data, even within a single server, and operations are not updatable shared state.<p>This turns out to be a very effective architecture for highly concurrent, write heavy software like database engines. It is much faster than, for example, the currently trendy lock-free architectures. Most of the performance benefit is much better locality and fewer stalls or context switches, but it has the added benefit of implementation simplicity since your main execution path is not sharing anything.",1437175870

Nothing magical, but it is designed in a very clever way.<p>Our eyes have three types of cones, call them L, M, and S (you might think &quot;RGB&quot; but it&#x27;s really not, but that&#x27;s not a bad lie to believe).  Between L and M, for example, there is a fair bit of overlap.  So, these glasses filter out the colors in the middle, where L and M overlap the most.  This means that the only colors which make it through are the colors which your eye can distinguish better, making the colors more vibrant.<p>This works because most colors are a mix of a bunch of different frequencies of light.  Say, ROYGBIV.  Maybe you have color blindness and a ROY mix looks the same as an OYG mix.  These glasses will filter out OY, so you are left with R in one mix, and G in the other mix.  These are easier to tell apart.<p>So, obviously not perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be.  It just needs to be better than what nature gave you (if you&#x27;re colorblind).  It also doesn&#x27;t work for people with, say, 100% deuteranopia, but most people with color blindness aren&#x27;t that severe.",1437174803

This approach will let us build containers which homomorphically process data, and decay in a number of questions less than the number which would deplete the privacy of the data in the container. (For various reasons, operating in homomorphic space gives you increasingly fuzzy answers the more questions you ask, and thus you cross a probability bound on your answer being useless near when the privacy is depleted.)<p>While this isn&#x27;t perfect, since you still need to trust that we&#x27;re both a) not storing the base keys and b) did our math/implementation correctly, it&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the trust asked for by marketing companies now. (Especially since contracts could require us to do those things fairly easily, thus exposing us to breach of contract if we failed to.

Basically, creating the closing bracket, quote, etc. every time you open bracket, quote, etc.)<p>vim-easymotion (this is a very interesting plugin. I would recommend that you check it out to get an idea of what it does. It&#x27;s useful when trying to navigate around the screen)<p>syntastic (syntax checker for multiple languages)<p>tagbar (if you enjoy having a small summary of all the functions and variables in the current file, this is for you)<p>supertab (vim uses c-p and c-n to complete words in insert mode. supertab allows you to complete with tab instead of c-p and c-n. If you are used to using tab in other editors, this will help you)<p>vim-fugitive (quite nice if you are use git. Helps you comparing newer and older revisions, for example. You can open a modified file with vim, write :Gdiff and get the uncommited changes)<p>youcompleteme (the best code completion tool available. Has very good context completion)<p>vim-colorschemes (a collection of a million different colorschemes to try)<p>vim-hybrid (my favorite dark colorscheme by far)",1437174130

If you suspect that you will quickly get sick of music, why not just spend the money on books instead? I mean, if I found that every time I bought fish and chips I felt sick afterwards I wouldn&#x27;t start stealing it without paying, I would just stop eating it.<p>If you steal music in digital form without paying for it, of course it is not lost as with a physical object, but you have lowered the equilibrium price of the good by unilaterally increasing the overall supply.",1437174111

But sometimes the cost of copying is too high, and that&#x27;s what shared memory is for.<p>Take, for example, a simple texturing fragment shader in GLSL. You&#x27;re not going to copy the entire texture to every single GPU unit; it might be a 4096x4096 texture you&#x27;re rendering only a dozen pixels of. Rather, you take advantage of the caching behavior of the memory hierarchy to have each shading unit only cache the part it needs. This is what shared memory can do for you: it enables you to use the hardware to <i>dynamically</i> distribute the data around to maximize locality.",1437174084

It set an industry standard and a format that I&#x27;m sure will stick for a long time. It made huge strides in quality control and tackled a lot of the problems in the industry, if not completely solving them. You can only hope that Google keeps that spirit alive, and having met her, I have only amazing things from the impression that Adora Cheung left on me. I&#x27;m sure whatever she chooses to do next, she&#x27;ll do it well.",1437174004
