It&#x27;s not like millions of VC money is being raised before that even happens. Except for some cases of stupidity, like Color or Clinkle; those are the anomalies IMO.<p>What we&#x27;re discussing is where to take the venture/project after figuring out, &quot;Holy shit, there are probably millions willing to pay money for this, we&#x27;ve hit gold.&quot; Most ventures don&#x27;t have that moment - or even worse, miss that realization if it&#x27;s true.<p>So the smart ones start arming up -- getting those big VC dollars to grow the venture as fast as possible before someone else realizes what they&#x27;ve done and tries to do the same.

9820831,comment,9819798,9820641,0,0,brighteyes,,,"Something being &quot;incredibly obvious&quot; is not scientific evidence.<p>First thing, there are huge genetic differences in non-mental traits, like height for example. No one doubts that. And many people use those to infer the same is true of mental qualities, but that would need to be proven separately.<p>Heritability studies show that IQ is in fact significantly heritable. But these do not prove what non-scientists often assume. Heritability is the percentage of variability due to genetic differences, but it is always relative to an environment. Genes are meaningless without environments. For example, if we as a cultural thing feed shorthair cats different diets than longhair cats, and the diets affect their weight, then genetics would explain much of that variability. Cat weight would be heritable, strictly speaking, but in a different environment - all cats get the same food - it would not be.<p>Various sources of evidence show that IQ is heritable in humans, but depends heavily on the environment. For example, adopted black children have higher IQs when raised by white parents, most of the difference between black and white kids goes away in that case.<p>Is that the final answer? We honestly don&#x27;t know. To really study it, we&#x27;d need to do unethical things - raise people in controlled experiments - which we simply won&#x27;t do. But we do know that cultural effects are very large, and they might mask genetic effects.<p>In practice, though, heritability still holds. People are born with genetics and those genetics are correlated to certain environments, and reactions from those environments. So even if in some theoretical way we are &quot;born with equal mental potential&quot;, given the world as it is, that simply isn&#x27;t true. But it could change.",1435863251

It also depends on where the server is, physically - is it in your home or in some data center?<p>If it&#x27;s system administration, one example that is reasonably useful is setting up an owncloud server. Or a private mail server. If it is in your home, setting up a DHCP server and a DNS server can be a fun excercise. In any case, there are <i>many</i> tutorials and HOWTOs available online. The search engine of your choice will tell you where. Most major linux distros also come with pretty good documentation or at least have some online.\n(Depending on the circumstances, you might consider reinstalling the system first - without physical access to the machine, it is not easy, though.)<p>If you want to learn about software development, there are more things you can do with a linux server than I can think of. When I try to think of a fun programming project, I often make the mistake of thinking of the technology (programming language, libraries/frameworks) first and then choosing a problem that goes with it. For <i>learning</i>, though, it can be a good idea - so I want to learn about, say, building web apps with Ruby on Rails or Django or whatever; what better way to learn about that than building a small toy application? Okay, now all I need is a nice toy problem, difficult enough to actually teach me something, but not difficult enough to be frustrating.<p>Again, there far too many tutorials out there for me to mention anything specific. (Just as an example, I taught myself Django by writing an application that is basically a glorified RSS reader with a builtin Bayes network - I could rate news as boring or interesting, and after a while the app could classify news items a &quot;probably boring&quot; or &quot;probably interesting&quot; well enough so I could make it filter out news that were &quot;probably boring&quot;. It did not work <i>that</i> well, was really slow, and I basically suck at UI design, so it was really ugly, too, but it was still useful and fun to build.)<p>I hope this helps at least a little. I am staying fairly vague because your question is kind of vague. If you supplied more details about your interest or your skills/background, I might be able to give a more helpful answer. Generally speaking, try to think of something that would be actually useful to you - that way, motivation will be less of a problem, and it will probably be more fun, as well. (To be honest, learning about Linux / Unix can be very frustrating initially - within the first six months of using Linux on my desktop, I was <i>very</i> close to physically throwing my computer out of the window no less than three times. The learning curve can be steep at the beginning, but to me, in retrospect, it was time well spent. It also tends to be a great deal of fun after a while.)",1435862468

But I think pass is on the correct side of this tradeoff:<p>1. ./blah.sh | grep LookupKey exposes just as much information as pass -c LookupKey. If someone has access to your machine and you don&#x27;t carefully prune your bash history file, then you&#x27;re screwed. However, in the latter case, at least you get something at the cost of giving up security -- namely, the convenience of tab completion.<p>2. The only way to solve problem #1 in general is to have multi-stage authentication, where you authenticate to access to lookup keys and then authenticate again to access the passwords. That&#x27;s achievable using pass and some Bash -- obfuscate file names and store a obfuscated -> actual mapping in a gpg-encrypted file, and write a bash script that does the ln -s&#x27;ing. And then the command that does that dumps you into a shell that doesn&#x27;t record history.<p>I did this for a while but found it&#x27;s a bit of PITA. Also, I can almost always come up with names that would be difficult to exploit without a lot of information about my life (bank_primary, bank_secondary; email/personal, email/business, email/spammy; server/personal, server/2011; and so on. I won&#x27;t remember these verbatim, but once tab-completion reminds me of my options I typically recall which is which. And in case you&#x27;re afraid in several years you&#x27;ll forget which server you first purchased in 2011, you can always just pass -e server/2011 and explain which one you meant in subsequent lines.",1435862394

9820734,comment,9818325,9818325,0,0,nkurz,,,"I want to remind international readers that confessions by a defendant in an American often have little to do with truth, but with calculated odds.  One should not assume that just because a defendant &quot;admits&quot; to having done any particular act, that they actually did so.  While the confession provides some evidence that the defendant is guilty of something (to the extent that this makes them more likely to be found guilty by a jury of a particular set of charges) the exact details of a confession should be trusted less than the details that result from a full trial.<p>The confession is a charade, usually coordinated in advance with the prosecution.  Almost never is the confession made because the defendant suddenly realizes that wrongness of their actions, and simply wants to avoid burdening everyone with the effort of a lengthy trial.  Instead, the defendant is threatened with a terrible punishment, and told that unless they cooperate the chances are high (regardless of their actual guilt) that this punishment will occur.  They are offered (or offer on their own) a &quot;plea bargain&quot;, where if they confess to a subset of the crimes with which they are charged, they can willingly accept a smaller (though often substantial) punishment.<p>The contents of the admission are a negotiation between the defendant and the prosecutor.  If the prosecutor demands that you confess to being a witch, and that if you don&#x27;t confess to being a witch there is a high likelihood that you will spend the rest of your life in jail being raped by unpleasant men, you don&#x27;t quibble about whether or not you are actually a witch.  You weigh the chances of a potentially unjust conviction with a horrible outcome against the chances that your lawyer will convince a jury that the charges are false, and if the odds are against you, you confess to being a witch in all the detail the prosecutor requests.<p>The harsher the punishment the defendant willingly accepts in the &quot;plea bargain&quot;, the more likely the admission was made under the duress of an even more severe punishment.  The accuracy of the details of the confession are equivalent to a confession under torture.  In torture, the punishment begins and in agony you are willing to confess to anything in hope that the punishment will stop.  In the plea bargaining system, you are threatened with a terrible punishment and confess to anything in hopes that the punishment will not start.  In neither case should the details of the confession be treated as true.<p>So while I presume this agent did lots of bad things, and probably stole the bitcoins in question, realize that the details of the admission are a just a plausible story written by someone wielding great power, signed under duress by a defendant justifiably scared of this power.  In the absence of outside evidence, the exact details should no more be treated as &quot;true&quot; than the dying confessions of a man broken on the wheel.",1435862287

On 5/21, a Navient rep inadvertently applied a false payment to one of my loans.  I then logged into my account on 06/01 and payed the total due for all of my loans.  When I logged into my account on 07/01 I saw that the loan in which the rep inadvertently applied a false payment to, was now showing payment missed and had a late fee applied to the loan.  What went wrong was because the Navient rep applied an incorrect payment to my loan, it was showing &#x27;up to date&#x27; on 06/01 and thus, when I clicked the &#x27;Pay Private Loans&#x27; button, it didn&#x27;t apply any payment to the loan in which the rep applied an incorrect payment.  The Navient rep then reversed the incorrect payment, without letting me know, resulting in my loan now being behind and late a month.  I immediately called the Navient customer support team and let them know the situation.  They said the best they could do was apologize and waive the late fee.  It then occurred to me that I&#x27;ve been overcharged interest on my July bill because now the interest had been calculated on the balance from May instead of a sum of interest accrued from the balance of May plus the interest accrued from the balance of June minus my monthly payment which wasn&#x27;t made because of an internal error by Navient.  I then decided to email their support team and let them know I had been overcharged interest due to an error on their side.<p>This was the response I received from my email,<p>&quot;Dear XXXX,<p>Thank you for your inquiry and for your business with Navient.<p>While your late fee has been removed, we are unable to waive an interest.  Per your promissory note, you are responsible for monthly payments each month.  Your interest assessed to your loans was in accordance with your promissory note, and would vary depending on which day you would have submitted your payment for June.<p>We apologize for any confusion that his may have caused.&quot;<p>It seems unethical to me that they are replying in regards to my promissory note and disregarding their violation of the contract when I enrolled in online billing.

It&#x27;s not just a game of memorization and regurgitation.<p>But O(1) for hash lookup feels like the old soft-sciency &quot;hey, you just have to memorize this&quot;.  I don&#x27;t have one consistent model that lets me derive bounds, and which produces O(1) for hash lookup and O(log n) for trie lookup.  The other convention of constant seek times is unrealistic [2], but it&#x27;s at least consistent.  This isn&#x27;t.<p>Rather, it&#x27;s supposed to be a big-O table.  If these were presented as &quot;in-practice&quot; bounds, with its own consistent logic about which resources are scarce relative to which, that would be a different story. Then I would have a consistent set of conventions that produce O(1); it wouldn&#x27;t come off as &quot;oh, we assume the rules don&#x27;t apply here&quot;.<p>>But saying that such a thing is possible is a simplifying assumption that we make, in general, for non-numeric algorithms: arithmetic is O(1).<p>Where?  Every treatment I&#x27;ve seen takes arithmetic as linear in the number of bits. [1] This is still consistent with O(n log n) for sorts because you can assume a bound on element size, and still only have constant factor overhead.<p>>Of course, real programs cannot do this for arbitrarily large numbers. So if you are actually concerned with arbitrarily large numbers, you must do something else. Thus, other sorts of analysis which would give you a different number for hash table complexity.

That&#x27;s not good.<p>I&#x27;d strongly recommend that you change it ASAP. The main two options are:<p>- The &#x27;I just don&#x27;t care&#x27; license: BSD 2-clause. This allows anyone to do anything with it, other than claim they wrote it. It&#x27;s the most open of the licenses. <a href=""http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause</a><p>- The &#x27;One true way&#x27; license: GPLv3. This is the classic copyleft license. It requires any modifications to the program to also be GPLv3&#x27;d. This requires quite a lot more thought, because if your compiler runtime is also GPLv3&#x27;d it means your compiler can&#x27;t be used to produce distributable non GPLv3&#x27;d binaries, which is bad; so you&#x27;ll have to license your runtime differently. GPLv3 also makes it really hard to use your program commercially (you may consider this a positive or negative quality). <a href=""http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html</a><p>Most other licenses are basically just variations on the them. Also, writing your own license, particularly a more restrictive one (&#x27;this software can only by used for education&#x27;, say) will basically kill any use of your program. And it&#x27;ll probably be invalid, too. Writing licenses is hard.<p>...<p>A cautionary tale follows: there is a C compiler called vbcc (<a href=""http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html</a>). It&#x27;s incredibly small, fast, and produces great code. It&#x27;s easy to port. But it&#x27;s released under a look-but-don&#x27;t-touch license which forbids distribution of modified archives. This means that if I, say, modify it to include a compiler backend for Infocom&#x27;s Z-machine, which I did (<a href=""http://cowlark.com/vbcc-z-compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cowlark.com/vbcc-z-compiler</a>), then I cannot distribute a version of vbcc which contains that backend! Instead I have to distribute the unmodified archive and a patch. This makes it way too hard to develop for, and additionally means that no software distributor will touch it.<p>When vbcc&#x27;s author finally gets hit by a bus, vbcc will die. Which is a shame; it&#x27;s really nice.<p>Please don&#x27;t do that!",1435861276
