They don&#x27;t protect people (you can&#x27;t really, in a free society), they punish people after the fact in an attempt to reduce antisocial/immoral/&quot;impure&quot; behavior. Doing their jobs correctly and with moral forthrightness is making absolutely sure the lives they destroy are lives that deserve to be destroyed. But as it turns out they are human and want to keep their jobs so they inevitably focus on &quot;winning&quot; cases -- that is, not failing to destroy lives, rather than being appropriately cautious with the power they are given.<p>Cartoonish villians? No. It&#x27;s more the opposite; they think of themselves as cartoonish superheroes and have a hard-on for &quot;punishing the wicked&quot;, and often forget that the wicked aren&#x27;t always so wicked and maybe the extreme and brutal punishment associated with even being touched by the US justice system isn&#x27;t appropriate -- but why give up a case you can win and tank your career?

9822506,comment,9817209,9822409,0,0,shredprez,,,">all of the problems you just described can be solved by simply firing a bad employee or not hiring bad ones in the first place.<p>Hardly. If hiring and firing could effectively eliminate poor employees, there wouldn&#x27;t be so many. As it is, only the most egregious are weeded out. Firing costly employees can be exceptionally difficult depending on local regulations and may not even be worth the trouble considering the risk of simply finding another costly employee. In a world where you more or less must work, low-quality job applicants are especially incentivized to misrepresent themselves. Basic income would divert many of these people out of the workforce and into their homes where they can do less damage.<p>>I&#x27;m still not following why paying them to do nothing is necessary.<p>They&#x27;re already being payed to do nothing. They&#x27;re just doing nothing at work where it costs businesses money, hurts the experience for customers/clients, and worsens the workplace for employees who really care about what they do. And at work they do worse than nothing: not only are they paid to do nothing, but they fill a position that could be filled by a productive employee. So while the business loses money on the employee, the whole machine is simultaneously thrown off balance by a missing cog. Usually fellow coworkers wind up compensating (paying) for this imbalance, with no extra reward. Best case scenario, the business manages to fire the employee. Then the individual either moves on to pilfer another company or goes on welfare. They don&#x27;t just fall out of the system, they continue racking up costs while contributing nothing. Basic income would allow us to filter them out cheaply (letting low-quality &quot;workers&quot; opt-out instead of making businesses review, employ, and reject them) and fix their monthly cost relative to our economy. Meanwhile, our businesses would become leaner and more effective.<p>You can&#x27;t eliminate leeches from society, but you can minimize their economic impact. It is less costly to pay them to stay home than to pay them to come to work where their costs are multiplied.",1435881163
