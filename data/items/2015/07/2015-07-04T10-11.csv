Any reader of `f.item` or `f.err` (in `GetResult`) is essentially waiting for triggered to be true before reading the value of those respective fields. If after an atomic load or synchronized access of triggered returns `true`, both versions of `setItem` should guarantee that a subsequent read of `f.item` will return the &quot;promised&quot; value.<p>In any case, because the reads (in `GetResult`) aren&#x27;t protected as well, and the call to `setItem` which writes to `item` and `err` only happens on a single thread, the only thing the code perfectly protects now are reads of triggered.",1436005476

That might produce a satisfying result with fewer samples.<p>I wonder if this could be used as an image resizing mechanism?  Take a large number of samples, then render the resulting image using those samples and a smaller or larger size.
