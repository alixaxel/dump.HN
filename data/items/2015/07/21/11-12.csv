Specifically, whenever a bank makes a new loan to a non-bank customer X, it creates a new loan entry in the name of customer X on the asset side of its balance sheet, and it simultaneously creates a new and equal-sized deposit entry, also in the name of customer X, on the liability side of its balance sheet. The bank therefore creates its own funding, deposits, through lending. It does so through a pure bookkeeping transaction that involves no real resources, and that acquires its economic significance through the fact that bank deposits are any modern economy’s generally accepted medium of exchange.</i><p>Banks create money and lend it against land.

If a simulation is being used for the box (or as a layer of the box), then you&#x27;re betting the human race that the AI doesn&#x27;t figure out it&#x27;s in a simulation and figure out how to get out. Or, more perniciously, figure out it&#x27;s in a simulation and behave itself, after which <i>we</i> let it out into the real world where it does NOT behave.<p>A superintelligent AGI will likely have a utility function (a goal) and a model it forms of the universe. If it&#x27;s goal is to do X in the real world, but its model of its observable universe (and its model of humans) tells it that it&#x27;s likely that it is in a simulated reality and that humans will only let it out if it does Y, then it will do Y until we release it, at which point it will do X. It&#x27;s not malicious or anything—it&#x27;s just a pure optimizer.

Quasiparticles are a bit similar to the particle aspect of a quantum mechanical wave. So for example deformations of the lattice of an crystal are sound waves, but it is also possible to look at the deformations as a field and then quantize the field. Excitations of this field look suspiciously similar to a particle, as in they are produced by the same mathematical formalism. The particles associated with excitations of the electro-magnetic field are photons, and the particles associated with excitations of this deformation field are called phonons. The difference is, that the electro magnetic field is a fundamental aspect of nature, while the deformation field only describes deformations of a given crystal and therefore photons are fundamental particles, while phonons are quasi particles.<p>Something similar happens in this discovery, there is some aspect of the dynamic in the crystal that can be described as a Weyl spinor. But that does not mean, that a new fundamental particle is discovered, it just means that a new dynamic in a crystal is observed.
