Anthropologists and primatologists both observe numerous counterexamples to the idea that we are hardwired to vie for status.<p>What is true is that we would like to be valued as worthy by the people we invest a lot of importance in. Shame and humiliation is not the absence of status, it is a response to a positive situation of being socially attacked in some way. In a society where status is governed by intricate, interlocking, alienating systems of rules and violence, no one but the very few priviliged (and even then) can escape feeling shamed by their social surroundings.",1437451137

9920497,comment,9906679,9907917,0,0,deobald,,,"So far at nilenso we&#x27;ve seen it swing both ways but the difference is largely a factor of age. Young(er) people are just not that interested in a co-operative corporate structure. The advantages (and disadvantages) of a co-op are all intellectual to someone graduating from University and the majority of these folks are more focused on their own career and personal finances than their employer&#x27;s legal entity. I remember when I was 21 -- I didn&#x27;t care whether I worked for government, a private corporation, a public corporation, or a non-profit. All I cared about was salary and an interesting technology problem to solve.<p>When it comes to lateral hires, there is more interest from people who have been burned. If someone has suffered from the opaque nature of a large corporation or suffered an opportunity due to an unfair equity structure their eyes light up when they hear about us.<p>The lack of interest seen in lateral hires comes from a pretty narrow segment: software developers who (in the present economy) want to be entrepreneurs. The &quot;I HATE HIPPIES&quot; attitude generally comes attached to an individual capitalist motivation to be on top. This is our biggest hiring/retention challenge, because these are precisely the people we want on board. We have plenty of entrepreneurial folks in the office but we&#x27;ve also lost some because a co-op will never let a person &quot;be on top&quot;.<p>As for a &quot;segment of the population&quot;, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve felt restricted there (though we of course suffer from our own bias). We&#x27;ve had a surprisingly wide set of demographics for a tiny Bangalore-based consultancy. :)<p>The huge advantage to hiring in a co-op is agency. The company is inherently democratic and change largely comes from individuals who exact it. There are a number of concrete examples we can give potential hires: moving most of the business to Clojure, running Haskell classes, everyone buying hardware for themselves, speaking at conferences, installing a garden and composter on our rooftop patio... everyone is attracted to a company where they can make the changes they really want to make.",1437451015

9920494,comment,9918898,9918898,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"A big &quot;problem&quot; is that things are too easy actually. Slap together an MVP based on an obvious idea, execute it half-assedly on the ragged edge of competence, expand with VC money, make tens of millions at the lower end, maybe billions. Because so much of industry, the economy, etc. still hasn&#x27;t been hit fully by the disruption of 21st century technology. Uber being the perfect example, disrupting an industry that had barely changed much in a century. There are countless similar examples. In SV you can snowclone your way to success because there&#x27;s just so damned much low hanging fruit that hasn&#x27;t been executed on hardly at all. The same&#x27;s been true in the mobile space for years as well. Hardware wise, just rev the display and the proc. and you&#x27;re golden, as long as the device wasn&#x27;t garbage you could demand a huge profit margin (amplified further by the &quot;subsidized&quot; handset purchase model).<p>Easy money makes for laziness. When google hit big they entered a tight market during an economic downturn. That&#x27;s also when amazon started hitting its stride. But there is so much potential right now for easy money in tech that I suspect it&#x27;ll be a long time, if ever, before economic pressures force a serious drive for innovation.<p>But there&#x27;s also a huge need for real innovation. Mobile devices are still largely consumption rather than creation devices, for example, though they have no shortage of capability. And there&#x27;s a huge need for fundamental research into programming languages, operating systems, and especially software development as an activity (what works, what doesn&#x27;t, in which situations and circumstances, and why, etc.) Consider, for example, how utterly lacking in universally acknowledge best practices is the development of firmware with potential safety implications.",1437450907

And hand it directly to consumers.<p>> I just tried to explain to you that printing money without producing more goods/services just dilutes your purchasing power.<p>Yes.  But then you went on to say:<p>> The US GDP has been bumping barely above 0 over the past several years, which means we are not producing more. A lot of reasons for it, but one of them is lack of consumption caused by excessive debt of consumers, who are flat out broke (and heavily in debt).<p>If we hand real money to consumers instead of handing them credit and plunging them into debt, why wouldn&#x27;t that address the lack of consumption problem?<p>> The pain caused by _moderate_ inflation is easier to hoist on unsuspecting public, so inflation is typically chosen over bankruptcy<p>I&#x27;m skeptical that printing money and handing it to consumers would cause any amount of inflation.  If we assume a downward-sloping long-term aggregate supply curve -- and the long term gets shorter the more scalable our businesses are -- then the more stuff we produce, the cheaper that stuff gets.  Right?<p>Besides, if we do see inflation rates that are higher than what we want, the government has other levers it can use to address that.<p>1. Open market operations.  The fed sells treasury securities back to the open market thereby removing dollars from the supply.<p>2. Increase bank reserve requirements to discourage bank lending.  This reduces the amount of credit (and therefore debt) and can help reduce future credit crises.<p>3. Tax consumption/spending.  Taxation is fine as a means to reduce the money supply and influence consumer behavior.  But I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is to view taxation as a way to fund the government.  Why not spend as needed and tax as needed without worrying about balancing the two?<p>> Greece is out of luck<p>Yup.",1437450726

At best, it can measure how the surface the accel is attached to responds to the acoustic environment (and that&#x27;s only if the accel has a very high frequency response and is conditioned and sampled appropriately). For this kind of work they probably wanted to measure dynamic pressures within the tank, which they would most likely do with microphones. Other than that you have exactly the right idea.",1437450627

I was privy to some of the higher-level discussions, but I spend most of my days down in the guts of the system. I don&#x27;t spend much time debating the finer points of product direction or user experience (and the world is probably a better place because of that!)<p>Conceptually, Google Photos is very much a V1 product. It might sound a little weird since the team is experienced and a lot of the technology it is built on has been through multiple iterations.<p>But from a _product perspective_ Google Photos is a new product.<p>The product team was really focused on a few key aspects of the user experience (I&#x27;m not going to try to enumerate them here. The main reason is that I would certainly do a poor job of explaining them. The other reasons are that I can&#x27;t remember how much of the strategy has been talked about publicly and it doesn&#x27;t really matter for the point I&#x27;m trying to make).<p>Being focused meant saying no to things - at least for the initial launch.<p>So the first answer to your question is that for most of the mentioned features the answer is that they simply didn&#x27;t make the cut for V1. I can&#x27;t comment on which features will or won&#x27;t make it to future versions.<p>Date picker is an interesting one. Really, the only reason it existed was to work around how painful it was access older pictures in Google+ Photos, Date picker was added to (somewhat) ease that pain.<p>In building a new product, there was a desire to make things like date-picker unnecessary. Make finding older photos so fast and painless that you don&#x27;t even need it. Try grabbing the scroll bar in the new web-app - you can scroll to any time you want in seconds. On mobile, it&#x27;s easy to zoom out, scroll and zoom back in.<p>There is also search, which often means you don&#x27;t even _need_ to scroll through your photos to find what you want. Just this morning my wife wanted me to find a picture of a tatoo from six years ago. I was able to find it by searching for tatoo. It was awesome! In Google+ Photos I would have spent a long time trying to figure out the right date range and then searching around.<p>If you really want to jump to a date, just type it in search - I just tried &quot;September 2012&quot; and &quot;9/23/2012&quot; and they both worked great.<p>So I would argue that date-picker just flat out isn&#x27;t needed any more, because the team focused on some core user experience flows.",1437450474

It took 2.5 billion years for life to get to sexual reproduction, another 700 million to the Cambrian explosion, and so on with each phase getting shorter and the growth rate getting much faster. In human history, we&#x27;ve seen typical economic growth go from less than 0.001% per year (paleolithic) to 0.1% per year (urbanization, agrarian life) to 1% (early to mid-industrial) to ~6% per year in the 1960s. (We&#x27;ve slowed down to about 4-5%, globally, and the developed world is stagnant. That&#x27;s another topic.) I don&#x27;t know what will happen in the next 10 years regarding Moore&#x27;s Law, but I don&#x27;t see any reason to doubt that the faster-than-exponential growth <i>can</i> carry on for a while. It would surprise me not to see 10% world economic growth by the end of my life.<p>The OP does a great job of explaining why Silicon Valley won&#x27;t be involved in much of a meaningful way. I think that the biggest problem is that the balance of power between connections guys and talent has fallen into a state of irreversible moral calamity. In their time, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were approximate equals. The business partner wasn&#x27;t innately taken to be superior to the engineering partner. That changed somewhere between 1995 and 2005. Now, the connections guys are the only people who really matter and engineers (even up to the CTO level) are largely viewed as interchangeable. And they probably <i>are</i> interchangeable given that these businesses are all built to be dumped on a buyer inside of 3 years, and the consequences of mediocre engineering generally don&#x27;t have business-macroscopic effects (beyond &quot;throw more money at it&quot; problems) until 5 or 6 years have passed.<p>I don&#x27;t know where, when, or how the positive-sum mentality of the old Silicon Valley will reconstitute itself.
