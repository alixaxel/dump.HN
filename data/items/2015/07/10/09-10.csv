I&#x27;ve even wanted to do this in fiction -- for example, if characters reference something I forgot about, I wish I could just click that and go back to that original chapter/scene and refresh my memory.<p>I suspect that any UI awkwardness will be growing pains caused by it being a new idea for books.<p>Technical Issue<p>1. I click a planet expecting to go to a chapter about that planet (say, Saturn), but nothing happens despite the page reloading and the address bar changing to #saturn. Chrome 43 on OS X 10.10.<p>Content Issues<p>1. I love the animated cover, but it wish it had relatively accurate orbits and periods (within reason). One of the coolest things for me as a kid was realizing that Pluto and Neptune switch places.<p>2. The summary for the book says &quot;all ages,&quot; but very shortly in you have a bunch of math and symbols that don&#x27;t make sense unless you&#x27;ve already had geometry.<p>3. The homepage presents Bubblin as &quot;for developers,&quot; which doesn&#x27;t seem to fit. Do you want authors to present books (as suggested by your own), or do you want developers to use it to present stuff (documentation, use cases, white papers?) about development? It&#x27;s also at odds with your statement &quot;Meanwhile, to those who are unhappy about the idea of having books with flipping animation on the browser, here&#x27;s a little tip: A lot of kids, especially my nephews, love it,&quot; so I feel like there&#x27;s a little bit of confusion about the audience. :)<p>A nice idea/platform!

C/C++ code written for speed would not perform heap allocation in its main processing. However, this is true with garbage collected languages as well.<p>Not just code written for speed. Stack allocation is easier. There&#x27;s not much that can go wrong. Heap allocations on the other hand you have to be careful not to leak or free multiple times or free a wrong pointer. So after you&#x27;ve debugged one too many of these bugs, you learn to avoid heap allocations where possible just to make your own life easier.<p>(This is my experience with C, I don&#x27;t have enough experience with C++ to know whether it sufficiently takes care of some of that complexity to the point where heap allocation becomes as easy as stack allocation.)",1436522089

This assumption breaks under a number of circumstances, e.g.:<p>* Closures capturing their environment and keeping local variables alive longer than intended.<p>* Debugging code keeping a record of objects.<p>In either case, you have likely failure modes in that either the resource can be deallocated prematurely and then accessed through a stale reference or that it is kept around longer than its intended lifetime.<p>RAII also does not provide a solution to a number of resource management scenarios, such as requiring access to an unbounded number of resources of which only a finite number can be reified at any time (e.g. due to the maximum number of file handles a process can manage). The obvious solution – a caching mechanism that will disconnect a resource from its in-memory representation upon eviction and reconnect when it is being used again –  needs to attach itself to resource usage, not resource creation and destruction.<p>Most scenarios where RAII is being used are either trivially handled in any language that supports closures or macros, or benefit from explicit reasoning about resource lifetime, anyway.<p>Speaking of closures, I think it&#x27;s no coincidence that RAII first arose in a language that until recently had no such concept; closures both create problems for RAII and also obviate many common use cases.",1436520796

9863005,comment,9862135,9862507,0,0,koffiezet,,,"While in C++, RAII is a good practice, it has it&#x27;s fair share of problems you should not ignore. Debugging, profiling and unit testing are a bitch. Performance becomes completely unpredictable in more complex applications. And then error handling.... Destructors shouldn&#x27;t throw exceptions - and you don&#x27;t have any other choice than just catch them all and &#x27;log and forget&#x27; - which can be seriously problematic.<p>Both RAII and the explicit cleanup of resources have their advantages and serious disadvantages. In C++ you better use RAII, in GC&#x27;d language, use explicit cleanup. What is better depends on the language.<p>> I kind of wonder if a preference for GC languages is in part responsible for the way distributed systems are typically designed these days -- namely, the emphasis on stateless servers, which avoids the need to do remote resource management (which is hard without RAII), at the expense of requiring a lot more machinery to make performant (e.g. complicated caching layers because all state changes have to hit storage which is sllloowwwwwww)<p>Don&#x27;t wonder, they&#x27;re not related at all. We have a few stateless services running that are written in C++. They are the only sane option once you start working beyond a certain scale - which is the point when you decide you need a distributed system. The reason for them being stateless is simple: nodes WILL fail. Hardware failures, power outages, line cuts, ... This is not the reason for &#x27;more machinery&#x27;. Resource cleanup is hardly a bottleneck? RAII does this for you, but the only difference with GC&#x27;d languages is that you need to do this cleanup yourself.<p>There are other reasons for having to add &#x27;more machinery&#x27; to make things performant: going for &#x27;easy&#x27; scripting languages to get things up and running in record time - which is important for startups to have something to show for as quickly as possible. Performance at that moment takes a back-seat, and it&#x27;s hard to go back. Micro-services are becoming a trend for this reason too - you can quickly write your services in <slow hipster scripting language>, get everything up & running, identify your bottlenecks and optimize them. Just look at the upcoming trend there for &#x27;optimizing&#x27; distributed applications is to rewrite parts of your service in Go, which is a native compiled GC&#x27;d language. Easy to write, little memory overhead with decent execution speed, and designed to do concurrency well. Does it compete with C++? Not at all, but it gets things done that would be pretty damn annoying to do in C++ - and it does it with little memory and CPU overhead.<p>That - or going for some Java enterpricy application with tons of frameworks which eats up all your memory.

Will do!<p>> On the Sun&#x27;s chapter, you drew it yellow.<p>Oh yes, it&#x27;s actually bright <i>intolerable</i> white once you&#x27;re outside the atmosphere. I wrote this book for my nephew and he totally loves sitting next to me when we do these creatives. So I&#x27;m gonna leave it like that for now and revisit later in the day (it&#x27;s 5:30 am here in DC!) with him.<p>> There are too many links that forces the reader to constantly deviate from what he reads ...<p>I realized it midway that traversal would be more-or-less linear and then reduced the number of anchor links per page later on. I guess I&#x27;m gonna leave it on the writers to choose what&#x27;s best for their book. Will come back on the look_up feature later, but thanks for sharing your insight here.<p>4. No love for Pluto :(<p>There will be love for the dwarfs very soon! :-)<p>=====<p>Meanwhile, to those who are unhappy about the idea of having books with flipping animation on the browser, here&#x27;s a little note: A lot of kids, especially my nephews, love it. It might be that you are not the right audience for it, but kids really love flipping the page as it is. And they love the animations and visuals within too. There&#x27;s a <i>reason</i> why Apple chose to have flipping behavior for iBooks - cuz otherwise it&#x27;d feel more like a slideshow. Fast/performant is another thing, but books must have a bifolia experience that flips comfortably at a soft reading pace. There is <i></i>no doubt<i></i> about that.<p>While I understand the passion with which people want to impress what should or shouldn&#x27;t be on the web, but there&#x27;s no point making it a turf war. There have been several occasions where exactly the same thing - i.e. <i>books</i> - have been appreciated by hackernews on the browser itself. By the very same people who at other times chose to batter the idea.<p>For example, this book on Startup School Doodles from my friend Greg Koberger was loved invariably by all of you:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8449652"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8449652</a><p>So it&#x27;s all a matter of context and audience.",1436519605
