In fact, they take it a step further: all SSH is proxied via an authentication agent. Then, when the SSH session has terminated, the box is scrubbed and rebuilt from a fresh image. It&#x27;s quite cool, and I think a really nice way to isolate your servers from one another, and from any rogue employee (or ex-employee) with or without intent to cause damage.",1436784923

However, see this: Italy has voted Berlusconi for 20 years and now has another despotic leader who might stay another 20 who speaks poor English and has very bad understanding of economics.

They don&#x27;t produce enough of &quot;what people want&quot;, plus they spend more than they can afford to, and that&#x27;s that. The real problem is that the Eurozone has no mechanism to deal with bankrupt. There should be an easy way out of the Eurozone or an &quot;easy&quot; way to default. Italy will follow Greece, sooner or later, maybe Portugal and who knows, even France. We have to deal with the fact we have broken public spending all around Europe and that will catch up, if not now, in 5, 10, 15 or so years.

They were not the first startup to try this sort of thing. The idea itself was a dime a dozen, like many others. App for calling taxis. Classifieds. Restaurant reviews. Online profile. Video sharing site. These are all pretty banal ideas. Lots of attempts were made at all of them. Picking winners is about picking a winner, not picking the race.<p>(2) Try to see &quot;markets&quot; as their full spectrum. High end, low end. Business, consumer. Freaks, mainstream. Coach surfing is a different place on the same spectrum as Hilton. Startups often move up and down spectrums much more easily than mature companies. Tesla could make a budget car next. Jaguar can&#x27;t. AirBnB can handle mansion rentals for billionaires. Grindr could probably pivot to over 50s Catholic matchmaking easier than one might think.",1436783778

After an episode of total motivation and some kind of reckless/risky behavior (cutting off friends because they &quot;do not fit&quot; anymore, excessive exercising whatever interest you in this moment and so on) a depressive episode is following, taking you and your motivation down. 
Dealing with depression is hard and it gets even harder when your social life and work performance is suffering because that takes you down even more. Also, eventually reduce your amount of work and consider taking a day off for a a consecutive amount of weeks. When you trust your boss, talk to him. Executives are also humans!<p>Some people mentioned doing sports and in my opinion, this is one of the most helpful things one can do. Running a mile maybe one or two times a week can clear your mind from lots of negative thoughts and make you feel happier. In addition to that, some people like Yoga/Pilates to calm down and rearrange themselves. 
After all, the very most important step is getting professional help! Depression can influence your whole life and it is always good to have someone who is listening.<p>Summarized:
- Get professional help
- Do sports

- Reduce stress",1436783497

It&#x27;s not a write once, deploy everywhere kind of deal.<p>I have been building an iOS application using React Native and the performance is great (on account it maps to native Objective-C) and it feels like the future. It isn&#x27;t just like a Phonegap application where it is run within a web container, so you get the native performance. If you already know Objective-C and or Swift, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with React Native to be honest. RN is good for non-programmers to build iOS and eventually Android apps.",1436783209

9877223,comment,9875731,9875731,0,0,vlehto,,,"Science is commonly defined as usage of scientific method. So science is just trying to find truth with the best possible tools. Nothing more and nothing less. I think here is the common and problematic misconception. Scientists are saying &quot;look, we used the best tools&quot; and people are hearing &quot;hey, we found the truth!&quot;. But science is not about the destination, it&#x27;s all about the journey.<p>Engineering lacks such rigid definition. I&#x27;ve thought about it a lot, and I think deep down engineering is always optimization.<p>If you invent a new need for people and fill it with a toy, that would be marketing. But if you solve previously solved problem better, that&#x27;s engineering. You got closer to the optimum, even though the way you solved might be described as &quot;invention&quot;. So engineering inventions would be just leaps in optimization.<p>Now if you optimize economical or cultural stuff, that would not be engineering. So engineering is &quot;optimization of technology&quot;.<p>I do not think &quot;engineering&quot; as a term should be expanded to the fields this article suggests. The term started off as &quot;art of building of siege engines&quot;. And so far we don&#x27;t have &quot;sales-engineering&quot;. It&#x27;s called marketing and it works pretty good considering there is big human factor everywhere. Medicine is good term too. These fields are just naturally more difficult to squeeze accurate data out.<p>I think the best model how to deal with the human factor comes from medicine. Rigorous meta-analysis is pretty solid. If we import the way tech or natural science is researched, that would be: &quot;just use better instruments and measure more carefully&quot;. Which is pretty obvious dead. Because you will just get more expensive studies that still disagree with each other.",1436782765
