9888031,comment,9882331,9887683,0,0,themeekforgotpw,,,"Yes. Sure. The US arrested hundreds of journalists from covering Occupy, leading to a sharp drop in it&#x27;s Freedom of Press score (I don&#x27;t trust that metric, but other people seem to like it). They also put a media blackout zone around Ferguson. Facebook has blocked individuals, myself included, from posting Wikileaks documents, Snowden documents and Manning Documents, as well as organizing May Day protests. The US Government infiltrated and disrupted operations at the Associated Press following the Benghazi scandal. The US knowly falsely linked investigative reporters with ongoing criminal activity to hold them from investigations and to get access to sources (Rosen), held whistleblower Binney and his family at gunpoint, blackmailed Joe Nacchio, persecuted and proscecuted journalists for unfavorable coverage (Jassam, Poitras, Greenwald, Risen, Brown), partnered with US domestic media to skew coverage (Dilanian, Miller, Gordon), manipulated US media to support the Iraq war (Fallujah, Zarqawi), coordinated the removal of journalists reporting unfavorable coverage overseas (Mohyeldin), has published false international cables to manipulate the domestic press on purpose (<a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/03/heroes-error?page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/03/heroes-error?pag...</a>), seeded fake journalists to ask softball questions at press releases (Gannon), have paid for positive coverage by US domestic media outlets (Williams, Gallagher, McManus), injected pro-war news stories into local news channels through the WCIA (leading the resign of Tomlinson), sent fake letters from the US Army to media outlets to get positive coverage, completely fabricated hero stories and trotted them about the media (Lynch), repealed restrictions on propaganda operations in the Smith-Mundt Act so that propaganda aimed ultimately at other audiences can now be legally consumed and need not be prevented from consumption by Americans, has used coerced testimony to justify policy goals (reporting them to media as fact - Bush torture programs in advance of Iraq), research on at least both vote manipulation and emotion manipulation to be weaponized against other countries were tested on Americans - one during the 2010 congressional elections), made it impossible in practical terms for third parties to get access to the presidential debates, astroturfed during elections, released press information at inconvenient times to discourage press coverage (e.g. NSA oversight report on Christmas Eve). Hell, politicians and policy makers often either have relatives in influential positions in the media or sit on a board of directors. When Hillary Clinton said that the Benghazi attacks were about a youtube video, did you believe her? Hell, Bush Jr. instanciated HSPD-5 that clarified the use of information support for civil affairs (domestic propaganda) during the use of states of emergency. Then again his administration also perpetrated international fraud to justify the invasion of Iraq by knowingly falsifying evidence: knowingly and falsely linking anthrax from US bioweapons labs, weapons of mass destruction and 9/11 to Saddam; coordinated with intelligence agencies under the cover the UN commission.<p>If you ask anyone from outside America whether its citizens exist in a media bubble they will tell you that it&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s like talking to a Russian and telling them that they have state sponsored propaganda. They are going to be skeptical - and it will seem like for good reasons.<p>> No. It is not. It similar only in from a technical perspective. From the perspective of the government&#x27;s motivations for blocking them, and the moral acceptability of those motivations, the two are entirely different.<p>The motivations are pretty similar in this case, and the acceptability is the same.<p>I cited examples far beyond the ISIS/ISIL case. We&#x27;re talking about those now. The &#x27;tools by human rights lawyers&#x27; are state sponsored tools from Civil Society Organizations funded by the West. Like ZunZuneo and when the US criticized Cuba for blocking Cuban cell phone access.",1436907573

I&#x27;m fiddling with this now, but I wish I had some guidance as to where to focus my optimizations and how to make them, all in one place and straight from the source (AWS).  For example, I&#x27;d love some examples on API Gateway caching, making my API accessible in multiple regions, how to make my Lambda functions faster, and why my first requests to my API Gateway + Lambda routes are so slow even after only a few minutes of inactivity.  On a first request, my Lambda function will run for 1.2 seconds but the network request as a whole takes 2.8-3.2 seconds, yet every immediate subsequent request comes in much faster (~1.4 seconds)(Everything is in the same us-east region).  If there is nothing I can do about this because the server my lambda function is on has been de-prioritized due to minutes of inactivity and is in an idle state, then the guide on optimizing elsewhere is even more necessary.  This is the last piece of the story that is missing for me personally, and it causes me to hesitate before deploying more code.  Also, if you have this written already and I&#x27;ve missed it, please let me know!<p>Overall, you&#x27;ve lowered the barriers to entry and increased efficiency so much I plan on deploying much more server side code than ever before.<p>Thank you,<p>Austen",1436907500

A type constructor that takes a type and returns an type. Enough languages have an Optional construct now that this should be sensible to anyone paying attention.. If Integer and Optional<Integer> are types that have values, Optional is a type constructor.<p>2. A function for injecting a value in an appropriate manner. To stick with java-ish syntax, it&#x27;d look like Optional<T> inject(T x) { ... }.<p>3. A function for binding a function to a value with appropriate types.  Optional<R> andThen(Optional<T> x, Function<T,Optional<R>> f) { ... }.  This function has a couple restrictions on what it&#x27;s allowed to do which are called the &quot;monad laws&quot;.  It&#x27;s not really worth burying yourself in them.  The important part is that they have the effect of requiring inject and andThen to do the absolute minimal thing that works sanely.<p>This really isn&#x27;t complicated.  It&#x27;s a super-basic pattern.  It keeps getting reinvented over and over in languages with first-class functions.<p>So why do you not hear about it outside of typed functional languages?  Because very few languages give you the flexibility to <i>work</i> with this abstraction.  In Haskell or F#, you can write code that works with any monad.  In Java or Rust, you can only write code that works with a specific type.  The missing abstraction capability makes the abstraction academic only.  And since it&#x27;s so simple, there&#x27;s nothing in particular to be gained by talking about the abstraction when you can&#x27;t use it.<p>People have made a huge deal out of monads, but they&#x27;re really not complicated.  Thinking they&#x27;re hard or hold the secrets of the universe is like thinking the Iterator interface is hard or holds the secrets of the universe.  Sure, maybe a language has some syntactic sugar to make it easier to work with them (do-notation in Haskell, for loops in Java). But it doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s anything complicated going on.<p>Note the things absent from this response: IO, side-effects, purity, sequencing, basically any use case.  None of them are related to the definition of monads.  None of them require monads. Monad is an <i>abstraction</i>. It doesn&#x27;t let you do anything new. It just lets you share vocabulary (and code in more expressive languages) between many disparate areas.",1436907059

To give you some background: I&#x27;ve written games for all kinds of platforms: PocketPC, Windows Mobile, (Desktop) Windows, Linux, OS X, Flash (AS3), HipTop, J2ME devices and some smaller proprietary devices.<p>Some of those platforms offer write once, run everywhere. On other platforms every device has it&#x27;s own quirks and you have to test on every device and implement workarounds.<p>You might not like Flash, but it is great at running on every platform/browser with the same code base. If you test it on one platform, it runs on all others. (Adobe is also very good at keeping it backwards compatible)<p>Now, I ask you, what&#x27;s the alternative for Flash? Does HTML5 offer write once, runs the same on every platform/browser(version!)? No it doesn&#x27;t, and it never will. Even simple HTML pages are full of browser checking hacks.<p>Now, if you can offer a programming platform where the games I develop on, run exactly the same on every browser, on every platform, I have no problem killing Flash. But let&#x27;s be honest here, only plugins can guarantee such a thing.<p>As to Alex Stamos, the top games on Facebook are all Flash. You know why? Because developers don&#x27;t have to worry whether or not those games will run inside the users browser. Because once Flash is installed, they will run without issues. HTML5? No such guarantee.<p>So before you declare EOL, please have a proper alternative, where I don&#x27;t have to pull my hair and cry all night because browser X on platform Y version Z seems to break the end boss of level 5 in my game because its implementation slightly differs from all the rest.",1436906210

For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a market that might well have gone into shock.

When you&#x27;re out of improvements, you can just update it every year with better graphics and updated rosters.<p>In another other industry, that mentality makes sense.

Since 1995, NBA Live was <i>the</i> basketball game. They (in my opinion), crushed the 2K series. For years, it was a really polished game and sales were pretty consistent. They continuously improved on the menus and on the actual basketball games.<p>Then, something changed around 2010. Suddenly, EVERYONE preferred NBA2K over NBA Live.

I worked on analysis of the Weak Stability Boundary, which is the mathematical set of all points in phase-space that lie at this fuzzy boundary, for my Masters thesis [2]. It has been used in a few missions, including SMART-1, Stardust, and Hiten. ESA&#x27;s Bepi-Colombo mission will also be using it to ensure that there isn&#x27;t a single point-of-failure to enter orbit around Mercury.<p>The big problem with ballistic capture is that it doesn&#x27;t guarantee a more optimal solution. Transfers can take a lot longer, and in theory even require more fuel. So it&#x27;s very much a case of having to perform mission analysis on a case-by-case basis.<p>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s an interesting prospect to send unmanned missions to Mars carrying habitat elements, before a manned mission, since they can be sent well in advance.

The U.S. blocked forums being used to publicize and support enemy activities in a war zone (by a terrorist group, by any definition, to boot), while China blocked communications tools being used by human rights lawyers to expose inequities in China&#x27;s legal system.

If, for instance, they help because the people in the study are, well, average Americans, and the standing desks help develop core muscle strength, yes, that will improve their lives. But if it is about that, then you could probably do much better with much less effort by directly performing exercises that strengthen your core, without incurring the risk of knee damage from a standing desk. And of course if standing is good for some other reason, that won&#x27;t help the problems at all. As near as I can tell, science has nothing to say about this particular rather simple question yet. We have roughly one point in the relevant space and a whole bunch of people drawing a lot of lines through it very excitedly based on biases and preconceived notions, but nowhere near enough data. Or, basically, business as usual in the world of health and fitness. (Sadly.)<p>Personally I focus on strength training directly and leave the standing desk issue aside. YMMV.

It&#x27;s in the BLE specification!<p>> Duplicate advertising reports are not required to be sent to the Host. A duplicate advertising report is an advertising report for the same device address while the Link Layer stays in the Scanning State. The advertising data may change; advertising data or scan response data is not considered significant when determining duplicate advertising reports.<p>Advertising really is designed to advertise the presence of a device. It isn&#x27;t for putting data in - for that you should connect to the device.",1436904020

IBM: main business used to be hardware, but now mostly IT services. This, believe it or not, is the most stable business. It&#x27;s really hard to switch to another service provider for stuff your whole company relies on: payroll, inventory management, HR, etc.<p>2. Microsoft: main business used to be software, but moving to infra/productivity services. This is also as sticky as IBM&#x27;s offering.<p>3. FB/Google: main business is selling advertisements, still looking for something to move to. If history repeats, it&#x27;ll be some kind of services, but the multi-billion dollar question is, for what?",1436904013

In order to get off the prescription drugs, whose side effects were killing me, I have pursued a whole lot alternative treatments for my medical condition.<p>I will just say that there are a great many things wrong in the world that contribute to this kind of scenario. For one thing, asthma is on the rise due to pollution. We are slow to address problems like that, even while documenting the connection, meanwhile we are happy to keep prescribing drugs for it and then complain about the financial cost. Being sick all the time and needing drugs all the time costs a lot more than mere money.<p>I hate the state of things in America today and I hate how insurance works. But there is really a lot more going on than just that. It&#x27;s sad that we seem unable to have good discussions about other underlying causes and mostly just want to talk trash about pricing.",1436904011
