I know that may be confused for negativity towards the SPA technology, but I always found it to be a technology looking for a problem.<p>Again, in my experience, SPAs break the web 99% of the time. The times that they don&#x27;t (e.g. Gmail), I still don&#x27;t see what an SPA brings to the table that a simple MPA didn&#x27;t. Yeah Gmail is nice, but it&#x27;s no where near as good as a decent desktop or mobile mail app. And its miles away from a good, well structured MPA. SPAs just seem to sit in this no-mans land for me, and I&#x27;m not sure that more technology is the answer.<p>It&#x27;s like Flash. When Flash came out I used to be a Flash developer for a while. But I had an epiphany as to why Flash development was so hard. It was the entire concept of the timeline, something that is at the core of Flash. A timeline is a sequence of keyed steps over time. The problem with this is that it make interactivity next to impossible; you were constantly fighting against the core purpose of Flash (play items in sequence over time). How do you handle users interrupting this sequence with their constant demands for interactivity? The answer was to throw the entire timeline concept out the window and generate all objects, items and stuff using code. That way you could handle arbritary interactions from the user. Well, I&#x27;m sure you can imagine how ridiculous that got over time. Frameworks and libraries and hacks and workarounds and generally just a big fat mess because Flash devs were constantly trying use Flash for something it was never designed to do in the first place.<p>For me, personally, SPAs and the related technology bear some of the similar hallmarks. Some developers want to use Web Browsers to write the equivalent of desktop apps. But browsers and the web in particular do not have the same interaction patterns as desktop apps (or mobile). But that is absolutely fine! The web is something else, it is its own thing.<p>But thats just me. By all means go for it! You are right that progress in technology is a good thing. I&#x27;m just wary of misdirected technological gains, like smart-jars, digital credit cards and smart smoke alarms that require internet connections.<p>To sum up; I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s negativity, it&#x27;s more that some people are just not convinced by the concept at its core.",1436862211

At least 60M cars are produced annually[0] and there are about 1B currently in the world[1]. A best case for tesla is to grow from ~50K cars to ~500K cars anually by 2020. There isn&#x27;t an industrial base yet.<p>Some other manufacturers will contribute of course, but even if 60m electric cars rolled out annually starting now and started replacing ICE cars, that will take (1B/60M) * years, which is 16years and 8months.<p>The only way this could be sped up would be the rise of self-driving cars, an increase in public transport and the continuation of urbanization. If many manufacturers stopped making ICE cars and we used much less of them we could replace enough of the current fleet for it to be non-trivial in a few decades.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.worldometers.info/cars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldometers.info/cars/</a>\n[1]<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/08/23/car-population_n_934291.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/08/23/car-population_n_934...</a>",1436861715

For example, if you add a field to a datatype, every pattern binding will have to recognize that fact.  But for every place where that&#x27;s the case in Haskell, you can accomplish the same thing in other languages.  For example, if you add a field to a struct in C, you can rename its other fields, and then fix up every usage in your program.  Other tricks include renaming a function you&#x27;ve changed, adding a dummy parameter, and of course, putting something in a wrapper type while you do the refactoring.<p>Haskell&#x27;s type system (assuming you mean with GHC extensions because you called it advanced) only gives you an advantage in cases where other languages would have to resort to reflection or dynamic casts, i.e. specifically where they give up type safety and you&#x27;d miss a recompilation.  In reasonable languages with generics, like C#, this is quite rare.  For example, once in a while, in C#, you might wish you had associated types (or functional dependencies).",1436861115

I can&#x27;t find docs when searching to understand if this is the only reason they exist but that is what I believe is their only purpose.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve started learning about Tor - you can make <i>single service</i> reachable through the Tor network with a Hidden Service address like: 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion<p>Like IPv6, &quot;Onion addresses&quot; aren&#x27;t starved for address space.  With Onion addresses you can only host a single service behind the address.  It&#x27;s trivial to create and bring one up to host a service.  I argue we can use IPv6 similarly.<p>Getting rid of TCP/UDP ports - the positives?:<p>1) We could chop off 4 bytes from TCP/UDP headers (2 x 16-bit for source/dest port)<p>2) Routing traffic to the right bound service in the kernel&#x27;s networking stack might be made simpler.<p>3) Without ports you can&#x27;t assume from an address what type of service is hosted there - with ports we assume port 80 is a webserver.  People might start claiming addresses that end in &#x27;:BEEF]&#x27; to associate with webservers, though.

This hasn&#x27;t always been true with things like NAT and Haproxy, but if we got rid of ports you&#x27;d have to keep a note of which address hosts SSH.  Ports make this less cumbersome.<p>2) Someone could maliciously try claiming every address in an advertised/routed/reachable prefix to starve other users of addresses - how possible is this?
