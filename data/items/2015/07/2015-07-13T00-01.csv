There are exceptions but the vast majority of mobile games that &quot;make it&quot; have very simple and mindless gameplay. Games like Super Mario/Metroid/Zelda do exist on mobile but very rarely do well, and as a result not many people make them. It&#x27;s nothing at all like the 80s/90s.",1436749182

Very recently it has been turning out some great talent in the 0-2 yrs of experience range.<p>The rest of this post is pure anecdote from the perspective of someone that has hired tech workers in Nashville, both full time and contract.<p>We seem to have a decent (but not enough, never enough) supply of junior devs (0-2 yrs experience). Really experienced talent seems more elusive. I believe that it&#x27;s here, I just think most of it is employed already.<p>Additionally, the tech scene here is a little strange. There&#x27;s an ever expanding pool of web folks (e.g., Rails, Node, etc) and a surprising amount of more Enterprise experienced developers (e.g, C#, Java) that arose as result of all the HealthTech hiring that&#x27;s been going on the last several years. So veteran (e.g., 7+ years) software developers I&#x27;ve encountered seem to skew toward Enterprise.<p>There&#x27;s some startup activity here[2], and we&#x27;re seeing some larger non-healthcare outfits set up shop in Nashville (e.g., Warby Parker, Lonely Planet). The technology scene here is really starting to come together, but it&#x27;s by no means a Silicon Valley, NYC, Boston, or even Austin yet, really.

The license is stuck as GPL due to no copyright assignment (100% intentional!), though &#x27;ansible&#x27; in context is trademarked.  So people shouldn&#x27;t be worried.  The code will live, because it&#x27;s basic stuff that hundreds of python developers can get their heads around (and do, based on a lot of long-tail contributions).  So, unless I&#x27;m full of it, it was designed to survive ANYTHING, on purpose, and especially sought out making the code non-clever, and make it easy enough for someone to hack where they needed to extend or diverge from what we did with it.<p>Code that has a liability based on a disappearing author is usually the complex code, in a specific problem domain, or something complex and poorly documented or poorly commented, or built with proprietary tools.

9875726,comment,9873645,9875090,0,0,unclebucknasty,,,"FWIW if you advocate managed local mutability, then you also have folks who will tell you even that is evil. They would say internal mutability is still mutability. And, of course, it&#x27;s true that you do also have to manage the same concurrency issues as with any mutability.<p>><i>At what cost then?</i><p>If a language offers a construct for achieving a certain goal, and you opt to bypass that construct to create a parallel construct, then you are necessarily creating additional cost. But, it&#x27;s actually worse than that because it goes beyond creation of parallel constructs: it also includes working to actively suppress the built-in language constructs.<p>And now we are creating immutability tools and new annotations, and running Mutability Detection, etc. as if mutability itself is a defect and stamping it out automatically improves code quality.<p>><i>Have you got a specific business problem that you&#x27;ve solved with and without mutability</i><p>Yes. Every bit of code I&#x27;ve written before the age of Mutability-is-Pure-Evil.

Just pure, clean, intuitive code whereby other developers were required to actually understand the design before using it.<p>You need to set a property? Then, set it. Don&#x27;t construct a completely new object with a builder, just to update the zip code. In a multithreaded environment? Sorry, you need to understand concurrency issues. No amount of dumbing down objects is going to make up for your lack of understanding there.<p>Otherwise, let&#x27;s stop calling immutability OOP. What people really want is to pass around a struct and have procedural code wrapped in other objects perform operations on it.<p>And, sorry. Moderation is key. Your use of &quot;internal mutability&quot; is actually a nod to moderation. When people find themselves repeating that something is always evil, it should trip a mental alarm.

9875719,comment,9875425,9875425,0,0,tgroshon,,,"I&#x27;m calling BS.  I stopped reading after you wrote about Nazi Soldiers and Soviet Soldiers because that was the point I was sure you are a fool.  Specifically gems like, &quot;Nazi soldiers as not only dishonorable, but downright evil&quot; and &quot;unless we are willing to defend the Soviet soldier, who dutifully executed the orders of Stalin, we cannot pardon the American soldier&quot; show how little you understand about the realities of life under Fascist/Despotic rule.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t want to be an apologist for the terrible atrocities crafted and committed by the men on the ground of a war, but your stance is naive.  You seem to have imagined-up to yourself Evil armies, populated solely by Evil men who could not wait to murder, rape, and torture.  Then you conclude, &quot;You are a soldier fighting for evil men, therefore you are evil&quot;.  This is inaccurate.<p>The sad truth is a majority of Nazi and Soviet soldiers were average people and not that different from you or I.  Almost none of these soldiers had any choice in the matter to fight for these Tyrannical Leaders.  Both armies were populated mainly through conscriptions and drafts.  In fact (and through my Russian family members, I know this to be true), you were guaranteed to be executed (and your family) if you did not join the army and serve obediently.<p>And you do not seem to understand the importance of Moral leadership, military and governmental, to the morality of the troops.  What happens when you&#x27;re ordered, under pain-of-death, to execute an evil order?  You can resist, for which you are either executed immediately or more likely &quot;disappeared&quot; without the opportunity to be a martyr to inspire your comrades.  Do not forget, your family will also meet the same fate: e.g. Stalin&#x27;s Order 270.  This environment eliminates the effect and actions of good men by killing them, corrupting them, or cowing them to the point of compliance.<p>Admittedly, I could only stomach the first few sections of your writing.  But that was enough to offend me with your lack of understanding of history and humanity.  It&#x27;s easy sit in your comfy world, with freedom and a democratic government and call those poor souls &quot;Evil&quot;, &quot;Dishonorable&quot;, etc.  You have these gifts out of dumb luck.  If you were born in some other time or land without those gifts, you would likely find yourself walking in their shoes doing the things they did.  That is sad and terrifying, but likely true.<p>There are bad men that serve in the American Military.  But most of them are very normal people and a significant portion of them serve with honor.  Our military is volunteer, which means the members had a choice to be there.  In addition, our governmental and military leaders are moral for the most part.  That makes it radically different from these Boogey-Man Armies you&#x27;re equating them with.<p>You are comparing Apples to Oranges and doing a rather terrible job at it.",1436748165

I&#x27;m told there will be videos in two weeks.<p>Design by consensus is different than design by committee. In the latter, there is horse-trading and the like, so that basically everyone&#x27;s ideas go in. In contrast, design by consensus means that nothing went into Go until all three - Rob, Robert, and Ken - agreed it was right. That&#x27;s actually a higher bar than design by just one person.<p>The Go spec came before the Go implementation. That&#x27;s actually important too - it&#x27;s not an implementation-defined language - and the prime sieve was written as a complete example program for the spec. It&#x27;s still a decent example of what you can do with just plain Go, without any libraries. Go was meant for networked servers, but a complete HTTP server would have been way too large (remember, there were no libraries yet!).<p>Go certainly had a target: the kinds of networked servers that Google builds. The first real Go programs were exactly those servers. But it takes a lot of code to build up to that. For much the same reason, you can bet that UNIX was not the very first C program; something like hello world (or maybe just &#x27;exit 0&#x27;) probably was. Judging Go by the prime sieve is like judging C by &quot;hello world&quot;. Obviously greeting the world was not the number one problem the C creators had.<p>In the context of the talk, &quot;serious&quot; does not mean what you are saying. Around July 2008 the first draft of the current compiler and runtime started working on both Linux and OS X, but nearly all of the standard library, many key language features, and much reworking of the existing things were yet to come. Serious does not mean frozen here. It means that Go started being a focus of active development for more than just the original three authors. (In particular, Ian Taylor and I joined the team, and development accelerated quite a bit.)<p>Stepping back, the focus of Andrew&#x27;s talk was how changes to Go were proposed and made, and how that process has changed over time. For more about the actual design, see Robert&#x27;s talk, the Evolution of Go (<a href=""https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gophercon2015/123645585015"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gophercon2015/123645585015</a>).

This was not at all true in Germany, and has failed to be true in the US, as well.  In fact, arguably, even when no-one has been drafted, many people have joined in the military under the assumption that they will <i>never</i> serve—in some cases, a factual error, but surely not one to which honour or dishonour can attach.

9875637,comment,9874388,9874388,0,0,shoo,,,"This topic roughly reminds me of Jeff Schmidt&#x27;s book &quot;Disciplined Minds&quot;[1], where he argues that professionals are likely to be more conservative and trusting of the government that other people, in part due to the process of professional education. Here is an excerpt from the first chapter:<p>> Evidence that professionals are not independent thinkers has been around for a long time but has generally been ignored, in part because people don&#x27;t know how to make sense of it. The Vietnam War produced some revealing examples, which are worth looking back at.<p>> On 12 January 1971, the federal government indicted Philip Berrigan and other East Coast antiwar activists on felony charges of plotting to impede the Vietnam War through violent action. The activists&#x27; agenda supposedly included blowing up underground heating pipes in Washington to shut down government buildings, kidnapping presidential advisor Henry Kissinger to ransom him for concessions in the war and raiding drafting boards to destroy records and slow down the draft.<p>> The Justice Department prosecutors chose to hold the conspiracy trial in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a conservative area where a randomly chosen jury would be heavily against the defendants. However, before the jury was selected at what came to be known as the Harrisburg-7 trial, a group of left-leaning social scientists supporting the defendants interviewed a large number of registered voters in the area to try to figure out how to get a sympathetic jury there. They discovered, amongst other things, that college-educated people were more likely than others to be conservative and trust the government. Thus, in court, during the three weeks that it took to examine 465 potential jurors and pick a panel of 12, lawyers for the defense quietly favoured skilled blue-collar workers and white-collar workers without a lot of formal education -- nonprofessionals, although the sociologists and lawyers never used that term.<p>> The lawyers were uneasy about doing this, however, because it went against their intuition. The notion of closed-minded hard hats and open-minded intellectuals is widespread and is reinforced by mass-media characters like dock-loading worker Archie Bunker and his college-student son-in-law, &quot;pinko&quot; Mike. In fact, All in the Family made its television debut the very day of the Harrisburg indictments, 12 January 1971; by the time the trial and jury selection started, it had been on air for over a year.<p>> Ignoring these false stereotypes paid off. The government put on a month long, $2 million extravaganza featuring 64 witnesses, including 21 FBI agents and 9 police officers. The defense called no one to the witness stand. After seven days of deliberation, the jury was not able to reach a unanimous decision, and the judge declared a mistrial; but with 10 of the 12 carefully selected jurors arguing for a not-guilty verdict, the government dropped the case.<p>It is a book worth reading.<p>[1] <a href=""http://disciplinedminds.tripod.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disciplinedminds.tripod.com/</a>",1436746879

We&#x27;re not saying either of those are &quot;correct&quot; in the sense of optimal, but they&#x27;re what we have now.<p>Robert addressed generics in his talk (summary at <a href=""https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gophercon2015/123645585015;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourcegraph.com/blog/live/gophercon2015/123645585015...</a> I believe the video will be available in two weeks). Quoting the sourcegraph summary:<p>> Generics is the single biggest language feature absent in Go. It’s often missed by newcomers to Go. But it’s more of a type-system mechanism. It’s unclear if it’s an essential language feature.<p>> Generics are incredibly complex in both semantics and implementation. There are considerable trade-offs to consider, such as do you want a larger binary vs. slower binary vs. larger source code.<p>> It’s also very non-orthogonal. It interacts with and complicates a lot of other language features.<p>> They have tried and implemented prototypes of generics in Go, but they haven’t found a good solution, so they’ve decided to hold off and keep thinking about it for the time being.<p>Robert also made the point that generics are very complex, much more so than most people realize.

We regulars keep pointing out the great subreddits that exist, so I don&#x27;t need to do that here. Unlike Chuq, I don&#x27;t feel guilt by association because there are also terrible subreddits.

If anything Reddit has improved by banning subreddits like jailbait and fatpeoplehate. The trend on Reddit is less toxicity, not more as Chuq implies.<p>America has been having a conversation the last few years about rape culture, sexual harrasement of women, micro-aggressions, exclusionary speech, gender fluidity, sexual objectification of women in video games, sexting, celebrity nudes, and so on.

I don&#x27;t know a formal definition of &quot;random number&quot; that would allow me to back up what I&#x27;m about to say, but it seems to me impossible to guarantee that exactly 10% of all generated random numbers are less than 0.1.  For example, it can&#x27;t possibly be true if (some, but) fewer than 10 numbers are generated.  (For example, consider jmmcd (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9874773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9874773</a> )&#x27;s hypothetical classroom with 2 students.)<p>The best guarantee that I can imagine is some sort of &quot;law of large numbers&quot;, which won&#x27;t help in a class of, say, 30 people, 4 of whom happen to generate a small number!<p>EDIT:  Also, I think that the use of a random-number generator should probably count as co-ordination.  Consider, for example, a situation where some outside observer picks floor(10%*$classsize) of the class, and the random-number generator is replaced by this person.  (Let&#x27;s say he has an auxiliary random-number generator, for which he generates a number up to 0.1 for the chosen students, and a number past 0.1 for the unchosen.)  This is clearly co-ordination, but it is also indistinguishable to anyone who can&#x27;t peer behind the curtain; so it seems to me that your situation should count as co-ordination, too.<p>EDIT 2:  Also also, let&#x27;s ignore the fact that there are only finitely many distinguishable floating-point numbers in [0, 1] (so that, in particular, it makes a difference what we instruct the student to do who generates 0.1 exactly), and suppose that there&#x27;s some clever output scheme that gives infinitely many possibilities.",1436745682
