The costs of potential legal liability and reputational risks would far outweigh the small financial gain. Especially as they could just analyze the app, never contact the developer, and not leave such a big evidence trail<p>Maybe Amazon is not a competent, healthy company, or maybe a rogue executive inside the company independently arranged this evil scheme, but that seems so unlikely when they could just offer a few 100K, or employment, to get access to his ideas legally.<p>Anyway, my advice to the developer is: it&#x27;s possible you were evilly taken advantage of, but it&#x27;s improbable. What is probable is that if you go down this road of paranoid fear of having your ideas stolen, it&#x27;s a very unhealthy path to follow, even if you are right a few times.
