Starting with RAM, four gigabytes of RAM may work for a barebones programmer machine, but once you want to start doing any sort of media work, like editing photos, video, etc, you start running into that wall real quickly. Even software development work is going to cause you to run into limitations. As the processor doesn&#x27;t have an IOMMU, any vms you want to run will be limited to slower, virtualized, graphics, and that expresscard slot on the side becomes a security concern (hello, evil maid). Additionally, it only supports outputting to vga, limiting your options in monitors, and making sharing content on a friend&#x27;s tv a lot harder.<p>So in short, its constraints in various areas really do shackle you in a lot of ways.

I remember re-cloning the repo so many times when chances are there was a way I could have fixed the mess I&#x27;d created.<p>I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing and it was very complicated. It had a <i>steep</i> learning curve.<p>Now, some six years later, I still only use a handful of commands regularly, but really, aside from the painful-to-read man pages (they are very clear, but contain so many flags and other tidbits), I find it very simple to understand and to use. I rarely ever get confused. I&#x27;m not a big fan of `rebase` but I can see where it would have its purpose in merging feature branches back to the trunk/master (and if I can find a coworker using it in a nice, clear way, I might adopt it myself). I never use `--force` and recommend that everyone everywhere avoid it once they&#x27;ve pushed.<p>But really, and there may be some &quot;survivor bias&quot; involved here, I think it&#x27;s a very well done system for what it does, and I am generally able to reason pretty clearly about what&#x27;s going on and help others figure out what their issues are. It&#x27;s quite possible that bzr/hg/darcs is a better and cleaner way of doing the same tasks, and I still have no idea about many commands and I am sure there are things that I have glossed over thinking that I understand them... but it makes sense to me; I don&#x27;t like any of the GUIs (though I tend to like to &quot;live&quot; in the terminal as much as possible, I&#x27;ve seen things I don&#x27;t like in both Tower and Sourcetree), and it just seems right to me.<p>Sorry to go off on a tangent there...",1437356374

It seems that the biggest problem is that the underlying debt market is very illiquid and people are using ETFs and other financial instruments to create liquidity. This is why Icahn called BlackRock a dangerous company. Icahn is not a man I&#x27;d want to bet against. Though, this so called bubble could go on for years.<p>I think the market will have a minor &quot;taper tantrum&quot; but I don&#x27;t know if that will be the needle or not.

9913521,comment,9913209,9913455,0,0,rory096,,,"<i>Editor’s note: This week, to mark the 170th anniversary of the appearance of the first issue of The Economist on September 2nd 1843, this blog will answer some of the more frequently asked questions about The Economist itself.</i><p>MOST newspapers and magazines use bylines to identify the journalists who write their articles. The Economist, however, does not. Its articles lack bylines and its journalists remain anonymous. Why?<p>Part of the answer is that The Economist is maintaining a historical tradition that other publications have abandoned. Leaders are often unsigned in newspapers, but everywhere else there has been rampant byline inflation (to the extent that some papers run picture bylines on ordinary news stories). Historically, many publications printed articles without bylines or under pseudonyms—a subject worthy of a forthcoming explainer of its own—to give individual writers the freedom to assume different voices and to enable early newspapers to give the impression that their editorial teams were larger than they really were. The first few issues of The Economist were, in fact, written almost entirely by James Wilson, the founding editor, though he wrote in the first-person plural.<p>But having started off as a way for one person to give the impression of being many, anonymity has since come to serve the opposite function at The Economist: it allows many writers to speak with a collective voice. Leaders are discussed and debated each week in meetings that are open to all members of the editorial staff. Journalists often co-operate on articles. And some articles are heavily edited. Accordingly, articles are often the work of The Economist&#x27;s hive mind, rather than of a single author. The main reason for anonymity, however, is a belief that what is written is more important than who writes it. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, our editor from 1938 to 1956, anonymity keeps the editor &quot;not the master but the servant of something far greater than himself…it gives to the paper an astonishing momentum of thought and principle.&quot; The notable exception to The Economist’s no-byline rule, at least in the weekly issue, is special reports, the collections of articles on a single topic that appear in the newspaper every month or so. These are almost always written by a single author whose name appears once, in the rubric of the opening article. By tradition, retiring editors write a valedictory editorial which is also signed. But print articles are otherwise anonymous.<p>Different rules apply on our website, however. A few years ago we decided to start using initials as bylines on our blog posts, to avoid confusion on our multi-author blogs (such as Democracy in America, which covers American politics). Our journalists can and do disagree with each other on our blogs, so we use initials to enable readers to distinguish between different writers. This approach is not without its faults (we have four staff members with the initials &quot;J.P.&quot;, for example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full bylines, in our view. We also identify our journalists when they appear in our audio and video output. And many of them tweet under their own names. The internet has caused our no-byline policy to fray a little around the edges, then, but the lack of bylines remains central to our identity and a distinctive part of our brand.",1437354157

I&#x27;m willing to trust a clean Windows 7 installation and well-known drivers not to be phoning home. Given a system that was never contaminated with junkware, I then have a reasonable chance of only getting stuff I choose on there afterwards and keeping control of what applies downloaded software updates and when, and that is my primary requirement in software terms for a system I&#x27;m willing to trust. The desire for a good spec is just because so many business laptops are overpriced junk here in the UK, and the physical switches are just safeguards to mitigate things like zero days attacks or, frankly, embarrassing forgetfulness.<p>I don&#x27;t really buy the theory that the source for everything you install theoretically being available somehow makes your privacy better protected. Given that I&#x27;m not going to personally audit the entire source code of the OS distro being installed -- and neither is anyone else who buys these laptops -- the benefit is largely illusory, and the reality is that I&#x27;m just trusting the distro and everyone contributing to it instead of trusting the likes of Microsoft. Either way you&#x27;re also assuming the system is secure so any privacy you start with will stay that way.",1437354059
