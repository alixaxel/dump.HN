Single identities will be used by governments to control people. They&#x27;ll also work against normal communication patterns where people speak differently to different groups (think parents, friends, coworkers.)<p>Second, matching a name with social media is the wrong way to lookup others. It only works if people put enough personally identifiable information (PII) on their social media accounts, otherwise we won&#x27;t be sure we found the right person. This matching system encourages PII, works against multiple identities, and associates multiple accounts on disparate systems. Everything you told Facebook, you&#x27;ve now told Reddit and Github, etc.. because the companies can also lookup your (single) Keybase identity and connect the accounts, as can advertisers and governments.<p>Third, leaving people to manage their own private keys is worse for security than having them managed by others. Software changes, glitches and upgrades should be overseen server-side and managed; there should be a help-desk to contact and backups should actually be done, etc... Multiple identities would make it easy to let an employer manage an &#x27;employee&#x27; identity, and Facebook manage -or consume- a public &#x27;personal&#x27; identity, and Twitter manage a private &#x27;political&#x27; identity.

Because the way I am reading your comment and the code is that doing this localization is a pain in the ass (therefore also extremely easy to screw up and not notice), and therefore &#x27;a very bad idea.&#x27;<p>However it seems like you would write a library that was basically a collection of user command/language/machine command triplets, expanding the library as you needed new commands to be available.  Being as inexperienced as I am I see this as a fairly straight forward manner of allowing users to provide commands which seem intuitive to them making the learning curve for software easier.  It would make online community trouble shooting and question asking / answering more difficult, but that could be handled by what would amount to using the same library to translate posts to the users local language.<p>It just seems like a text based user interface will unfortunately already confound enough people that making the commands seem foreign to any one that does not know the original language of the commands is a barrier you would want to avoid creating for potential users.<p>Anyway I am sure I missed your point, or that there is a painfully simple way to handle allowing users to give commands which seem intuitive in their local language, and would like to learn what it is.

As soon as it is filled with what amounts to user curated network TV levels of content and the banal advertising mindset that goes with it, it will become Just Another News Aggregator and will not inspire the level of engagement it has enjoyed until now.<p>Reddit doesn&#x27;t have a sticky network effect.  The content decays.  People can easily jump ship.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why they are obsessed with raw &#x27;ratings&#x27; numbers anyway.  Part of what makes their user base valuable is that they are self-segmented -- it is the small, focused communities.  Also that they are used to hopping off site then back again to re-engage.  They are missing a huge opportunity, not to merely get more people in the door, but figure out how to serve the valuable communities that already exist there.<p>If they keep staring at that bone in the water and open their mouths to grab it, they will lose the tasty morsel they could currently be enjoying.<p>What they really need is some people that know how to target ads effectively to small valuable clients and some technologists with the chops to help them make a profit from that valuable connection making.  Some deep experts from Google&#x27;s Adwords team, for example.  And they need to make the whole process above board and transparent so the userbase doesn&#x27;t feel like they are being used secretly.  Reddit and their commercial offerings should feel like a partner for users, a valuable available resource, not a slimy shill machine.

Having worked remotely for a year myself, I think remote work should be considered harmful for the career of most engineers.<p>For engineers who are in the habit of thinking of their job and their career (and maybe a lot of other things?) exclusively in mechanistic terms of inputs and outputs, it&#x27;s a tempting abstraction.<p>But when you work remotely, you&#x27;re basically advertising your work as commodity work.  You&#x27;re basically consistently reminding the company -- and the job market -- that you are substitutable.  In economic terms, that is simply not a smart signal to be sending.<p>It&#x27;s also short sighted in terms of the arc of your career.  Right now you might be making economic value in the marketplace strictly by extruding a software widget from your keyboard.  Great!  But at some point, the odds are good (not 100%, but good) that the way you&#x27;ll make value is by enabling others to build software; reading body language, detecting issues in a team; or negotiating; or motivating; or selling; etc.  The proportion of people reading this who will hack til their retirement day is quite small.<p>Sitting in your home office being &quot;productive&quot; isn&#x27;t preparing you to do much that&#x27;s important in the second half of your career.  It&#x27;s a case of over-fitting.  You&#x27;re optimizing around your current skill set and not thinking about the larger portfolio of useful -- human -- skills.",1436979689

It defines preference based on the action an individual takes when not interfered with, and builds a value system based around taking this form of preference as a &quot;good&quot;. You&#x27;re assuming the existence of some absolute concept of &quot;rationality&quot; by actions may be judged; Austrian economics does not make this assumption.<p>>It&#x27;s actually possible for people to take actions which they don&#x27;t prefer to take.<p>Not if you define preference as what is demonstrated by people&#x27;s action at a given point in time when not interfered with. Which is what the Austrians do. If you want to give a different definition of preference, that&#x27;s fine, but the issue of what definition of preference forms the best basis for a value system is a matter of philosophy, not science.<p>>Praxeology IMHO is thoroughly unscientific, contradicts modern neuroscience and psychology with many of its assumptions about people<p>Praxeology treats the acting individual as just that: an individual, a black box. Not a collection of competing mental components. Which model of the mind to use is a matter of philosophy. We could for instance treat the mind as nothing more than a deterministic product of atoms, neurons and the like, but then we&#x27;d have to make our models much more complicated. It&#x27;s a matter of philosophical debate which part of the brain and its experience constitutes the mind, and the Austrian approach is to sidestep this issue by just treating the person as a black box.<p>>Both the Chicago school and the Austrian school start out with assuming the outcomes -- a free market s what&#x27;s desired, and produced the best outcomes<p>This is simply not correct. They work forward from first principles to reach the conclusion that a free market produces better outcomes, because how they define &quot;better outcomes&quot; is based on the first principles they have chosen. An Austrian thinks a free market is good because a free market minimises interference with people&#x27;s freedom of exchange, and Austrians define interference with freedom of exchange as a fundamental negative. A socialist may think a free market is bad because it leads to unequal distribution of wealth, and the socialist views unequal distribution of wealth as a fundamental negative. The issue of who is right about free markets, the socialist or the Austrian, cannot be settled by empirical methods, as it&#x27;s a matter of philosophy: the Austrian and the Socialist have fundamentally different notions of what is morally good/bad.<p>>when externalities are not priced in for things human beings care about in the abstract but not in their day to day preferences, like the long term ecosystem, or the health and welfare of future generations<p>The importance of the condition of future generations is again a matter of philosophy. For an Austrian, its importance is determined by the consideration for it that is implied by the actions of the current generation. For an extremely passionate environmentalist, the living conditions of generations thousands of years in the future might be viewed as more important than the preferences of the current generation. These valuations are based on the philosophical underpinnings of the belief systems of the individuals in question, not on propositions subject to empirical verification.<p>>If economics is unpredictable, or the consequences of actions unknowable it also means the consequences of inaction or the &#x27;free market&#x27; are unknowable, but that&#x27;s no basis for siding against government action.<p>The use of ordinal forms of utility in economics is meant to account for this. E.g. if an economist argues that action Y is bad by virtue of stopping person P from doing action X, which they&#x27;d otherwise do, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what the consequences of action Y is, as their argument against Y is not based upon its predicted consequences.<p>>I also think it&#x27;s more moral than either of those.<p>This is almost tautologically true. Unless you have the same moral foundations as a pure free marketer or a Marxist, you&#x27;re not going to view their approaches to economics as more moral than one based on your own moral and epistemological foundations.",1436979622
