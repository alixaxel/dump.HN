9843676,comment,9841911,9842698,0,0,simoncion,,,"The simplest way to allocate addresses on a LAN is something called SLAAC. To use SLAAC, an IPv6 router advertises a /64 on a LAN and connected machines automatically select addresses from that /64. So, -by design- the smallest general-purpose network will always be a /64.<p>The IETF recommends that ISPs hand out /52&#x27;s to their customers. Why? IIRC, there are no specific examples in the RFC, but I&#x27;ve cooked up a likely scenario:<p>First, remember that traffic amongst machines in the same subnet never [0] touches a router. This means that traffic within a subnet can <i>only</i> be filtered by endpoints.<p>Now, imagine that -say- the Open Wireless Router Project [1] gets clever, recognizes that our ISP is allocating a /60 or a /52, automatically splits that into one /64 for each advertised SSID, then sets up firewall rules that create real &quot;guest network&quot; isolation (both from other SSIDs and from machines on the LAN), while still giving every connected machine a globally routeable address.<p>That would be nice, no? The beauty of it is that an end-user doesn&#x27;t have to even be <i>aware</i> of IP networking for this to work!<p>The practice of automatically giving end-user sites the ability to create rather large numbers of subnets will inevitably give rise to consumer networking gear that allows for interesting, secure configurations while still ensuring that all machines on the Internet have a globally-routable IP address.<p>[0] Let&#x27;s ignore encapsulation and tunnelling for a moment.<p>[1] <a href=""https://openwireless.org/router/download"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openwireless.org/router/download</a>",1436244189

But I don&#x27;t really understand <i>why</i> this matters.<p>First, why does your home office need <i>globally unique</i> identifiers for its devices? 48-bits seems really excessive. A CRC16 hash of the MAC should cover far more before a conflict arises than any home networking devices could handle anyway. (you&#x27;re really unlucky if you hit a 1:65,536 conflict. But make it CRC32 if you&#x27;re really worried about that.)<p>Second, how does having the MAC address make routing simpler? When a packet comes into the router, it has to have a table to say MAC A == LAN port B. So instead, you&#x27;d just have it be: IP A == LAN port B. In the reverse direction, the PC already has to ask the router &quot;what is my IP prefix?&quot;, so why is that harder than it just asking &quot;what is my IP?&quot; and getting a full address from it?<p>Third, wouldn&#x27;t temporary (privacy) addresses undermine this entire EUI-64 setup&#x27;s efficiency improvements? Now you&#x27;re back to randomized data in the low 64-bits, so the router and PC need to have some kind of negotiation to know the IP addresses just like before anyway.<p>Lastly, I do think it&#x27;s a valid privacy concern. Now when you do something the government doesn&#x27;t like and they show up, that IP address with your MAC in it lets them say &quot;yep, this is the exact computer that was used.&quot; Before, there was the argument that it could have been a Wifi guest. Even worse, it could follow you between dynamic IP reassignments from your ISP, and even from switching to different ISPs.<p>So all that said ... it doesn&#x27;t seem like we really need 18 quintillion addresses to do decent routing and subnetting. Just drop EUI-64 as a bad idea, and have 16-bits of randomized values for the home network. And when you go a small business, increase it to 24-bits. Fortune 500, 32-bits.<p>And now to make the whole system even better ... make most of the IPv6 values used by ISPs 0000, so you can collapse 80% of the address to ::",1436244074

When you want to ask a remote computer to send you some data, you are going to have to tell  them where to send it. If you don&#x27;t want that to be your local address, use some sort of proxy (e.g. Tor).<p>> (no NAT), and they can port scan me<p>Again, stop conflating NAT with the firewall. They are totally separate features. If you only have a NAT and not firewall, <i>you can still be port scanned</i> if the router uses static NAT, and sometimes you can source-route packets addressed to an internal address, which most NAT-without-firewall routers will happily route to the internal network.... because you left out the part that filters packets.<p>Why bother? IPv4 NAT &quot;works&quot; right now, right? So there should be no harm in using it even if NAT provides no actual security benefits? While that&#x27;s a popular belief, it isn&#x27;t actually true. NAT has been and continues to be incredibly damaging to not only network-software, but also damages our <i>freedom</i>.<p>When considering how technology affects the <i>freedom</i> and security of the people that use it, <i>getting rid of NAT</i> is probably right next to &quot;encrypt everything&quot; as the most important change we need to make to the internet (we should have done it a decade ago). We are missing a huge amount of software that wasn&#x27;t even <i>started</i> because you have to assume everybody on IPv4 is using a &quot;party-line&quot; that cannot accept incoming calls. Over two decades of network software was left unwritten.<p>Instead software was forced to rely on central servers with real IPv4 addresses. You see to have a lot of concerns about privacy - which is good - but advocating for an IPv6 version of NAT is the same as arguing that services should remain centralized. You are arguing that we should remove the <i>most important</i> feature of IP networking: that any network address can be a server, giving everybody the ability to publish without needing permission[1] from a central authority.<p>Unfortunately, this is an uphill fight, because far too much of the tech industry is currently finding the role of &quot;central authority&quot; to be very profitable[2], and so we have a lot of people that see NAT&#x27;s limitations as a good thing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/</a><p>[2] Aral Balkan&#x27;s recent talk ( <a href=""https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html#balkan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html...</a> ) shows just how successful the digital imprimatur[1] has been.",1436242561

If <i>this</i> was what you were going to reply with, why on Earth did you bother asking the question?<p>Anyone who&#x27;s even remotely techy knows <i>why</i> their smartphone battery lasts far less than a day on average. That doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re happy with the (often fashion driven) tradeoffs made by phone designers, or that they don&#x27;t actually want a vaguely-smart-phone that also has battery life of a week or more.",1436242179

Thousands of subs turned there subs private in protest to force the &#x27;new management&#x27; to come to the table and answer some urgent questions and address major issues that are effecting all the subs.<p>This is about a series of bad decisions by Pao and her &#x27;new management&#x27; trying to make fundamental changes to how Reddit works which most Redditors think will damage the community and viability of the site. Possibly to the point of a mass exodus as Reddit is turned into DiggBook 2.0.<p>Narrative spinning about &#x27;haters&#x27; and &#x27;misogynists&#x27; is deflection. Trying to cover the bad decision making and contempt under a &#x27;victim hood status&#x27;.
