What you said was very `unnice`. Rather than plotting to kill him, start plotting your apology. Then figure out whether you are a &quot;Boss&quot; or a &quot;Leader&quot;. It makes all the difference in the world. If you find that you are a boss, quickly relinquish your position. If you are a leader then you will find a way to apologize and turn it into a teachable moment for yourself and for your co-workers.<p>Do a quick google search on &quot;Boss vs Leader&quot; to understand what I am getting at.",1438052292

If you&#x27;re going to read one, read this.  A lot of theory undergirding how people think.  Decision making by people will make a lot more sense after this.<p>2. Influence - Robert Cialdani.  Less theory and more pragmatic advice on how to influence people.<p>3. Drive - Daniel Pink, Switch - Chip Heath, Made to Stick - Chip Heath, Predictably Irrational - Dan Ariely.  Books on specific sub-categories.  More pop-psych.  Information density is less, but easier to read.<p>4. Poor Charlie&#x27;s Almanac - Charlie Munger.  Best known as Warren Buffett&#x27;s partner, this book is a collection of his speeches, letters, etc...

9959225,comment,9958043,9958043,0,0,tvawnz,,,"Hmmm, great article that summarizes some of the more advanced explanations for the Fermi paradox.<p>Some say that the Sun is young and so if there&#x27;s other intelligent life, some would naturally have a 7 or 8 gyr lead on us. But the contra is that the young sun evolved just when the metallicity of the gas was high enough to actually form rocky planets and the solar system.<p>The article notes that the universal star formation rate has been decreasing for a while, since about redshift 2. So everything that&#x27;s going to get a start has already gotten it. The vast majority of possible planet host environments are hostile because of SNe, AGN feedback, stellar winds etc. etc. etc. in the article.<p>Short of the long, sure we could say that we are approximately at the time when one would expect to see the emergence of advanced life give or take a couple billion years.<p>HOWEVER, this article neglects the fact that there are still billions of stars similar in aspect to the sun, that have cosmically long lifetimes, high metallicities and relatively quiescent environments.<p>From Kepler we know that planet formation is not the exception, it is the norm; at this juncture, it is impossible for us to say if rocky planet formation is an exception or a norm. You have to understand that the Kepler mission was not designed to figure that out, it was designed just to figure out if planets were common. The next major ESA planet mission, PLATO (and I think NASA may have a similar project in the works), will answer that question, and until that time, it&#x27;s entirely plausible that the galaxy is filled with goldilocks planets.<p>(For reference, the Kepler spacecraft&#x27;s sensitivity to earthlike planets in the habitable zone is minimal-- it&#x27;s a function of size of the planet vs distance from the star, every time the planet goes in front of the star (function of distance) a small signal (function of size) is added to a time series that can be coadded over and over to remove noise (so maybe it takes 7 or 8 orbits to verify a planet). This is why Kepler mostly finds molten rock planets and gas giants. The distribution of planets we know about today _is a function of the instrument, not the actual planet distribution_.<p>The more interesting projects are the ones attempting to take planetary spectra. A spectra of a planet&#x27;s atmosphere will tell you the chemical components of that atmosphere and is performed by taking a spectra of the star and then subtracting the spectra of the planet in front of the star (the difference between the two being the planet. There are certain chemicals in atmospheres, called biomarkers, that are indicative of life (ozone, for example, only exists in meaningful quantities because of photosynthetic life). This is an incredibly difficult and ambitious project: you need high res spectra at large signal to noise to even see these biomarkers which means probably multiple nights of 8-10 hour observations on modern 8m class telescopes, in the 30m telescope era, maybe it&#x27;s more plausible; you need the right type of rocky planet, of which we know few; you need that planet to be in the exact right spot in its orbit in front of the star; and of course god needs to make it not rain after your 20 hour flight to Hawaii.<p>For all we know, not only are planets the norm, not only are rocky planets the norm, but life is also the norm.<p>Thus, not seeing advanced life is a function of _our instruments_ not indicative of the fact that advanced life is somehow new, or rare. Even with all the notes in the article, there could be advanced life with several billion years head start on us.<p>A thought I haven&#x27;t devoted much time to is that perhaps interstellar travel is just downright impossible on a meaningful scale at a reasonable speed.<p>... Unless of course life arose from a panspermia situation, and we are the actual results of the most sophisticated form of interstellar travel in the universe. Perhaps we are a colony of some monolithic species, packing their genetic blocks into chunks of ice and tossing them willy-nilly about the galaxy...",1438051036

Right now games focus on camera space rendering because they only care about 1 view output and view space effects are cheapest in this scenario.<p>If you have shared state rendering suddenly you can process the instance state once per frame for 100s of users just like you simulate the game for 100s of users per instance.<p>You can have specialized hardware setups (ie. multiple high end GPUs with >10GB of ram) doing dedicated tasks like recomputing lighting/shadows, animation, particle effects, etc. you would need to find a way to make these systems asynchronous to reduce lag so lighting updates might lag a frame or two for eg. behind animation but as usual with rendering there are always clever tricks to fool the eye - and once you have gigabytes of ram at your disposal very different rendering techniques compared to currently used ones become viable for shared state rendering.<p>Someone already linked a platform that&#x27;s already doing this - I have no doubt this is the future of VR and gaming at least in some part (maybe you won&#x27;t be streaming video to the client but some geometric 3D world representation with deltas so that the final rendering can be done client side and you can have low latency rotation for stuff like VR)",1438050598

There&#x27;s no way to use these HLS tools unless the third parties feel like writing a model for their IP in your choice of HLS tool language. This means you would have gaps in <i>your</i> HL design everywhere their stuff fits in. Verification in the high level language would be tough work until those gaps are filled.<p>No doubt guys like Intel can use the fancy HLS tools on their SOC because they own every module in the design. Same goes for the RISCV stuff: They can run Chisel sims because they wrote every part of the design in Chisel.<p>The rest of us idiots are doing straight Verilog RTL because SOC level is more about gluing a lot of different modules together with low level logic.

(e.g., name requirements) While there was an expectation that people would behave better when their activity was tied to their own identity, as that identity is presumably a highly valuable and non-renewable resource to them, the evidence weighed against it: people seem quite willing to be jerks under their own identities....</i><p><i>In practice, the forced revelation of information makes individual privilege and power more important. When everyone has to play with their cards on the table, so to speak, then people who feel like they can be themselves without consequence do so freely -- these generally being people with support groups of like-minded people, and who are neither economically nor physically vulnerable. People who are more vulnerable to consequences use concealment as a method of protection: it makes it possible to speak freely about controversial subjects, or even about any subjects, without fear of harassment.</i>",1438048812
