9274328,comment,9274047,9274047,0,0,davvid,,,"I&#x27;m a C++ developer, and Rust looks very exciting to me.  Maybe I&#x27;m optimistic, but Rust really looks like it can be a serious C++ contender in the long run.<p>Talking with other C++11/C++14 users here, the general feeling is that, yes, C++ is a good language because of the performance you can get out of it and some of the nice features that have been added, but the language carries around a lot of cruft that is unavoidable due to its age and maturity.<p>C++ has always been an expert&#x27;s language.  These days it&#x27;s the expert&#x27;s expert language++.  There are no shortages of landmines and gotchas in the C++ landscape.<p>Modern C++ is a new language, and it really does help, but for the first time there&#x27;s another language that can actually fill those same shoes.<p>A really big deal that isn&#x27;t really addressed by golang is the fact that you can produce shared libraries with rust, and call them from existing C/C++ programs through a C interface.  That&#x27;s a really big deal in places with a lot of legacy code.<p>Another big deal (from the scientific computing POV) is the lack of garbage collection.  Yes, GC is helpful, but replacing C++ means squeezing every last bit of performance out of your hardware.  Rust does not sacrifice in this regard.<p>I really hope that Rust has a bright future.  It&#x27;s almost like &quot;C++ done right&quot;, but I would stray away from such a label since someone might Linus you and say, &quot;there&#x27;s no way to do C++ right&quot;.<p>I also view golang as the successor to Python.  It&#x27;s faster, modern, addresses concurrency, and makes things easier for developers.  It takes a strongly opinionated stance, and that&#x27;s exactly the right choice for many problem domains.<p>Python, unfortunately, is dead to me.  The GIL is a deal-breaker, and even though we have <i>lots</i> of Python code in production, I can definitely see a future where Python is phased out in favor of something like golang.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m bullish on Rust + Golang, neutral on C++, and slightly bearish on Python/Ruby-like languages that do not address the concurrency problem.",1427420762

You&#x27;ll have plenty of time for learning, for thinking about the content of your studies, for the library, for dedicated focus <i>later</i>. You&#x27;re only young once.<p>Now I&#x27;ll agree that getting wasted every weekend is a very bad idea. You will end up dying a painful death very early in your life. But it&#x27;s a good idea to go to parties. It&#x27;s a good idea to have fun, to live. Doing what everyone else is doing isn&#x27;t always the best advice, but sometimes it&#x27;s <i>the</i> best advice. You have to use your (unimpaired) judgement. I wouldn&#x27;t have half the friends I have now if I hadn&#x27;t spent nights puking right beside them. Now as an adult with a professional job, if I want to make new friends, the only way to do that is to have kids and set up playdates. Instead I find myself studying, reading books on the couch next to my wife. When you get older, you lose your ability to party like a college kid. You lose the opportunity to have that kind of bonding experience with your peers.<p>Young people drinking is a serious issue. You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s harmful to brain development, it gets people in all kinds of trouble, and it can be seriously deadly to the drinker or to someone else they might meet while drunk. That&#x27;s what makes this really hard to write, because to be honest, I&#x27;m not a drinker now but I was in college. And I attribute everything I have to the nights I spent not in front of the books, but in front of the crowd, dancing with a lampshade on my head.<p>So don&#x27;t drink. You don&#x27;t have to. Don&#x27;t do drugs. Don&#x27;t put yourself or others at risk like that. But seriously, if you&#x27;re in college DO SOMETHING SOCIAL. <i>Don&#x27;t</i>, DON&#x27;T sit in the library while your youth passes you by. Sit in the library Monday-Thursday. When Friday rolls around, go hang out with your friends. Because trying to make college-style friends as an adult is 100% impossible.",1427420597

But actually, in practice, once one has moved from some old Nokia brick to a modern smartphone, the assumption is wrong. SMS has its place for sending someone a quick text but it is going the way of FAX, to be only used in some arcane circumstances.<p>With SMS the delivery was not as good as email. As mentioned, there is perfectly good wifi where I live but marginal phone signal. In theory I could find some remote mountain where there is only 2G but even then emails get delivered at least in header form.<p>The other thing is that when I had my SMS notifications I had to buy credits in advance. If the monitored sites were completely down and notifications were being sent to three people then those credits could run out quickly. So there was that unnecessary dependency on a third party service that had some credits to pay for in order for it to work. Totally non-strategic!<p>If we think of the dog and the selfies, say the dog just happens to tap the button every few seconds. That could be expensive with SMS but free on email.<p>You can also build some backup into the email approach, you can cc your private email as well as email your work one. There is none of the 140 character message length nonsense either.<p>Plus, who doesn&#x27;t check their phone every 6 minutes or so?<p>To be slightly unfair, TFA is marketing spam.

To me, there are two problems to be solved here, the first is that women are uniquely punished for being assertive; the second is that, in my opinion, you need a mix of assertive and relatively unassertive people in your organization to accomplish the most, but being assertive will naturally get you more attention, money, etc, which can create an imbalance in staff rewards.

As far as I can tell email is going to remain the primary method of business communication for the foreseeable future.",1427418635
