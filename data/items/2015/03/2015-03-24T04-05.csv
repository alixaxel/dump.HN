9254972,comment,9254393,9254393,0,0,Jonhoo,,,"FWIW, here&#x27;s what I just did on my (Arch) Linux machine:<p><pre><code>  $ for f in /etc/ssl/certs/*.pem; do sudo ln -sfn &quot;$f&quot; /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/blacklist/; done
  $ sudo update-ca-trust
</code></pre>
This will block all currently installed CAs (as well as double-block some, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter). You then need to add them back in.<p>Restart your browser, and go to websites you access frequently (change them to <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> if necessary). Click the (broken) padlock and read off what CA they used; remove the corresponding .pem file from the blacklist directory. Some might be signed by intermediate certs and thus hard to find, but SSL Hopper has a great chain inspection tool at <a href=""https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html</a> you can use to identify the topmost CA cert you need to whitelist.<p>After you&#x27;re done, run &quot;sudo update-ca-trust&quot; again, and restart your browser. All normal sites should work, and you&#x27;ve gotten rid of ~160 root certs.<p>If it&#x27;s of interest to anyone, here are the ones I whitelisted to get all sites I bothered to try up an running:<p><pre><code>  $ sudo rm DigiCert_* GeoTrust_* Go_Daddy_* GlobalSign_* VeriSign_* StartCom_Certification_Authority* Comodo_* AddTrust_* Thawte_* thawte_Primary_Root_CA* Baltimore_CyberTrust_Root.pem UTN_USERFirst_Hardware_Root_CA.pem Visa_eCommerce_Root.pem
  $ ls /etc/ssl/certs/*.pem | wc -l
  206
  $ ls /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/blacklist/
  163
</code></pre>
EDIT: Note that this is not a perfect solution; the CAs you&#x27;ve whitelisted could still go bad, and you&#x27;ll need to blacklist any new CA certs that are added with subsequent ca-certificates updates. But it&#x27;s a start.",1427173059
9254971,comment,9253290,9254795,0,0,ploxiln,,,"Bringing up Redis, Riak, and ElasticSearch is nice...<p>You see, ElasticSearch gets split brain surprisingly easily, if you have a real significant load / number of hosts / host failures you will most definitely experience it, whereas with most other databases it&#x27;ll only happen once every couple of years to the very largest and heaviest users. It&#x27;s also just not known for data consistency, you just have to be able to refresh data from some other canonical source periodically.<p>Redis requires 2x memory present as is used to serve the load of requests, in order to backup. You can only safely really use half the server&#x27;s memory. Because it has to fork to either save the snapshot or to compact the write log.<p>Riak performance is difficult to manage and keep consistent, as you replace failed nodes.<p>What I have experience with is a very large / heavy use of mysql at a popular website. We did manual/application sharding, and master/slave streaming replication, with automatic read-failover to slave, but only manual promotion. The slave did backups each day, and there was enough transaction log on the master and slave to spin up a new slave to either, with a backup up to 3 days old, and have it catch up. The nature of the load was that it was not possible to take a backup of the master in order to seed a new slave, because the traffic never stops and we could not afford the memory or iops overhead of backing up the master, and we really didn&#x27;t do downtime if we could help it. A couple hours a year maybe.<p>We had trending and alerting of everything, including replication, roles, and we automated it all with something not unlike the configuration it appears you have to use for postgresql. Frankly these new-fangled auto-everything databases are untrustworthy, I&#x27;ve seen three of them fail (in ways you might not notice if you&#x27;re not a graybeard), and the fourth has a name that really puts me off. RethinkDB? yeah, go ahead kids. I just love all this unreliable crap on the internet these days...<p>PS I&#x27;m 26 :)",1427173056

Each CA would have to effectively mirror all of the logs out there, and the logs impose rate limits on queries. It would be interesting also to see what happens when a log gets DDoS&#x27;ed (we know OCSP servers aren&#x27;t useful because of that problem).<p>> <i>Is it possible to configure the browser to fail closed if it hasn&#x27;t reached its update server within some period of time?</i><p>Sure.<p>> <i>Is this something that CT can/should do? Can we standardize something like Chrome&#x27;s CRLsets, and make the browsers require they be able to reach CRLsets somehow, either through the vendor or through a CT log?</i><p>Can? Yes. Should? Well, I suspect this would be yet another user experience nightmare that would therefore lead to little support for the idea.<p>> <i>What&#x27;s DNSChain&#x27;s solution here? Can a MITM pretend that the blockchain hasn&#x27;t moved in a few weeks?</i><p>Are you referring to the connection between clients and DNSChain or a blockchain and its network?<p>If the former, then a MITM&#x27;s only option is to block connection to DNSChain, which would be treated as a MITM attack (appropriately).<p>If the latter, yes, a MITM could do that, and if PoW is being used by the blockchain this attack would be detectable instantly due to an immediate and significant drop in block difficulty. Even if it somehow wasn&#x27;t detected, it still wouldn&#x27;t allow the MITM to issue fraudulent certificates.",1427172720

Consider: Many people would rather not wear an ill-fitting &#x27;nice&#x27; outfit, or may not have the sartorial education to do so, but feel obliged to do so as a condition of their employment. You won&#x27;t be able to get a job as a bank clerk if you show up dressed in a hoodie and jeans, for example; you need to show up in a shirt and tie (if you&#x27;re a guy) even it&#x27;s the cheapest item that you could find at Men&#x27;s Wearhouse and you don&#x27;t look very good in it.<p>&#x27;Well-fitting slob clothing&#x27; not only signals that you&#x27;re not subject to some sort of onerous dress code imposed by your employer (within reason), but also that you can afford to spend money on what most people could consider leisurewear. Further, while you may genuinely not be interested in clothes, picking them out in the morning, looking at other peoples&#x27;, or shopping for them - and while I can sympathize with your disinterest - that very indifference is itself a mark of affluence. Most people work hard at that stuff because they feel obliged to create a certain image to get employed, get laid, and maintain their self-respect.

They were not in the earliest versions of B, but appeared along the way. People often guess that they were created to use the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes provided by the DEC PDP-11 on which C and Unix first became popular. This is historically impossible, since there was no PDP-11 when B was developed. The PDP-7, however, did have a few `auto-increment&#x27; memory cells, with the property that an indirect memory reference through them incremented the cell. This feature probably suggested such operators to Thompson; the generalization to make them both prefix and postfix was his own. Indeed, the auto-increment cells were not used directly in implementation of the operators, and a stronger motivation for the innovation was probably his observation that the translation of ++x was smaller than that of x=x+1.<p><a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html</a>",1427170981

9254833,comment,9253690,9254344,0,0,_callcc,,,"I noticed the implicit y combinator as well... here&#x27;s something I wrote in python some time ago to play with the idea:<p><pre><code>    def tco(fn):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        tco
        ---
        
        Usage:
    
        Functions should have the following form:
        
        >>> recursive_fn = lambda fn: lambda x: fn(x+1) if x < 1000000 else x
    
        or
    
        >>> def recursive_fn(fn):
        ...     def recursive_fn_cc(x):
        ...         return fn(x+1) if x < 1000000 else x
        ...     return recursive_fn_cc
        
        The notable difference is that called on their own, these
        functions aren&#x27;t recursive at all. For example,
    
        >>> recursive_fn(lambda x: x)(1)
        2
    
        This is easier to see in the anonymous-style definition:
    
        >>> lambda fn: lambda x: fn(x+1) if condition(x) else x
    
        So we go from
    
        >>> def recur(x):
        ...     ( function body modifying x )
        ...     if not base_case_reached:
        ...         return recur(x)
        ...     else:
        ...         return x
        
        to
    
        >>> @tco
        ... def recur(fn):
        ...     def _lambda(x):
        ...         ( function body modifying x )
        ...         if not base_case_reached:
        ...             return fn(x)
        ...         else:
        ...             return x
        ...     return _lambda
    
        Then call as usual like
    
        >>> recur(x)
    
        Functions need to take this form as it exposes the fixed-point, 
        namely the recursive `fn`. We need a fixed-point for the modified
        y-combinator. The modified combinator is the same, only where the 
        evaluation step would normally take place, each evaluation is 
        suspended or &quot;thunked&quot; by wrapping in a `lambda`. The thunks
        are then looped over and called in a while-loop, sidestepping
        the recursion depth issue.
    
        TODO: save the kwargs; eliminate the need to write the functions
        as continuations (i.e. `recur = lambda fn:lambda x: ...`) by creating
        new function objects from bytecode, replacing instances of `LOAD_GLOBAL`
        with `LOAD_DEREF`, may need to build temp function in order to create 
        closure so `fn` can be added in `co_freevars`. See e.g.

with everything you said except your
first sentence, and I&#x27;m not sure the
rest of what you said does much to 
support your first sentence!<p>One point is, CS isn&#x27;t the only area for
<i>applications</i>!<p>E.g., in the software for my startup,
sure, I have some matrix theory,
right there in the code, but it turns
out the matrix theory is what is left
for the actual code after some 
earlier derivations very much in
<i>calculus</i>!<p>When I was a prof in a B-school and
teaching linear programming, right,
awash in linear algebra, I mentioned
to my students, all of whom had had
the required courses in calculus,
that I regarded it as a &quot;pillar of
Western Civilization&quot;.  I still do.<p>Without Newton&#x27;s second law, Maxwell&#x27;s
equations, etc., I strongly suspect
that Western Civilization would be a
very different and much less good 
place.<p>E.g., my father in law eventually 
slowed down his farming and got a
job in town.  He was head of the 
REMC -- Rural Electric Membership
Cooperative.  So, it was the local
electric utility.  They handled 
only the last few miles and bought
their electric power from the <i>grid</i>,
really from one private power company.<p>Some of his customers were factories,
and at one point he asked me why his
engineers put large capacitors outside
some of the factories.  Well, I&#x27;d been
a ugrad math major but, except for
one course I wanted instead of another
that would have been required, also
a physics major, and had done well in
ordinary differential equations, so
had see the differential equations of
basic passive AC circuit theory, that is,
with resistors, capacitors, and inductors.<p>So, sure, the factories had a lot of
big electric motors with a lot of
inductance.  So, the utility pushed
current to the motors but half
a cycle later the motor pulled more
current.  So, net, the utility was
moving a lot more electrons than
necessary to deliver the power it
was getting paid for and, thus, was
getting more power losses in its
lines.  So, put a capacitor just
outside the plant, and then the
plant looks like a pure resistor
to the electric company and all the
extra electron moving is just between
the motors and the capacitor 
just outside the plant.  Ah,
<i>applied calculus</i>!<p>There are many more such examples;
the examples say that calculus
is really important but don&#x27;t
really settle your question about
&quot;overstated&quot;; for that question,
I don&#x27;t know what to say!",1427169701
