9295246,comment,9290271,9290873,0,0,Potando,,,"Not stupid, but they either didn&#x27;t understand or relied on the placebo effect and didn&#x27;t perform experiments that were actually useful at distinguishing helpful from harmful or useless medicines - AND communicate that information to others. When an ancient remedy turns out to be useful, it&#x27;s not useful until we rediscover that it actually works. The idea of science and sorting out mysticism from reality is fairly new in most of the world. In China, doctors in public hospitals still prescribe untested herbal remedies and diagnose diseases without any idea of the effectiveness of what they&#x27;re doing. Patients just trust authority, tradition and popular belief. You could argue that the same is true to some extent in the west today too - see general &quot;have some antibiotics&quot; prescriptions, and cough and cold medicine.",1427795923

9295234,comment,9294227,9294227,0,0,diasks2,,,"I did an analysis of different sentence segmentation tools when I was working on my own rule-based segmenter. The results can be found in this README (<a href=""https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter</a>).<p>I think this blog post almost hits on the key in the middle - in my opinion it is important to test (all of) the edge cases. The problem with most corpora typically used to test segmenters is that 80-90% of the sentences are the same (i.e. a regular sentence ending in a period). Thus if a segmenter just simply split the sentence at every period it would still show a 80-90% accuracy rate. This is why I am trying to develop a standardized set of edge cases: <a href=""https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter#the-golden-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter#the-golden-ru...</a>",1427795718

9295231,comment,9291015,9293511,0,0,IanCal,,,"Slightly OT ramble ahead :)<p>> even when I filed bug reports that turns out to be issues in my own code.<p>Every time I&#x27;ve used or built a property based testing system I&#x27;ve had problems when starting because there&#x27;s something broken in it. This has then turned out to be an actual bug in the system being tested.<p>Building a quickcheck style tester in AS3 drove me nuts at one point before finding out that the conversions between strings and floating point numbers has a bunch of weird issues. There are some obvious ones, but then also things like certain numbers convert differently if you add a trailing zero (so 0.7362856270 is turned into a different number to 0.736285627 and 0.73628562700). So my little &quot;decode(encode(x)) == x&quot; test example broke!<p>My favourite thing that it found was in a menuing library we were building (and why I built the tester). I set it up to test a library by making library calls that a developer might make and test various properties of the overall menu (all elements reachable, for some if you move left then right you&#x27;re back on the same item, etc). One property was that if there was at least one item in the list and the list had focus, then one item in that list had focus. This was found to be broken by starting with only one item, removing it and adding a new one (reduced test cases are incredibly useful).<p>That&#x27;s a fairly boring bug, but the interesting thing (to me) was that when I fixed it my unit tests broke. I had an explicit test to ensure that this behaviour was happening, and I&#x27;d also written it down in my spec for what should happen.<p>The testing tool forced me to consider higher level things of what should be true and drove out an inconsistency in my library. It&#x27;s a &#x27;bug&#x27; that would have bitten me many times, but rarely enough that it would probably have regularly ended up going live.",1427795692

9295228,comment,9294954,9295064,0,0,ptaipale,,,"TL;DR: Denmark, Finland, Sweden and presumably others do it already.<p>I&#x27;m surprised if France and other supposedly civilized countries don&#x27;t do it on behalf of the Justice Ministry or equivalent. I mean, the fundamental responsibility of citizens is to adhere to the law (ignorantia juris non excusat); the fundamental responsibility of government is to make the law available to citizens because it is not reasonable to require compliance with laws that are not practically available to citizens.<p>I&#x27;m in Finland, and the full content of law books has been in internet for almost 20 years, published first by the state-owned publishing house that gave out the print versions, and more recently by Ministry of Justice who has contracted the technical execution out. The database structure managing pieces of legislation dates back to 1980&#x27;s, but until 1990&#x27;s it was available only through a license payment.<p>Individual laws (and executive orders, state treaties and such) that are published by parliament or ministries have of course always been public information and published in the net since 1990&#x27;s; the important thing is actually maintenance of &quot;up-to-date&quot; version because the parliament publishes its laws mostly as &quot;patches&quot; (i.e. only a changed section is reviewed, voted on, and published).<p>The database cross-links to published parliamentary process so that the official background work for each law, section and paragraph is available, including preparatory statements by parliamentary committees, any dissenting opinions and so on.<p>Also more significant precedent cases from high courts are available in database. (We have a so-called Roman law system where the code is primary source of law, unlike American/English common law where precedents are more important; nevertheless neither system is absolute of course, and precedents do matter in civil law systems as well.)<p>The database descriptions can be found:<p>Denmark: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_dk/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_dk/index_en.htm</a><p>Finland: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_fi/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_fi/index_en.htm</a><p>France: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_de/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_de/index_en.htm</a><p>Germany: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_de/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_de/index_en.htm</a><p>Sweden: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_sv/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/n-lex/info/info_sv/index_en.htm</a>",1427795643

Let me know if I got anything wrong.<p>------<p><i>The French Civil Code, in Git</i><p><i>Introduction</i><p>Here is a little hack, the result of an afternoon of code: the Civil Code in Git.<p>If one considers the law as a set of texts modified by the various assemblies of the state, one can consider them as a set of text files created collaboratively.<p>The members of government, and the various assemblies, work in collaboration on these files, which, once voted for, are written into the Code (here the Civil Code).<p>But there is another category of people who, for fifty years now, have worked on text files collaboratively, and excel at it: developers. They have created extremely effective collaboration and tracking tools for working on source code. The most popular to date is Git.<p>Git not only allows you to view the source at a time T (snapshot) but above all to easily visualize the changes in the source (commits). In the analogy to the Civil Code, this permits the tracking of the changes made by a law.<p>Combine all of this with the Open Source philosophy, and the second part of the analogy is made: the modification of source code in an open and public fashion.<p>Finally, the Civil Code is a part of the source code of France. And source code belongs in source control. Period.<p><i>Example</i><p>Here is for example the commit which authorizes marriage for all: <a href=""https://github.com/steeve/france.code-civil/commit/b805ecf05a86162d149d3d182e04074ecf72"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/steeve/france.code-civil/commit/b805ecf05...</a><p>This is more readable than, for example (cf <a href=""http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/ta/ta0120.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/ta/ta0120.asp</a>):<p>&quot;At article 165 of the same code, the word: &#x27;before&#x27; is replaced by the words: &#x27;during a republican ceremony by&#x27;.&quot;<p><i>Technical Note</i><p>Git dates are based on the Unix epoch (01/01/1970), changes before these dates are all dated 01/01/1970, with incremental seconds; the commit message gives the correct date.<p><i>LICENSE</i><p>All files are licensed under Creative Commons (<a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a>).",1427792931

I do not think openness and publicity of fights is the only way to get fairness. Or at least this can be discussed and we should allow that, on one side openness is often faked, on the other that private and closed tractations may to some extent result in a decision or in a law that is efficient and corresponds to the long term better good of the concerned people (i.e. what they would really choose if given all the elements, and not disturbed by red herrings)<p>For instance, if the governing elite is composed of (&quot;extracted from&quot;) people from all parts of society, attracting the best of them with some good rewards (e.g. not money, but something like &quot;good fame&quot;) and they collegially discuss important issues using the powers of associations, it could very well be a sane way to distillate the will of the people.

The more interesting question is what other forces there are in a culture to counter that manipulation. Political censorship is an attempt to suppress such counter forces, not a replacement for manipulation. Censorship is supposed to make maniuplation more effective.",1427792451

There are no safety barriers to protect the audience. Additionally, the rally audiences got crazed by deadly dangerous activities like standing in front of the cars until the last second or trying to touch the cars when they zoomed past (there&#x27;s a story that a mechanic once found a severed finger in the side mirrors of a car).<p>It became impossible for the race organizers to control the crowds and make the race events somewhat safe. That&#x27;s why &quot;exploding popularity&quot; was an issue.<p>Group B was terminated after an accident in 1986 Rally Portugal (?) when a Ford RS-20 car flew off the track and into the audience with dozens of fatalities and serious injuries. This was only a few weeks after the fatalities of driver Henri Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto in the Rally of Corsica. Toivonen&#x27;s last interview concluded with: &quot;these cars are too fast for the human mind, if you lose concentration, you&#x27;re dead&quot; [paraphrased from Finnish], then he closed the car door, drove off and was never seen again.<p>This is how crazy it was: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYIH7ApCxoM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYIH7ApCxoM</a>",1427792403
