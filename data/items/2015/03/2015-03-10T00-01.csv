9175259,comment,9170615,9174893,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"I mean, if you consider knowing that databases require disk space to be &quot;specialized knowledge&quot; then, I mean, I guess so. Otherwise the installer is rather straightforward in telling you what the paths are for. And creating a new DB also shows you which files will be used. There may be 20 pages, but most of that is ... pretty straightforward, easy stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve run SQL Server in life-critical production systems (911 call routing) and found it to be very straightforward. Just make sure the alarms are turned on and enabled for replication.<p>I&#x27;ve run it in HA clusters, both with a shared DAS and with the new shared-nothing system. A walk in the park. The only difficult thing I&#x27;ve personally run into with SQL Server was figuring out the Broker Service stuff and dealing with replication outside of a domain. And that was probably mostly networking configuration issues - the config wizards are pretty amazing.<p>I&#x27;m not implying that there is <i>no</i> specialized knowledge, and many SQL Server installs are probably suboptimal. But it&#x27;s far from necessary to know much to go very far with SQL Server.<p>Compare to Postgres, where doing anything correctly requires mucking around with the config file, and, last time I used it, logging into the shell with a special user. And HA, well, good luck.",1425949161

One problem is that line between real and bot has been blurred.  There are many real accounts out there whose owner have attach bots to them.  I frequently get bot follows only to see that I have been unfollowed in short order.  The obvious hope is that I will reciprocate the follow and not notice the unfollow.  But often these are coming from real accounts.  One of the downsides of being a programmer and being interested in CS type things is that a the twitter circles I would be interested are loaded with these semi-faux/semi-real accounts.  The result is that the spam to signal ratio is much too high.",1425949151

The Science abstract suggests &quot;reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods&quot;, while the Vox article talks about &quot;reducing pesticide use <i>when possible</i>&quot;.  The news article phrasing suggests that pesticide reduction is optional.<p>The Science title is &quot;Bee declines driven by combined stress from parasites, pesticides, and lack of flowers&quot;, while the Vox title is &quot;A new theory for why the bees are vanishing&quot;.  The paper clearly blames pesticides, while the vox title suggests (on a quick read) that pesticides are really only a <i>theory</i>, and may not be the latest one at that.<p>One HN comment states &quot;It would be helpful to know exactly what&#x27;s killing them instead of just assuming the reason is obvious.&quot; The corollary is that maybe we should research more and wait before drawing conclusions. I agree with the statement, but not the corollary.<p>I grew up with the schoolyard buzzing in summer time. In Vancouver, Bumble bees and honey bees were everywhere when the flowers bloomed.

Some of the best developers in that organisation were excellent at their job because they could take the incomplete and inconsistent desires of a banker, and turn that into a coherent and complete &quot;world view&quot; about the system they were required to build. We were primarily a Java shop, and they could produce an adequate application within the frameworks available to them, but I shudder to think what they would have said if you asked about &quot;coupling and cohesion&quot; or the java memory model, or how dynamic proxies work, or even how they should choose between making a field a short, int or long.<p>So, for my current (startup) organisation, I wouldn&#x27;t hire those people - despite them being instrumental in producing some of the most satisfying and successful (ROI) systems I&#x27;ve been involved in. This team needs people who can do hard engineering, and if my former colleagues applied for a role here they&#x27;d end up looking like the proverbial &quot;inept programmer&quot; that we&#x27;re debating.<p>This <i>is</i> a reflection on their skills, but it&#x27;s also a sign that similarly named roles (&quot;software developer&quot;) in different teams require and cultivate different skill sets.",1425948257

If the thing is simple and timeless and easy to transport, I opt for the timeless route. If I think I might not keep it for more than a year or two, I usually get the cheap one.<p>Midrange &quot;luxury&quot; items seem to be barely better quality than the best-cheap-options available, while most of their cost seems to go to marketing (or styling, in the case of clothes/fashion products). They also quickly depreciate.<p>Super premium items, however, usually retain their value and are significantly more satisfying to hold/use. The place where this has been the _least_ true, in my experience, is with electronics. All electronics depreciate quickly. There is no timeless smart phone.<p>Incidentally, Kia has been doing a great job lately. I rent a car almost every week, and after comparing the Kia Forte with the Jetta and the Optima with the Passat, I prefer the Kia in both cases. The VW automatic transmissions don&#x27;t seem to shift very smoothly, and I actually found the trim levels to be comparable and the Kias more fun to drive.",1425947692

As far as I know:<p>* The L-1 visa is only for intra-company transfers, so unsuitable in most cases.<p>* The O-1 visa is for proven extraordinary talent, and as such is inaccessible to 99.9% of the population.<p>* The EB-3 visa has a 4+ year waiting periods, so out of the question.<p>* The EB-2 visa, if you have a master&#x27;s degree (related to the job), and were not born in India or China, can be obtained in circa ~1 year. (Labor certification alone could take nine months to a year.)<p>* The J-1 visa lets your work for a short amount time, but imposes a 2-year ban after the year is over. Anyone even mildly considering moving to the U.S. for longer than a year and half would not use this visa.<p>* International students in the U.S. can work for a short amount of time after graduation with OPT. But this requires being a international student in the US, of course.<p>* The EB-1 visa is primarily used by managers transitioning from L-1A visas. The &quot;extraordinary talent&quot; EB-1 oddly has a much higher standard than the O-1. (A good candidate would be a Nobel prize laureate.) For all practical purposes, it is inaccessible to 99.9999% of the world population.<p>So right now, the &quot;best&quot; alternative to the H-1B is the EB-2. But a company will have to wait for a whole year vs. the 6-7 months for the H-1B. In addition, labor certification is a very expensive process costing around $10k-$20k. It&#x27;s not guaranteed to return a positive result either. A single <i>minimally</i> qualified U.S. worker could bar the entry of the potential would-be immigrant.<p>So in your knowledge, is there any visa that&#x27;s actually easier to obtain than an H-1B and that offers the (AC21) job portability of an H-1B as well?",1425946772

The column interface is one that could drive anyone crazy, especially with the unintelligent defaults for sizing the windows and columns.  It&#x27;s damn near impossible to get around a filesystem with finder as is.<p>It seems as though apple is pushing non power users away from the finder altogether via apps that hide any notion of a filesystem from the user.  Just try copying a movie project file from Final Cut - it&#x27;s maddening.  If they&#x27;re going to continue down this road, then why not provide some additional features in finder for people who could use them (like breadcrumbs and the ability to type a file path like in windows, any IDE, etc).",1425945653

For us, we have too many projects for copy/pasting the Gruntfile between them to be a viable option, and the Gruntfiles themselves would have been too complex.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced the shell scripts are a good alternative, though. (Maybe they are for your scenario.) I would like to write a follow-up post talking about this.",1425945639
