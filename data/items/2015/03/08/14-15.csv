Apps are much simpler. You can bootstrap an entire ecosystem by just implementing a few services (messaging, email, maps & a few others).<p>Nokia was on its way with the N700-N9/Maemo-Meego series, and afterwards with Nokia X. Both killed before getting the chance to succeed, but they might have had an impact had they lived longer.<p>Jolla is now taking the same route, but also adding an Android VM which offers almost seamless interop with Android apps. Very interesting approach. Not fully open yet, though.<p>If I were Xiaomi, I would go full steam ahead with MIUI. Don&#x27;t just create another shallow Android mod. There are too many of those already. Try to evolve it into a whole open ecosystem free of Google. Think Cyanogen + f-droid, on steroids. It would really make them different.",1425826766

You&#x27;ll see a engineer rat another engineer out to management when there&#x27;s nearly nothing to gain. This has been shown in companies with peer performance reviews: the bankers and traders give each other top ratings, while the programmers tend to beat each other up. It&#x27;s not that bankers are better people and won&#x27;t stab each other in the back; it&#x27;s that they understand that information is power and won&#x27;t do so for free, or for meaningless stakes like transient managerial favoritism.<p>A typical, politically-inept programmer will say, &quot;the low performers are Alice, Bob, and Charlie&quot;, just because he&#x27;s asked. You don&#x27;t have to offer him anything. He ends up losing in the deal for two reasons. First, if people find out that he&#x27;s a snitch who tried to endear himself to management by selling others out, then everyone will hate him. That&#x27;s just human nature. Second, low performers can be good for your job security because (a) you don&#x27;t have to outrun the bear if layoffs or stack-ranking come-- you just have to outrun the other guy; and (b) they can anchor compensation favorably. The fact that a mediocre investment banker gets $500,000 per year means that a good one makes millions. That&#x27;s how you play a large, rich organization that isn&#x27;t going to die because of a few passive low-performers. You want to move against the active low performers (i.e. those who create problems for other people) and the politically dangerous, but it&#x27;s generally good to protect people who are benignly below-average because their making average wages puts a case forward for you (as an average or better performer) to make above-average wages.<p>A banker won&#x27;t give that kind of information (who&#x27;s performing, who&#x27;s a little weak) up unless there&#x27;s something to be won from it. If you&#x27;re acting politically optimally (and not afraid of being a bit of a sociopath) you know that there are times when it&#x27;s best to protect low performers and times to sell them out. In peace time, it&#x27;s usually the former.<p>As for academics, they make the software engineers look politically savvy. They&#x27;ve performed so poorly, as a tribe, at convincing the rest of society that they have any worth, that their whole industry has fallen to shit. If I were to choose a specific mistake, I think the biggest fuckup on the academics&#x27; part is making it so goddamn obvious that they consider research to be their &quot;real work&quot; and teaching to be that onerous grunt work that they got stuck with. That works for the research rainmakers who bring in millions in grants, but devaluing teachers has led to the adjunct market.<p>The older generations of professors expressed distaste for the teaching job, as if it were commodity grunt work, and the universities have responded in kind by treating the teaching as commodity grunt work, i.e. the &quot;You said it&quot; retort-- and, at the same time, realizing that they could then do without all these medieval history researchers who were mediocre teachers.<p>If academics had any political or social skill whatsoever, they would have never developed that culture that devalues teaching and especially undergraduate teaching, because even if <i>they</i> considered the research to be their real work, the rest of society considered the teaching to be their real work, and by devaluing it they basically challenged the rest of society to unemploy them <i>en masse</i>. See, undergraduate teaching is valuable in its own right (intangibly) but it&#x27;s also a marketing effort; if you convince the next generation of leaders that literature is important, then maybe they won&#x27;t unemploy people who study it full-time. But if you decide that teaching the <i>hoi polloi</i> undergraduates is beneath you, then you risk getting fucked (deservingly) 20 years later when those undergraduates become state senators or college donors and decide that what you&#x27;ve been studying is unimportant.<p>That said, the calamity of the tenure system is that the older generation (who created this obnoxious culture) was unscathed and it was the younger generation who saw their job prospects turn to vapor. I hate academic tenure for that reason: it seems almost designed to make the rising generation pay for the entrenched generation&#x27;s sins.",1425826738

She could then make the free choice to move to SA. Now, while in SA, she would have the same (lack of) woman rights as other women in SA. But it was her own choice to put herself in that situation. In the same sense, women are freely able to express that they want something like sex segregation in &quot;our&quot; society. That is a free choice on their part. But if that somehow comes reality, they might not have so much free choice any more, if SA is any indication.

9165717,comment,9161935,9164863,0,0,archietse,,,"Two main reasons:<p>1) SVG text scales as you scale the the SVG object so the text becomes unreadable pretty quickly as the artwork scales down, or looks hilariously large as it scales up. By rendering the text as html, we can scale the &quot;graphic&quot; up and down, but keep the text readable at the same font-size and line-height. This is important because we are trying to reduce the number of versions of the artwork that we have to create in order to accommodate viewports that range from mobile phones up to giant desktop monitors. An example of this is here: <a href=""http://nyti.ms/1CQdkwq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nyti.ms/1CQdkwq</a> Change your window size when you view the page and you&#x27;ll see the artwork scale but the text stays the same size.

You&#x27;re probably never going to get a yes/no answer though because most large competitors will have multiple unrelated lines of business, and it&#x27;s usually not possible to get data beyond the organization level.

Before I tried it I had lots of doubts and a feeling of &quot;no, this can never work out, you need Live, nothing can be better&quot;. But it was a big surprise - it feels like Live done right, without the awkwardness. Since then I am so happy that I can use pro music production software on top of linux, I have not looked back into my Ableton setup for months now.<p>Linux is such a win for me, works much better, most stable, quick and fluid system I have ever used, I do not want to change back to windows or osx. I hope Bitwig will survive and finally bring some more long term attention to the linux audio stack, which seems to be much better choice for making a computer a music machine.",1425823574
