And if there is an impending &quot;Hiring Freeze&quot; that is about to be enforced , the desperation to hire someone goes up. This happens in large companies ( I m not sure about startups though); In these cases - the hiring Managers feel its OK for a candidate fall short of a bunch of expectations . They might as well have a resource that can get some work done , instead of not hiring any one ( and be stuck with one less resource for the next few months) . Most of the hiring freezes last one quarter. Sometimes , it might last two quarters - and it mounts a lot of pressure on the existing members of the team.<p>(2) Hiring managers (sometimes) look for potential than what you are currently capable of. You might have not the exact skills they are looking for - but you might have shown enough enthusiasm about the role / and might have strong indicators that you could get the job done for them.<p>Its fairly possible either one of these or both could be happening in your case.",1427010817

9245977,comment,9244283,9245855,0,0,saraid216,,,"> (I really hate the phrase &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, by the way, because it simply isn&#x27;t a good way to describe democratic voting, where the majority is emergent and not determined ex ante.)<p>Nothing about the phrase actually requires the tyranny be remotely permanent, and nothing about the concept of tyranny requires it either. Indeed, it&#x27;s actually more poignant that the tyranny is both ephemeral and, more importantly, inevitable. This is the real issue. It&#x27;s easy to comprehend the issue by looking at semi-permanent states [1], like Marxist class divisions or political polarization, but those are <i>consequences</i>.<p>When you place something to a vote and fail to achieve consensus, you have a majority whose will is being enacted upon a minority. This is commonly celebrated by moronic catchphrases such as, &quot;the right side of history,&quot; but you still have a winner and a loser. And when the ephemeral majority seems to crystallize from the aether into an unmistakable demographic of some kind, you really have to wonder about this &quot;emergent majority&quot; concept.<p>The fundamental American problem is that it is incapable of trusting its government. (I can&#x27;t speak to other governments; I don&#x27;t live under those.) This lack of trust is well-founded, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less crippling. I said below that the appropriate counter to the tyrannical majority is a strong executive. The executive is capable of saying, &quot;No,&quot; to a popular opinion in a way that the legislature cannot. (Indeed, this is a role Americans have shoved onto the judiciary, which means we can&#x27;t actually say no until someone files a lawsuit.) The interplay between the legislature and the executive (the vote, the veto, the super-majority overrule, the refusal to enforce, the impeachment) is exactly the solution being proposed.<p>None of it works without an executive willing to exercise its options. See Obama&#x27;s refusal to enforce immigration laws, for instance. (For the sake of this &quot;academic debate&quot;, let&#x27;s presume that he could enforce them to the letter if he wanted to.) That is a check against tyranny of the majority. So naturally, well... see for yourself [2]. This isn&#x27;t meant as an anti-Republican statement; it&#x27;s just the most recent example I could bring to mind off the top of my head.<p>The trust part comes back when you ask, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t a minority group tyrannized by a majority group just leave?&quot; You know, secede. This comes back to the emergent majority you spoke of: if you trust the majority to, you know, not be dicks about it [3]. To not <i>always</i> be the majority, then secession isn&#x27;t necessary. You can expect that the issues will change and you&#x27;ll be in the majority. Of course, what&#x27;s happened with the polarized political class in America is that you stick around because you figure you can <i>win</i> next time.<p>This is a problem. It is the exact opposite of what you need to make sure that a majority is an emergent majority. Instead of melting back into an indeterminate goo and forming new majority/minority groups in each vote, you have battle lines being drawn for a budding civil war. And that&#x27;s as far as I&#x27;ve figured out.<p>[1] &quot;State&quot; as in &quot;state of being&quot;, not as in &quot;nation-state&quot;.

As far as protocol features go, it is a pretty good yardstick.<p>Now, as for &quot;turnkey service&quot;... I would guess you&#x27;re positing yourself as the platform provider.

Maybe it&#x27;s specifically the density of people in passenger jets that causes issues, but you&#x27;d think the military would have done studies about smoke in airplanes prior to the 80&#x27;s.<p>It&#x27;s also interesting how much catastrophe investigation resembles bug hunting.  The crash had four distinct features that made it such a disaster:<p>- A internal piece of the engine, a combustor can, had a crack manually repaired via welding.  Since the documentation to the mechanic didn&#x27;t specify the <i>maximum</i> crack length that could be repaired, the weld was insufficient.<p>- The combustor can exploded during takeoff, which broke through the wing&#x27;s fuel line<p>- The engine lit the leaking fuel line on fire<p>- The fire caught a wind updraft, which engulfed the (otherwise fire-retardant) fuselage, causing poisonous smoke to fill the cabin in minutes.<p>If any one of the 4 issues hadn&#x27;t occurred, catastrophe could have been avoided.  Piecing all that together really gives new meaning to the term &quot;cascading escalating failure&quot;.<p>Finally, the video mentioned how one door got stuck because the inflatable ramp failed to deploy.  On modern aircraft, those ramps are no joke.  If you&#x27;ve ever heard &quot;Cross-check and verify&quot; on a flight, it means to verify that the ramps (which explosively inflate) are activated [1].  The &#x27;red strip&#x27; on a flight door means that opening said door with trigger the ramp.

It&#x27;s hard to say which jhanic states exactly because I practice alone with no teachers. I would guess from first to third but not for long periods of time. I have experienced piti and after that entered &#x27;equanimity&#x27; jhanic state, subtle but alert and content concentration.<p>I highly recommend the book Focused and Fearless, I haven&#x27;t seen such clarity on meditation anywhere else, except maybe Buddhist texts but they can be cryptic and poorly translated.<p>My technique is comfortable freestyle sitting (as opposite to lotus that gives me pain and takes away from concentration) and breath counting from 1 to 10 and 10 to 1 until I reach more relaxed breathing, then I switch to counting 1-1 on inhale, 1-1 on exhale, repeat until 10 and backwards, this reduced mental activity and keeps me on a) breath at nostrils and b) concentration with counting. After 15-20 minutes I usually start hitting Jhanic states with piti coming in first and then going away to enter more subtle higher absorption.<p>But yeah, get the above book, I am not much of a guide, I was actually lucky to hit piti within several days of Anapanasati meditation and Jhanic states within a week. I hear that some people struggle for months.",1427008799
9245944,comment,9245467,9245467,0,0,glup,,,"I think one important thing to note is the hourglass format of most scientific papers: statement of the broad problem and general importance of the question at hand, gradually more specific identification of the current challenge/contribution, down to the methods/model and results, and then widening to look at the implications and relationship of the new findings to the rest of the field.<p>Where you focus on the paper depends on what you want: if you are just learning the central questions and theoretical views in the field then the beginning and end are more useful; as you gain an understanding of the field you may be more interested in the particular advances in a given paper and may devote more attention to the middle.<p>At least in several of the fields I read regularly (linguistics, cognitive science, NLP, and developmental psychology) there are three key paragraphs that tend to have the most useful information:\n1) the abstract (duh!)\n2) the last paragraph of the introduction (this usually has the most concise statement of the motivation)\n3) the first paragraph of the discussion (this usually recaps whatever advances they make in a usable way; actual results sections often contain a level of detail that isn&#x27;t very memorable after a few days).<p>Citations are shorthand for entire sets of ideas--they&#x27;re a means by which whole arguments can be referred to very concisely. One of the challenges in reading a new literature is in learning what set of citations are commonly reused and how, especially because the conventionalized citation of a paper isn&#x27;t necessarily what the author expected it to be known for, nor what you might take from a paper on a first reading (or any number of readings). For this reason I highly recommend reading papers with inline full citations (Chomsky, 1965) rather than numeric/ indexical citations that you have to look up [1].<p>Finally, mock-reviewing a paper is a fantastic way to make sure you&#x27;re being honest about how much of the paper you understand. Another technique at higher grad school levels is mock-reviewing a paper from someone else&#x27;s (=prominent academic&#x27;s) perspective--which imposes the dual constraint of understanding the paper at hand as well as the theoretical perspective behind someone else&#x27;s critique.",1427008741
