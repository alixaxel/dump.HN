9238431,comment,9237063,9237698,0,0,T-hawk,,,"XSLT is conceptually sound indeed, a transformation of tree structures.  But the <i>requirements</i> and <i>real-world usage cases</i> thrown at it are often terribly suited for it.<p>Real applications just don&#x27;t fall neatly into tree transformations.  I inherited a financial reporting web app using XSLT as the rendering mechanism.  Requirements included things like running totals (state!), suppressing leading values when repeated between rows (also state), alternating row colors, external dependencies such as numeric formatting based on user&#x27;s locale settings.  A stateless tree transformation doesn&#x27;t express that elegantly, so you end up with fantastically complicated and ugly XPath hacks.  A running total would come from something like &quot;sum all my parent&#x27;s children with an index less than mine&quot;.  Then that breaks when something comes up to introduce a need for another layer beneath that parent.<p>XSLT is purely functional.  <xsl:if>template</xsl:if> isn&#x27;t even control logic, it is functional evaluation, the same as Lisp&#x27;s (if x template nil).  <xsl:for-each> also isn&#x27;t an imperative loop (it&#x27;s map) even though it looks imperative and most enterprise programmers trained on imperative languages think it is and use it as such.  So it&#x27;s no surprise that XSLT in the wild ends up as a messy ball of mud.<p>Most templating languages have this problem, including PHP/HTML.  The messy nature of real requirements isn&#x27;t unique to XSLT.  But XSLT manifests it most dramatically since it lacks a stateful and imperative framework to fall back on.",1426866840

Can you afford higher education both for you and your offspring? Can you afford to own your home? Can you afford reasonable and convenient means of transportation for your area (multiple family cars in rural areas, but maybe one or even none in urban ones)? Can you afford occasional leisure activities? Can you afford to have a savings and retirement account? Do medical expenses not worry you?<p>Meeting most or all of these requirements is what sets people into the middle class. I agree with the article that this number is different as you need to take into account local cost of living, but a lot of these requirements are not tied to local costs. I also think this probably puts this number at a higher point than many people think. I have many friends that think, &quot;Oh, I make $20/hr. I&#x27;m middle class now!&quot; And I don&#x27;t agree. You&#x27;re still going to struggle with bills at that level of income. Middle class is about being above that struggle most of the time. There&#x27;s a freedom that comes with not having a loan for your education, vehicles, emergency spending (credit cards), etc. And a middle class family should have that freedom.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I can see $250k being middle class still, but I do think in the SF Bay area, a family making $150k is quite reasonably still middle class. The upper bound of the middle class is I think harder to define than the lower bound. Once you always have the option of not working for long stretches of time (more than several months) that might be a good indicator of upper class.<p>I think throughout the last 40 years or so we&#x27;ve gradually become so accustomed to the diminishing size of the middle class. We don&#x27;t realize what it used to mean. We forget that a time existed where a family with a good budget could live on one income and still afford a house, two cars, college funds for the kids, vacations, and savings.",1426866802

A number of people accused Windows 7 of taking UI ideas from KDE, which ultimately greatly improved their OS&#x27;s usability. Still, a delicate balance needs to be found among innovation, enterprise requirements, and personal/community wants. Thankfully, at least covering the third group, with Linux there are often solutions to these experiments (though they might still end up being rather involved, such as creating your own solutions or moving on to a different window manager entirely). Yet if one doesn&#x27;t like the Windows 8 UI approach, for example, the only real recourse would be to downgrade and hope things change for the better in the next release.",1426866620

It isn&#x27;t a good idea, though, because it falls disproportionately on rural owners, and it ignores the central insight of the law of rent.<p>The point is that monopolization of prime locations is what drives &quot;real&quot; wages down. In other words, the amount you can afford after rent and taxes take their cut, is determined by these factors.<p>You should instead pay for what you use, by value. If that doesn&#x27;t happen, rents will just flow as unearned income to owners of the best land, and wages will be depressed. And then we&#x27;ll additionally need to tax productive activity to make up the shortfall.<p>The &quot;margin of production&quot; is the best available rent-free land, and the point is that the better this land is, and the more productivity is possible upon it, the better your next best alternative to paid labor is. Thus, employers must pay you more, or landlords must demand less... because otherwise you&#x27;ll take that next best alternative.<p>Of course, the alternative includes all subjective and intangible things too... but that is what I mean by &quot;real wage.&quot;",1426864843

Today, thanks to Blue Systems adopting Kubuntu and the general decline of most other KDE spins (Suse lost its commercial support, Mandrivia died and got forked a bunch, Fedora continues to be Gnome-first in a good way) my impressions from the ML and general developer mindshare is that Kubuntu is becoming <i>the</i> KDE distro for the betterment of the platform, because then you don&#x27;t end up with all this wasted effort making an 80% great experience on every different package manager, fs layout, login manager, and init stack. Kubuntu CI is pretty much the only place one should go to develop KDE software and that means Kubuntu and Netrunner are always going to be the core KDE distros.<p>And that is not bad.

9238208,comment,9237199,9237878,0,0,weland,,,"I have very mixed feelings about some of the stuff Gnome is doing. Some of them are <i>at least interesting</i> from a certain point of view, like sandboxing applications. I get why this would be nice to have in corporate environments, and that brings money to Linux, which Linux does need. I also think it&#x27;s solving problems at the wrong level for everyone else. (Selective) communication <i>between</i> sandboxed applications seems to be something they have no coherent framework for. Besides, as many Android applications show, savagely enforcing sandboxing has had questionable effects on privacy (as applications that <i>really want your data</i> will happily just request permissions to do everything and refuse to work otherwise). As for the security gains of such an approach, I&#x27;m skeptical about the effectiveness they add to an open source environment. What remains is offering additional protection against bugs (that e.g. allow otherwise unauthorized access). But proper desktop sandboxing is so incredibly complex that it&#x27;s hard not to think a far more efficient approach would be fixing those bugs in the first place.<p>For better or for worse, they&#x27;re also experimenting with a lot of new approaches to UI. Which is pretty much how innovation happens -- something that computer desktops could use since everyone else is, at this point, imitating either Mac OS or Windows 95. However, an opt-out solution for users who are happy to encourage innovation, but would rather not be the victim of failed experiments every other release would be nice...",1426864636

Partly because of new language features (proper namespaces (enabling easy autoloading), traits etc) and partly because of the community pushing decent standards [0], [1].<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that since 5.3 the Laravel framework [2] has been created and in its latest iteration it draws a lot of inspiration from ASP.NET MVC and Rails (the former resonates with me coming from .NET land; though I&#x27;ve not much experience with the latter), making it a great framework for rapid prototyping. Its coding style encourages a lot of good practices and it&#x27;s become very much the go-to PHP MVC framework, at least for me.<p>A good resource for reading up on &#x27;modern&#x27; PHP is PHP the &quot;Right&quot; Way [3] - there&#x27;s also a (very recently released) O&#x27;Reilly book on Modern PHP [4] written by the creator of a popular micro framework [5] - I&#x27;ve not had chance to read it yet (and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not its target audience) but I have enough faith in the author to know it&#x27;ll be a worthwhile resource.<p>Having said all of this, it is still PHP and you will still be working with some of the old quirks.
