If you have someone who&#x27;s basically a competent geek, they can probably do that in a few days to get it all working perfectly. Once set up this sort of stuff tends to be fairly robust, so it probably won&#x27;t take more than 1 days a month to maintain, deal with inevitable issues, etc.<p>If you have absolutely nothing better to do with your time, it&#x27;s a great idea to do this yourself.<p>For the rest of us who are actually trying to grow businesses rather than set up IRC servers, there&#x27;s HipChat and Slack.",1427277510

Also you avoid all the obstacles that cars have to navigate at ground level (rivers, buildings, trees, etc).<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s some work to be done to define good copter &quot;rules of the road&quot;. A simple solution is to say you can only go north at lvl1, east at lvl2, south lvl3, west lvl4. That would pretty much eliminate lateral collisions, so then you&#x27;ve only got level changes and takeoffs/landings to solve and it&#x27;s done.<p>On the other other hand, there are bad drivers, there&#x27;ll surely be bad pilots.

They deserve to have this dirty laundry aired, considering the massive investment they have made in covering up the problems with their products.  This is not a company that will go lightly into the chambers of justice - it will fight all the way for its own position to be held in the public eye, because that is one of the things it does, as a company, to build the value it has achieved so far.  Monsanto is not just a biological-product producer; they&#x27;re also masters at manipulating public opinion, owning politicians, and defining their PR on their own terms.  Just like they manipulate the genetics of organisms for their own gain, they manipulate the general publics point of view in the same light.

Built in unit testing and contracts, algebraic data types, pattern matching, optional typing, immutability by default - no other altjs language provides all of them at the same time (I think). It reminds me of Cobra (<a href=""http://cobra-language.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cobra-language.com/</a>) a bit. Does it support AST-based macros? That would go way beyond awesome :)<p>It looks like Pyret is the result of some 20 years of work on PLT Scheme/Racket - most of the good and advanced parts of Racket but without any historic cruft.
