There is also a lot of busy work, unnecessary work, and the like, done in offices daily.<p>Still I find that in many areas the amount of office work needing to be done is related to the amount of regulation the industry is burdened with. I know what because of SOX deal with two sets of auditors quarterly whose staff size alone is dozens of people. There is still a great deal of paper work that is required to be in the files of overlapping government agencies in different forms and even at specific times of the year. All that takes people. People to create, people to review, people to certify, people to validate the certification, and people to validate a process that creates the documents is all observed.

This is even more so an issue because the majority of startups are VC funded and are under pressure to sell or comply with VCs interests.<p>So in practice you have three ‘safe’ ways to build your infrastructure, which are not mutually exclusive. Choose OSS software, buy from companies such as Oracle, IBM, HANA, etc, and build it yourself. Depending on the expertise of your team and funds available for purchases, as well as qualifies of the available solutions, OSS is probably the safest way, followed by purchased from large corps. Rolling your own infrastructure is expensive, time consuming, requires committing your developers to building infrastructure instead of well, building a product, and may not work in the end at all.<p>Even the companies that can afford to do it everything in house (Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, etc) choose OSS for the majority of their needs and build on top of that. Google is Google. However,  if that infrastructure is your selling point and what differentiates you from the rest, and/or you have very specific needs and makes more sense to do it this way, doing it yourself can be a great alternative.<p>We rarely use OSS here, and we don’t use any proprietary infrastructure technology. We have built everything ourselves, and it has worked out great so far, but we have put a lot more effort and resources into that, whereas we could have instead invested on the Product. If we had to make a choice again, in retrospect, we ‘d most likely have gone the OSS way.\nIt’s all about tradeoffs.",1427283860

That&#x27;s actually how rump kernels on NetBSD started: running the kernel file system driver as a library in userspace on top of a FUSE-like subsystem.  It&#x27;s pretty useful functionality, since it allows you to handle untrusted file system images safely in userspace, while not imposing performance penalty on the trusted images which can be handled by the same driver running in the kernel.  Unlike with FUSE-specific drivers, you don&#x27;t run into issues with unsymmetric driver support in userspace vs. kernel.",1427283506
