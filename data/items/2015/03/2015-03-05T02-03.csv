If you went to a job interview and they asked &quot;What is your biggest strength?&quot; would you say &quot;Well, humans are prone to overestimate their abilities. I couldn&#x27;t answer that question without doing a double blind research study&quot;?<p>Think about it: The only way that you could change your view of your own abilities is by comparing your predictions about people&#x27;s character to their actual behavior over time. Jessica did the same thing, but she found that her predictions were accurate.<p>JL has the opportunity to make judgements about people, and then spend months or more with them as a part of YCombinator. She can say &quot;I don&#x27;t think the members of this startup will work well together&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t like the looks of this guy&quot;, and then see if she was right or not.

There is a dynamo in the center of the front wheel hub that generates far more power than the system uses. Its expected that the dynamo will be sufficient as the sole power source.

I have some random thoughts about doing this in a distributed fashion:<p>...<p>In the wiki there&#x27;s a mention of how the geocities torrent was 900GB and very few people seeded it as a result. There should be a way and an incentive for clients to seed parts of files without having the whole thing. As long as there are enough copies of each chunk on the network, it&#x27;s fine - we don&#x27;t care that any one client has the whole thing.<p>...<p>Another cool thing is thinking about health metrics - you don&#x27;t just care about how many people have a file, you care about recoverability too. This seems a bit similar to AWS glacier - you have to take into account how long it&#x27;s going to retrieve data. You could have stats on how often a client responded and completed a transfer request, what its track record is, and assign a probability and timeframe for correctly retrieving a file.<p>...<p>One thing that comes to mind is that whatever the solution ends up being, it should be such that partial recovery should be possible. The example that comes to mind is stuff like a zip file or encrypted image that is completely ruined when a chunk is missing. So maybe it makes sense to have the smallest unit of information be large enough to be still intelligible on its own?<p>At first I was thinking of a model where chunks get randomly distributed and replicated, but then that made me wonder whether that&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>...<p>And then what of malicious clients? I guess it&#x27;s not hard to have a hash-based system and then just verify the contents of a file upon receiving it. But can I effectively destroy a file by controlling all the clients that are supposed to be keeping it up? How could you guard against that? Could you send a challenge to a client to send you the hash of a random byte sequence in a file to prove that they do indeed have it? What guarantees that they will send it even if they do?<p>...<p>And then what about search / indexing?! P2P search is an awesome problem domain that has so many problems that my mind is buzzing right now. Do you just index predetermined metadata? Do you allow for live searches that propagate through the system? Old systems like kademlia had issues with spammers falsifying search results to make you download viruses and stuff - how to guard against that? Searching by hash is safe but by name / data is not.

This explains why style judgements seem so intuitive and &#x27;snap&#x27;, but at the same time the phrase &#x27;rigourous sense of style&#x27; is not either un-common or innaccurate.<p>While &#x27;objective&#x27; character and Style are both attributes subject to (intuitive, snap) judgement it is really best not to conflate the two.<p>I think we are doing the topic a dis-service by not calling out style bias as something distinct from objective character evaluation.<p>-------<p>[1] What I&#x27;ll just call &#x27;objective&#x27; character here, which has both moral and pragmatic dimensions, but you get the gist, in that its covering things like fundamental integrity, work ethic, and functional social-skills, leadership, altruism, etc).<p>[2] the core style being the subset of those in the target class deemed qualified enough to be alumni of YC.",1425522386

At some point in the conversation Bob &quot;dissociates&quot; and is replaced by Charlie. Charlie is in the exact same place as Bob and sees all the things Bob was seeing, but Charlie wasn&#x27;t here before so no idea where here is, how he got there, or who is talking to him. Alice doesn&#x27;t know anything&#x27;s wrong at first but Bob (now Charlie) seems uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t know things Bob does, like where they are, how they got there, or who she is. Sometime later the dissociative episode ends and Bob comes back in place of Charlie. Bob has no idea what transpired during the episode because Charlie was there instead, but recognizes Alice and remembers things they had done together.<p>In this case there is no difference in Bob&#x27;s or Charlie&#x27;s ability to perceive the world, nor are either of them perceiving something which Alice could not (barring other conditions). There are no hallucinations or delusions; Bob and Charlie appear to &quot;know&quot; different things, as if they were different people. Of note, Bob and Charlie identify differently but its debatable whether they are (or should be treated as) different persons, hence the change of name.<p>Schizophrenia: Alice is talking to Bob. Bob is talking to Charlie. Charlie isn&#x27;t really there, but Bob is either unaware or doesn&#x27;t mind. Bob&#x27;s conversation with Charlie may be benign or it may involve plots to take over the world, in either case from Alice&#x27;s perspective Bob experiencing something which isn&#x27;t real.<p>This of course is just a possible scenario for schizophrenia, and if Bob is being treated for schizophrenia he may be better able to control or cope with Charlie. In schizophrenia cases Charlie does not exist to any third party observation; Bob is not identifying as Charlie nor is Charlie an alternate persona. Bob believes he is himself and that Charlie is communicating with him.",1425522201

She sometimes said delusional things like she thought she was an alien, or that Jesus was inside her, or that she was a reincarnated dolphin, etc. Other people told me she would get weird in conversations, a lot like the &quot;react oddly in conversations, not respond, or talk to themselves&quot; description in the Wikipedia article. Stuff that schizophrenic people do.<p>When I asked about it, she said she realized that it didn&#x27;t make sense that she was a reincarnated dolphin and that she didn&#x27;t know why she believed those things. Schizophrenic people don&#x27;t really have that kind of self-awareness.",1425521352

Reminding that if 50 years ago military requests pushed boundaries of technology, today commercial applications are so demanding - and command such a large market - that it is military devices which piggyback on RND results of commercial ones.<p>Yes, you may always want a unique, expensive, cutting edge satellite. But you won&#x27;t always need that - military doesn&#x27;t directly set the goal to spend as much as possible. X-37 demonstrates a lot of capabilities while being much cheaper than previous reusable space vehicle. So with launch costs going down other, cheaper opportunities open - to everybody, including military. That&#x27;s beside the idea that cheaper rocket doesn&#x27;t mean worse rocket, reminding Japanese cars of few decades back.",1425521248

Then, by construction, the exercise and no exercise groups are drawn from the same genetic distribution.
