Take a look at the context of the conversation.  I wasn&#x27;t popping in out of context out of nowhere and saying &quot;Linus is an asshole, look at these comments!&quot;.  I was responding to the specific assertion that these asshole-ish statements can be attributed to cultural differences.  I in no way disagree with the idea that &quot;Linus was being a dick in these cases&quot; is very very different from &quot;Linus is a dick&quot;.",1426924762
