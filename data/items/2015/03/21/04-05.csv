It gave me a complete, new FreeBSD system inside of a directory.<p>Then a lightbulb went on ...<p>A month later I posted beta invites to the cDc and 303 mailing lists and in December &quot;JohnCompanies&quot; was born.  I advertised almost solely on kuro5hin.org and grew the company from my apartment in Aspen, Colorado.  In February, 2004, I sold the company.<p>We called them &quot;server instances&quot;, but &quot;VPS&quot; is the name that eventually caught on.<p>JohnCompanies still lives on today.  Not sure where they&#x27;d fit on the &quot;VPS Compare&quot; list.  I see our ad is still up on kuro5hin, if only because Rusty is too lazy to remove it, after more than 10 years...<p>The backup system(s) that we built for JohnCompanies customers was reworked and launched as a standalone product in 2006.  You know it as &quot;rsync.net&quot;.",1426913937

It really is as simple as, &quot;Have any of you played Grand Theft Auto? Does that make you all car thieves? Have you watched Saw? Does that make you serial killers? No? Then why are we here?&quot;<p>That people will vote to convict a man simply because they don&#x27;t like what he thinks about, and that these cases can get this far in the first place, is absolutely terrifying. People really have become too stupid for a jury of one&#x27;s peers to result in a fair trial.<p>What do you think these people would do if this man had an impossible fetish, like petrification or gigantism? &quot;Your honor, clearly the defendant had conspired to turn a woman in real life into a 50-foot tall statue. We must lock him up before he is able to do so.&quot;",1426913884
