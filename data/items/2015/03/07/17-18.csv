What that means is something every Ph.D. from a less-prestigious institution knows all too well: No amount of publishing, teaching excellence, or grants can compensate for an affiliation that is less than favorable in the eyes of a search committee.</i><p>This is just wrong.  It is possible that publishing and grants are correlated with institution rank (and teaching excellence is usually a relative measure so hard to compare across schools anyway).<p>It seems decades of anti-discrimination indoctrination have resulted in a situation where no argument is to sloppy, and no evidence is to flimsy, when you are arguing that discrimination exists somewhere.",1425751167

How about Churchill, King, Lincoln?  No doubt very smart people but relied just as much on other abilities.<p>What about the arts?  How many of your favorite musicians or comedians are great at math?  Arguably these abilities are orthogonal to what Tao can do, yet are clearly a form of genius.<p>The innateness/validity of EI is not yet settled but emotional intelligence enables people in ways that just are not possible with only pure problem solving prowess.

They do this by coercing the person or persons at SilentCircle that can post an update to post an update stating that everything is just peachy now.   Followed up by another post on their blog, or here on hacker news (as happened the last time they did not update the canary) stating that it was a misunderstanding or a simple error and no to worry everything is fine.<p>The value of the SilentCircle has in my opinion been nil since the last incident occurred when it was not updated.<p>I would like to believe that our government will act transparently in accordance with democratic principles \nand in accordance with the public courts but this is\nnot always the case.  It may be the case in most cases.<p>I would also like to believe that SilentCircle employees would not agree to &quot;fake&quot; their canary under any circumstances, and this is probably 90% certain.

Is it solvable? Not to sound like an asshole myself, but with the route feminism is taking us, we&#x27;re going to have people hand-feeding women who don&#x27;t deserve to be in a specific role. I myself have specifically experienced such an event where my manager hired a woman because he said we need to hire one, not because she had experience that made her worthy. In fact she had far less experience compared to the other people interviewing. One of my best friends on the other hand is one of the most kickass programmers I have ever seen and everyone respects her for it. She works for her status, rather than feeding off of being a woman.<p>People shouldn&#x27;t judge a book by its cover, as they say. That&#x27;s what this is all about and I may have gone off-track. However, its also naive to forget or completely deny that people are inherently competitive. People like to boast about themselves, not others. Woman or man, work politics are something everyone has to deal with. It&#x27;s wrong for someone to use a woman&#x27;s gender against her competitively, but then again it&#x27;s also wrong for a man to throw another man &quot;under the bus&quot; or take credit for someone else&#x27;s work to get ahead.

This should not be happening constantly, and I&#x27;d expect word to spread so it no longer happens at future events.<p>If the TAs are not introduced to each other, and are not wearing prominent tags or something that identifies them as TAs (and the students are not wearing anything that prominently identifies them as students), then given that women are are very underrepresented among programmers and that women are massively overrepresented among the students (it&#x27;s a workshop to teach women to code), then the male TAs are doing nothing wrong.

Whenever Greg K-H does his contributor report, it looks like the largest collaborative software project ever shows no signs of slowing down.
