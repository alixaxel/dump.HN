Apparently male pumas roam a range approximately 3 times as large as female pumas, and therefore must be much more mobile to maintain their territory - average lingering time at a kill site was estimated to 7 hours shorter (2.86 vs 2.56 days) for males than females in areas with minimal human presence. The suggestion from the authors is that the since males are already under pressure to be mobile, that they were already spending close to the minimal amount of time required at a kill site to extract sufficient energy.<p>Other things of interest is that we can actually see variance in behavoir increasing as human density increases. The error bars (standard deviation) on time spent at kill sites (or really doing anything) open right up the moment housing appears.",1425185765

9126077,comment,9125816,9125816,0,0,rpcope1,,,"It&#x27;s funny, this article seems to be rather full of irony. At the beginning of the article, I started miss when a lot of the tech scene was a little more grass roots, but maybe that&#x27;s just rose colored glasses. Obviously, things have gotten more sophisticated since the days of simple computers like the TRS-80 and while it&#x27;s not possible to totally grep everything in a modern OS, I do miss some of the hacker ethos that may have waned when the web went big. That being said, I find it a rather perverse juxtaposition to take about governments and Wall Street abusing the tech industry and then hold up he examples of Uber and bitcoin as movements counter to this. While there may have been some inefficiency in the Taxi medallion system, Uber seems to thrive on skirting labor laws and relying on the perhaps misplaced hype surround the &quot;gig economy.&quot; Bitcoin is also not a terribly appropriate choice; while the idea of the blockchain is novel, the technology is kind of wasteful (all of energy required to move the blockchain along, probably coming from non-renewables), it&#x27;s built on arguably shaky financial grounds (nothing like a sovereign to back it, it&#x27;s often theorized to be a Ponzi scheme), and Wall Street is getting into it big time. Both of these seem to be part of the &quot;pop tech&quot; the author is rallying against.<p>I would rather see kids encouraged to hack all things (not just web sites and walled garden mobile app) to keep the old school tech culture alive, and I certainly feel the need to make sure things like GNU continue, as it, amongst other things, have provided the means to rally against big corporations controlling access to the interesting bits of technology (like being priced out) back in the day. I personally feel as though copyleft is important from this perspective, though this is probably a somewhat controversial opinion. One thing the author doesn&#x27;t mention as something we should focus on, is if we want to keep the tech industry from locking us out of technology as we know it, I think we should also work to make sure tech giants and other corporations don&#x27;t strong arm standards organizations and force development into walled non-free gardens, especially like with Google and Apple&#x27;s threatening moves with regards to the internet (i.e. iOS locking out competing browsers, Google trying to completely lock out others from gTLDs like .dev).<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I also find the equating of &quot;pretty people&quot; and the use of &quot;nerd&quot; around a lot of the culture surrounding technology both click-baity and ad hominem.",1425185706

Amongst others I was offered USD 350k + bonus to head a data science team - and all I have is an unrelated engineering degree and three years&#x27; experience. This kind of package would be hard to get for a freshly minted Harvard MBA at a major bulge bracket bank...<p>In finance, I&#x27;ve seen some eye watering packages in China for the same reason, including base salaries of 600k and 750k respectively for someone who was making 300k, at a large institution and a small hedge fund. Obviously, with the local cost of living the difference is magnified.<p>Personally, moving to Asia was the best career move I ever made; the local economies grow at 15% a year, the local companies grow even faster, and there&#x27;s a real lack of talent locally vs the ultra-competitive US market. Whenever I can, I try to convince companies here to hire Americans or Europeans remotely or relocate them.",1425184266

What I find to be more egregiously misused when doing machine learning in practice is that everyone too often flocks to the state of the art with little understanding why. There&#x27;s no reason for example to spend weeks (or months) tuning a incredibly deep neural network if the current predictive ability is enough and there are higher priority matters to work on.<p>Moreover, there&#x27;s just too much of an emphasis on prediction. Design and analysis of experiments, handling missing data and the context of the data sets, and quantifying one&#x27;s uncertainty about parameters in a principled manner for robust estimators are very underappreciated skills in the community. Using p values arbitrarily and &quot;95% confidence intervals&quot; based on an unchecked normal approximation is incredibly more harmful than not doing anything at all. There&#x27;s just so much more to machine learning than supervised learning.",1425184035

Yes, immigrants, by increasing supply do have a depressing effect on wages, but, in a global economy, don&#x27;t we also believe in a global workforce?<p>People seem to have a problem with H1Bs, but people are happy to enjoy the benefits of cheap fruit and vegetables possible with labor of (illegal) immigrants --farmers, even descendants of immigrants oppose amnesty because that would result in the help actually getting legal jobs which pay more.  But here, in the case of H1Bs, people seem to have a strong dislike for them.  They are just people looking for jobs like anyone else.<p>Is the implicit argument we should have a different system to allow a greater supply of tech immigrants but with a more flexible visa, maybe even grant residency status thus eliminating this kind of soft exploitation?",1425183938
