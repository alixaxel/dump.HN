9278344,comment,9275987,9277330,0,0,ketralnis,,,"That&#x27;s a very cherry-picked list of problems.<p>* Drugs are addictive and expensive. Not all of this expense is due to costs of avoiding enforcement. This can and does drive users to poverty, which has its own correlation with crime outside of drug enforcement itself<p>* Not all overdosing is due to &quot;no proper information available about dosages&quot;. I&#x27;d wager that few overdoses are from first-time users, so the overdoser has <i>some</i> information about their own previous dosages at the very least.<p>> Drug users are denied jobs and treatment, so they cannot get their lives on track even if they want to.<p>If the only problem with drugs is that they are illegal, why do they need treatment? Can we agree that an addict that wants treatment would need it whether the drug is legal or not? And that some people don&#x27;t do it, or can&#x27;t afford it, regardless of its legality (see: alcohol)?<p>I&#x27;m pro-legalisation, but you&#x27;re hardly making a good case here by picking strawmen and showing how easy it is to beat them down.",1427482622
9278343,comment,9277370,9277980,0,0,JackC,,,"ircmaxell makes a good point in that comment -- not that the <i>concept</i> of a pepper doesn&#x27;t work, but that a two-way encryption function is a better choice than a hash function for applying the pepper.<p>Your pepper will be a long, random key that is known to your app server but not your database server. If you store passwords as:<p><pre><code>     bcrypt(bcrypt(password, salt), pepper)
</code></pre>
then you spend a lot of cycles bcrypting your long, random key, which is pointless (it should already be long enough to be un-brute-forceable), and you lose the ability to rotate keys or ever stop using this scheme in the future. There&#x27;s also (in theory) some risk that nested bcrypt() doesn&#x27;t work predictably.<p>If you store passwords instead as:<p><pre><code>    encrypt(bcrypt(password, salt), pepper)
</code></pre>
then you can routinely rotate peppers through a simple one-time decrypt-and-encrypt step on your app server, instead of endlessly nesting peppers as suggested in the filippo.io blog post.<p>The rest of it is more of a qualitative question -- what&#x27;s the risk that someone gains access to your DB but not your app server, vs. the risk that in implementing the pepper, you somehow screw up and store something easily crackable?",1427482618

It explains something pretty well and then suddenly there is a big knowledge jump that you must fill looking at internet (I had to check the python documentation several times to understand what was happening at some examples).<p>I started looking at other books and found &quot;Learn python programming arcade games with pygame&quot;by Paul Cramel, who is teaching his own book at an university course.<p>For me it&#x27;s sooo much clear, taking you step by step through the difficult concepts (hand holding if you wish), that suddenly are not that difficult. It contains lots of simple exercises and questionnaires that make sure that you understand the concepts in the lesson. Each lesson has also it&#x27;s own Lab, that gives you the specs and making you use the lesson material to code on your own. I find this to be the perfect way to fix the ideas in a practical way. I don´t know enough to create my own exercises&#x27; specs being a complete newbie.<p>Of course making games and moving drawings is hands down much fun than writing command line scripts.<p>It only has a small problem, you need to install pygame&#x27;s libraries, which can be a bit difficult in mac. I had to do several tries with snow leopard,  Finally I installed the latest Mac OS and it installed without problems.<p>I&#x27;m recommending it to every body who asks me. It&#x27;s free in his site and the e-book(that I bought) it&#x27;s inexpensive.<p>I´m sure LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY is and will be useful to a lot of people, and don´t mean to disrespect the author effort in helping people learn programming, but I thought worth giving an alternative in case you are looking for one.<p>I´m not related in any way to Mr. Cramel, I just happen to find his book very useful.",1427482464

9278327,comment,9275464,9277790,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"<i>> who and what are behind the push to remove civil liberties</i><p>There&#x27;s no master plan, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting at. I think this general drift is the result of a few different things, most of which are older than we&#x27;d like to admit:<p>• A <i>lot</i> of people like authoritarianism
• People blame government by default for any problem that doesn&#x27;t have any more obvious perpetrator (see point 1)
• The massive mismatch in military strength between western powers and elsewhere that results in oppression of weaker nations and resultant terrorism<p>In case you doubt the appeal of authoritarianism just go look at the popularity of Stalin in Russia, or the readership of the Daily Mail in the UK, or the overwhelming political support for the NSA / the PATRIOT Act. Lots and lots of people <i>want</i> to live in a highly authoritarian society and it&#x27;s worth reflecting on why that is, and whether those people have valid reasons.<p>I was recently in a former communist country, and took a tour of one of the cities. The tour guide mentioned that a lot of older people weren&#x27;t so sure that democracy/capitalism is better than communism. Sure, in the communist era people got executed for merely making rude comments or jokes about political leaders, but at least there was working social security, pensions, everyone had a job etc. Whereas post-USSR, often life got harder and the old certainties dissolved.<p>Authoritarianism is popular because it presents people with a simple deal: support the regime no matter how shitty it gets and in return the government will take care of you - and as long as they have absolute power, if something bad happens to you then it&#x27;s the government&#x27;s fault. That government tends to have simple, easily understood solutions for things that appeal to people&#x27;s animal instincts, like picking someone to blame for something and then executing them. Additionally you will get a comforting story about how by simply being born in this society you are one of the good guys, as opposed to &quot;them&quot; who are the bad guys. All you have to do is not have strong opinions, not be weird, or gay, or a Jew, and fit in with whatever other random biases the leaders have and life will be, if not good, then at least straightforward. And how hard is that, really? Almost by definition most people find it easy to meet that criteria, because they&#x27;re in the majority.<p>Contrast with the civil libertarian utopia: if something bad happens to you, it&#x27;s probably your own fault. You have nobody to blame but yourself. It&#x27;s not clear what you&#x27;re supposed to do or how to be a success in life. The government is small and generally refuses blame for things, even if the population is under attack. There is no black/white good vs evil story to hold on to. All around you are people  who aren&#x27;t like you, who don&#x27;t think like you.<p>That&#x27;s just my guess. I would really like to read a well thought out book on the appeal of authoritarianism. I feel like it&#x27;s an underexplored topic (at least in the modern era).",1427482427

But like any other constructed data set, Piketty makes choices about measurement indicators and categories that are open to challenge.  The way that he composes his measures of wealth and capital could be more nuanced, if those nuances make a significant difference in the results produced by the models built on top of them.  This MIT student seems to be doing just that—arguing that the composition of land and capital in measures of wealth need to be treated with more nuance, and that measures of capital need to take account of depreciation in a different way than Piketty does.<p>I make similar arguments in my dissertation about one of the longest-running, most widely used data sets in my field.  Sometimes the categorization of data is misleading in certain ways that elides phenomena that are actually very significant.<p>Piketty&#x27;s construction of the data set is fantastic work.

Roll two dice, take six times the number on the first minus the number on the second plus one. That is the position in the list of the first word in the sentence.<p>Next, write a new list of 36 words, but only include words that make sense given what is already there.

Australia has always been apathetic - &quot;she&#x27;ll be right&quot; was our catch cry. Until recently (the last 20 years or so), we maintained that casual attitude.
Since then, we have culturally become Americanised through TV and movies. With it has come a callousness and a higher level of sophistication and a greater sense of entitlement.
I would suggest two points. It&#x27;s a combination of apathy and self-focus that are driving our indifference to draconian policy. The second point is that the crimes you accuse Australia of are typical throughout the west. While I don&#x27;t like to see what Australia has become, other western countries are no better.
Does anyone remember the blue ribbon campaign about free speech from the 90s? I went into all of the Australian IRC channels before the news hit.

So I have a few things to share.<p>Moving to US from India should not just be about salary even though a salary of 200K is decent anywhere in the US even an expensive place like SF. But I will give you more things to consider than just salary:<p>1. Health Insurance. This is a huge one in the US. Very expensive if you pay anything out of pocket and you are at your employer&#x27;s mercy for this. OF course good employers have good plans BUT what if you have to get your own ? Imagine this. Without insurance, a lot of places will give you a HUGE bill even for basic things like X-ray which are commodity in India. Yes there are lot of pluses compared to India but the costs of health in US is a huge factor to consider specially if you will live here for a long time.<p>2. Cultural differences. Another biggie. How open are you and your family (if married) ? Even if you are from an Indian metro (mumbai/delhi etc), the culture in the US is very different. People are a lot more independent and on a general basis, like their privacy. Indian culture is more about sharing. For example little things like salary discussion to religion to more personal things. Ppl here like to be left alone (again i m not generalizing but you get the point).<p>3. Access to human resources or labor. This is another biggie. In india, even if metros, you can hire a nanny real cheap. For like 5000 Rs a month, you can get a decent nanny for kids. That is less than $100 A MONTH!! Here, anything less than a $1000 is extremely unlikely to get you a decent service. That is 10 times more. I am sure this number is even higher in SF (more like 2K?). Want to hire a cook ? forget about it because not happening for $100.<p>So the point is that there are lot of things that Americans do on their own as access to labor is not cheap. Not the case in India. If you are used to having people do work for you in India, you will have to be a multi-millionaire to get the same service in US.<p>And last, think hard about the cultural differnces again. Are you willing to mingle with the local culture ? Are you willing to understand before judging ? Initially, a lot of things/people will seem weird to you but remember, they will think the same about you. Take your time, learn the culture and then try and take the good things out it and ignore the bad stuff. Don&#x27;t be too one sided in your thoughts.<p>In my honest opinion, unless you are ok with all the points above, 200K in India beats 250K in SF hands down. You are like the top 1% in India and not even top 10% in SF.",1427481632

And while the current coalition can now fairly be judged on its track record as we come up to our general election and its record has also been far from perfect, the influence of the minority partner (the Liberal Democrats, who had not been in government here for generations prior to 2010) is probably more clearly evident in their efforts to defend civil liberties than anywhere else.<p>That same Lib Dem party has been almost unbelievably naive politically since entering the government and has been so comprehensively outplayed by its coalition partner that the Lib Dems are likely to be all but wiped out at the coming election. However, the fact that the party most likely to replace them as the protest vote of choice is heavily against foreign interference in UK business and seems to have become very popular almost immediately despite most people knowing little or nothing about either the party leadership beyond one key figurehead or the party&#x27;s other policies might tell us something about popular sentiment and the desire of the UK electorate not to be taken for granted by the two big (and both heavily authoritarian) parties.",1427481603

How much time elapsed between points A and B? Give me time, use it as a unique timestamp. And so on.<p>The old way Erlang handled time (with time correction enabled) was to speed up or slow down the internal clock by about 1% whenever the system time changed. This is fine for smaller fluctuations like leap seconds (and correspond nicely to what Google calls leap-second-smearing). But for a large sudden &quot;time warp&quot;, the system will be wrong forever because it will never catch up. The 1% frequency difference also means that 1000ms is closer to 990ms or 1010ms.<p>The new API maintains a precise and accurate monotonic clock which is used to wait on timers, do latency calculations and such. And then a &quot;system time&quot; is kept by noting how the system time is &quot;offset&quot; from the internal monotonic clock. You can monitor time change events of this &quot;system&quot; time, which allows your program to explicitly handle leap seconds, or when the system suddenly gets full NTP connectivity and learns that 14 days has passed since last reboot.<p>Finally, a seperate API can give unique integers. Earlier, erlang:now() was guaranteed unique (even if called from several different processes at the same time. It would simply &quot;speed up&quot; for a while if the calls were too close to each other). The downside of this guarantee was a big fat lock around erlang:now(), which has been dreadful to anyone who wanted good scalability in their programs. Lock instrumentation could often show serious contention around this lock.<p>By querying the underlying OS for the best clock source and separating the different time concepts, timer wheels can now be per-core, which results in a massive scalability boost of the system as a whole.<p>All in all, it is a necessary and very cool change to Erlang systems. It allows one to handle time with the attention to detail which is needed. While the original leap-smearing tactic is fine (and worked well for a long time), this finally allows people to program real solutions to leap seconds and sudden NTP time warps.<p>(Edit: added a &quot;never&quot; which was needed for a sentence to parse correctly).",1427481598

The old &quot;It&#x27;s the economy, stupid&quot; line is as true in politics today as it ever was.<p>To be fair, it is also true in the West today that just as the risk of being a victim of terrorism is low, so the risk of being a victim of government abuse or incompetence in applying these anti-terrorism measures is also low. A rational and objective citizen looking at the practical reality <i>right now</i> might consider that neither issue is that significant and there really are much more important things to worry about.<p>The strongest arguments for promoting civil liberties and reducing government powers are generally those of equality (just because something bad is unlikely to happen to you, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s unlikely to happen to someone equally innocent but in a less fortunate position) and long term risk (just because today&#x27;s governments and security services and police forces don&#x27;t routinely abuse these capabilities and legal powers on a wide scale, that does not mean tomorrow&#x27;s won&#x27;t, and history shows that the risk of such abuse is real and the consequences can be catastrophic).",1427480630

9278082,comment,9276605,9277908,0,0,dmbaggett,,,"Some day I will write this up for real, but without going into detail, here&#x27;s a summary.<p>The camera in Crash was on a rail. It could rotate left, right, up, and down (in Crash 2 and beyond, at least), but could not translate except by moving forward/backward on the rail. This motivates a key insight: if you&#x27;re only rotating the camera, the sort order of the polygons in the scene cannot change.<p>This allowed us to sample points on the rail and render the frame at each sample point ahead of time, as a batch job, on the SGI using a Z-buffer. (We may have done the Z-buffer with software; I don&#x27;t remember.) Then we could recover the polygon order of each frame by looking at the Z-buffer. And, even better, at run-time we could simply <i>not render at all</i> those polygons that weren&#x27;t ultimately visible in the pre-rendered scene. This solved both the sorting and clipping problem nicely, and made the look of the game closer to 3K polygons/frame vs. the 1K polygons we were actually rendering in real time. (Many polygons were occluded by other polygons.)<p>The trick, though, was what exactly to do with this sort/occlusion information. In a nutshell, what I did was write a custom delta-compression algorithm tailored to the purpose of maintaining the sorted polygon list from frame to frame, in R3000 assembly language. Miraculously, this ended up being quite feasible because the delta between frames was in practice very small -- a hundred bytes or so was typical. And if a transition was too heavyweight (i.e., the delta was too big) we&#x27;d either sample more finely in that area or tell the artists to take stuff out. :)<p>One thing nobody talks about but which is obvious in retrospect is that without a Z-buffer you&#x27;re pretty screwed: sorting polygons is <i>not</i> O(N lg N) -- it&#x27;s O(N^2). This is because polygons don&#x27;t obey the transitivity property, because you can have cyclic overlap. (I.e., A > B and B > C does <i>not</i> imply A > C). This is why virtually every game from that era has flickery polygons -- they were using bucket sorting, which has the advantage of being linear time complexity, but the disadvantage of being wrong, and producing this flickery effect as polygons jump from bucket to bucket between frames.<p>I&#x27;ll leave the matter of weaving the foreground characters -- Crash himself and the other creatures -- into the pre-sorted background for another day.",1427480118

Given that we give out e-mail addresses to anyone who needs to contact us, I think the latter option (securing our email accounts) is the smarter one<p>2) instead of encrypting phone numbers and postal addresses, should we instead be challenging the requirement for online services to store them to begin with?
