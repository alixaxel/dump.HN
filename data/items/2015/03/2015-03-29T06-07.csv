9284118,comment,9283608,9284073,0,0,danjayh,,,"I suspect that most families living in a half million dollar McMansions actually do pay <i>far</i> more in tax than the typical apartment dweller. In my area, the flow of capital is definitely the opposite of what you describe: without question, the individuals living in the suburbs heavily subsidize the lives of those living in the more urban areas and apartments, at least those who live in a tax district that has a combination of the two.<p>More typically, the tax districts for the areas with McMansions are entirely separate from those with a high concentration of apartments and urban housing. In this situation, the residents in a particular area bear the tax burden for the services that they consume. My particular metropolitan area is divided into several &quot;cities&quot; (I put it in quotes because they really all run together) that serve to ensure that each area&#x27;s residents bear the cost of their services. Even in this situation, due to taxes levied by the state government, the flow of capital still tends to go <i>from</i> the suburbs <i>to</i> the urban areas.<p>In fact, I suspect that most house dwellers would be hugely in favor of further segregating the tax system so that funds paid by a group of individuals are used for services desired by that same group. In my area this would, however, result in the defunding of most public transportation (which is largely financed by people who do not use it), urban schools, the community college (which is funded by the whole county, but mostly used by lower income residents), etc. As an example, the public bus system recently appropriated lanes on many busy streets that were paid for by gas taxes. Since those with longer commutes pay more in gas tax, it stands to reason that these lanes were originally paid for by suburban commuters, and are now being used by the apartment dwellers and urban residents who are the primary clientele of the bus system (use fees make up only a small part of the funding for public transit in my area).<p>I am not stating that the existence of any of these things is bad, but simply that your belief that apartment dwellers are subsidizing the lives of McMansion residents is entirely incorrect.",1427612227

It&#x27;s probably best modeled as an acyclic directed graph where frame objects reference (many-to-many) memory buffers.

   Rule 11 frivolous-claim territory
   ...
   You are required, as a matter of legal ethics,
   to display good faith and professional candor
   in your dealings with adverse parties, and you
   have fallen miserably short of your ethical
   responsibilities

   read them broadly, and Monster loses.
   ...

   ...
   I am &quot;uncompromising&quot; in the most literal sense
   of the word. If Monster Cable proceeds with
   litigation against me I will pursue the same
   merits-driven approach: I do not compromise with
   bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand
   dollars on defense than give you a dollar of
   unmerited settlement funds.
   ...
   Not only am I unintimidated by litigation;
   I sometimes rather miss it.

Cross talk and outside interference raise noises levels on the line and the devices on either end can&#x27;t tell the signal from the background noise. This is different from audiophile cabling, which is usually over short distances where noise is not an issue.",1427609512

The FedEx stories are also excellent. I&#x27;m personally interested in high performance computing and machine learning, but I&#x27;m also interested in solving &quot;real problems&quot; and like how you seem to focus on the actual value of the applications. I love the feeling of engineering solutions to mathematical problems, and this seems to be something that you also enjoy.<p>I&#x27;d really like to hear more about your career, research, and also the startup that you&#x27;re working on. I&#x27;d be very happy if you shoot me an email at eric@ericmart.in<p>Best,
Eric",1427609330

I found it easier and cleaner to write Ninja build files.<p>I wasn&#x27;t able to do a direct comparison of the build speeds of the two systems, but I bet the Ninja builds were significantly faster.",1427609057
