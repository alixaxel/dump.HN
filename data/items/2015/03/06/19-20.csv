Depending on the topic of the site (i.e., ecommerce site selling products or a ticket site selling tickets), lots of pages tend to have the same content. Some product pages have the same product in a different color, or the ticket site is selling the same tickets some other site on the web is selling.<p>I get that Panda can be helpful, help identify &quot;low quality&quot; content.

9159182,comment,9158913,9158913,0,0,halostatue,,,"I’ve been fired three times.<p>The first time was early in my career. A site manager decided to impose working hours that (a) were in opposition to how I was recruited and (b) not what the client wanted, but (c) didn’t matter anyway because the site manager had the power to do that. This was no great loss. I was better off out of there than working under those circumstances. I had a new job a month later paying 50% more.‡<p>The second time was a few years ago. Another employee screwed over the entire team. He did something really stupid that caused him to be fired, the executive sponsor to be fired, and then a week later, me to be fired—just three weeks after I had started. Again, this was no great loss, but the company handled the whole situation very badly (they were one of two options I had when being recruited; they won, but they treated me like crap when I was fired). I was far better of out of there because it turned out that the management team without that executive sponsor was pretty stupid when it came to technology.<p>The third time was last fall. A new head of engineering had come in and he decided that (a) he was the only person who could be bombastic about technology opinions, (b) he didn’t like my technology opinions and (c) he didn’t like me. I wasn’t better off out of there—this was one of the best teams I had ever worked with. I was better off not working for him, for sure. In the end, what he did was truly stupid: he isn’t there anymore and neither are the three other senior software engineers that were there when I was there. Those departures probably wouldn’t have happened if he hadn’t done that.•<p>At the same time, I had a job doing something more clearly two months later. Less pay, but much more opportunity to learn, grown, and shape a team the way that I want to shape the team.<p>Being fired hurts. Each of those times was depressing, because either I had just wound down a job search and didn’t want to spin it up again or I wasn’t ready for a job search. It sounds like Zach is doing the right thing—he’s got the tools and a bit of time to pull himself together, and he’s figuring out what he wants to do with the next phase of his career. Best of luck.<p>‡ More importantly, during that job search, I came to Canada the first time and met the woman who encouraged me to immigrate to Canada and whom I would eventually marry.<p>• This last job search was interesting because the middle one was so short that it could clearly be seen as Not My Fault. This one…I had to address why I was no longer at the company clearly, directly, and without evasion or disparagement. I handled it very well, I think. I also figured out that I didn’t want to just be the “seniormost” person; I wanted to be the acknowledged team lead/dev manager. That changed the job search substantially.",1425671706

It was quite common to want to recalculate the rehabilitation rates and other stats.<p>This was a problem, as patient records filled several tapes and, being the youngster, I had to sit loading tapes for hours.<p>Because our data set was bigger than memory, we had trouble deciding what to sample.  We&#x27;d read everything in, filtering the records, and recording just their offsets.  Then we&#x27;d pick some number, then re-read all the tapes to fetch the actual records.  Naive and tedious.<p>Luckily the IT manager knew all about reservoir sampling, and explained it to us.<p>We made a little Turbo Pascal program that ran over the data files each night before they were archived to tape and kept a large (but small enough to fit on one machine) reservoir!<p>Every time we were asked after that for a random sample after that we just handed out the reservoir.<p>The care managers, who thought they were still causing us to sit for hours shuffling tapes, were terribly grateful at the quick turnarounds.  We never did let them in on our secret.<p>These days of course hospital records fit in RAM.  Not the same kind of problems.",1425671680

9159175,comment,9158141,9158959,0,0,graeme,,,"The first step was learning to make eye contact. If you&#x27;re not looking at people, you&#x27;re not even getting the chance to read them. I just didn&#x27;t look much at people for the first 21-22 years of my life.<p>I remember reading a bunch of articles about &quot;how to make eye contact&quot;. I was on sites aimed at people with aspergers, as they&#x27;re a niche most likely to actually need that kind of advice.<p>Then you practice. And occasionally get feedback from people. Everything will be awkward as first, but do something long enough and it becomes a habit. The feedback is important, so your new habit is actually a good one.<p>Then I read some books on body language, and I got this DVD by Paul Ekman about microexpressions. I&#x27;ve since read some stuff suggesting that may be bunk, but the DVD was still valuable because it showed me what a bunch of different expressions represented, and gave me feedback if I was correctly classifying them. (There&#x27;s a big book of facial expression coding that lists expressions standard across cultures: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System</a>)<p>Then I combined the two. Talking to people, looking at them, and noticing their expressions. A bit one was looking for laugh lines by eyes. If someone is genuinely amused, their eyes will smile in a way that they won&#x27;t if they&#x27;re just mouthing a smile.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile#Duchenne_smile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile#Duchenne_smile</a><p>After that, it was just practice. Talk with people, pay attention, see if the results match what you thought. (For instance, if you thought someone enjoyed themselves, and then they want to hang out again, then you were probably right)<p>Over time, by paying attention, and using feedback to assess my judgments, I was able to build an intuition for reading people, one that I believe is quite accurate. People often are surprised that I know what they&#x27;re thinking or when they&#x27;re upset by something.<p>Most of the small annoyances of life melted away. A lot of interpersonal grief just evaporates if you can read the people you&#x27;re dealing with, and respond appropriately. For instance, I have zero complaints about store personnel, in person. They&#x27;re all wonderful! Over the phone, I can&#x27;t see them, and stuff can still get frustrating.<p>It turns out that people usually aren&#x27;t jerks.

People aren&#x27;t being denied/excluded because of their gender they&#x27;re being denied/excluded because enterprise IT culture sucks.<p>It is the opposite of an &quot;inclusive&quot; culture but it should be noted how it became that way:  Through decades of non-technical people interfering with technical decision making and a political culture that measures success--and power--by the amount of people who work for you.  Eventually you get to the point where someone--an outsider--contributing work to your project feels like a threat to your very existence.<p>> However, when the hierarchy is dominated by one gender, there is an additional hurdle that the privileged gender will not encounter.<p>What hurdle would that be?  In addition to not being on the right team or having the right job title you need the right sex?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Silos, NIH syndrome, and similar don&#x27;t take sex into account.  They impact all genders, races, and whatnot equally.<p>I&#x27;m sure sexism exists in IT as it does in all industries and careers (especially the subconscious kind) but the worker-hostile situations that are all-too-common in IT are not sexism.

However, for the past few months, I was unable to refill my antidepressant prescription during my transition to CoveredCA (or, at least wasn&#x27;t sure how to do so, derp), which led me back into a pretty bad case of my depression, anxiety, and obsessive/compulsive behavior.<p>When I don&#x27;t take my medication, I can hardly think straight for more than a few minutes at a time before I&#x27;m thrust into a really mentally exhausting power cycle of automatic negative thoughts, which usually results in intense physical discomfort and a generally unpleasant demeanor.  I get rude and withdrawn, and often binge on comfort foods and mind-numbing television to deal with the fact that I feel absolutely no pleasure in life.<p>Fortunately, I figured out my medication situation and I&#x27;m feeling a lot better.

It&#x27;s really hard to do this when you don&#x27;t have a regular routine, as I&#x27;ve come to discover, but you just sort of have to start forcing yourself to be on a schedule of some sort, or plan for when your schedule is going to be somewhat erratic.<p>Also, seeing a therapist is super beneficial, and I frankly think most people would benefit from seeing one.

Make sure you specifically talk about these concerns; if it ends up being a performance meeting, they&#x27;ll probably tell you you&#x27;re doing great, like they probably already have.<p>Most people love to help when asked. Have one of those people connect you with people or resources that can fill in some knowledge, skill or experience gaps that you may identify. No one else needs to know about your concerns beyond that first person, if that&#x27;s how you want it. Schedule the meeting right now.<p>2. Related to 1, when you&#x27;re afraid of being found out for not knowing something, it&#x27;s hard to ask for help. So make it a near term goal to eventually ask everyone you work with for help on something. Just something small is good enough, to get you used to doing this. You&#x27;ll probably find that they don&#x27;t think a thing about it, and will be glad to help. It also builds relationships. Successful people always ask for help.<p>3.It&#x27;s hard to self-assess when you&#x27;re broken. It sounds like you&#x27;re temporarily broken. Temporarily. So have a discussion with your doctor, as a jumping off point. He may recommend any number of things, but he&#x27;s clear-eyed at the moment and you&#x27;re not.

You&#x27;re not &quot;becoming the impostor [you&#x27;re] trying to conceal.&quot; You&#x27;re fighting a neurological challenge that, untreated, would overwhelm almost anyone.<p>3. Sleep: 8 hours, same approximate time of day, take melatonin (or, if your doctor suggests something stronger, then that) if you have insomnia.<p>4. Exercise and diet are important. Eat greens, work out <i>every day</i> (do different activities, obviously) and try to avoid too much caffeine. Best time to exercise is in the morning, for most people.<p>5. Try not to spend too much time in an open-plan office (this can be hard to avoid). Use breakaway offices and take walks outside if you need to. Once you establish a reputation as a strong performer (and, remember, you&#x27;re probably a lot better than your impostor syndrome has you <i>thinking</i> you are) you can WFH approximately 1 day per week per year that you&#x27;ve been at a company.<p>5a. ETA: It&#x27;s quite probable, if you work in an open-plan or cubicle office while others can see you while you work, or approach you without you seeing them, that this is making you sick. Having to manage your image <i>and</i> perform cognitively intense work is very damaging (it&#x27;s too incoherent, and overwhelms the brain) and your body starts to release toxins after 4-6 hours under that particular form of stress. Open-plan is truly the devil.<p>6. Meditation / mindfulness practice <i>after</i> you get your other ducks in a row. (Sitting and stewing and being anxious isn&#x27;t &quot;meditating&quot;, so get your mental health on an even keel in therapy and then use meditation to further strengthen your resolve once well.)<p>7.

Compete against yourself, not them, and just get better every day at what you think is important.

So they had to leave. Usually it was a series of conversations about how the person, their peers, and the company were all unhappy, and why should we perpetuate the pain. We&#x27;d do our best to have them leave in a way that made them feel dignified and like they controlled their destiny, and but once in a while, there wasn&#x27;t a meeting of the minds and we had to say &quot;well, it&#x27;s not gonna be fixed and it&#x27;s time to go do something else.&quot; Even in those cases, I always thought so highly of the work I did with those people over the long haul, even if it was painful at the end.<p>The point being, if I started a new company tomorrow, I would, without a doubt, go and try to hire some of those same people to help me start it.  And maybe now, as a more capable manager than I was then, maybe some would make it longer, or maybe some would realize as the company goes from 10 to 100, that they are just much more satisfied at really early stages. Maybe we&#x27;d even define their comp and equity to reflect the fact that they might not be on board for the long haul, but might be key for the early innings.<p>The same thing is true for hiring bigger company people too early... without structure and process, some folks go crazy too and have to leave.  You need the right people at the right time.  This is hard to do. I messed up a bunch of times. Some people grow with the company through stages, and some don&#x27;t.  I think it&#x27;s a responsibility of the company to help people grow if they want, or to end the misery and let them go back to what they love if they don&#x27;t want to change.<p>Finally -- For what it&#x27;s worth, people are fired all the time ( as I have been ) for all kinds of reasons, and so it&#x27;s not a reason not to hire someone.

You are setting up a trap for yourself in which small disappointments shatter your fragile self-image. You enter a vicious cycle of rebuilding/breaking your self-esteem that has a huge toll on your mental capacity, as you have already observed.<p>In the end, the only way out is to stop thinking about oneself. You understand that your self-image is illusory,  then there is no self-image to damage. You are entitled to nothing except to experience life. Your true being becomes defined by something more essential than your work, your performance, your personal relationships and such.<p>Curiously, once you let go you will observe your capacity for enjoyment and performance greatly increases. You work because it brings pleasure and satisfaction, not because it brings admiration or success. Let go of expectations and plans and you will observe that things work out on their own.<p>Of course this does not happen overnight, everyone&#x27;s path is different so it&#x27;s difficult to say what will work out for you other than to be patient and accept your anxiety as part of a process of growth.<p>In my case keeping track of my mood and my habits helped tremendously:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/@duopixel/the-qualified-self-7f69c6b23623"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@duopixel/the-qualified-self-7f69c6b23623</a>",1425670742

Every bug that is discovered on staging or production should (in theory) trigger a root cause analysis of some kind... because it means that one of the earlier processes failed.<p>If you have manual QA people, it&#x27;s mostly just improving the QA plan and adding edge cases and domain knowledge, but it can also sometimes be that there are data bugs or integrations on production that are not on staging, slightly different on staging, etc.<p>With every bug there is an action plan for how to fix the bug, but that is separate from the knowledge that we gain about our system because the bug occurred.  Maybe the fix is to get someone to manually clean up some dirty data that wound up on production due to someone forgetting to validate/clean input data ... that&#x27;s great but from the QA perspective you might have learned that several of your steps failed.<p>So I think the main thing is considering bugs opportunities to learn about the system as a whole.  The philosophy behind chaos monkey at NetFlix is that even a well tested, solid system needs to be resilient, so any opportunity to make your system stronger (regardless of the cause) is a good thing. In particular, any bug found before it hits production is a win overall.<p>I&#x27;d also add that it&#x27;s important to let the knowledge flow back out of QA and into the product team, etc. QA people often end up becoming internal domain experts who catch lots of issues, but that is something that quickly exceeds what one person can remember/understand as a system scales, so organizational learning/practices pay off big.",1425670093

The very minimal feature set and lack of high level abstractions makes the code very easy to understand and modify. The fact that everything uses stdio makes debugging really easy.<p>As a sysadmin it sucks because providing the features your users rightly expect forces you to maintain patches as well as configuration. And a good deal of that configuration is long pipelines where tiny changes have huge consequences. Set the magic option in the magic variable to change behavior. Certain files that aren&#x27;t explicitly mentioned anywhere just have to exist, and one wrong permission or file ownership just breaks everything and it&#x27;s really annoying to figure out what&#x27;s wrong.",1425670082

When we did a &quot;field trip&quot; to Github thanks to Scott, I shared Zach&#x27;s quote with the engineers here:<p>&quot;We’re currently at 35 employees and growing, and this approach still works great. But managers love to assign hours for a reason: it gives them the illusion that hours can measure performance.\nIf you don’t go hard on hours, you do have to look at different metrics. How good is their code? Are they fixing bugs? Are they involved in work, or is the greater flexibility not motivating them?\nIt’s difficult to make these qualitative judgements, but they’re still going to be more valuable than “did this guy put in his ten hours of work today”. Because as soon as you make it about hours, their job becomes less about code and more about hours.&quot;<p>4 years ago a lot of us had just come to Kiva from corporate gigs and such and were building a culture of meritocracy rather than bureaucracy and even though this advice seems obvious now, they were truly inspiring words at the time.

The company failed for these reasons:<p>* MySpace sold ads to Google when they didn&#x27;t have ad inventory to sell.  MySpace had to meet impression thresholds each month or pay penalties to Google.  To meet those requirements, MySpace added ads where they should not have been.  Impression ads were put up in odd places.  MySpace forced users to log in for the sake of generating an impression.  The result was a poor user experience.<p>* Tom & Chris were from an email spam shop background. eUniverse bought Tom & Chris email spam company. Once eUniverse had the emails, Tom & Chris had nothing to do, so they put their effort into creating something new.  Friendster was doing well at the time, they decided to clone it, the result was MySpace.  Spam and poor user experiences were part of their upbringing and it showed in MySpace.<p>* There were no coding standards.  Engineering teams worked in silos with each team having their own standards.  For example, at one time someone put a picture of all the different submit buttons in the break room.  Tom & Chris shared this brake room.  I&#x27;m not sure if the poster was motivational or insulting.  We all knew the site looked ugly and this picture of all the different submit buttons quantified it.<p>* MySpace didn&#x27;t leverage an API.  FB users had the ability to add plug ins like calendars and classified ads from a myriad of sources.  The result was users were able to choose the best solution.  MySpace users were given the same tools built internally.  Those tools were pushed out in rapid succession, without much effort, and users were left with poorly created solutions.<p>* MySpace cherished metrics that had no meaning.  Your number of friends, for example, were meaningless.  People like Percival created companies to help people add friends under the guise that having friends meant something.  MySpace bought into that snake oil, Percival perpetuated it, then they hired him on as a VP.<p>* MySpace thought allowing users to create their own unique page was a competitive advantage.  Users were given the ability to embed their own HTML within their own page.  The result was ugly bloated pages.  At MySpace, we had an internal message board to debate ideas.  This idea was debated and people in product defended the ability to customize pages as a competitive advantage.<p>* Chris & Aber were distracted by &#x27;partying&#x27;.  Hang out at the bars on Wilshire Blvd, you&#x27;ll hear things and I&#x27;ll leave it at that.<p>* Employees were not given stock.

What are the first three things you would do?&quot; The kind of things I&#x27;d expect to hear here would never be of the kind &#x27;write a test plan&#x27;. And I hardly believe anyone would be able to contribute a test plan right away, would they? I expect ability to write a test plan, or setup a process where it is created and managed, to be rather easy to check by just asking someone to do a test plan on an imagined scenario. The answer I would like much more would be: &#x27;1. meet the team&#x27;, &#x27;2. understand the product, its vision, goals&#x27;, &#x27;3. understand current dev/QA setup and code before I proceed&#x27;.<p>In other words, it seems to me that the first things to do should be to see where we are, connect with people rather than making things up. How can you propose first actions without at least basic understanding of where you are?<p>I like questions 5+ much better, but still these seem more suited for interviewing an experienced individual contributor, not a team manager.<p>How about setting up a team? How about hiring? How would you define and split tasks, assuming we agree on tasks? What kind of testing would you personally do, which would you delegate to QAs and which would you require to stay on the dev team? What would  you do in situation X?

For example, files in the queue were named after their inodes, meaning you couldn&#x27;t just restore from backup and have it work. UID/GID were compiled in statically so you couldn&#x27;t pre-build binaries and distribute them unless you had centralized user management via NIS/LDAP.<p>There were no features and no way to extend functionality, meaning that as the internet&#x27;s use of email changed (e.g. SPF records), everything was distributed as a patch to qmail. This meant 1. sysadmins got to spend more and more time applying patches that hadn&#x27;t been tested together, struggling to even get them to apply or compile; 2. sysadmins got to debug a lot of other people&#x27;s code because there wasn&#x27;t anyone to report bugs to; 3. if you accidentally blew away your qmail build directory there wasn&#x27;t much chance of you getting an identical configuration back again, making your entire mail system ridiculously fragile.<p>When qmail was first released, it was awesome and amazing. Only a few years later, Postfix started providing the vast majority of the security benefits of qmail (e.g. separating privileges and functionality into separate daemons), with nowhere near the number of headaches. Need to change a configuration parameter? Just use postconf(1) instead of recompiling. Need to replicate your mail configuration? Just copy the configs over. Need to add new functionality? Milters.<p>I worked at a hosting company a few years ago that still used qmail (and Apache 1.3, and this was in 2010); there was a slight misbehaviour in qmail which we needed to change, which resulted in one of our sysadmins (who didn&#x27;t really know C) spending days reading, changing, compiling, testing, and debugging code which, with Postfix, would have been a one-line config change. And who knows if it&#x27;s robust? He stopped working on it once he had a solution that passed his test without segfaulting immediately.<p>Qmail did wonders for the internet by replacing sendmail, but horrors for the internet by replacing necessary functionality with onerous security, requiring third-party patches for almost everything other than just exchanging mail between servers, and refusing to update the code to add anything that wasn&#x27;t there already.",1425669174

As in, hint to them that you have sought legal counsel and that, if worse comes to worse, you wouldn&#x27;t mind sudo rm -rf the entire code base.

Meditation acts as a kind of &quot;off&quot; button for incessant thoughts that trigger each other. By letting concrete reality totally consume your awareness for even one instant, you squeeze out the self-reflective consciousness that is a key part of that loop, and weaken it. (Your body is a key part of this loop at two points: first as a source of &quot;concrete reality&quot; sensations, and second as a kind of residue of emotional reaction.)<p>Success on this path requires the ability to sit still and not get up even if you think of something better to do, or because you are bored, or because your butt hurts, or because you&#x27;re anxious.",1425668934
9158863,comment,9155364,9156188,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It&#x27;s certainly possible to conceive of contractual arrangements that would allow for this, but prosecutors could equally well argue that such arrangements were a mere instrumentality to facilitate otherwise illegal activity, and that argument would rest upon the net direction of economic activity.<p>Suppose Alice is willing to have sex with Bob for $100, and Carol owns a video camera and operates a porn website. So if Carol pays Alice $100 and films and publishes her having sex with Bob, then fair enough, Alice is a porn actress. But in this context, Bob is also someone who would be willing to pay $100 to have sex with Alice, were it not illegal to do so. If Bob offers $100 to Carol, who gives it to Alice, then Charlie is engaged in an illegal pimping relationship with Alice. Carol could pay Bob $100, in which case Bob would also be an actor, but this doesn&#x27;t make any economic sense for Carol because it&#x27;s unlikely that every sexual transaction is going to generate $200 of viewing revenue. I mean, why would <i>anyone</i> watch porn if you could just go over to Carol&#x27;s and <i>make</i> porn, and walk out with more money than you came in with? OK, Carol could pay bob only $10 because of supply and demand, but that still doesn&#x27;t make sense for Charlie, who&#x27;s operating at a loss.<p>In reality, the economic motivator is Alice&#x27;s willingness to have sex for $100 and Bob&#x27;s willingness to pay for her participation. We could introduce Don, who holds himself out as a booking agent of some sort, and accepts some sort of &#x27;membership fee&#x27; from Bob before going on to set up a porn shoot over at Carol&#x27;s house, but that&#x27;s just the same situation with an extra helping of conspiracy on the side, plus the economic incentives make even less sense. When you get right down to it the reality is that nobody particularly wants to pay Bob for sex (at least not in the short term) and Bob is in any case more interested in having sex than getting paid. His sexual drive is the motivating factor for any transaction; if no men wanted to have sex, Alice might be able to make $100 by, I dunno, selling hamburgers, but it&#x27;s unlikely that Bob could consider $100 worth of hamburgers an adequate substitute for having sex with Alice.<p>Of course the other problem with this is that many people who patronize prostitutes wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to appear in sex videos on porn-not-prostitution.com, although I suppose you could get around that by having all the videos in silhouette or pixelating the images enough to obscure the participants&#x27; identities or something.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to come up with some legal scheme whereby Bob sets himself up as a porn producer and is the star of the movies he directs and produces, but I think it would still be almost impossible to generalize this out to some sort of platform. Courts would draw a distinction between Bob actively working a producer of pornography and running a business like Hugh Hefner or whoever, vs &#x27;Carols Adult Video Services&#x27; whose clientele consisted entirely of loss-making &#x27;adult video producers&#x27; who engaged in no commercial activity whatsoever other participation in sex acts.<p>Going back to hamburgers, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to get out of restaurant licensing/inspection/etc. requirements by claiming that all the people sitting at tables eating hamburgers were actually trainee food-tasters in a school for culinary critics, not a restaurant, nosiree.",1425668934

9158824,comment,9158141,9158141,0,0,graeme,,,"Used to be anxious, now I&#x27;m not. This stuff may or may not apply to you. Take it as one anecdotal experience.<p>First, are these in line?:<p><pre><code>  * Sleep\n  * Diet\n  * Exercise\n  * Meditation/relaxation time\n</code></pre>\nWhenever I feel anxious now, I notice I&#x27;ve let one or more of those slide. Anxiety resolves when I fix them.<p>Second, I used to be anxious for the following reasons:<p><pre><code>  * I was socially awkward with few friends.\n  * I was bad at reading body language. \n  * I didn&#x27;t have objective things I could point to that I had done that were unambiguously good.\n  * My reasons for feeling good were all in one area.\n</code></pre>\nNumber 2 was a major cause of number 1. When I couldn&#x27;t read people, I was always worried I&#x27;d do something wrong. This made me shy and awkward around people. This in turn made people less likely to want to hang around with me.<p>So I learned how to read body language. You don&#x27;t have to live in fear of harsh reactions if you can read body language. You&#x27;ll notice people broadcasting loudly &quot;everything is fine, I think you&#x27;re doing a good job&quot; loud and clear. The odd occasions someone is displeased, you&#x27;ll spot it a mile away. I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough.<p>I used this to also fix any specific weaknesses that made me feel bad. So now I feel very comfortable with my life. I produced a bunch of stuff that everyone unambiguously agrees is good.<p>Finally, I made sure to put my efforts into a few areas. If work is going poorly this week, at least I lifted more at the gym, and vice-versa. Having your ego fulfilled from different areas prevents you from feeling bad if one goes south.<p>Hope that&#x27;s useful.<p>Note: Advice of this calibre is all assuming that there&#x27;s no issue that actually requires therapy/medication. I don&#x27;t know much about those options. My experience was just garden variety anxiety that can affect any human being.",1425668650

In other words, rather than arguing that P-zombies couldn&#x27;t differ in any way from us because they&#x27;re physically identical to us (which just begs the question), the argument would be that they couldn&#x27;t differ in any way from us because they&#x27;re indistinguishable from us.",1425668543
