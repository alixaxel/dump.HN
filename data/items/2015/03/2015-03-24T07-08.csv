Sorry but the left barely exists in the US, compared to other nations. Your confusion is probably due to the binary party system where, interestingly, 0 = 1.<p>Anyhow, though they share some common grounds, the left is not and cannot be &quot;liberal&quot;.

But the reason recursion doesn&#x27;t &quot;suck&quot; in python (an other languages without TCE), even with a small call stack, is that usually it is used to tackle problems with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Even if you are handling a massive amount of items, if your recursive calls splits them to handle in two or more parts until there&#x27;s no more to handle, then it is very hard to deplete the call stack:<p>log2 1_000_000_000_000_000 => 49.82892142331043<p>&quot;Recursion and iteration are equally expressive: recursion can be replaced by iteration with an explicit stack, while iteration can be replaced with tail recursion.

the return and expr simply never get executed, producing incorrect results (which I guess is slightly better than a potential stack overflow, since even the most basic of tests will pick up on the missing +1).",1427183363

Kid, life&#x27;s a marathon, not a sprint. It is pretty much irrelevant if your options will vest now or in a couple of months. What you really need to be in the look out is for dishonest leadership. If this is a one off event, all is OK. But if it is a trend of the founders failing to respect previous commitments to employees... you don&#x27;t want to waste your time around that kind of people.<p>3. Assuming healthy leadership, it sounds like you have earned a key role in that company.

There are a risk of learning things that you might not like --  of course, I&#x27;ve never worked in one, so takes it with a cup of salt.<p>Personally for me, the other thing is that I like to learn a lot of things, and I just figure that whether now or a few years from now (when I&#x27;m &quot;Senior Developer&quot;), there would be just as much things to learn about. I figure it&#x27;s just better to learn how to learn and get people to teach you stuffs without being in the same work place.<p>Another thing is that leadership skill is different than tech skill, which is also different than &quot;technical leadership&quot; skill, and this is back to the whole autonomy thing: I got a chance to try my ability to cram the idea that &quot;not everything in a language need to be used&quot; to the js guy, or telling the Java guy &quot;may be we will just decide to rewrite our ORM with another library and putting up 5 layer of abstractions could potentially help us do that&quot; is not a sound idea. Engineering skill set seems to be distinct from coding skill, which I&#x27;m not sure will qualify in the usual sense of &quot;technical skill&quot; or not, since you can&#x27;t put &quot;good variable and function naming&quot; on your CV. Believe it or not, working with really bad code forced me to come back to first principle and ask question like &quot;why should we use function&quot;, which I don&#x27;t think you will have the chance to do in a bigger code base?<p>There are also benefits from working closer to the business: you learn what actually is important, and what is crap.<p>Of course, all of this would apply if you join another startup ... and I don&#x27;t mean for any of this to be an advice or anything, more of a commiserating comment.<p>I can&#x27;t really put my email here.
