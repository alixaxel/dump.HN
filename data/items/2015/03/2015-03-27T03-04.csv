And this is coming from someone who is a strong proponent of functional programming.<p>The problem as I see it is pure functional programmers scoff at object oriented design being so prevalent while object oriented programmers seem so biased and giddy towards OOP when they haven&#x27;t even seen the light yet. How come more people don&#x27;t see that both are correct?<p>Both are the result of the market and people reacting (heh) to the market. This by definition means that both are correct but serve different purposes. What is fascinating to me is that the web has evolved enough to where user are expecting results immediately for their actions. This is an amazing time to live in. Why? Because this means the market is finally very invested in providing a fluid functional experience for the user. Since the front end is functional and the backend is OO, its very exciting times as we are the midst of real time innovation. React is just a tool to help connect these two very different pieces.<p>Functional programmers need to get off their high horse and ask themselves why frameworks are almost entirely object oriented. Object oriented programmers need to ask themselves why they didn&#x27;t think of a reactive view sooner. Both are not 100% right but functional programmers come off as d*cks when they fail to see there is no continuum of FP principles and that in the real world OOP makes sense (say to connect the pieces between say a Scala backend and React front end). You&#x27;d think they would realized this sooner though when noting, for example, that &quot;call by name&quot; usually is more efficient than &quot;call by value&quot;.",1427427796

At least in San Francisco I&#x27;d consider Postmates to be the front runner for door-to-door delivery services, followed by Door Dash (sort of an Uber v. Lyft dynamic).<p>I am not a frequent customer of either but I actually do occasional bike deliveries for Postmates (about 5 deliveries a week, on the weekends).  Postmates has insane demand, whenever I sign on the deliver my phone is practically exploding with orders, even when they turn on &#x27;blitz&#x27; pricing (and it&#x27;s not cheap to begin with).  The product seems simple but I am very impressed with Postmates&#x27; logistics.<p>Postmates basically has a comprehensive listing of not only all the places to buy things in the city (mostly food but not only) but they know the full menu, item by item pricing, if they accept cash/credit, open hours etc.  So you can place highly specific orders.  Postmates gives each courier a credit card which they load with about how much  money you will need for a given delivery on demand so you can pick up an iMac or a burrito through the same process.  They also have a 24/7 customer and courier support network.  So if I get a flat tire on my way to deliver a sandwich they can actually try to get another Postmate courier nearby to come finish the delivery.<p>And recently Postmates has started working closely with some restaurants to provide &quot;turbo&quot; jobs, where the restaurant knows the order is for postmates, provides postmates with an ETA for when it will be ready, which means I can get an order saying &quot;Go to XXX restaurant, the sandwich is already prepared and paid for&quot; and pick it up and go.  This enables me to get food to most customers about 30-40m after they order it from anywhere in town.<p>Anyway those are just some things that came to mind.  There is a lot more to it (scheduled shifts, tipping, etc). It all goes to show how interesting these seemingly simple ideas are from the inside.",1427426529

It&#x27;s off the Java heap, true but doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s either safe or won&#x27;t slow down the UI or is even home free.

The later is most probably impossible in practice: enforcement would not scale. A simple question: how would a user of that language deal with a concept for which no word exists? The only possibility is to formulate that concept in lengthy sentences (<i>Ents</i> do speak like that), until a word is officially adopted by the language conformance body. Of course, people wouldn&#x27;t be able to wait for that adoption each time they stumble on the issue, and it&#x27;s bound to happen all the time. From then, one or more unofficial words would pop up for ideas yet inexistant in the language lexicon, and of course subtle semantic differences would crop up among these variants. Or maybe the author is implying that agglutinative languages don&#x27;t suffer from that problem?<p>I am only talking about vocabulary, because this issue alone is enough to demonstrate the problem.

If the author took their same approach to parsing s-exprs for a grammar like C, I&#x27;m not sure how successful they would be.<p>I haven&#x27;t really looked at grammars / compilers in a long time, but I&#x27;m curious if I&#x27;m off-base in thinking s-exprs are relatively easy to parse.  Some grammars like brainfuck or assembly would obviously be easier.",1427425395
