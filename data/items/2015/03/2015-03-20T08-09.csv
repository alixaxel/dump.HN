9236698,comment,9225288,9229128,0,0,dgomez1092,,,"I agree it is a little pretentious. But at the same time what does it say about the user? Being pretentious means a user is attempting to sway you by affecting, say knowledge of culture  (an emotive response) to an object than it inherently holds. In this case the aesthetic appeal to the interior of a bus, less seats and maybe they&#x27;re made of leather but to the seat itself, there is no significance in its functionality -- we give it its meaning. That to me is materialistic and gives us insight as to how we can understand users.<p>Say there response is to recommend to their friend, &quot;Oh, I only use Uber when I come back home after a night out, but when I go to work I use Leap, I love that I can put my feet up on the leather seat across from me while typing away!&quot;<p>Your user seems to have issues rooted in self-identifying through external means. Why is it that they feel compelled to compare Leap to Uber? To note I think it increases their socio-economic status (in their mind) for that brief moment thus generalizing them to the specific core of typical Uber users. This is a self-transformation expectancy that keeps them coming back to the product, Leap! They&#x27;re not happy with themselves to a certain (obviously monetary) extent. As a business it should follow a categorical imperative to come up with a way to (a) accept the pretentious user (b) be pretentious product (c) BUT help user keep some measure of progress, allow them to get rid of that maladaptive urge >> make them begin a drawing, everytime they ride have them sketch one line at a time. Over the course of a month if they&#x27;re active then they will have become a amateur artist in that timeframe -- a transformation. (d) feel good.",1426841691

However, I still keep wanting more and maybe I get an insight that allows me, having first played with the first build, to make a better approach with a new set of tradeoffs but such that will get me closer to what I want.

We&#x27;re advancing in spaceflight because we have no other choice: the money&#x27;s ran out -- years ago, really.<p>Political systems of organization (organizations of people set up based on the desires of the electorate and controlled by politicians) exist and act for political reasons. Getting to the moon was a political goal, not a scientific one. The shuttle and ISS were political goals. Even privatizing like we&#x27;ve done is a political act.<p>We really need to build a mass driver on Earth for cargo launches. It would not be crazy expensive, and it would make a huge difference in the cost of LEO construction. Our order of priority should be 1) reduce cost to LEO to 1/100th of what it currently is, and 2) make orbital construction costs as close as possible to other oddball ground-based construction costs, like building underwater or in Antarctica. If we can focus on dropping costs, there are thousands of industries and other actors that will do some really cool stuff with the tools we provide. But that&#x27;s a really tough thing to sell politically. The real reason we have SpaceX is because nobody wanted to explain to the folks how we lost a huge amount of our launch capacity when we retired the shuttle.",1426838488
