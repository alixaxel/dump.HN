There is little doubt that &#x27;merit&#x27; defined as an capability or skill of an individual is not uniform. The point is that &#x27;merit&#x27; is systemically produced. It is a function of money, aspiration, parental ambition, education, culturation, in-group bias, and many other factors. Another way to phrase this is &#x27;privilege&#x27;, though that word is considered some kind of anathema by people who don&#x27;t like to see their elevated status and capabilities as somehow a function of their environment.<p>Absolutely Asian males are more privileged in terms of their ability to access tech jobs. Immigrant populations can have privileges in this way. Hindu families that are second or third generation immigrants to the UK from the Indian subcontinent are over-represented in medicine, for example. Is that because Indian people just make better doctors? Or is it because children of Indian descent are cultured and supported and mentored into medicine?<p>Anyone who actually understands the last 20 years of social science, far from &#x27;stopping intellectual discussion&#x27; are more likely to recognize that you&#x27;ve simply not found out or understood the issue.

Sorted by relevance, they return in the following chronological order: 2008, 2012, 2013x7, 2012x23, 2011x12, 2010x12 and on and on. Nothing from 2014 at all, and nothing from 2015 at all.<p>All of the returns have &quot;open house&quot; (or some variant) in them, quite a few have punctuation or non-alphanumeric characters right next to them, so that&#x27;s cool. In quite a few &quot;open houses&quot; scores more highly than &quot;open house&quot;.<p>So I filtered down to one mailbox. Now, I get a few from 2014, but no joy on my recent one.<p>I change the filter to another mailbox. About 10 down (there&#x27;s only 12 &quot;matching&quot; in this mailbox) I see one of the relevant emails I was looking for earlier, but not the one I explicitly just sent myself.<p>If I remove all filter constraints and sort by date instead of relevance, the email I just sent shows up at the top, followed by some emails where &quot;open houses&quot; match my query, followed by the earlier email I was looking for.<p>So it&#x27;s kinda working if I sort it by date. Sorting by relevance seems to be entirely useless. Sorting by mailbox is kinda useful, but doesn&#x27;t seem to show most recent.<p>I dunno, it still seems faster and more accurate to hit each of my mailboxes separately from the web interfaces if I need to search them.<p>I think qznc might have hit the nail on the head about IMAP and getting weirdly out of sync.",1425188481

TechCrunch: &quot;the establishment is flocking to the tech industry.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just the eternal september, ad infinitum. Hate being pushed out? So did the people _you_ pushed out, when you were annoying and first found IRC and you and your peers flooded all the old cool dives, driving hackers ever deeper underground.<p>The easy ways out don&#x27;t work when you&#x27;re faced with filtering out annoying newcomers. Some are fundametally wrong (racism is essentially a quick band-aid reaction to newcomers). Using money as a filter (country clubs) doesn&#x27;t work either--there&#x27;s always that annoying newly-minted millionaire who wants to break into your circle. Legislation to suppress young upstart competition even fails for the same reason: eventually your industry becomes so totally ossified that the whole thing can be toppled (US automakers).<p>Fundamentally, anybody who doesn&#x27;t get Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem is going to fail. &quot;When voters have three or more distinct options, no rank order voting system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a pre-specified set of criteria.&quot; I would propose strengthening it to: any pre-specified set of criteria, at all, ever. In other words, you just can&#x27;t have all three:<p>1. Purely democratic or meritocratic or whatever<p>2. Total transparency (of rules and laws)<p>3. Adaptation of the rules and laws<p>So you get this never-ending cycle: the hackers get together and make something really cool. They are able to work together. Then comes the flood of newbies. After things get overloaded, anybody actually contributing to the original project either sells out or goes deeper underground. The project coasts on autopilot until something breaks, then it crashes and burns.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter who the participants are, from simple rule-based sims up to human-level intelligence, the outcome is the same.<p>The exceptions, I think, prove the rule:<p>1. BSD and the Linux kernel -- essentially ruled by benevolent dictators.<p>2. Representative democracies -- they can work. I&#x27;m deliberately refusing to think about why here, since that&#x27;s politics.<p>3. The internet. Not IP or the OSI model or the DNS system, but the idea that anyone, anywhere can conceive of an idea, and then communicate it nearly instantly. This includes a worldwide language (or tools to automatically translate), global comms and the hacks to circumvent state-sponsored net terrorism, the unwritten code of conduct that most netizens are guided by, the ability to search and explore, and on and on.<p>I think any good example would have some element of a social hack in it.

Now one of the best languages to learn, Javascript, comes free with excellent developer tools in every web browser, which comes free with a computer that can be bought for <$1000.

There are, in fact, a number of possible reasons apart from the one you have in mind. Here are some.<p>1) Tech is meritocratic so it attracts men who are less physically attractive or socially capable, because they mainly need technical skill.  This in turn makes the field less attractive to women.<p>2) Tech is a monotonous job with low social status, and so it attracts people driven by ambition and desire for money, who tend to be male.<p>3) Women are fundamentally less interested in technology because they prefer fields with human interest (though this doesn&#x27;t explain the gap between programming and, for example, math or physics).<p>I have only really addressed the gender issue above, but I think that&#x27;s enough to critique your original way of phrasing the problem.",1425187530
