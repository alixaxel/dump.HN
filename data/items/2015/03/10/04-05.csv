But you can configure the air to have just as much without spending more.<p>With the air 13&#x27; having an extra inch, 3 hours more battery, more ports, better performance, the only thing the MB has going for it is resolution.

I have a demonstrable track record and since all of my business comes from referrals, I must not be entirely out to lunch.<p>I suspect that you are internally switching out my use of the word honest for [something like &quot;prediction&quot;] which has nothing to do with my feedback. I don&#x27;t predict what any of my clients will do, although I do certainly run the numbers in my head before I take on a new client.<p>When I say that I give honest feedback, it means that I don&#x27;t pull punches — no matter how awkward it is.<p>Humans are trained from birth to tell people what they think that they want to hear. They want to be encouraging. Unfortunately, that means that you&#x27;ve sacrificed telling someone that you can see flaws in their logic for telling them selective truths that will make them feel good. This gets you off the hook socially and gives them no useful information about the hard road ahead of them.<p>Next time you have an idea, run it past me. I&#x27;m happy to give you 15 minutes over Skype. You can decide if I&#x27;m negative.

Sure &#x27;yo&#x27; and anything more substantial that that will break through as a new communications style, just like texting did, but a true conversation just isn&#x27;t possible in that fashion.

9176084,comment,9175119,9175725,0,0,Scoundreller,,,"> Oddly enough, the reason these folks are failing is that Google&#x27;s CPC (the money they get for an advertising &quot;click&quot;) has gone down Year over Year for the last 13 quarters. What that means is that if your web site depended on advertising from Google (and most do), and your traffic remained constant, you have seen a 33% drop in gross revenue over that same period.<p>All it means is a 33% drop per click, not per thousand visitors, or gross revenue over a same period.<p>As Google gets better at matching ads to users, CPC would be expected to go down, since there would be more clicks, and each click would therefore be less valuable, but there would be more clicks overall.<p>As a micro-publisher, the first question that friends ask to satisfy their curiosity is &quot;How much do you get paid per click&quot;, and I have to answer that total revenue is all that really matters, not revenue per click.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t improving fraud detection increase click quality?",1425963030

A completely irrational approach.

Keep the pitch to employers for employers. Don&#x27;t be patronizing to inexperienced developers: inspecting the assembly output of a compiler is not elite and not difficult to explain to someone given the right context and framing.

But this kind of data provides evidence for our disagreement no more than a still image of a flying arrow can settle the one between Aristotle&#x27;s and Newton&#x27;s theories of motion.<p>Somewhat relatedly I&#x27;d like to add that while the result of an experiment in dynamics will obviously change my theory, it will in no way change my values[1]. Privilege based on an immutable characteristic such as intelligence (assuming such a result were to be obtained) is no more arbitrary than one based on bloodline.  A smart person, though she <i>will</i> obtain it, <i>deserves</i> no more power than the average bloke, just as a nobleman, though he will obtain it, <i>deserves</i> no more power than a commoner. This is one reason the original meaning of &quot;meritocracy&quot; is satirical[2], as it does not change anything other than for the worse, by making the wielders of power believe that they actually deserve it (like the nobility in ancient times but unlike more recent ruling classes such as the American WASPs).<p>So far I have found that people who believe that the variance of some traits such as intelligence between population groups is dominantly the result of genetics do so because they think it provides a moral justification to the social order: things are as they ought to be because nature dictates so. I see no connection between the two. Nature (if it is, in fact, at play) has little bearing on ethics[3], and thus can, at most, explain but never justify an unfair distribution of power.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact%E2%80%93value_distinction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact%E2%80%93value_distinction</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy</a>",1425962270

Imagine applying to a few different jobs, and each requiring you to do 20 hours of learning of their material followed by some open ended realistic problem, that could take many hours to complete. If you were looking around at a few different employers, this would be a full-time job itself; some candidates would skip it because they could find a job which required less effort up front easily enough, some would simply not have the time because they are working a full-time job while doing it.<p>On the other hand, if there is a shared work-sample test like this one, that will be used by a number of employers, it means that it can be more in depth than any single employer could do, while simultaneously wasting less of the candidate&#x27;s time as they do the one test, rather than one per potential employer.<p>So yes, in a way I am viewing this as a replacement for a technical phone screen, because I am interested in improvements to that process but haven&#x27;t come across any potential improvements which seem viable, but this one sounds like it could have potential.<p>The &quot;read the resume, read their existing code samples, and do a phone screen&quot; approach covers a lot of ground in a little time, so while there are a large number of problems with it, it&#x27;s pretty hard to improve on without spending a lot of the candidate&#x27;s time to get up to speed on a more realistically sized problem, and a lot of good candidates aren&#x27;t willing to devote that much time unless they really, really want to work for that particular employer.

But the MBA 11 is the cheapest in the macbook lineup, the price difference with the 12&#x27; is so big that its niche is essentially catering to a lower-end price segment.<p>For the 13&#x27; the price difference is still there, but not as big. But the 13&#x27; has 3 hours more battery, better ports and an extra 1 inch, while again being cheaper.<p>Add to that the fact that the MB is actually quite underpowered (1.1ghz, HD 5300), the MBA 1.6 Ghz, HD 6000 is a significant step up. Meaning for any dev work for which you don&#x27;t need a MBP (probably the majority of web stuff both front/back end, and a fair bit of development outside of that), you&#x27;re going to want to more powerful MBA.<p>The MB to me feels like a replacement for the 11&#x27; for rich peeps who want a slick device for school, entertainment, office work (e.g. PR, marketing, management), while the MBA 11&#x27; is in the cheap macbook niche and the MBA 13&#x27; is in the &#x27;all-day aspiring workhorse that&#x27;s not quite as powerful as a MBP, but very affordable&#x27; niche. The new MB is certainly not in the cheap niche, and it&#x27;s not quite all-day or an aspiring workhorse.<p>Longer-term though, I have no clue. It&#x27;s a confusing lineup for sure. MB is less powerful than the air. What? Air is thicker, bigger, noisier than the MB, what? The Air/Pro was a great lineup, the new MB is a weird one in the story.",1425961058
