If a lot of people started doing it though there would be a lot more local sell pressure and the prices people could get in that country would drop and raise the overall cost of the transaction.<p>Bitcoin can be good for remittances but if it becomes popular in a region it will out price itself for that and other reasons.<p>Also almost all bitcoin services I&#x27;ve seen so far have saved money two ways.  1.  They have offloaded the last mile cost on another service(a banks ATM network, or corner store, etc).  If it becomes popular those services are going to start wanting their cut much they same as WU would pay them.  2. They ignore KYC.  Again if they get popular the banking industry will definitely apply pressure to get them to start following this which will again increase costs.",1425981594

So if you can&#x27;t do it in your sleep then it isn&#x27;t good enough. There are only two ways to reach this stage, either it becomes second nature to you or you memorize everything. If you still want to proceed then you can try these steps:<p>Firstly you need to learn to code small 10-20 line programs in your head (everything including proper syntax etc, if you printed a copy of your mental image it would compile), without that you get crippled just from being unable to properly reason about your code.<p>Secondly you need to build up an intuition for data structures and algorithms so that you can easily come up with solutions on the fly. Very few do this, some even thinks that it is impossible and assumes that the questions only test memorization.<p>As an alternative to the second step you can memorize a ton of algorithms and continue going to interviews till you get a question you have memorized. This is what people usually do which isn&#x27;t strange since this is how most pass their CS exams.<p>The first step is easy, just stop using your favorite IDE and use something simple like notepad. When you are comfortable with writing code in notepad then you are ready for interview programming.<p>The second step is harder and will take years. The easiest way to get better at this is to try to solve problems without help. You can start by reading up on different data structures/algorithms on wikipedia and then try to implement them in your favorite language. You can do competitive programming in parallel to practice speed and try out your implementations on tests which are much better at finding bugs than any interviewer.<p>The alternative second step can take any amount of time depending on how lucky you are. Minimum is to memorize FizzBuzz by writing it over and over in notepad till you get it right 20 times in a row. This can be done in a day even if you are an idiot. From there you can continue adding solutions to problems till you get the job you want. Then just forget everything and come back complaining once you want another job. This already happened once for fresh CS graduates since they forgot what they crammed for their tests so now they need to cram again and again for every interview.",1425979864

Subtle plagiarism can exist in varying forms, such as reading an analysis of the problem and solutions. Some people who plagiarize will pass a thorough Q&A about their code, because they fully understood the explanation of the solution, but are getting an unfair advantage over candidates who worked out a solution themselves from scratch.<p>Overall, I get more value from tests that are constructed so that I can learn positive things about the candidate - as many opportunities as possible for the candidate to distinguish themselves. If the only reason for a particular approach was to provide the opportunity for immoral candidates to weed themselves out by committing obvious plagiarism (negative data), then there&#x27;s probably a better approach that tells me more about the candidate per unit time.<p>If I was going to continue, I would use a problem that is (1) more representative of the actual work being done by the team; less of a puzzle (2) custom designed for the team or company; not a preexisting or well known problem.

The value of having mentors and teachers is tremendous, even if you know you can learn to code on your own.

There are many decent competitors out there that don&#x27;t require these types of hacks (and for the record, I carry two USB batteries in my bag since there are occasions when I&#x27;m in the field for extended periods of time (24 hours+), but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be charitable to the idea of draining that backup power because Apple thought I needed to save 2mm of vertical space more than I needed the ability to transfer battery power from my laptop to my phone). That&#x27;s the gist of the thing here. Apple people take using Apple products seriously and will go to lengths to make it work. Other people take their work seriously and will use the tool that best suits their needs. It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine a MacBook <i>ever</i> best suiting the needs of a user that&#x27;s more advanced than the casual Facebook browser just because so many sacrifices are made for aesthetics, and honestly even that market is a dubious target for the MacBook since the emergence of the tablet (for lighter casual users) and the ultrabook (for heavier casual users).<p>Do we care more about having the sexiest laptop in the airport or getting more productive time in?

9176720,comment,9172373,9175301,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"When I sit down to work on a laptop, unless I&#x27;m just stopping to check something for a couple of minutes, I usually want to plug in at least my phone (since publicly-available WiFi is not really a thing, often I have to USB tether to get usable connectivity (I <i>could</i> wifi tether if I had to, but this kills the phone&#x27;s battery)), mouse, headphones, and AC adapter. I&#x27;ll pretty frequently want to use an external storage device like an SD card or USB hard disk and if I&#x27;m in a real office, I&#x27;ll usually want to plug in to the physical network (even non-Apple portables don&#x27;t include this port usually anymore, so that&#x27;s another USB port occupied) and use an external keyboard.<p>That&#x27;s just me. A few of those things could be transferred to wireless peripherals, but not all of them, and wireless peripherals usually suck pretty bad. I have a Bluetooth headset that I try to use in the field occasionally and it&#x27;s a nightmare switching between A2DP and telephony modes. I could switch to a wireless mouse, but then that&#x27;s batteries and many of these take up a USB port anyway with a proprietary dongle. I don&#x27;t usually carry a full keyboard around with me so I just gotta use what they have in the office, which again, even if it&#x27;s wireless, often occupies a USB port.<p>To me, this is serious. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m doing anything super special; I&#x27;m definitely not writing custom firmware for esoteric embedded devices from Starbucks or anything like that. Just your everyday developer and sysadmin.<p>Now, if I put a lot of effort into it and decided I was going to live on a MBP and therefore needed to keep my usage restrained to one or two USB ports max, I may be able to come up with an arrangement that works, but it&#x27;s by no means the default; I most recently tried to live off a MBP for 5 months in the first half of 2013, and it didn&#x27;t work out (the lack of ports was a constant annoyance, but not the impetus behind the change). I swapped it for a Thinkpad and was <i>much</i> happier. I find this happens to me every time I try to live off an MBP. The most successful run I had was 2006-2008 where an MBP was my sole laptop and I did a lot of remote work, but it was not really pleasant and I had a desktop that I used to supplement.<p>To be clear, I have bought 3 Apple laptops over the years of my own free will and used a few more that were owned by employers. It&#x27;s not that I hate them (in fact I continue to be astonished by Retina displays, which I was sure was just going to be hype before I saw it in person, and wish PC makers would catch up), but I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re good workhorse machines for people who do real work. I think they&#x27;re mostly a fashion thing that people force themselves to live with. I&#x27;d love to have one around the house as a casual computing machine, but it&#x27;s hard to justify dropping $2k for the setup, when again, there is real work that would be better served by the same investment going to actually useful equipment or to labor.<p>I just don&#x27;t really see a reason to force myself to heed Apple&#x27;s insistence that while I <i>think</i> I may want more than two ports, I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t. Even the way I use Apple hardware usually pisses off Mac devotees -- back in 2006 I made some permanent enemies out of a few acquaintances that were stunned I would be voluntarily using Fedora on a MacBook Pro. They kept repeating that they&#x27;d totally understand if it was a PC, but if I had to use Linux on a Mac, I was most likely just a retard who couldn&#x27;t grasp <i>the beauty</i> gifted to earth by Humanity&#x27;s Eminent Genius Steve Jobs. They continued this hostility every other time I saw them. Pretty bizarre.",1425978057
