Perhaps I went a bit too gung-ho with my POV.<p>I&#x27;d note, though, that long compile times shouldn&#x27;t be too dependant on language design, should it?<p>I feel that an argument could be made that if a programming language is well defined, then a well written compiler could be well thought out and designed around it.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m sure that there are counterpoints. I&#x27;m sure that there are languages for which it is very difficult to write a &quot;fast&quot; compiled.<p>> Besides, have you ever looked back on something and said &#x27;Gee, I wish I knew less about this when I started&#x27;<p>Actually, I kind of have.

Who the fuck cares about the indentation and spacing for a test case, maybe that&#x27;s part of the input causing the failure? Or perhaps the forum software ate it. Regardless, dumb.)<p>It seems clear Benjamin was originally operating under the erroneous assumption that this was written by a human, which I&#x27;d consider an honest and reasonable enough mistake, requiring no managerial boogy men.<p>If we make the same mistake:  While it&#x27;s a minor quibble given the size of the snippet, there&#x27;s no less than three scopes with the same indentation level (global, function, for-loop) already - which, if a habit, is one you want to correct <i>before</i> someone tries to check in a few hundred lines of non-test code in the same style.<p>Fixing the indentation might be trivial enough with any autoformatter (since this isn&#x27;t python), but cleaning up the variable shadowing is going to get a bit nastier - likely introducing (or fixing) bugs if done manually.<p>Proactively trying to prevent such problems seems like a reasonable response, not a dumb one, to me.",1425196274

A good approach may be to show 3-5 subjects (e.g. Philosophy, Startups, Architecture) and highlight one of the courses that would be the best beginners course. So if I&#x27;m interested in philosophy it&#x27;s very easy to just see immediately where I could/should begin and click just one button. Going in to feature creep here but; as I just signed up I haven&#x27;t completed a course yet, obviously, so I don&#x27;t know what happens then, but it would be great (for retention etc.) to be recommended a natural next course to take as well. Dumb it down for the user even more. Actually what I would do is to have a button in the last email of a course that would read &quot;Continue with GREATEST PHILOSOPHERS IN HISTORY&quot;. So just one click and I would be in the loop again.<p>I definitely got in to a &quot;oh this is nice.. and this too.. and these two would be cool..&quot;. At the same having the full catalogue of courses available is good of course, but don&#x27;t overwhelm the first time user.<p>I would test having the &quot;popular courses&quot; feature, or something like proposed above, just under your headline actually. So it&#x27;s super easy to see what the site is really about without even having to scroll. That would show off the kind of content you have and even though your name is Highbrow, it might not be clear if you&#x27;re teaching out nail painting techniques or philosophy when I just read the headline and the feature list you have.<p>Great idea anyway and nice execution. :)",1425196110

This is why all these CSS rules are so hard to use for applications. It is built on the model of a document, not a user interface.<p>The situation is immensely worse on machines like the Raspberry Pi or the BeagleBoard.

It only matters that someone can understand what we mean, because it is the meaning that matters, not the word. Too often discussions end up about what words really mean or should mean. That feels like an argument that is getting somewhere, but it actually does very little intellectual work. It distracts from talking about the actual topic. That&#x27;s all I meant.<p>> That we optimize for imminent capability is obvious.<p>Not to me. There&#x27;s nothing gambling about, trying to make it so that potential capability is more accurately correlated to imminent capability. Then both strategies align.<p>As you say work to fulfil everyone&#x27;s potential.<p>But as long as systemic privilege exists there will be some with more resources and access to capabilities despite lower potential. So we end up employing large numbers of sub-optimal people just because they could afford to become educated / mentored / inspired, and ignoring others with far more potential because they didn&#x27;t happen to have those benefits.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m not totally convinced by the economic argument (or rather I&#x27;m not convinced that, if it were false in some way, it would be a good reason to keep privilege unchecked), but that&#x27;s what the argument is, as I understand it.<p>> Note: Click on the unique comment link<p>You&#x27;re my hero/ine thank you!",1425195281

It seems inplausible that individual differences are mostly genetic but group differences are entirely cultural. The mean IQ of Ashkenazi Jews is a standard deviation higher than the European average. In a group so genetically isolated that it has its own set of endemic genetic diseases, I&#x27;m not willing to assume without evidence that privilege is the primary contributor.",1425194486

Finding a shared vocabulary can be essential to actual communication.  It&#x27;s far too easy for people to argue a similar or even the <i>same</i> point without that shared reference point.  That doesn&#x27;t really need to be what it &quot;really means&quot; as long as it&#x27;s meaning in the discussion is well understood.<p><i>&#x27;Merit&#x27; has its own problems, because it connotes &#x27;deserving&#x27;, and it is a problem to suggest that a rich, Harvard educated white male deserves a job more than a poor, community college educated black female.

Is the goal of getting more participation in certain roles better achieved through artificial insertion of people into those roles, or more focus on earlier stages to make them better fits for those roles so they are naturally chosen at a later stage?<p>That we optimize for imminent capability is obvious.  To do otherwise is gambling.  Perhaps it could be considered too high a price to pay - if it had not shown over the past few hundred years that it pays great dividends.  I think my stance here is that there are other ways to attack the downsides of privilege rather than putting sub-optimal workers in positions.  Namely, work to fulfill the potential of those workers that have said potential.<p>I think an argument could be made that the current strategy, which has been in place for at least the last few hundred years in the west, has lead to a higher percentage of people utilizing their talents optimally than ever before, with a higher standard of living for more people than ever before, with a higher survival rate as well.  I think it&#x27;s folly to attack what I see as the fundamental mechanism that&#x27;s lead to this while there are still other avenues to pursue.<p><i>There&#x27;s no problem with being ignorant of things we don&#x27;t know.</i><p>The problem is not the <i>being</i> ignorant, the problem is the use of the label ignorant as an argument tactic to cast the opposition&#x27;s position as unworthy of consideration.
