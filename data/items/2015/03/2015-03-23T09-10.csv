This can be as simple as always being punctual and available to work and actively learning as much about your job and work environment as possible, to coming up with new ways to save or make the company money.<p>Reality, however, dictates that not everyone can be truly irreplaceable, no matter how hard they try, and that is what takes away bargaining power. The solution to this is not easy and involves learning a new (and hopefully more valuable) skills, or looking for work elsewhere, and I acknowledge that this can be hard in depressed areas of the country. Many are unable or unwilling to do that sort of thing and think that they should not have to.<p>However, just because there is no extra industry in your area should not mean that the existing ones should be muscled by unions to make up the difference.

The matching process happens in a very specific order and all I/O happens as side effects of small steps in the matching process (I/O operations are implemented as pseudo-constraints, i.e. small &quot;twigs&quot;).<p>As a result, the order you write your constraints (&quot;trees&quot;) in in Prolog is /very/ important.  Things may not terminate or may blow up the stack or take far, far too long or produce the wrong I/O if the order isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> right.<p>So standard Prolog is not a nice language.<p>But the idea of specifying constraints and let the computer find solutions is really nice.  If only we didn&#x27;t have those side effects weaved into the constraint solving process.  And if we could specify the constraints separately from heuristics on how to solve them (i.e. the order in which to try things).  Or if it could handle something more interesting than just &quot;trees with wildcards&quot;.<p>mini-Kanren seems to be such a better constraint solving language -- I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, since I am not done with my Prolog studies but I&#x27;m very much looking forward to it.<p>Some Prologs have extensions that ameliorate or completely fix some of the problems with Prologs.
