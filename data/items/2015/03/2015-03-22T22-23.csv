It&#x27;s not really true. After 30, jobs under 2 years start to look bad on your CV, and you start getting into senior positions that are rarer. You can&#x27;t always overcome those issues just because you&#x27;re a great programmer. If you&#x27;re 40 and have had 4 jobs in the past 6 years, many companies won&#x27;t even look at you.<p>We seem to think that, if it will cost hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for us to leave, we&#x27;re in charge.

But this just is not right.<p>Pass-by-reference has a specific meaning, and by ignoring that, you are adding to the confusion and doing a disservice to everyone who genuinely wants to learn what is right. Stop doing that.<p>If you &quot;x = new Foo()&quot; inside a routine and it changes the value of y in &quot;call(y)&quot;  then it is pass-by-reference. Period.<p>Java does not do this. Java is pass-by-value only.<p>Just because you can dereference your copy of a variable holding an object reference (or pointer - they are synonymous in the JLS) and mutate the pointed-to object, which the caller can then see through their copy of their pointer variable, does not mean you are passing by reference.<p>You are passing an object reference (pointer) by value.",1427064855

9248596,comment,9245043,9245043,0,0,agricola,,,"I think people are reading way too much into what a reference is.  In c++, it has a very specific meaning, but in Java it has a slightly different definition.<p>In c++, the only difference between a reference and a pointer is in the dereference syntax, and that a pointer can be reassigned.  In the background, the variable is a pointer in both cases.  It is simply syntactic sugar.<p>Another thing some people are mixing up is the entire philosophy between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value.  The ability to write a simple swap function does not accurately demonstrate what a language is doing.  It is quite simply whether or not the compiler creates a copy of the <i></i><i>object</i><i></i> (not a copy of the address / pointer / reference).  If, in the background, Java passes an address / pointer / reference (the word makes absolutely no difference), when the programmer is attempting to pass an object, that is the definition of pass-by-reference regardless what arbitrary word I want to name the referencing value.  Yes, the pointer is a copy of the previous pointer, but that&#x27;s not the explicit value that the programmer cares about.<p>Yet another comparison to c++: the same thing happens with pass-by-reference in c++.  If a function has the prototype:<p><pre><code>    void foo(Dog& d);
</code></pre>
and I pass a Dog object in a call similar to:<p><pre><code>    Dog d(&quot;Spot&quot;);
    foo(d);
</code></pre>
then, in the background, it is going create a reference (i.e. the address), and copy it on the stack.  In my foo() function, the argument is simply already dereferenced (I don&#x27;t have to treat it like a pointer).<p>TLDR...<p>If you pass an object to a function, and operations performed by that function affect the original object, it is pass-by-reference.  Period.",1427064566

Setup is as easy as Wordpress and it will monitor pretty much everything on a network (ISP/carrier). Adding a device is pretty much one click, add hostname.<p>In exchange it expects things like having resolvable hostnames for devices and standardized port descriptions.<p>Compare this with Nagios or Cacti where you have to configure checks/graph collection for each thing you care about. The skill level required to set them up is a bit higher than Observium but still free.<p>Alternatively you have commercial software like Orion or Intermapper where setup may be easier but you have to pay for every metric you collect.<p>Because of this Observium gets a stream of vocal small MSP/ISP-type people who demand support and aren&#x27;t willing to pay for it. I believe Obserivum went to a pay-for-access model in part to keep this under control.<p>I use Observium, pay for the subscription (~$200/yr is really trivial for this), and have contributed patches (that were committed) that fixed  bugs and added device support (without any compensation aside from it making $DAYJOB easier). From the WISP community alone I saw probably half a year of &quot;I won&#x27;t buy a subscription until you support X device/X pet feature&quot; from people who often came off as the client from hell in how they said it.<p>So, yeah, I don&#x27;t like that I end up with a bit of anxiety over the reception my patches will get but I see the occasionally rough reaction as a immune response from a community that&#x27;s under stress.",1427064560

But, the decline in union membership does not tell the whole story about the decline of wages in America.<p>I believe the decline in wages and union membership reflects a shift in how people value themselves as human beings, and their relationship to their fellow man.<p>The biggest obstacle to increasing wages to more equitable levels comes from the mentality: &quot;At least I have a job&quot;, &quot;I will be rich someday&quot;, &quot;I can make it on my own&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m only going to work here for a year&quot;.  These thoughts are what has allowed wages to be pushed to their lowest levels in recent history without any push-back from the work force.<p>Unions at their core are nothing more than a group of workers who get together to negotiate a contract and are willing to take action to force the employer to sit down and negotiate.  This used to be understood, but at some point unions became viewed as some sort of &quot;servicing&quot; entity that drew its powers from a mysterious legal paper.  Members forgot that the union was THEM.<p>Thankfully, the labor movement is starting reverse course from decades of this mentality.<p>The truth is that,  the only power which workers (unionized or not) have is to withhold labor in a coordinated manner. Contracts are meaningless without the power of a strike. Without workers being willing to all withhold labor together, union or not, wages will continue to decline until a moral crisis is reached.<p>Sorry, that was a bit of a ramble, but &quot;unions&quot; are just groups of workers who have a 501(c)(5) paper with IRS that allows them pool money together to organize.",1427062889

I have a feeling our disagreement is due to definitions so let me be more specific about my intended meanings.<p>There is a minimum price at which you are willing to not switch vocations and there is a maximum price at which you can be profitably employed. The latter is what I was calling value, as in &quot;value to the company.&quot; Relative bargaining power determines where on that spectrum your salary will be. It&#x27;s arguable that the final price is &quot;value&quot; but that&#x27;s not the meaning I intended. What <i>should</i> happen is a question for the philosophers. What <i>does</i> happen is up to us.<p>The Wapping dispute is an example of a union failing to recognize that the value (same definition I was using above) of their employees had fallen below their asking price. Sure, it happens -- I have no doubt that unions increase friction, which is bad and hurts the economy. But underpaying workers &quot;because you can&quot; is also bad, also introduces friction (increased need for loans, decreased ability of workers to bootstrap), and also hurts the economy.

He has to beat that number to be considered genuinely better (rather than being the luckiest).<p>For example suppose that the volatility of the S&P 500 is 10% per year.  In a 40 year period, the volatility is thus 0.10 times sqrt(40), the central limit theorem, or 63%.  So, a 1 standard deviation move in the S&P 500 over 40 years is 63%.<p>To outperform by 2% per year, is 1.02^40 = 2.28 = 128% gain.<p>63% * 2 = 126%<p>So, this guy performed two standard deviations above the mean over 40 years.  That certainly is within the realm of random chance, considering he was the best/luckiest.<p>Therefore, I conclude he did not outperform the market by a statistically significant margin.  Actually, I&#x27;d expect the best fund to be 3 or 4 standard deviations above the mean (given the # of funds), so this result is an argument AGAINST active managers.<p>Actually, the volatility of the S&P 500 is more than 10%, so I overestimated his performance.

The actual independence war of Slovenia lasted only 10 days [1]. Still, troop movements happened in sight of the Austrian border and the Austrians were not happy at all.<p>The outbreak of full conflict between the recently declared independent states of Croatia and Bosnia with Yugoslavia happend shortly after and was not over in 1993/94 [2]. So I guess any Austrian border patrol would have been wary of refugees/smugglers/shady elements crossing any eastern border.<p>Hungary was never immediately affected by the war in the former Yugoslavia, but it had an enormously long border with a country at war with itself and the economic impact (loss of trade with the southern neighbours, influx of refugees etc.) could be felt in many ways. So, compared to western standards, Hungary might, at the time, have looked slightly less than appealing.

Who should decide it? Not easy.<p>It gets particularly hairy when technological change has an impact on value. This is happening faster and faster.<p>Consider the classical example of Wapping dispute [0] where old hot-metal methods of printing, which unions sought to protect, were replaced by electronic publishing tools and printing machines. Today, it would look quite funny if papers still had to employ Linotype professionals to be able to print things in newspapers. The more acute concern is whether publishers print anything at all on paper, or if everything is in the net. If the unions could decide, of course you couldn&#x27;t publish in the net, because it is destructive to jobs in the printing industry.<p>At some time, the commercial &quot;value&quot; of Linotype operators was very high. Now it is only historical; as a commercial operation, the machines have gone to obscurity. Who should have decided the value of those workers? I think the only one who really can decide is the one who owns and runs the operation. The unions mostly have an incentive to preserve the status quo - while happily accepting a change in other businesses, if it benefits them. No doubt that the modern-day Linotype operator would see it fit that he uses his union pay to buy an iPhone.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping_dispute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping_dispute</a>",1427061685

      <tr><td align=center valign=center>
        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        The following button should be centered:<br>
        <button>Button</button>
      </td></tr>
    </table>
</code></pre>
Can you reproduce that with flexbox?  In a way that works across all browsers?  Without writing huge amounts of code?<p>[NOTE: This example has a bug in it.  See the subsequent comments]",1427061609

Play against opponents and adapt to them is a whole different ballgame where you don&#x27;t have gazillion artificial hands to play against another dumb computer. I am pretty sure Phil Ivey would love to play against that unbeatable program, if those scientist would put their money where their mouths are :)",1427061604
