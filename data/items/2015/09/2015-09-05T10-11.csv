It&#x27;s hard to put your finger on what makes it feel unsavory. After all, there are a bunch of players who have different interests who all have to agree on the deal for it to go through. Presumably, if it were a rigged game, these deals wouldn&#x27;t get closed. The whole &quot;fool me twice&quot; thing, and all.<p>Yet, these big PE firms seem to come out ahead. Certainly their principles do. On the other hand, when big companies falter, there are the bystanders: the working people, clients of the business, the community, and other non-equity-holding stakeholders. None of these people seem to stand to gain much no matter who wins the game of thrones in the boardroom.

There are certain types of debt with different risk levels.<p>The debt with the lowest levels of interest tends to be traditional bank debt. If the company goes under, they are first in line to recover any losses. The more debt involved in a deal, the riskier it gets.<p>If you fund a $100m deal with $40m in debt, and $60m in equity, that&#x27;s fine. That&#x27;s usually low risk if it&#x27;s a healthy company.<p>Now imagine the same deal, $80m debt and $20m in equity. Traditional banks might only give you a loan for $50m. The remaining $30m you will need to get from other investors, who will be further in line to recover any losses (meaning they will charge a higher rate of interest).<p>Why do banks love big deals? Easy: these deals generate a lot of profit. On a $100m loan, they&#x27;ll be making $4-6m a year.<p>Usually the risk level is acceptable for them, since they&#x27;re first in line when the company gets liquidated.",1441450414

Many of them use foreign hosting providers and cloud services because the quality is higher.<p>Imagine that every county in the World will require the same thing. For monsters like Google and Facebook it will be an issue but still solvable issue. For small and middle size business it will cost a lot.<p>And if we take a look from the Russian Government point of view, if you have a choice to check that Google follows the law or to check that 100 small companies follow the same law. Of course, they will check 100 companies, because it&#x27;s easier to find something there than losing a lot of money, time and other resources fighting against Google.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.ecipe.org/blog/data-localisation-russia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecipe.org/blog/data-localisation-russia/</a>",1441448012

Debt helps to fix the companies. The PE business model essentially focuses on fixing principal-agent issues (i.e. management working against the best interests of shareholders). Improved governance, high equity ownership by management, and high debt loads are how they do it. &quot;Debt disciplines management&quot; because it forces them to eliminate -NPV projects and increase cash flows.",1441447777

It reminds me a lot of another piece from a year ago: <a href=""https://stories.expost-news.com/screw-stigma-im-coming-out-6809e83f355e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stories.expost-news.com/screw-stigma-im-coming-out-6...</a>.<p>I&#x27;ve learned it can be really dangerous to tie so much of your identity up into something that&#x27;s external and not fully under your control. But maybe that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s particularly true for people predisposed to anxiety? It would be interesting to know if, for example, Fish&#x27;s contemporaries identify at all with what he&#x27;s going through. Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of degree.<p>I&#x27;ve had anxiety issues for most of my life. I&#x27;m 31 now, and until I was about 22, I think my anxiety and related issues were one of the defining features of my life experience. I&#x27;ve never really gotten professional help with them because I only realized what was going on with me in retrospect, after managing to wrestle my anxiety under control, with a lot of support from people close to me. It&#x27;s almost like anxiety cloaks itself so that the sufferer feels like their experience is truly unique and untreatable. I look back and feel silly for having felt that way. But I hope I know enough now to identify anxiety and call for help if it ever rears up again.<p>What has helped for me is a great deal of meditation to reframe what&#x27;s important in my life, taking on of tasks that challenge my fears, seeking balance and diversity in my activity and thought patterns, development of self-awareness of my thought patterns and deeply held assumptions, a very intentional focus decoupling of my self-worth with success in tasks I take on, and being lucky enough to friends patient enough to really shepherd me through some difficult times.<p>What hasn&#x27;t helped are self-medication, over-reliance on any single source of comfort, value and/or security, and adherence to belief systems that emphasize extremes.",1441447525
