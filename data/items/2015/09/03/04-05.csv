10163409,comment,10156227,10158567,0,0,noobermin,,,"Thank you for your reply. I was downvoted perhaps because people read my identification of the stereotype and thought that was my emphasis, but I honestly was curious. I myself am a physics type but I&#x27;m an armchair (or kiddie chair, really) philosopher. I specifically love philosophy of math and science because it&#x27;s closest I can get to it without feeling too guilty with wasting free time on something other than grad school (<i>cough</i>). My two favorite non-physics courses in undergrad were humanities types, a &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; (history writing) course, and a general ed philosophy course. I would say that the philosophy course was one of the most important classes for I took in my five years in undergrad.<p>The reason I asked about whether it was a rule or even common is I hear about it often that I wanted to believe it was true, so I wanted others&#x27; experience. Philosophy, hell, history is hard, at least it was for me, so I don&#x27;t doubt people who think about such things are really intelligent...and that intelligence can&#x27;t translate well to something like hacking of mathematics. It&#x27;s good to hear it in your case it worked in your favor.",1441256177

I too was interested in Scala and read Odersky&#x27;s book - and improved a lot as a programmer because of it, despite not using Scala for any &quot;real&quot; project. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever found Python that compelling. Rust and Go don&#x27;t do much for me. The 2 languages I&#x27;m excited about right now are Elm and Nim.<p>Nim empowers the programmer to do just about anything, use GC or switch to manual MM, target any computing platform that supports C (i.e. everything), reinvent the language with macros, while packaging it up very elegantly indeed.<p>Elm promises almost the exact opposite. I mean it&#x27;s elegant, but it&#x27;s also limited - purely functional, immutable, no nulls, no unchecked list access. And that&#x27;s the kind of limitation that addresses the problem that Bruce has with other languages - dealing with all the complexity of how something&#x27;s working. The promise of Elm is that if your code compiles, it works, leaving you to focus on getting the important stuff right - information flow and business logic - instead of tracking down another silly invalidity that never should have made it to runtime.<p>They&#x27;re both young, but I wish Andreas Rumpf (Nim) and Evan Czaplicki (Elm) and their teams all the best in taking on the &quot;big boys&quot; with these plucky languages, and would encourage Bruce Eckel to consider skipping ahead of the curve and writing for these alternatives.",1441255673

See Steve Blank&#x27;s &quot;Secret History&quot; series for examples.<p>And, speaking more generally, the U.S. Department of Defense is the world&#x27;s largest employer, 3.2 million strong. When taking into account benefits, pensions, etc., it may also be called the largest socialist program.<p>That statistic paints a big picture; it&#x27;s not that having a market economy was sufficient to become the sole superpower of the 1990&#x27;s. It was that the U.S. had a lot of centralized spending in &quot;the right places at the right times&quot; and then allowed the marketplace to pick up the results and run with them wherever convenient. However, it&#x27;s very difficult to backpedal and reallocate now that this has been done, and the status quo probably won&#x27;t change until a crisis motivates it.<p>The pattern of every emerging market - Japan, Korea, China - is that state power still entangles itself somehow, even if there is a marketplace at the low level.

The only way to complete a cycle is by mutating a managed value or &quot;tying the knot&quot; via laziness (which is of course just mutation in a hat).<p>Rust almost has this. Only shared (immutable) references can be obtained to values owned by a reference-counted pointer (which is nothing fancy -- just not implementing mutably dereferencing RCs). Since mutability is inherited, this freezes all reference counted data and everything it can reach.<p>However Rust also provides types which specifically <i>can</i> be mutated in a shared context (a Mutex being the most obvious case), so you can indeed make reference-counted cycles and leak.<p>Still, by default you can&#x27;t leak. You have to opt into these &quot;interior mutability&quot; types.<p>Basically, &quot;shared XOR mutable&quot; does not necessitate forbidding mutability universally. It just requires a way to freeze data when it <i>is</i> shared. You can even unfreeze it whenever you can prove it isn&#x27;t actually shared (e.g. reference count = 1).",1441255212

If I remember right international passenger flight regulations insist that there be atleast one airport that can handle your class of aircraft within 180 minutes of flying time at one engine operative speeds at all times. If we assume a passenger jet flies at roughly 0.8 Mach or ~960 kph, and one-engine operative speed is roughly 40% of that or ~384 KPH. That means an airport needs to be within a circle of radius 1152 kms. That&#x27;s an area of ~4.16M km-squared.

In my eyes, React&#x27;s big feature is that it is a declarative, component-based UI model. Look at React Native or ComponentKit - they are not built around the idea that CocoaTouch is slow, but rather that there are simpler ways to do UI than the traditional imperative approach.<p>> React augments the complexity of a stack that it&#x27;s already too complex, to an unneeded, non-sustainable and dev-unfriendly way in which we are supposed to use HTML tags inside JS scripts.<p>In my experience, as I mentioned above, React actually provides a fantastic abstraction that makes it simpler to build UIs. I haven&#x27;t found it to be dev-unfriendly at all, the opposite actually - I find that it is a highly pragmatic, productive and pleasant way to work. But I suppose that&#x27;s a matter of preference. What do you find unfriendly about it in particular?<p>> React is not a product of love for a greatly engineered system, but obviously just a product of FB&#x27;s understandable necessity to work faster &quot;today and here&quot;, in order to keep bringing home their daily profit.<p>This point I must disagree with absolutely. I have had many interactions with people who work on React and from my point of view it is indeed a labor of love as much as any I&#x27;ve seen on an OSS project. Do you have any examples that you can point towards to back up your assertion? Just watch presentations by any of the React team members and you&#x27;ll see that there are real people behind it that care deeply about it. Better yet, talk to any of them in person and see how excited they are! This isn&#x27;t a heartless top-down mandated project by a massive organization to squeeze more money out, but rather it started off as a skunkworks project by a single engineer in his spare time who thought that UI could be simpler, that caught on within the company because it turned out to be a great idea.<p>> React is not a solution, it&#x27;s a patch, a ugly one.\n> We are not forced to like it just because FB made it and made it OS.<p>Well, isn&#x27;t the world beautiful, so many different opinions! I&#x27;m extremely curious what your preferred tooling is, or any suggestions you have to make React better.

While questions on a good exam should need not be shared in advance and may test creativity and problem solving, they shouldn&#x27;t be out of the blue either, they should be related to the study path.  An exam should be graded consistently and fairly, by people who are qualified to recognize a strong performance, and perhaps an approach that was not anticipated (a grader for a math exam, for instance, should be able to evaluate a proof that differs from the one a professor had in mind when he or she wrote the question).  Students often have the right to receive feed back on their performance, and they often obtain a lasting credential, credit for a course, or other artifact that demonstrates that they successfully demonstrated knowledge of or competence in the subject matter.<p>Unfortunately, I believe that tech exams are very stressful, but don&#x27;t observe many of these practices that I believe exist in universities and other exam-related institutions for a good reason.<p>The first step, I think, is to recognize tech interviews for what they are, which is a form of exam.",1441252918

We must find middle ground between the two models. A solution that takes the best of both on-prem software and cloud based SaaS services may be that middle ground, but it&#x27;s going to require a globally federated cloud.<p>I think something like remoteStorage can address this need.<p><a href=""https://remotestorage.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://remotestorage.io/</a><p>It&#x27;s a federated, open storage protocol that has multiple server implementations that anyone can host. I think it has the potential to enable a new model for SaaS software where users, rather than service providers, own the data.",1441252893
