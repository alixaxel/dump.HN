front of me teaching the subject.<p>Here are his books that I bought:<p>Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java , Course Technology, 2004<p>By reading this book, I&#x27;ve developed my skills in programming with
C/C++, assembly language and while learning computer architecture all
at the same time. This book contains lots of low level stuffs.
The exercises are easy enough and had really sharpen my skills.
Although the target machine is theoretical, I was able to switch
easily into the real machine.<p>Compiler Construction Using Java, JavaCC, and Yacc, IEEE/Wiley, 2012<p>This book taught me how to create compilers. The author started from
simple principles in grammars then slowly introducing a very simple compiler
eventually adding more features to the compiler. I was able to adapt
his method in developing a compiler. In later chapters, the book does
a great job in presenting an application of what was learned from the previous
chapters by implementing grep using automata theory.<p>I might have forgotten some of the topics after more than a year but I
will not forget the fun it gave to me when reading and learning from
those books.",1441695095

If it was &quot;real&quot; enough, you wouldn&#x27;t need a contrived example.<p>> <i>and, in the article, is directly responsible for a bug.</i><p>Nope! It was not responsible for anything whatsoever. Yeah, the backslashes got escaped, but they were <i>already</i> broken, so it didn&#x27;t actually break anything.

Neither of us was present (I&#x27;m assuming) when the printf format spec was decided upon, but I&#x27;d wager that % was chosen because this has a semantically different meaning than backslash-escapes. Backslash escapes are just that: escapes. They&#x27;re either stand-ins for certain un-typeable characters, or they disable interpretation of the following character. But % in printf isn&#x27;t used as a character escape, it&#x27;s used as a <i>token</i>. It&#x27;s a stand-in for a more complicated representation of a separate argument. And the fact that it behaves differently than \ does warrants it using a different character.<p>Whereas in other languages, \ typically has the exact same semantic meaning as \ does in C strings (the set of character escapes may vary slightly, although most languages tend to copy C&#x27;s character escapes verbatim). And that&#x27;s why they use \. It&#x27;s the same reason most languages use &quot;&quot; to denote strings, or [] to denote subscripting. It&#x27;s common punctuation that behaves the same across multiple languages, which makes it easy for the programmer to remember and work with.",1441694332

You could pay extra to have the app baked into a custom rom to make it non-removable.<p>The business model from our end is we&#x27;d find app developers who are willing to pay X amount per install (a conversion was usually tracked by the first time an end user opens the app), and then we pay Y amount per install to a shady phone re-seller to bake that app into the rom of their latest batch of phones. As long as X is sufficiently higher than Y to account for whatever our conversion rate is, we make our money back plus profits as the app developer pays us for conversions.<p>The shady re-sellers would take their phones with new roms and either sell direct to consumer or, in the case of the bigger guys, move those phones on to a big-box retailer.",1441693437
