10219006,comment,10217887,10218717,0,0,xxbondsxx,,,"Sure there are strong similarities to versioning, but I think the difference is in how callers get migrated. In GraphQL you can update each callsite incrementally. Imagine half the app has been converted to calling PlanetDetails {name} and the other half still calls homePlanet. That&#x27;s totally fine -- the app will totally work, compile, run, everything.<p>Whereas contrasting with REST versioning or traditional versioning, it becomes quite difficult to mix API versions internally (each callsite needs to specify their desired api version before specifying fields) or impossible outright. If the latter, you&#x27;re then forced to migrate <i>all at once</i> from a given version to another, which requires a ton of coordination across teams and big scary &quot;flip the switch&quot; moments.<p>This gets worse as you scale up your org, which is why GraphQL has served FB well.",1442292977

Watch a hollywood film from the 30&#x27;s and you&#x27;ll see men hugging, slapping each other on the back, holding hands, walking arm-in-arm, etc. in a very casual manner. Man hugs still happen in movies, but only in times of extreme emotion.  Think back to the last time a co-worker gave you a hug.  It was probably quite a while ago!<p>Some cultures still show a lot of emotion and have a lot of physical contact (e.g. Turks).  People in these cultures also tend to stand much closer when talking.  Put a Western European or North American in their midst and he&#x27;ll feel very uncomfortable.  Showing strong emotions is also generally more acceptable in these cultures.  I may have fist pumped a couple times when my team won the Stanley Cup, but I&#x27;ve seen Turks do cartwheels, flop on the ground in hysterics, get up and start hugging everyone in the room because their soccer team won a quarter-final!<p>So, what happened?  Why, in less than a century, did we become so aloof and restrained?  Homophobia may be one possible reason.  If two men unconsciously stand too close to each other while looking at the same thing someone (a woman did this to me once) will exclaim &quot;ARE YOU TWO GAY!??&quot;.  Physical contact, sharing emotions, etc. are things that, in the last century, have become off-limits for heterosexual men, and women enforce this as much as men do despite the fact that the same standard does not apply to women.<p>The psychological effects of this on men are probably not good.

It seems different scientific fields use the word &#x27;stochastic&#x27; in very different ways.<p>The commenter, &#x27;bgins&#x27; makes the point, &quot;Random has many connotations (like entropy), not at all equivalent, and is a more generic term usable outside mathematics. Stochastic means nondeterministic or unpredictable. Random generally means unrecognizable, not adhering to a pattern. A random variable is also called a stochastic variable.&quot;<p>And user, &#x27;Einnocent,&#x27; &quot;Likewise, I&#x27;ve noticed that network theory tends to refer to traffic as being stochastic. Such traffic, from the point of view of a router, would be considered random, but of course each packet was deterministically produced.&quot;<p>In the biochemical field (of which I&#x27;m familiar, though ignorant of the others), I doubt anyone would say that gene expression is &#x27;random&#x27;, rather it is &#x27;stochastic&#x27;, and their intention in choosing those words distinctly would indicate that there are not just probabilistic, but physical limits to the expression of a gene that constrain its probability space. And further, there are generally deterministic (if unpredictable (though not entirely independent) from to state) mechanisms which ultimately lead to gene expression.  Were I to say that the expression of gene A is &#x27;random,&#x27; then it would seem to imply that there is some minute chance that the result is a billion copies of the gene, when physically, it might be impossible for the cell to exist with that many proteins in it - or that the state of gene expression at time t0 is entirely independent of expression at time t1, which is also untrue.  Both of these interpretations of biological processes are misleading and wrong, though they are what is conjured when it is said that, &quot;gene expression is random.&quot; All the while, the number of copies is actually dependent on knowable, measurable, if highly-noisy processes - what I&#x27;ve know to be termed &#x27;stochastic&#x27;.",1442292373

Quoting it below.<p>&quot;The following list briefly describes some of the features of Uncap.<p>1. Map Caps Lock key to Escape key on a new Windows system with almost no effort. Just download and double-click. This is the primary reason why Uncap was written. This tool was written for users of vi editor who like to map their Caps Lock key to Escape key for convenience.<p>2. Map any key to any key, multiple keys to other keys, or disable keys using command line arguments. No additional file or script is required.<p>3. Enable, disable or modify key mappings without having to reboot the Windows system.<p>4. Disable key mappings easily by stopping Uncap.<p>5. It is a single-file executable. It is very lightweight. The executable is only about 60 KB in size. It occupies about 1 MB or less of memory, and negligible CPU while running.<p>There are several other methods and tools available on Windows to map one key to another. But none of them seem to have all five features enumerated above. For example, editing Scancode Map registry value requires the Windows system to be rebooted after every change. On the other hand, AutoHotKey requires an additional script file to be written. Therefore, Uncap was written to support all five features described above.&quot;",1442292194

Or possibly increase supply through desalinization, or reallocate supply with major changes to infrastructure.  As I&#x27;m sure you know, the majority of water use in California is agricultural.   The bright side of that is that legal changes  to water rights can go a long way toward reducing demand. Coming from somewhere where water is less of an issue (Wisconsin) I find water rights (and the concept of the &#x27;surface estate&#x27;) fascinating.<p><pre><code>  > Which, again, makes California sound like a pretty nice

I think a more important step for California is to re-asses its priorities for water use. The amount of groundwater that the farmers are pumping is absolutely insane -- agriculture in that environment doesn&#x27;t make sense. In my area, the climate isn&#x27;t quite as nice, but I can dig a 10ft deep hole in my horse pasture and it&#x27;ll turn into a nice pond. No, you can&#x27;t grow almonds and certain other trendy foods in the midwest ... but you can grow crops that will adequately feed the populace, and it&#x27;s a far more ecologically responsible place to farm. We grow tomatoes, watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries, broccoli, green beans, blackberries, corn, and a few other things in our garden and most years I don&#x27;t need to give it a drop of water from a hose. I&#x27;ve actually had to put a good deal of time, effort, and money into managing the water that runs off of our land (we have ~11 acres that all slope toward our house). The commercial corn field across the street has <i>no</i> irrigation system, at all. Although some farmers do it, watering with groundwater here is definitely the exception and not the norm.<p>... now if only the competition for software engineers were a bit more intense ...

Pressure is force per area, so saying that there is a pressure difference between the upper and lower side of the wing means that the air is exerting a force on the wing. By Newton&#x27;s third law, that also means that the wing is exerting a force on the air, which has to move.<p>I guess you can also see it from conservation of momentum. Gravity acts on the plane, so each second there is a certain amount of downwards momentum added to the system. But the plane is not in fact moving downwards, so the all the downwards momentum has to end up in the air, so it has to move downwards. The net &quot;lift&quot; force is equal to the rate at which momentum is added to air.<p>If I understand it correctly, you can calculate the lift on the wing either in terms of the pressure on the two sides, or in terms of the downwards acceleration of air--it should be two equivalent views giving the same result. Bernoulli&#x27;s principle gives a way to calculate the pressures if you only know the velocity of the air (this is a typical situation in a wind tunnel, where you make movies of moving smoke puffs), but it&#x27;s not a separate effect from the air motion.",1442289705

There are many other things to compare this too. I am not clear on how informing the reader about the amount of funding Uber has raised and SpaceX&#x27;s revenue from contracts actually clarifies and helps to provide proper perspective of the amount of money SpaceX has under contract. There is only mention of Uber in the title and once in the article, but the mention and comparison have worked to make everyone think about Uber (look at the current comments in this submission :))",1442289650
