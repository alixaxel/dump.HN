Google&#x27;s ideal outcome is that no other browser would have tabs, making them inferior to the point of not being usable. That is literally their desired outcome from filing this patent, and indeed it is the basis for every software patent. You can see just from the list of patents cited that Microsoft and many other companies have all taken out patents on obvious incremental design improvements on browser GUIs, and the reason that they do it is to gather ammo for some theoretical ultimate showdown that they imagine will end with their browser as the only remaining legal product. None of them are dealing in good faith, and this should confirm forever that Google no longer subscribes to &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; as a behavioral maxim.",1443063466

He would know why they are getting better results. &quot;Oh, we tweaked the firmware and now we&#x27;re in compliance.&quot;<p>Yes, precisely my point.  If he knew that they &quot;tweaked the firmware&quot; well there&#x27;s a million ways to do that <i>legally</i> and to be in compliance.  And there seem to be a few ways you can do it <i>illegally</i> too, and no be in compliance.<p>The claim he made was &quot;He has said publicly that he is not aware of any wrong-doing on his part.&quot;  And that&#x27;s technically true!  Hiring someone who punches another employee reflects poorly on you, but that doesn&#x27;t make the punch your fault.  So hiring someone who hired someone who hired someone who told a programmer to come up with a &quot;cheat mode&quot; hardly makes the CEO directly responsible.  He is responsible through the chain of command, but not because of direct knowledge.<p>Finally, please remember that <i>emissions are incredibly complex</i> and it&#x27;s entirely possible that someday someone will discover a way to get great mileage with low NOx emissions.  Maybe it&#x27;s pulsed injection, maybe it&#x27;s having more fuel injectors, maybe it&#x27;s even higher pressures, maybe it&#x27;s who knows what.  So just because you&#x27;re getting numbers that are better than your competitors doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that the people in your company <i>must</i> be cheating and that they need to be found out.

Something that is relatively cost-effective to throw up, but accommodates a decent number of people, and when built throughout a neighborhood will easily pass the critical thresholds for future services. Much of San Francisco is also built to 3 stories, and it&#x27;s one of the most dense areas in the country. It&#x27;s a geometry problem, as you point out - but also a cost problem. It&#x27;s cheaper to have mid-rises everywhere than a few high rises, and people find shorter constructions more humane on average. But the construction height isn&#x27;t the _only_ thing to worry about.<p>Land use in suburban areas is mostly premised on maximizing car traffic. That&#x27;s why we have the big six-lane streets and the huge parking lots with sad, small strips of grass separating everything. If we optimize for maximizing people movement over car movement, the streets get smaller and so do the parking lots; transit and bikes get more accommodation. Room opens up for more destinations, and you get more access at a lower average speed and energy consumption, further improving the land value - all just by changing the design requirements. Traditional cities are very energy-efficient.",1443062759

In fact it is so cheap to produce that you can use it as a loss leader for advertising job positions.<p>Why is this?  Your average software company runs their R&D department on about 10% of their earnings.  Yes, I pulled that number out of my nether regions, but in my experience that&#x27;s about right.  If you do a google search for R&D as a percentage of earnings, you will see lists for large companies that range anywhere from 2%-30%, but they tend to be on the lower side in my experience.<p>This means that for a software company to produce, package, market and sell a software product, they have to charge about 9x what it cost to produce it.  If we factor in profit, then we&#x27;re pretty close to an order of magnitude difference.<p>With open source software virtually all of that overhead disappears.  If you are writing software that you already needed anyway, then the cost is very low -- even if nobody contributes to the project from the outside.<p>With a traditional software sales model, you divide the cost over many customers.  So it might cost you $10 million to create and sell, but if you have 100,000 customers, you can charge $100 each and break even.  With an open source model, each actor builds pieces that they want and care about and uses other pieces for free.<p>The advantage to working with the open source model is that the overall cost is an order of magnitude lower because you cut out all the sales, marketing, support and associated management.  Not only that, but the pieces you pay for, you get to dictate exactly what they look like (within reason ;-) ).  So essentially, you are getting your software at a tenth the price and the bits you care about, you are getting custom made.<p>Of course, you usually have to spend time packaging and documenting, but this cost is quite low.  The reputation you get for doing it is often more than worth it (especially if you look at the cost of hiring recruiters).  It would be interesting to see a study to see if sponsoring popular open source projects leads to lower attrition for companies.  I suspect this is true, but have no data.<p>Of course, this sucks if you are in the business of selling software.  If you are in the business of selling services enabled by software, then open source is absolutely king.<p>Individuals still contribute quite a bit to open source projects and have their own internal drivers for doing so.

The last time I looked, the Linux kernel was about 75% funded through commercial entities.  On the web side of things, it&#x27;s actually getting difficult to find popular projects that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> mostly funded by one or more organizations.

Wouldn&#x27;t that be a little like saying high school algebra is closer to set theory than say abstract algebra?<p>To establish a correspondence between utility and the real world, I think it is worthwhile to acknowledge that an understanding of what predated currency has shifted away from barter economies and toward economies that traded influence and status. Or, similarly, take a look at this story from a few weeks ago[1], where the consistent theme to me seems that people&#x27;s behavior occurs within a context, and that anthropology might be as good a way to explain things as a highly simplified reward and punishment framework. That is, utility is maximized by acting consistent with your perceived identity as much as through projections of rewards from various choices.<p>So, while I don&#x27;t think the concept of utility by itself says that status and identity play the primary role, I also don&#x27;t think it is implausible.<p>And yet, you&#x27;re right that open source isn&#x27;t just hobbyists, and I doubt contributions from corporations contribute to prestige in any way that is valuable, so as you said:<p>>My guess is that open source software reduces the transaction costs of acquiring and fixing software for corporations [...] It should be a tragedy of the commons, but it isn&#x27;t.<p>— leaving us with a poorly understood phenomenon.

It&#x27;s exacerbated by the sometimes steep curb, so driver will turn left into the bike path at full speed, come to a complete stop perpendicular to bike traffic, and then slowly move into their parking lot or McDonald&#x27;s drive through too avoid scraping their undercarriage. It&#x27;s maddening how drivers seem to prioritize potential damage to their vehicles over the risk of killing someone.<p>The bike path is still new, though, so hopefully people learn to slow down and check their mirrors.",1443060877
