10158850,comment,10157651,10158551,0,0,e12e,,,"That&#x27;s my interpretation as well. It might be a bit of a stretch to label it as a &quot;forward-secure platform&quot;, as you can&#x27;t know anything about what the receiver will do with the mail/(session)keys.<p>As a <i>general system</i>, I don&#x27;t really see the attraction of forward secrecy for asynchronous, &quot;email-like&quot;, communication -- I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one that likes having a record of things I&#x27;ve said, or things others have said to me (good ideas, tips about everything from food to trips, not to mention the general &quot;letter&quot;-type things -- the stuff that can partially make up for not keeping a diary etc). The danger of being convicted for plotting to kill the president based on the contents of digital letters must be balanced against the historic value of having such records available for further students of history, so to speak.<p>But it just occurred to me that a system like looking glass could easily accommodate both: have the system automatically archive a copy of incoming and outgoing email, both encrypted to the (gpg-)key belong to the system owner. Such a system might retain &quot;cryptological&quot; plausible deny-ability (the owner, having the key, could fabricate a fake archive) -- but it would probably loose any &quot;legal&quot; equivalent. (eg: anyone can fake their browser history log files, but they&#x27;re still used as evidence etc).<p>It would be easy to automate what should be archived, and it would also remain possible to shred certain things from the archive, if wanted. It might even be possible to store an archive in a git-like fashion, so that it will be easy to see if something had been deleted -- while hard to prove that a certain deleted plain-text was <i>what</i> was deleted.<p>[ed: to add: To misquote a common Internet meme: &quot;I don&#x27;t <i>always</i> plan a revolution, but when I do, I use a forward-secure platform&quot;.

I was firmly interested in the continental side. Of those that left philosophy, I found that continental people would often end up in some kind of community-oriented area, like education or sociology or social work or the like, whereas on the analytic side, people tended to end up doing physics/maths/comp sci type stuff.<p>Ironically, I&#x27;m a comp-sci/math type person, and I regard continental philosophy a bunch better than analytic.  Continental philosophy usually considers matters inside their social and historical context, so at least sometimes, when they can be bothered to refer to the real world, they&#x27;re referring to it with a solid context.<p>Whereas analytic philosophy often seems to me to suffer from math-envy, and to formalize too early and too often.  The result is that analytic philosophers spend a lot of time debating over <i>what they think</i> are rigorous, scientifically-grounded concepts <i>when in fact</i> our best science says that things just don&#x27;t work that way or the theories aren&#x27;t &quot;done cooking&quot;.<p>(I&#x27;m thinking of a Stanford Philosophy Encyclopedia page someone directed me to last night on &quot;reductionism&quot;, which was given three definitions, <i>none</i> of which matched what a working scientist would usually call reductionism.  Or of the very concept of supervenience, which needs less metaphysics and more information theory.  Or of the perennial debates over the &quot;Hard Problem&quot; of consciousness.)",1441198060

Its interesting how many plotting packages get this wrong but are finally catching up.<p>I switched from Matlab to Python years ago and was sad to see pyplot using the default rainbow palette still. However, there was some good work done by Chris Beaumont to improve the plot quality. See: <a href=""http://plotornot.chrisbeaumont.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plotornot.chrisbeaumont.org/</a>  You can easily import these styles into matplotlib using rcparams.<p>Matlab is using a roughly perceptually linearly luminant colormap they call Parula now.  Good job Matlab.<p>Paulo Penteado has also done some good work in this area. See: <a href=""http://www.ppenteado.net/ast/csbc2012_pfp_2_pres.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppenteado.net/ast/csbc2012_pfp_2_pres.pdf</a><p>I want to talk about the Luv Lab colorspace.  There are several places on the net (even in the literature) that are wrong about these colorspaces saying Lab is for emissive displays and Luv is for reflected light.  This is actually not true.  (If anything it is reversed).  See: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scikit-image/DIRaSXJoEes/2jDwuwmxRTYJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scikit-image/DIRaSXJoEes/2jD...</a> and  Berns reference.<p>The interesting with colorspaces (and colormaps thereof) is that working in a perceptual space like Luv/Lab is yields a non-linear (and non-convex) gamut in the sRGB space used by most monitors.  There is more &quot;headroom&quot; in the magenta hue of colors than say green.  However, you have to then look at monitor output as a function of hue and human sensitivity -- with a red object and blue object with the same reflectance under the same illumination, the red object will appear darker to humans.  So there are many transfer functions at work here which makes the problem challenging in picking the right colormap that is perceptually uniform, has the maximum number of perceived differences, and has the appropriate number of hues for best represeting your dataset.<p>Finally, it would not be complete of me to not mention this article: <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4118486&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4118486"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=411848...</a><p>Slides: <a href=""http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/cs725s15/presentations/nam-presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/cs725s15/presentations/nam-pr...</a>",1441198017

It tends to fail spectacularly.<p>The main reason is that &quot;common sense&quot; is more a matter of culture than it is &quot;sense&quot;.

If someone disagrees, it practically begs ridicule because how can someone disagree with common sense?  And yet, it is also the thing we do not question.<p>&quot;Being an adult&quot; is very similar.  Adults have a code of conduct.  It is obvious.  For example you <i>don&#x27;t</i> belittle other people.  You don&#x27;t ignore to other points of view.  You don&#x27;t drink alcohol at lunch time during a work day.  You don&#x27;t show up to work late.  You don&#x27;t wear running shoes to the office.  You don&#x27;t act friendly to the cleaning staff (what if they got uppity?)

And both of those people will be adults.<p>Such a code of conduct will invite unbelievable flame wars in my experience, because you will have people naively thinking that everybody thinks the same way as they do.

This may create anxiety and a tightening in your stomach. This will then prevent you from taking action. The outcome of that is rationalisation thoughts such as &quot;I&#x27;ve got loads of time on this&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;ll just do it later&quot;, which then eases the emotional and physical responses, leading to you postponing the task and doing something else. This cycle will continue.<p>By being mindful of these thoughts and recording them, you can then begin to look at rational responses. So, for example, you might say &quot;I&#x27;m not good enough&quot; and then craft a written, rational response to it. You continue this until you have an uncertainty, where you can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s a rational response. You then create a practical plan of behavioural experiment to test it. This may include doing a small part of the task and seeking feedback to see if you&#x27;re on the right lines, as an example to not being sure if you have what it takes for the task.<p>Identifying these cycles and consciously taking steps to elimate them can probably do more than focus on any particular part of the cycle alone.",1441195578

Let us know how they&#x27;ve done in a year. I have been through times of extreme productivity and, well, the opposite in much shorter time spans. The difference being partially down to self-confidence, being aware of the reality of the results of the work and a mastery of stress levels. &#x27;The opposite&#x27; happens when stress and the resultant bad decision making creeps in. To me it&#x27;s the external factors in one&#x27;s life that mean that any single person can be both a procrastinator and an extremely productive &#x27;100x&#x27; person in the same year, month, week. When stressed or &#x27;temporally myopic&#x27; (as per the article) no amount of tools, widgets, hosts files or GTD schemes will work. They are all too easy to disable, workaround and ignore. The solution can not be quick-fixed, imho.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things myself over the decade-plus of working from home, currently even having my machine announce new Pomodoro sprints every 25 minutes (+5 minutes for break) to try to enforce a working atmosphere. It has an effect in that it at least generates the atmosphere, but it can have the opposite effect if external factors have already primed me for procrastination. Those factors can be tiredness, everyday life issues, being overworked, underworked, distracted etc. Any of which cause me to frequently ignore the espeak announcements. The cronjob that launches Anki every day gets equally ignored during these periods and they tend to start to bake in a habit of ignoring the automated reminders and thus the good habits for longer than I might have done without them.<p>All of which leads me to believe that self-motivation and constant reflective thought of one&#x27;s current and future situation (all with a confident and optimistic outlook) are the only ways to maintain a level of productivity approaching constant. Understanding that there isn&#x27;t a quick-fix, that effort must be exerted, anxieties must be overcome. Learning to cope with life&#x27;s external factors so that they don&#x27;t push your work off course. Those kinds of things seem like the real solutions to procrastination. And they are great personal challenges for many, myself included.<p>The irony of the length of my post on this subject is not lost on me, but then I have had a productive morning and this is my lunch break (sweet, sweet excuses...).",1441195304

I created a mastermind with other entrepreneurs and it helped enormously First, everybody has this &quot;problem&quot;. Second, you help other people and you help yourself.<p>Now I can make amazing things in very small amounts of time, and spend a lot of time reading-writting things that interest me, or stay with my family.<p>Basically what happens is that the human beings are flexible enough to do things no animal could do. But it comes at a price, no natural things require immense amounts of effort to do, even if trivial.<p>For example, most men could spend all day long hunting or fishing without problem, even if it is hard, rich people do that when they are free to do whatever they can. But plowing the earth or writing a book or programming are totally different.<p>When you do non natural things, odds are your body responds badly. For example, programming all day means you don&#x27;t exercise your inertial system. If you sit all day, your lymphatic system suffers a lot. There are hundreds of things like this. You don&#x27;t see any of this, you only know that you try to work and your body says NO!! You try to force it, but the situation worsens and your body will tell you NO WAY even stronger.<p>My cofounder died in his twenties by cancer trying to work harder. He forced himself so much into work that he got weaker and weaker before getting cancer. No sleep, no exercise, bad food. We know today that eating well, exercise and sleep is essential for your immune system.<p>Anyone that offers you an easy solution, he is BS. It requires effort and time to learn how to control yourself, but it is probably the best investment you could do in your entire life.<p>Probably the best practical book on the issue is &quot;the Now Habit&quot;.

For example in online retail, seperate microservices for Customers, Products (catalog), Product reviews and Orders might be a feasible distribution of responsibility, functionality and data.<p>Note that there&#x27;s always a catch in going from a monolithic application to one with a more distributed nature. Distribution of data requires data synchronization and results in integration challenges, because of the unreliability and higher latency of networks.<p>Lastly, Martin Fowler c.s. wrote some nice articles on microservices: <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/tags/microservices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/tags/microservices.html</a>. That will help as well.",1441195270

You can get about a factor of 1000 in the compression -- 1MB of &#x27;a&#x27; winds up being about 1040 bytes. You can have multiple itxt chunks, and it appears that the chunk size is only limited to 2^31-1.<p>See <a href=""https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/master/Tests/check_png_dos.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/master/Tests/ch...</a> for a quick way to generate some of these.",1441195261

It is an interesting twist to have the players front the real world cash.<p>As an aside, I always dreamed of playing the game I read about.  One of the cool things about the game was that your character continued in the game as an NPC when you were offline.  I always thought this would be very interesting way to have player generated content, where they would have to build defences to protect their player/gold while offline.  Other players could launch raids to try to steal it.  No one has ever built a similar kind of PK system that doesn&#x27;t piss everyone off, but for me it&#x27;s a kind of holy grail of MMO functionality.  I hope I see it before I die :-)",1441195217
