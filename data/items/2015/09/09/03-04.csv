Even in an almost perfectly modular system, you need generalists sitting on the borders.<p>Take the case of a product that consists of a back end API, a single page web app, and a mobile app. Who do you want designing the API? I think ideally the answer is someone who has some experience with all the systems involved.<p>I&#x27;ve been on teams where the back end guys designed the data model and the API and forced the front end to conform to that. And I&#x27;ve been on teams where the front end team ran the show--in my opinion neither situation is optimal.<p>> this means that an expert (someone who is specialized) is always able to crush a FSDev in his own field of expertise. So, FSDevs are always the rookies in all fields, compared to specialized devs.<p>I think there&#x27;s a few different things to say here. First, I think most teams aren&#x27;t really made up of experts. Mostly because most teams can&#x27;t afford to be made up of experts, and because most teams probably don&#x27;t need that many experts.<p>Second, there is a huge amount of overlap in most developer roles, so a lot of experience in one role transitions very well to other roles.<p>Third, most good generalist developers probably have some field that they actually are experts in. You&#x27;ve probably heard the term &quot;T shaped developers&quot;. Their field of expertise might even be something like domain knowledge or management.<p>And finally, for most developers, there is a limit to how specialized you can become. To have along successful career in software development you can&#x27;t afford to become completely specialized. If you plan on writing software for 40 years or more, you&#x27;re probably not going to be a Rails specialist for the entire time.<p>In the end, I think a good team requires a decent mix of specialists and generalists to function well.<p>*usually misattributed to Stalin",1441770669

Even if football athletes could go straight from high school to college as in basketball and baseball, college football will still be a huge moneymaker, and the athletes will remain broke.<p>Actually, this solves a lot of problems.

If you&#x27;re 18, insanely talented and want to go to the NFL, you don&#x27;t have to waste everyone&#x27;s time pretending to be a student for 3 years.

These people put their bodies on the line for 4 years and serious, life-long injuries can be sustained. In the event that a player is hurt in this way, they should receive compensation (an annuity, to ensure it lasts their entire lifetime). Insurance seems like a good way to handle this.<p>2) Financial education. This works for both the 2% that go on to professional careers and the 98% that don&#x27;t. What goes along with being broke is not having basic financial skills like budgeting or even opening a bank account. There&#x27;s a reason that the majority of professional players are broke only a few years after retirement despite making millions during their playing careers. ESPN&#x27;s documentary, Broke, did a good job of dissecting it, but the moment that left the biggest impression on me was when one player admitted to taking his $500k signing bonus to a check cashing store.<p>I agree with you about creating a minor league instead of using colleges, but it will never happen. The two popular college sports are the ones where the pro league has no minor league (the D-League is a very recent development, so it remains to be seen whether it survives.) Baseball and Hockey have minor leagues and neither is popular. The college equivalent is also unpopular. But Football and Basketball have found a way to put an inferior product on the field/court and make it incredibly popular/lucrative. It&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;d be able to replicate that success with a minor league.<p>So given that the current setup is too profitable to discontinue, I think the only conscionable thing to do is to give athletes who don&#x27;t pass the admissions process an alternate education. Paying them will, for the vast majority, not make them well off given what we see of athletes paid in the professional leagues. Paying them in a practical education that prepares them to make the most of what they do have once their fame expires with their athletic eligibility seems more appropriate and maintains the mystique of the amateur athlete.<p>Also, as an aside, I think Universities and football programs are missing a huge opportunity. Football coaches should be required to teach a course in the spring in football theory. As it is now, the only people who become Football coaches are ex-players. But Universities have access to some of the brightest minds in the country and most would love to learn about Football. Offering elective courses could open up the coaching field to a much wider field and make teams much more successful. We saw what happened when the Baseball nerds were allowed to influence how players were valued (Moneyball)...there&#x27;s no reason to believe that bright and motivated Math/CS nerds couldn&#x27;t do the same to other sports as well. From analyzing the tendencies of opposing teams using statistical analysis to designing new plays based on computer simulations, we have the tools today to revolutionize these sports if we&#x27;re only allowed access to their insular communities.",1441769646

That solution is to get out of the business of athletics.  If you are not a &quot;power 5&quot; program or one of the top NCAA D-I basketball programs, athletics is a money-loser.  The UAB debacle provides a pretty good case study in why this is so: there are only a handful of universities that the system will allow to make any money.  So what looks like one problem is really two: first, the employee-athletes at the major athletic programs aren&#x27;t being paid, and they should be.  But the flip side of the coin is that many of the same retarded rules that harm those employees are being applied to people playing sports at much smaller programs, where they are not at all profitable and there is essentially zero chance that anyone is ever going to make their career as a major league athlete.  That&#x27;s the second problem.<p>The solution to the first problem is complex.  It starts with paying your employees.  But there&#x27;s more to it than that: something has to be done about the fiction that those employees are fundamentally students.  They&#x27;re not.  Scandal after scandal shows every trick and dodge in the book is and will continue to be used to keep functionally illiterate players off the academically ineligible list and on the field.  It would be healthier, if these schools insist on keeping their highly profitable athletic programs, to partner with the NBA and NFL (baseball doesn&#x27;t really have this problem) to transition their status to minor league affiliates.  In the process, they could also cut the sanctimonious and absurd NCAA out of the game.  No more scandals, no more bullshit.  But it&#x27;s going to take some work to get from here to there.<p>The solution to the second problem is very simple.  For the other 95%, no more NCAA rules (they&#x27;re designed for the big-money programs to deceive themselves, not for the others).  No more TV, period.  Not that most of them are ever on TV anyway, except for the one or two games a year they volunteer to be slaughtered by far superior competition to fund the rest of their season (in games which, for no conceivable reason, actually count for both teams!).  No more licensing.  If they want to sell merchandise, they can sell it at the campus bookstore.  Not like any of them are making millions from Amazon or Foot Locker anyway.  Above all else, no more &quot;athletic scholarships&quot;, a profound contradiction in terms hardly anyone ever ponders long enough to recognize.<p>That means no more pressure, no more extended seasons, and no more faux students hanging around in hopes of transferring to a big-money program so they can get their shot at the big time.  If you want to play intercollegiate sports, fine.  But the reason those academic standards that are so low yet somehow impossible for the big guys to meet without cheating exist in the first place is to prevent students who don&#x27;t have time for a hobby from being distracted from their studies.  Raise them, high.  If you don&#x27;t have at least a 3.25, you have no business doing anything but studying.  And without the pressure of having to maintain your &quot;athletic scholarship&quot;, why should you?<p>No more games against hopelessly superior competition.  You&#x27;ll play against other teams of full-time students with no funding for fancy uniforms and gleaming locker rooms, at a simple gym or on a field shared with 8 other teams next to a single set of bleachers.  High school baseball teams don&#x27;t play against AA clubs; there&#x27;s no excuse for pay-for-play in other sports, either.  If you can&#x27;t fund your athletic programs through student fees, they get cut.  Simple as that.  But stop pretending that &quot;student athletics&quot;, a huge money loser and waste of time and energy, is a necessary part of your institutional identity, or that it &quot;builds character&quot;.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with intercollegiate athletics as a hobby, a diversion, another way to network, and a way to stay in shape while you study.  But that&#x27;s all it is.  Don&#x27;t let the tail wag the dog.<p>Because as bad as the futile aspiration of making a major-league professional club is for the 98% who never will, the small schools (or large schools with small athletic programs) forced to play by the same rules as the big boys are in exactly the same spot.  The first step is admitting that you&#x27;re not competitive and never will be.  Once you&#x27;ve done that, a whole world of refreshingly decent options opens up.",1441768888
