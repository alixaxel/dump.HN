It&#x27;s actually pretty easy to deal with cases like this... At the end of the day, you just end up having to code for both the case where the list matches the size requirements of the code you want to call and the case where it doesn&#x27;t. For example, you could pass the unsized list to a function which performs validation of its actual runtime size, returning, e.g., an `Option[List[Int] @@ MinSize[_5]]` (if I may use Scala-speak). You&#x27;d then have to handle both the case where the `Option` is a `Some` and the case where it&#x27;s a `None`. Ultimately, it ends up being extremely similar to checked exceptions: you are simply forced to write code to handle all cases, rather than writing code that allows some of them to blow up at runtime (while telling yourself &quot;that case could never happen in the real world&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s an edge case, we&#x27;ll just ignore it&quot;).",1443595597

10302187,comment,10300369,10300369,0,0,veidr,,,"I think the key point here (which the author kind of dances around) is that walking puts you in a different kind of mental mode.

I felt like it <i>did</i> make me smarter. Or at least, better at programming and writing.<p>I now commute by bicycle, and I think that is somewhere on the spectrum between driving and walking. But even on a bicycle, you have to be in &quot;collision avoidance mode&quot; pretty much continuously. Your mind still wanders -- but with a lot more interruptions and alerts.<p>I think there is something &quot;magic&quot; about walking -- by which I mean something great, but something that we may not be able to scientifically understand in my lifetime.

I would support an attempt to increase voter turn-out if it would improve policies and outcomes, but there is little evidence of this; in fact, the current evidence shows that current voters are better informed and more intelligent than eligible non-voters.[1]  Before you accuse me of being an anti-democratic autocrat or something of that sort, please keep in mind that I am not advocating the abolishment of elections, that I used to agree with you (but was persuaded to change my mind), and have voted at every election I am eligible for since reaching the age of majority.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter</a>",1443593098

</code></pre>
But what makes you think you need dependent types to do full specification and verification of a program? Instead you could use program logic. Write the program in any language you like and later, when it the program is finished verifiy that it meets its specification using program logic. This separates programming from verification completely. In my opinion this is the future of certified programming. Dependent types are too heavyweight to support any conventional programming process.<p>Another advantage is that unlike Curry-Howard based verification, program logic does not have to be constructive, instead you can use classical reasoning with excluded middle. This tends to yield shorter proofs.<p>See Microsoft&#x27;s Daphny [1] or CFML [2] for prototype tool chains implementing program logic based verification. Facebook&#x27;s infer tool [3], while not allowing full verification, is also based on program logic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dafny"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dafny</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/cfml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/cfml</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/infer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/infer</a>",1443593018
