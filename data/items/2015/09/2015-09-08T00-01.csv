Distracted momentarily, sometimes, perhaps, but not disabled - city driving is <i>replete</i> with &quot;bits of spray paint&quot; and &quot;funny sounds&quot; and sometimes &quot;women wearing short skirts.&quot; On average, human drivers manage a great deal of complexity without incident. We use the same visual acuity, adaptability and instincts to negotiate traffic as we did millennia ago to avoid predators and survive our climb up the food chain, and we&#x27;re actually quite good at it, albeit obviously not perfect. Human drivers are capable of not mistaking the reflections of other cars <i>for other cars,</i> and know the difference between a cardboard box, a human being and another vehicle.<p>The bar is actually quite high, if you want to do better than humans <i>on average</i>.",1441673950

I also have a large number of friends from the scene as well.<p>That&#x27;s fine if you believe that, but it is possible to be a winning live player and not use tells. Tells being used are more anecdotes than typical situations that come up.<p>At live poker, the number of hands ranges from 15 to 30 per hour. Most hands don&#x27;t go to showdown, so you simply never get the information you need. Unless you are playing higher stakes with a smaller player pool, or a small home game, you may not have the same opponent at your table for a long time even if they&#x27;re a regular.<p>Giving off tells assumes that opponents are perceptive enough to notice, or naive enough to fall for overly obviously tells. This is asking too much for a lot of weaker opponents. And most people won&#x27;t be involved in the hand and paying attention.<p>The most useful &quot;tells&quot; may not even qualify as such. They&#x27;re usually weak or bad players trying their hand at bad acting in a way that tends to be obvious after you&#x27;ve played enough.<p>You also run into the problem that even amateurs can familiarize themselves with tells and try giving off &quot;reverse tells&quot; which reduces it to a game of &quot;leveling&quot;.<p>Most of the time the best decision is irrelevant of whatever behavior an opponent is perceived to be exhibiting. If I&#x27;m following through on a bluff against an opponent on a flush draw (comes 35% of the time if they see the turn and river), and their draw comes in and they sigh &quot;guess I&#x27;m beat&quot; and shove into me on the river, I can&#x27;t call with ten-high.",1441673748

It&#x27;s the most popular Common Lisp package manager and has over 1200 open source libraries in it, and most of them are written in Common Lisp, or are bindings to native C/C++ libraries.  Using libraries written in the same language you&#x27;re using has a lot of advantages.  Using Java libraries from a Lisp seems clunky.<p>Also, judging solely by the number of available packages is not a good measurement.  Browse through NPM, and it&#x27;s pretty obvious there are a LOT of duplicates, and that people have published libraries for the silliest little things.  Search for &quot;PNG&quot;, for example, and in the first page of results there are two different png diff libraries, a few libraries for determining if a buffer contains a PNG byte-stream, multiple stream and un-stream libraries, etc.  That&#x27;s all done with a single library in CL.<p>And finally, I don&#x27;t think Clojure is that great.  It&#x27;s better than Java, and it&#x27;s what I&#x27;d use if I had a lot of legacy Java code to work with, but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice for a new project written in Lisp.

Plenty of companies already censor certain content without accepting liability for parts that they miss.

It&#x27;s called &#x27;projecting&#x27; from 3D to 2D.<p>The projection used for the underlying map here is the Mercator, which stretches everything near the poles. It makes Greenland look almost as big as Africa, which it is not. It&#x27;s the most common projection, but it&#x27;s awful for accurately visualising the whole world at once.<p>But the Mercator is actually a really good projection for stuff like Google Maps, because it keeps shape and direction  (not scale) accurate all over the world. Say you zoom into Iceland and then Ecuador... OK you&#x27;ll need a different zoom level to get to the same real-world scale (e.g. to get to 10 miles per inch you need to zoom in closer to Ecuador than Iceland) but who cares. What matters is that, in either location, north is pretty much straight up, east is right, south is down and west is left. And also, a 10 mile road going east–west will look about the same length as a 10 mile road going north–south.<p>Other projections don&#x27;t have these qualities, but are better for keeping overall scale the same all over the map, making relative sizes of countries look more like what you get on a 3-D globe.

This is the case in most startups that take a traditional business (e.g. Taxi) and modernise it (e.g. uber). The level of tech required to do that is not going to be cutting edge. It is quite rote to solve these things in RoR or PHP.<p>On the other hand there may be some startups where the choice of language really matters. One thing I can think of is how a lot of Enterprise software is a big feature fest with massive complicatedness coming from a mixture of the real-world muckiness of the problem, and poor architectural choices. Such shops require armies of programmers to maintain their bloated wares. Maybe a startup with a much more thoughtful approach, using a Lisp/Haskell/etc. type language and a small number of developers can have a big competitive advantage.<p>Customer &quot;we need a new feature&quot;.
