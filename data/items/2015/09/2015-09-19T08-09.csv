10243750,comment,10238109,10240298,0,0,roel_v,,,"(thanks and I agree with you, don&#x27;t get the rest of my post wrong)<p>Air gapping is not feasible for situations like this in 2015 imo, I mean not for &#x27;medium security&#x27; situations like this. For example you&#x27;d want to integrate it with the rest of a home automation system, which you&#x27;d want to integrate with various online services (weather data, calendars, ip cams, not to mention access from the outside & automatic upgrades). Of course you can build all sorts of &#x27;more secure bridges&#x27; and all, but it&#x27;s just a hobby, I don&#x27;t want to turn this into a job to maintain - and for mainstream roll-out, such setups are even less feasible.<p>I mean I understand what you say, my point is that I think that we&#x27;ve moved beyond that - we need to assume for applications that are not life-or-death that they will be internet-connected, and in most situations we also need to assume that they&#x27;re hostile; nobody can &#x27;know&#x27; at any point in time what is <i>really</i> going on in their machines and on their networks in 2015 (again, in situations where you don&#x27;t have whole teams whose 24/7 job it is to monitor and be proactive).<p>This seems in contrast with my original question of course :) , but I was more getting at novel approaches to &#x27;security mitigation&#x27; - which is vague to the point of useless but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t even know how to begin solving this for our current age, hence my question. Much like 10 years ago nobody knew about the blockchain and its applications, and some problems that seemed impossible to solve (not just &#x27;technically hard&#x27;, but &#x27;impossible&#x27;) maybe aren&#x27;t that &#x27;impossible&#x27; any more now.<p>I&#x27;ve devolved into rambling and I&#x27;m not expecting that someone drops the Big Revelation of the 21st century into my lap in a HN comment either, of course, so I&#x27;ll just stop typing now :)",1442653158

10243741,comment,10243011,10243511,0,0,Asbostos,,,"Epsilons are almost worse than the floating point errors they try to solve! Now you have to work out a safe epsilon that&#x27;ll always work and you create even more edge cases. A lot of the programming I do involved numbers that the user inputs, so I can&#x27;t hard code an epsilon because they might enter 1e-10 and break it. Luckily though, a lot of algorithms and formulas can be reformulated so they either don&#x27;t do = comparisons or if they do, it doesn&#x27;t matter which case comes out when the two operands are very similar.<p>I think of floating point numbers as being good for representing real world quantities - things you can measure with an instrument. It never matters if you read 1.2999999999993 instead of 1.3 because every practical instrument is less accurate than that anyway. If you start needing to test for equality, that&#x27;s a sign something&#x27;s wrong in your design. You can never measure two lengths with a ruler in real life and check if they&#x27;re equal. So maybe you should be using integers instead, or maybe you don&#x27;t really need equality.<p>Your point 3 about rounding issues with addition disappears if you think of the value as being a physical measurement. You just don&#x27;t care about those errors because they are always insignificant.<p>Isn&#x27;t the problem with floats for money more a problem with the conventions of accountants? By rounding everything to 2 decimal places, they&#x27;re obviously creating far more error than double precision&#x27;s ~16 places. They just tolerate their specific type of error by convention.",1442652933

10243737,comment,10243101,10243399,0,0,philwelch,,,"> If you look, at least at American music culture since the beginning of the industrial age, you&#x27;ll see cycles of people seeking authenticity (the beats, hippies, hip-hop, grunge, etc). Generally, that authenticity gives birth to some consumable form, such as the stuff that passes for hip-hop nowadays, as well as the &quot;corporate grundge&quot; of the 90s. I&#x27;m not as familiar with other eras, but I understand authenticity to be a huge point of critique w/r/t 60s pop culture.<p>I think this is the beginning of understanding what is so loathsome about hipsters. Hipsters are some awful Hegelian synthesis of the impulse towards authenticity and the culture of irony. Hipsters mostly express the urge for authenticity as a type of consumerism, but then immediately undermine authenticity through their commitment to irony.",1442652783

Good on you for implementing it nicely for scikit-learn, benchmarking it, and making the code available.<p>I did something similar a few years ago when using a random forest as a heuristic to speed-up some minimax game tree search code. I don&#x27;t think I still have the python scripts used to generate the compiled code (no great loss, they would have been terrible throwaway code) but amusingly enough I still have an example of a compiled random forest:<p>(warning: link #2 is a ~44k line cpp file of gotos encoding 50 compiled decision trees)<p><pre><code>    1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcostin/hangman_cpp/master/forest.h

This probably isn&#x27;t the fastest possible encoding of a bunch of decision trees, but it was pretty quick.<p>(II) On a different note, the article states &quot;Another point that some might find a concern is that random forest models are black boxes that are very hard to interpret.&quot;. Well, yes and no. Decision trees are pretty easy to interpret -- you can always pick out one of the decision trees and look at it.<p>If one is interested in learning more about random forests I&#x27;d recommend taking a look at these notes from Breiman and Cutler (the folks responsible for the algorithm!): <a href=""https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home...</a><p>E.g. they discuss &quot;variable importance&quot; measures, as featured in the original R version of randomForest. There are a bunch of tools built around random forests for extracting some insight beyond the raw predictions, to aid interpretation! Use them! <a href=""https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#varimp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home...</a><p>(III) Final comment: the article doesn&#x27;t mention the Bayesian interpretation of ensembling a bunch of statistical models together. That&#x27;s another potentially insightful way of thinking about why the method might be effective, and isn&#x27;t limited to decision trees.",1442652408
