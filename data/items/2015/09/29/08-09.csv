Terrestrial microbes have evolved in an utterly brutal competitive environment and they&#x27;ve been shown to adapt to extreme conditions, so it&#x27;s not unthinkable that they may have a substantial edge over martian life.<p>Maybe.

They can take a stool sample and if necessary, refer you for a colonoscopy.<p>You can be sedated for the colonscopy if you don&#x27;t like the idea of being awake for it under a local. You normally get a dose of Propofol injected into you (like Michael Jackson) and you wake up feeling refreshed and slightly pissed off that the nurse dared to wake you up from your beautiful embracing slumber. The procedure really isn&#x27;t as bad as you think it is going to be. The preparation for it is much worse (not painful, just unpleasant).<p>You will then know for certain whether or not you have a really nasty cancer problem, or just plain old piles.

Although what I&#x27;m going to say may sound like a joke, it isn&#x27;t meant to be one: Our society does not have enough (or any kind of) psychological resilience testing. Currently all of us are allowed to take any kind of risks regardless of the capacity for risk-bearing and its consequences. All of us want the cherry on the top of the cake and therefore jump at it, even the ones of us that do not feel competitive enough. That is reckless, and the consequences of immature decisions then falls on the rest of society which will have to deal with the broken ones. Yes, the education may be too damaging than it has to be and if so an attention in this regard is welcomed, but there also should be a better selection of candidates.

10295166,comment,10290793,10294805,0,0,dsfsdfd,,,"Hmm, I&#x27;m not so sure. For two reasons: If we assume that life naturally arises when light is shone at rocks for long enough then we might assume that life on mars would have an independent origin. However, this does not necessarily mean that life there will have orthogonal biochemistry. It may be that the biochemistry we observe on earth is the biochemistry most likely to emerge in a wide range of environments.<p>On the other side we should consider the possibility that space is porous to life. That life is able to travel between bodies or on bodies that pass through the vacuum of space. In this case we should expect that while there may be independent origins of life, within relatively short distances a certain kind of biochemistry might come to dominate.<p>Add to this the quite important role that exogenous organic chemicals likely played in the emergence of life on earth, in the case where life arose here and on mars independently. It is probably more likely that life would emerge through roughly the same processes wherever it emerges, therefore in roughly similar environments and using roughly the same building blocks (organic molecules constructed in space and deposited through impacts) we might expect it to have similar forms. I would say that Titan is likely to have something entirely different to earth life - owing to it&#x27;s very different environment...",1443515477

Imagine taking a portrait of 3 people in low-light by exposing a 1 second film (maybe including a couple of flashes). The processor then works (very hard) to build together single frame in which everyone&#x27;s eyes are open, the moving subjects are frozen and sharp, and the shadow detail is pulled from the dark background by averaging out the noise from the thousands of frames.<p>I think the accelerometer should be used to trace the movement during this exposure, which can be used in combination with the anti-shake blur removal algorithms which are being introduced into various programs now.<p>Add to this some other technologies like deep learning that can be used to &quot;guess&quot; what&#x27;s in a region of an image where we have noisy, obscured or OOF data.<p>I&#x27;m optimist, I think we will see not better classical images, but just better images.

It would not be at all shocking to see other forms of life based on very familiar machinery. But if there were different details here and there, that too would also not be surprising.<p>Additionally, electrochemical gradients as a means of storing and using energy, and amphiphilic bilayer based membranes both seem to be incredibly fundamental, it would be more surprising to see life that was based on other principles than to see life that shared the same design. As for everything else, who knows? It&#x27;s likely there are a ton of alternative design choices for a lot of different aspects of cellular machinery on up to large scale structures of plants, animals, fungi, etc.<p>But overall I&#x27;d rate some of the more &quot;out there&quot; notions of things like silicon or sulfur based life, or merely carbon-based life that was utterly different from our nucleic acid/protein/membrane based life as being comparatively unlikely.",1443514725

That&#x27;s saying hosts only charge 1.7X more per night than they would get from a roommate or tenant. That&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>A quick search on AirBnB shows rooms in my neighborhood going for $130-230. That&#x27;s $4k-7K/month for a room fully booked. A quick search on Craigslist shows roommates wanted for $1200-2200. That&#x27;s about a 3X markup, nearly double what Airbnb claims.<p>That matches anecdotally what I hear a lot. People are increasingly preferring to AirBnB rooms instead of seeking roommates. They get more money and/or have more control over their space. No getting stuck with a crazy roommate, no overnight guests, you can have the place to yourself when you want, etc. This takes housing stock off the residential market and moves it to the more attractive tourist market. It&#x27;s similar when you look at entire apartments too and the incentives to hold onto them and Airbnb them after you&#x27;ve really moved out, instead of letting new residents move in.<p>So the 75 day limit that Prop F proposes is much better targeted at changing those economics than the current 120 day limit (which is not very enforceable anyway). That means you&#x27;d have to charge 5X to break even vs. a long term rental, which is too much. So it only makes sense to AirBnB rooms/units that really would never go onto the long term market anyway.",1443514356
