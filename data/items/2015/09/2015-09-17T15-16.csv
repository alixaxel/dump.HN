I&#x27;d much rather get my advice from EFF&#x27;s Surveillance Self-Defense or TTC&#x27;s Security In-a-Box because they&#x27;re online and can be updated easily if a critical bug is discovered with any given popular privacy or security software. Capabilities change over time and when they do, you can&#x27;t update a book as easy as you can update a website. If someone relies on this books&#x27; recommendations and think that they&#x27;re secure when they&#x27;re not for whatever reason, that&#x27;s incredibly harmful.<p>Reading the overview though, the book is also seems to be about history of obfuscation and protesting laws (?) so I guess it could be useful for people who&#x27;re seeking that information, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this or any book that acts like a tutorial to someone who&#x27;s trying to learn more about online privacy.",1442505590

This is a big change and I&#x27;m sure a huge amount of work went into making this happen.<p>I wonder what this says about the company&#x27;s focus. They started out focused on payroll, with the BI press release saying they had 20k customers out of millions of small businesses. So obviously a lot more to be done and they are off to a good start. Which raises a few questions:<p>Do they consider payroll &quot;solved&quot;? Payroll seems to be a pretty massive problem with as much to be done as when they started.<p>What are they bringing that Zenefits doesn&#x27;t? Zenefits does payroll and benefits as well, so if you are going to take them on directly I would have hoped to see a lot more about differentiators.<p>On the one hand, very exciting. On the other, I&#x27;d be worried that they are letting a huge competitor drive their actions. Payroll (to an outside) still seems to have massive potential.",1442505533

So this near-consensus is useless in practical terms. The arguments always start over which other things that are not equal should affect one&#x27;s decisions, and which shouldn&#x27;t.<p>For example, take Singer&#x27;s classic analogy between saving a drowning child at the cost of ruining your clothes, and donating to charity to save a child in a faraway country at the cost of some luxuries. Obviously a lot of things are not &quot;equal&quot; between these two scenarios, but Singer is claiming that none of those things matter: if you would save a drowning child at the cost of ruining your clothes, you should forgo luxuries to donate to charity.<p>But Singer ignores one glaring thing that is not equal, and which, IMO, does affect the choice you should make: drowning children are rare. That&#x27;s why we have a moral consensus that we should save them even if it costs us a ruined set of clothes. If there were drowning children all over the place, and everyone was always having to drop what they were doing and save them and ruin their clothes and have to buy new ones, all the time, we would not have the same consensus. Instead, we would be asking why there are so many drowning children around, and would be taking different actions to prevent them from being at risk of drowning in the first place.<p>But that&#x27;s exactly the position we are in with respect to world poverty. Poverty is not rare; historically, it has been the normal condition of almost all human beings who have ever lived. Those of us who are fortunate enough not to be in poverty cannot afford to treat it as if it were a rare emergency like a drowning child, because it&#x27;s not rare, it&#x27;s common. (It&#x27;s hard for people who live in the developed world to see this because what defines the &quot;developed&quot; world is precisely that poverty, real poverty, is <i>not</i> common. In the US, for example, a &quot;poor&quot; person typically has enough food--in fact, too much, since a major health issue for the poor in the US is obesity--some form of shelter, access to public transportation, a cell phone, and an internet connection. That is not &quot;poverty&quot; by any reasonable historical definition--it certainly isn&#x27;t compared to the condition of people in, say, sub-Saharan Africa. There are people in the US who are in real poverty by this definition, but they are very rare, so it&#x27;s hard for people in the US to realize how common real poverty is elsewhere.)<p>So if we are going to fix poverty, we can&#x27;t do it by helping individual poor people, one at a time. We have to fix it by asking why it is so common in the first place.",1442504783

Also, with sufficient growth and power, the very laws themselves can be bent to legitimize past and current actions.<p>Criminal organizations also utilize principles of decentralization as a scaling strategy. There are elaborate transfer of power rituals, some resembling democratic processes and others not.<p>The goal of any criminal organization is to become larger and more powerful, but there are extra spoils due to premium prices for black market endeavors.  Criminal organizations seize opportunities where laws exist but are poorly enforced... or in other words, where there is no de facto prohibition against black/gray market activity (such as the tens of thousands of asian massage brothels in the US).<p>With additional revenue comes better propaganda and the freedom to clean up the organization&#x27;s image.

That understanding actually encourages politicians to overreact, in the belief that they are playing a vital constitutional role. It also encourages complacency, because a system that rights itself requires no painful compromises to preserve.&quot;<p>The problem the author points out with the American constitution is not that we have deadlock, and then we must compromise to get around that deadlock. The problem the author points out is that we can get deadlock, and the system itself has no recovery mechanism for bad actors; deadlock makes it possible for the entire system to collapse.
