Not that more respected publications haven&#x27;t been trying them--just with tighter controls over the advertisers (perhaps via direct sales only).<p>Affiliates are all over these as expected, and if they can make it work, then that says something because affiliates operate on crap margins and have many other challenges.<p>That said, there&#x27;s almost certainly a significant amount of dollars in there from companies just testing it because you need to constantly be testing new traffic sources and approaches.  In fact, I always recommend companies carve out a test budget that they can just consider wasted, and if it happens to perform or they learn something, then it usually pays off in spades.<p>There are always those that are less savvy and tossing money away on wasted impressions.

Google Analytics offers some great attribution tools for free if you&#x27;re interested in checking those out.<p>Beyond that, static models have their weaknesses, so dynamic models such as the data-driven model in Google Analytics Premium are a nice step up.  There are other solutions that handle this too such as VisualIQ, Adometry, Convertro, etc.  Those were all recently acquired by Google, and others btw.<p>Then there is software that attempts to help you model incremental lift in addition to dynamic attribution models.  I just demoed Adobe&#x27;s econometric modeling tool in their Adobe Analytics package (that feature set might be in the higher-level version) and that was about the closest I&#x27;ve seen to date for doing it the way I consider the &quot;right&quot; way (ie. user-path level attribution and modeling for incremental lift using literally whatever external data you can feed into it).<p>I&#x27;m an ad tech nerd so let me know if you have any other questions.",1441690788
10184238,comment,10179775,10179775,0,0,superuser2,,,"I&#x27;m not a fan of this trend of presuming causes for suicides. The brain is an incredibly complex system with many failure modes, and some of them are just <i>weird</i>. You don&#x27;t necessarily posses the hardware to begin to comprehend what a particular suicide victim experienced, which is not to say you shouldn&#x27;t try, but humility is appropriate.<p>People project their pet social critiques onto the youth suicide rate. I&#x27;ve heard everything from high-stakes testing to too much Instagram to the rise of atheism to too little punishment. In the context of statistics this might be an appropriate national conversation. In the context of a specific person, speculation on a cause beyond what they&#x27;ve written is patronizing at best.<p>The only generalization I&#x27;m willing to make about a suicide is that the subjective experience of being inside the person&#x27;s head was excruciatingly painful for too long. This kind of pain is probably not a scalar quantity across individuals, so ideas of normal and abnormal tolerance for it may not even make sense. Perception of time is also subjective, so don&#x27;t think you can judge &quot;too long&quot; either. There is probably a 16-year-old who has struggled for 3 years with an experience that would have killed you in a week, just as someone has probably killed themselves to escape pain you would have considered trivial.<p>There may not <i>be</i> a truthy-sounding causal story for the origin of that pain, even for its victim. If they had one, even wrote it down, it might have been an explanation they latched on to but not the root cause, which may be as complex as the sum total of a lifetime of experiences or as banal as chemistry.<p>I hope that we as a culture can show some respect for the dead and the complexity of their experiences, and stop using them as soapboxes for our ideas of what&#x27;s wrong with kids these days.",1441690682

I was wondering if they meant EU or the continent and whether only since last exit or since I left home (since they were holding my non-European passport), and no exact correct answers were coming to mind for any of the possibilities, I was tired, wondering why didn&#x27;t they just read the stamps in the passport if they cared so much, I wasn&#x27;t prepared to get a grilling just to check in for my flight, and OH NO I&#x27;M HESITATING I LOOK LIKE SUSPICIOUS WHAT&#x27;S GOING TO HAPPEN?!?  Well, I muddled through with vague hesitant answers that may have even been contradictory because of my uncertainty.  Anyway, despite a really cringey performance from me, I guess they were satisfied that I wasn&#x27;t knowingly or unknowingly carrying drugs/bombs (seemed to be the main concerns), because they gave me my ticket and I went through the real security and passport control which IIRC was nowhere near as invasive.<p>I guess they can tell the difference between a socially-anxious perfectionist stressing about giving correct answers and a liar stressing about giving false answers... or the airline is wasting their money by giving this &quot;interview&quot; but ignoring really sketchy answers.  Or maybe I did not appear as suspicious as I thought.<p>Another time I casually broke eye contact with a bus security officer while he was rattling off  prohibited items and searching my bag.  I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes I subconsciously prefer to focus by looking down and maybe turning an ear toward someone talking about something detailed like this, but this guy seemed to interpret it as a sign that he&#x27;d just said something that was in my bag and shouldn&#x27;t be.

That narrows the search space considerably.<p>Whenever you donate DNA to a large DNA aggregating project, you can be fairly trivially re-identified via a few ways. Even if you control all the other information, if a relative contributes DNA, your match will be close enough to narrow it down to a few relatives (including you).
