If you want more than 12 hours backup you need to double again.  If you want 48 hours backup you need 4x production and storage.  The numbers get quite unfeasible quite quickly.  You cannot have an energy generation system that is unable to cope with a multi-day weather event, right when you need it to be producing energy.<p>As a load following, top-up power source for peak daytime usage, or for charging storage based devices like cars, it&#x27;s great.  But you cannot compare solar and nuclear because they are entirely separate classes of energy production.",1442289556

It is getting tiring to repeat refutations of the same type for each new appearance of these various manoeuvres. For this reason, then, rather than yet another set of specific refutations, I offer you instead my little museum of their rhetorical manoeuvres, each exhibit neatly labelled, each label inscribed with a name,each name adding to a vocabulary of dismissal.<p>I don&#x27;t think he has really separated his examples from the philosophy they are criticizing.  If I was to more broadly use his characterization of the phenomena, I could say that arguments about postmodernism are for the author the &quot;bailey&quot; and the A and B statment distinctions are the easy to defend and boring &quot;motte&quot;.

His thesis is that technology &quot;amplifies&quot; the characteristics in society and self. If you have an underperforming school with ill-equipped or overwhelmed instructors, technology won&#x27;t fix these issues. But in education research, where studies very carefully select a field site, you don&#x27;t see experiments involving problem schools; you find experimental deployments in idyllic settings, with instructors who are extremely competent, and the researchers might even take a relatively hands-on role to ensure the technology gets used as desired by the protocol of the study.<p>In one chapter he points out that studies such as the OECD&#x27;s tend to find middling results (as this one seems to, although I see more explicitly negative conclusions, like that students do <i>worse</i> with technology in some circumstances) mainly because you&#x27;re studying students from across all schools; look at the successful schools and see how technology affects them, and he seems to argue that you&#x27;ll find those students make even greater leaps over the underprivileged students.<p>His bigger point is that technology&#x27;s benefit is contextually determined by human factors, and that we need to understand the cultures in which we hope to use technology to benefit the members of that culture. Throwing tablets, laptops, or smartphones at everyone won&#x27;t magically make the world a better place. It&#x27;s a good read (so far, at least).<p>Also, I&#x27;m getting more and more annoyed seeing news outlets publishing summaries of third party studies without linking to <i>anything</i>. The BBC don&#x27;t even link to the OECD&#x27;s homepage, let alone the study they ostensibly published.",1442287979

I pointed out that bureaucrats aren&#x27;t prudent when spending other people&#x27;s money, and that&#x27;s self-evidently true.<p>For example, you know would not be prudent with other people&#x27;s money either, or with $1000 you found on the street.<p>> <i>And that&#x27;s the fallacy of the excluded middle. Just because (some) bureaucrats aren&#x27;t particularly prudent when using our money, it doesn&#x27;t follow that (as you alleged before) the free market is always better.</i><p>I was hinting at the fact that since everyone uses someone else&#x27;s money less prudently than his own, using someone else&#x27;s money results in &#x27;waste&#x27; compared to using one&#x27;s own, and therefore, all public spending results in &#x27;waste&#x27;.<p>So it&#x27;s clear that the free market actually is &#x27;always better&#x27; in that sense. It&#x27;s better in all other senses too.<p>For example, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to argue that a state-maintained monopoly or cartel is better for us than no such thing.<p>> <i>I actually happen to think the opposite of the two assertions that you claim constitute my premise.</i><p>Quote the <i>two</i> assertions I claimed constitute your premise.",1442286013
