It features message dispatching / manipulation, dynamic object mutation, a script engine / interpreter and group object support.<p>The main way to interact with objects in ELENA is sending a message. The message name is structured and consists of a verb, a signature and a parameter counter. The verb defines a message action, for example read or write some data. There are only limited set of possible verbs. The signature is user defined and describes the message parameters. If the signature is not provided the message is considered to be generic and can be qualified (by dispatching).<p>If the object wants to handle the message it has to contain the method with the same name. If no method mapping was found the flow is considered to be broken and the control goes to the next alternative flow (exception handler) or the program is stopped. It is possible to declare generic handler which will be called for all incoming messages.<p>A class encapsulates data (fields) with code (methods) to access it. It is not possible to get a direct access to the class content.<p>To work with the class we have to create its instance with the help of the special methods - constructors.<p>There are special type of classes which do not have fields and constructors and can be used directly (extensions / symbols).<p>Classes form the inheritance tree. There is the common super class - system&#x27;Object.

(Alongside the other obvious choice -- using floats.)<p>> other languages have been too lazy or stupid<p>I&#x27;m extolling what I consider a minor Perl 6 virtue. Where have I been negative toward other languages?<p>> rational arithmetic is a fine choice for ...<p>... doing rational arithmetic.<p>> it is not a strict improvement over other number representations.<p>For representing Integers? Sure. Irrationals? Agreed. Complex numbers? Gotchya. Number crunching where absolute exactness is not necessary? Use floats.<p>But if exactness is required and a formula only involves rational numbers (and integers) then rational storage and processing is a strict improvement over use of floats.<p>> [rationals are] not as perfect, and floating point is not as bad, as you seem to think.<p>When did I suggest floats are bad? The general number type in Perl 6 is a float. Floats are awesome! But floats are <i>by design</i> not exact for arbitrary rational numbers. Their awesomeness derives directly from them being <i>inexact</i> in this way.<p>When did I suggest storing rationals is perfect? They use up more memory than floats and processing can become pathologically slow if the denominators get big enough. This problem derives directly from them being <i>exact</i>.<p>> doubles have lots of values they can&#x27;t represent perfectly, but so do rationals. Like sqrt(2), sin(1), pi<p>Those are explicitly defined in mathematics as numbers that are not rational. Rational storage and arithmetic is for representing and processing numbers that are rational!<p>One can&#x27;t exactly store an irrational number. The Perl 6 compiler defines a constant for the irrational number `pi`:<p><pre><code>    my constant pi = 3.14159_26535_89793_238e0;
</code></pre>
The &#x27;e0&#x27; on the end means that `pi` is stored as a float.<p>> Some slides I found about Perl 6 indicate that Rat values lose precision if the denominator gets too big, to avoid using too much memory.<p>The numerator of a default rational (a non-parameterized Rat) can be arbitrarily large but if the denominator exceeds 64 bits (20 decimal digits) then the compiler converts the number to a float.<p>If you don&#x27;t like that then you can use a rational with a larger denominator, with the extreme being a FatRat that has an arbitrary sized denominator as well as arbitrary sized numerator.<p>> If this is true, the Rat type shouldn&#x27;t be thought of as an &quot;exact&quot; type any more than double<p>I think that view misses something very important. This is indeed where the discussion could get interesting. We shall see. It seems we needed to get past a lot of misunderstanding first.<p>> What I&#x27;m disagreeing with overall is the dichotomy you are trying to create of: double=approximate, Perl 6 number=exact.<p>I&#x27;ve never said that. What I have said is that, for storing and processing <i>rational numbers</i>, doubles are approximate (and they are); that it&#x27;s possible to be exact instead (and it is); and that Perl 6 returns True for the expression `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` because by default it processes rationals as exact rationals.<p>> There are cases where double is exact<p>Not for rational numbers (I&#x27;m ignoring silly examples like 1/1 and others that happen to work out because the denominator and numerators are powers of two or whatever).<p>> and cases where Perl 6 is not exact.<p>Not for rational numbers, if you choose to have them be exact.",1441610950

When you partition, you can safely ignore a large portion of the network. So long as you have greater than half in a network shard, you can continue serving safely from that section. If you have datacenters A, B, and C, if C drops from the network consistently, you can still serve traffic from A and B while C is down - And your logic should be built to handle this case. AWS and similar frameworks give you all the tools you need to build this. If you&#x27;re multihoming your IP, your backend detects the partition, and stops offering the route. If you&#x27;re using an ELB, you start failing health-checks [1]. Partitions are not rare - Full service partitions, where A, B, and C are in their own shards, are, and you have the tools to deal with it.<p>On the other hand, where the P still matters a lot is in speed. If you need replicas of data in the US, Europe, and Asia, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time - For all three to agree takes >100ms, even in the best case. That is where you start thinking of the tradeoffs - Do you sacrifice unified-worldview for speed? The answer is almost certainly yes - Very few idioms require unified worldview, even banking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-healthchecks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/Devel...</a>",1441610819

Flash sites rarely looked the same.<p>The author clearly doesn&#x27;t remember what it was actually like to arrive on a Flash site, and play the fun games of &#x27;where has the designer hidden the navigation today?&#x27; and &#x27;oh crap, how do I turn the sound off?&#x27;.<p>Design patterns are there to ensure that functionality works in a roughly consistent manner across different sites, so instead of having to spend ages figuring out an inscrutable interface, the user can easily buy a product or find the information they want and get on with their day.<p>This is not a trend. This is lots of people slowly figuring out how content should be structured for maximum usability in a web context. Layout conventions will develop over time, as new ideas are incorporated and technology changes, but that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>As has been pointed out, books have looked roughly the same for the last few hundred years, but design innovation has only increased, as technology and our understanding of the conventions involved has improved.<p>The visual design area is more susceptible to trends - a few years ago everything was  glossy, then with &#x27;Flat UI&#x27; everything became dark blue and a sickly shade of green. But that&#x27;s ok too. Except for the green, that was horrible.<p>The danger is with &#x27;cargo cult&#x27; design. That&#x27;s where the complaint against generic themes is valid – a style is used because it&#x27;s popular without thinking about whether it&#x27;s actually the best fit for the content and what&#x27;s to be achieved.",1441610588

If you read the history of the business, it started with a group of people who really arrived in the business quite randomly. There wasn&#x27;t much thought given to building a balanced team or a strong culture. Effectively, twitter was an accident that came out of another business.<p>Most worryingly, the founders couldn&#x27;t agree on what the purpose of Twitter was, and illuminatingly people in this discussion <i>still</i> don&#x27;t have a clear idea of its purpose. Is it a news broadcast system, to follow current events? Or is it about sharing your personal life with your friends?<p>From a technical point of view, I find Twitter very confusing. I read that they were at over a million users before having any kind of backup strategy. They rewrote their systems from Java to Scala, but then seemed to regret that decision, their decisions on shutting down API access to third parties have been really nasty... this kinda thing makes me worry that they don&#x27;t have clear leadership.<p>And then there&#x27;s the politics of infighting, and some of their executives being &quot;overthrown&quot; over time... I can&#x27;t see how you can create a good culture when people at the top are behaving like that. It&#x27;s hardly rocket science - just focus on the product and your users.<p>I think creating a culture from the beginning is a lot easier than changing an engrained culture, so my view is that Twitter is screwed. Failing a Jobsian turnaround, the best they can do is sell and sell fast. I can seriously see Twitter losing out to a startup. Any thoughts on whether they will survive?",1441610313

I cultivate a list of accounts I follow strictly because their posts tend to be relevant or interesting.<p>If you have a stream of garbage on Twitter, don&#x27;t follow people who post garbage.<p>I follow people primarily in tech and programming. Most of them use Twitter to talk about things they work on, issues they have, things that are interesting. Occasionally they share something funny, but I rarely see something distasteful or annoying. Sometimes I follow somebody and after a few days I feel like I&#x27;m not getting any benefit from what they are posting--it will be annoying or I will realize that they are trying to reach an audience with a different set of values--and I unfollow them. That&#x27;s OK, they are not meeting my expectations.<p>The argument for Twitter being broken because signal/noise ratio is like saying email is broken because your inbox is full of newsletters for sites you don&#x27;t like. The problem isn&#x27;t with email, it is with how you are using it. Unsubscribe, clean it out, make a new address...",1441609292
