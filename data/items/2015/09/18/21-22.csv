Virtual slot machines are proof positive that they exploit people psychologically, since there&#x27;s absolutely no rational reason to play a zero-payout gambling game. More importantly, these apps make up 1/11th of the top 200 grossing on the App Store, sucking money and talent out of riskier and more rewarding pursuits.<p>It&#x27;s unfair though to look at what the producer describes and say free to play gaming is this huge existential crisis of conscious. Anything near the end (i.e., end user) of the value chain is going to be dealing with people&#x27;s demographics, their wants and needs, etc. Of course game developers are interested in their player&#x27;s features, no more differently than stores use loyalty cards, magazines survey their readership, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a consequence to what you&#x27;re saying: The only honest work doesn&#x27;t deal with the end user. Maybe if you&#x27;re building database testing tools you&#x27;re doing a total social positive. Well, we can&#x27;t all work for infrastructure companies messing around with Haskell libraries all day.<p>Who do you think is using all those elegant hierarchies, those pickaxes in the app goldrush? The producer says they integrate forty SDKs! That&#x27;s forty different tech startups, some of them with billion dollar valuations.<p>What created AWS? The intensive, pathological tracking of people&#x27;s preferences in book buying. What created all of Google&#x27;s server infrastructure? The intensive tracking of people&#x27;s searches. I&#x27;m not saying forfeit your values or principals. But the alternatives to free to play gaming are just less obviously exploitative.",1442613502

On a roundabout, when you cross one of the exit arms, your path is constantly crossed by drivers going straight through, doing a right turn, doing a left turn and doing a U-turn. They are all driving at full speed too, rather than just starting from a stop. It is a delicate game where you gently put your foot forward to signal your intent, wait for the incoming traffic to stop for a moment, then dash to the other side.

As big corporation, you basically can do very, very much, without being penalized much. In Germany, you always can say, that health costs are covered by the public health insurance. So, it is common, that compensations are small fractures of that which is paid in the US or even no compensations are made.<p>My feeling is, that German judges are much more reluctant to rule against corporations, as long as their fault can not be proven 110% -- for common people on the other hand, 80% prove are enough most of the time (I remember, that not long ago a young girl was convicted for computer fraud, just because Siemens said, that the 4 digit PIN-system for EC cards was 100% secure -- something we soon later found out, was never true!).",1442612257

Max power grows to 3rd power of cyclists dimension, because it&#x27;s dependent on the cyclists muscle mass. Maximum aerobic power grows somewhere between 2nd and 3rd power, because of the fractal shape of lungs and veins (for example, think about lung surface area, the smallest folds in lung have same dimension in bigger and smaller guys, so the area grows faster than 2nd power of cyclist&#x27;s dimension).<p>It then follows that bigger guys do well pushing against air (since frontal area grows slower than maximum aerodynamic capability), and smaller guys do better dragging themselves uphill (since mass grows faster aerodynamic capability). \nYou can easily find practical examples of this: say Fabian Cancellara, who has won time trial world championships 3 times + almost anything else riding in fairly flat ground, including several tour prologues and stages before getting into mountains... but when you get to the mountains, it&#x27;s the featherweights that rule, so likes of Cancellara can&#x27;t ever win the tour.<p>So... to propel something as fast as possible against air, you need big and strong cyclist (with huge lungs to match), just like the guy in the video looks like.\nPower/weight has little to do with it, since air drag is most of the resistance, and they can accelerate for 5 miles before measuring speed (you would need power/weight if you needed to accelerate fast, which is not the case).",1442611509
