10243924,comment,10243661,10243661,0,0,Udik,,,"I wonder if the study is able to make a distinction between solution aversion and what could be called &quot;proponent aversion&quot;. That is, it is normal to be skeptical of a statement when it comes from somebody we don&#x27;t trust. And our level of trust can be dependent from another statement coming (or perceived to be coming) from the same source. In this case, the proposed solution to the problem.<p>I&#x27;ve concocted an example:<p>Statement:
The rate of suicides among teenagers in the US has been growing steadily in the last two decades, to the point of constituting now a real public health emergency.<p>Solution 1:
Naturopathic nutrition, holistic and homeopathic medicine are fundamental to ensure the well being of the young generations - courses in these subjects should be part of the standard curriculum starting from primary schools.<p>Solution 2:
Standard psychological welfare assessment tests that can help detecting early signs of depression should be conducted at regular time intervals in schools starting from sixth grade, and counselling should be provided to those who display early symptoms of depression.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve no clue of whether the statement is true (I made it up). But I&#x27;ll dismiss it readily as BS if it&#x27;s followed by proposed solution 1. I&#x27;ll take mental note if it&#x27;s followed by proposed solution 2. I simply don&#x27;t trust any statement coming from proponents of snake oil.",1442660293

You pay $2000 a month for a shitty room in a 50&#x27;s cracker box house, and can&#x27;t park your vechicle anywhere without getting a ticket?  (Please save the Emergency vechicle egress excuses?  My town happily accept $90 a quarter for overnight passes?  And wide streets are treated the same as narrow streets?)<p>Where I reside, you can&#x27;t park your vechicle more than 30 min. between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.<p>Most towns I have lived in allow 72 hrs of parking, and then you need to move 300 yards.  My town doesn&#x27;t want to change the muni code because they make a staggering amount of Revenue.<p>Theses parking fines/traffic fines are revenue fueled.  I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be upset but these fees account for income level.  They don&#x27;t. You get a $38 dollar parking ticket, or a dubious $500 traffic violation--it&#x27;s a setback for low income residents.  Why couldn&#x27;t you send in a copy of your 1040&#x27;s, and have your parking violation adjusted to realistic amounts?<p>As to living, working, having a life, while living in the suburbs; you need a vechicle.  You need to park the vechicle somewhere?  Not all of us can just jump on public transportation(our public transportation is so slow, so spotty, I can get to most places in my county faster by riding  my bike. (My employer doesn&#x27;t like sweat soaked employees though, nor do Judges in Jury duty), or have the income to take Uber/Taxis everywhere.<p>My point is some of still need a automobile.

(For an off-road application, the only reason is to allow the use of TEL (leaded) fuel additive as an octane booster and an open loop controller and any such application would drive so few miles per year that it doesn&#x27;t need to be worried about. The reason to eliminate a downstream is to remove (or dramatically reduce) the catalyst function. I have not experienced a car that did a &quot;compare downstream to upstream&quot;; I&#x27;m sure they exist, but manufacturers have an incentive to reduce nuisance MILs, so most controllers are designed to detect gross defects and typical failure modes of installed components, assuming all specified parts are installed, not to detect all possible types of intentional tampering.<p>I agree with you that this isn&#x27;t a significant issue in terms of pollution levels, as the enthusiast market that will mod their cars to this extent isn&#x27;t large in numbers, but based on the amount of poorly modified cars I see (gassers with tailpipes so sooted up they look like diesels, diesels modified so they can better &quot;roll coal&quot;, people who think &quot;more fuel must be better&quot; when changing ECU maps, etc), I wonder how many regular cars&#x27; emissions are equally by some of these poorly modded enthusiast cars.<p>(I love and have no philosophical objection to auto enthusiasts and modded cars. Despite my hands-on experience above, I now drive an electric LEAF, which is not exactly an enthusiast car, but does payback the environment for some of my youthful transgressions...)",1442659888

This constant was then &quot;abandoned&quot; after Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding, it was still there but it&#x27;s value was (assumed to be) zero.<p>When the scientific consensus reached a point where it was agreed on that the universe is accelerating the cosmological constant came back into play because with it you can explain the accelerated expansion, the problem is that we can&#x27;t account for the additional energy needed to account for the acceleration so dark energy was introduced as a concept.<p>Dark Matter was introduced to solve another issue, one that can be seen on much smaller (or own galaxy) scales, basically if we look at the motion of stars and the rotation of galaxies we seem to be lacking mass, and quite a bit of it (although not nearly as much as dark energy) so again a place holder device was introduced in the form of dark matter<p>Now normally you would say well when you need to introduce additional doodads to account for something in your theory not in 1 instance but in 2 and maybe in many others your theory sucks.
The problem is that we&#x27;ve sorta proven that gravity works for the most part as we think it does, and if we go into weird stuff like localized gravitational constants well they don&#x27;t account for the observations that required dark matter or energy, oh and they kinda break the universe.<p>The force of gravity and hence the gravitational constant has been proven to be &quot;correct&quot; in from the smallest (even atom level) observations and calculations to the macro and universal scales, and while it&#x27;s true that we might be wrong, if we are we are wrong by not a mile but probably several parsecs this means that relativity and other current accepted gravitational theories are more wrong than the &quot;Ether Theory&quot;.",1442657217
