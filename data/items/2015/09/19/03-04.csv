They&#x27;ll most likely get away with it, due to the fact that they have a minority share of the global smartphone market, but the effect on the marketplace will be drastic.<p>1) This is an attack on the open web.  No matter what anyone says about minority report advertising, ad-supported content is a boon to the public good in that it encourages more sharing and more open sharing of information.  Yes, you can go too far, but ad-blockers drastically change the market dynamic.  Even the conscientious advertiser is punished by the extremes, which means that the market can not respond to user preferences for ads.  In the app store, no such technology will exist, and as such it drives content creators into the walled garden of eden of monetization.  There, the market will adapt, and you will be stuck with ads no matter what your preference is, and will have to support ads to the same level as the average user.<p>2) This is an attack on Google, in many ways.  On the one hand it gives Apple an above-average position in the case of their ad network when on their platform (lock-in), on the other hand by starving the open web, they are ultimately starving the future of Google&#x27;s search technology, helping to erase that advantage.<p>If we want to go down this route, everyone should be demanding that Apple enable content blockers in apps themselves.",1442634705

Most shops use just one reference book for the visual inspections.<p>The shop owner usually, almost always, buys the $100.00 Motor Emissions manual.<p>The cheap shop owner should buy OnDemand5(Mitchell Manual Smog Emission)  subscription/publication.  They don&#x27;t because they are cheap, and CARB only requires one reference manual for customers, and technicians.<p>The problem is Motor Publications is filled with errors that send thousands of customers home with failed Smog Checks.<p>I have found so many errors in Motor publications, it&#x27;s comical.  I have numerous emails, where I am literally arguing with, I believe, a secretary, over errors in their manuals.  I have one email when the person I&#x27;m communicating with doesn&#x27;t know the difference between Naturally Aspirated(Carburated) v.s. Fuel Injection.

Just the two autos I happen to own?  What are the odds of that?  They failed my vechicles, until I went to a shop that had Mitchell manuals, and I presented the Techs with a Printout of the Correct Emmission information.<p>(Motor Emission manuals--If you are listening; please clean up your books?  It&#x27;s beyond frustrating to fail a smog test because of your sloppy research!  I will show the world my frustrating emails--if necessary?)<p>(CARB--if you are listening, require every shop to have access to two (2) separate Emmission manuals from different entities?)<p>And no--1988 Toyota trucks, 2wd, naturally aspirated(Carburator) do Not require a MIL light.<p>I literally tore apart the dash looking for the missing light.  There was no light.  There was no plug for a light.  I literally thought I was going crazy.  I was so frustrated, I forget to set the emergency brake and the truck rolled out of the garage.
