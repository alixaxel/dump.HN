My opinion is that it&#x27;s highly unlikely that SR is incorrect (or partially incorrect), however, I do see it as a remote possibility.<p>> There are filaments and voids where the gravitational effects of unseen matter/stuff are plainly observable<p>Another way of looking at it is a map of the sum of things that we don&#x27;t know. Again, using Mercury as an example, we were able to calculate the [sum of] force the was &quot;wrong.&quot;\nThe dark matter map is incredibly cool because it&#x27;s the same thing done on a unbelievably massive scale. There were certainly people who believed that this unaccounted-for force on Mercury was a single force with a trivial explanation. We now know that this was not the case.<p>That is, in my opinion, the same mistake we are now making - simply because we can <i>calculate</i> a map of the effect does not mean that it&#x27;s actually a map of real stuff.<p>Although I&#x27;m in disagreement with MOND I do think it does something right: the μ function. &quot;This is something that we don&#x27;t know.&quot; In the same way it is in my opinion that dark matter and dark energy are merely unknown functions and not &quot;real matter&quot; and &quot;real energy.&quot; I certainly think that Turner and Zwicky had the same thought pattern when they coined the terms.",1442667422

10244135,comment,10243823,10244042,0,0,pvaldes,,,"Yes. The question is that fishes do not eat or use carbs normally, they use fat as source of energy and protein as last resource. Salmonidae are a little different because  use protein as main source of energy. They burn muscle in its travel ending skinny and with deformed heads. Thus, normally maybe the 80-90% of flesh in wild salmon is tasty protein. If you think in a &quot;fatty fish&quot; you never think in salmon.<p>Aquaculture fishes instead do not have problems to obtain fat. Fat is cheaper than protein so you have better cost-benefit ratio if you feed your salmons with more fat content pellets.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the farmed salmon is a bad product at all but wild salmon is a different thing. Not so apt to freeze and send to thousands of Km. You can earn more money  selling it in fresh in the local market as wild product (but be aware that some &#x27;wild&#x27; high-prized salmon in the market is farmed probably in fact).",1442667091

[...] one useful choice has been just three: h, c and G, collectively representing relativity and quantum theory.

But I don&#x27;t understand two things:<p>* Why is Boltzmann&#x27;s constant there, temperature being a statistical property more akin to the fine structure constant than the other 4 Planck units?<p>* Why do physicists nowadays prefer to use the electron charge instead of Coulomb&#x27;s constant as Planck did? Coulomb&#x27;s constant and the gravitational constant G slot into similar looking formulas for electromagnetism and gravity respectively, and pairing them seems more &quot;fundamental&quot; than using the electron charge.",1442664450
