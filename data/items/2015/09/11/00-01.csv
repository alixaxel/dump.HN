I argued that we could trigger the fraud detection code once per n impressions with n being 100 or 1000 and still be able to identify fraudulent sites with statistical certainty (our problem would be false negatives) but they couldn&#x27;t wrap their heads around merely sampling enough data to answer a question rather than ALL the data, so the idea was rejected.<p>Of course it&#x27;s also highly likely that they didn&#x27;t actually want to detect fraud.",1441932452

You had real relationships with the engineers. I got to know Netezza folks in Massachusetts, Poland and Australia - some of the smartest folks I&#x27;ve met. They shared scripts and passionate expertise.<p>IBM took it over and the bureaucracy set in. The term &quot;TAM&quot; brings tears of rage to my eyes... Opening a support ticket is  about as hard as applying for a mortgage online. And they want to have these endless conference calls with 7 or 8 folks from their side.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 44,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 80 (34 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for senior software engineers: people who can help us see around corners and mentor a sharp young team.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs</a>, or check out our recent press here:\n<a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-thir...</a>",1441931936

A little ahead of\nthe gun and in the path of the electrons\nwe have a <i>beam splitter</i>, that is,\na flat plate of material with horizontal\nnormal along the line from south \neast to north west.<p>So, we fire the gun.  The electron\nhits the beam splitter.  The wave\nfunction splits with some going\neast and the rest passing through\nthe beam splitter and going north.<p>One mile to the north of the beam \nsplitter and in the line of the path\nof the wave function we have a\nvery good electron detector.\nSimilarly for one mile to the east.<p>So, we fire and some fraction of the\ntime we get a detection from the north\ndetector and the rest of the time,\nfrom the east detector.<p>Now, let&#x27;s move some of the mass of\nthe electron faster than the speed \nof light:  A little ahead of each\ndetector we have a very sensitive\ndetector of gravity (or, maybe charge).<p>So, as the two parts of the wave\nfunction pass the gravity detectors,\nwe get a signal from both.\nIf the beam splitter sends 10%\nof the wave function north and\nthe other 90% east, then \nfrom the north gravity detector\nwe should get a signal\nof 10% of an electron,\nand from the east, 90% of\nan electron.<p>Then, soon, one of the electron\ndetectors gives a signal, \nof 100% of the mass (and charge)\nof an electron.  So, 90% or\n10% of the mass (and charge)\nof the electron moved\ninstantly, \nfaster than the speed of light.\nalong the line between the\ntwo detectors.<p>Is this wrong?  Why?<p>In more detail, what about the\nelectromagnetic field\nfrom the moving parts of the\nwave function?  E.g., if the\nelectron is detected at the\neast detector, is there\nan electromagnetic field \nstill from the path of\npart of the wave function to the\nnorth?",1441930715
