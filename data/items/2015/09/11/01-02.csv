10201562,comment,10201235,10201235,0,0,morganvachon,,,"A nitpick (beyond the spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors throughout): The part about &quot;most states in the Union require 24 hours before reporting a missing person&quot; is nothing but a Hollywood trope. The fact is, most agencies require a missing person to be entered into their respective state&#x27;s database within a few hours of the report. I can say unequivocally that Georgia has a two-hour window, as I&#x27;ve entered many such reports during my stint in law enforcement, and that is our state&#x27;s requirement.<p>The reason they want to enter the person as soon as possible is so that any checks for that person&#x27;s info will return a &quot;hit&quot; in time to locate the person. For example, George has dementia, goes for a walk at 8am, and is gone for several hours. He is reported missing at 12pm, and the police report is keyed into the state database by 1pm. At 2pm that same day, George is stopped by an officer and his information ran on the state computer. A hit shows up that states he&#x27;s a missing-endangered person (endangered due to his mental state), the officer notifies his department so they can notify the family, and all is well. Now, if the bogus 24 hour rule was real, George never would have been reported the day he went missing, and perhaps would have met a grisly demise that night. Timely reporting is a potentially life-saving measure and I really wish television and the movies would stop it with that particularly dangerous bit of misinformation.",1441935865

Constant screen viewing hampers  brain development, cognition and the biological effects of chronic microwave exposure may cause cancer, neurological problems, blood brain barrier permeability, reproductive harm, etc.  There are now over a dozen sperm studies that confirm sperm damage from using a laptop. Microwave radiation from Wi-Fi routers was classified a Class 2B carcinogen by the W.H.O. in 2011. None of these microwave emitting devices were ever pre-market safety tested. When we measured the microwave exposure in my daughter&#x27;s school it was 50x&#x27;s higher than standing 100 feet from a cell tower.  Science confirms this but the 4 trillion dollar telecommunications industry buys scientists, media and members of high profile agencies.  Industry money is the second highest source of revenue that the U.S. &quot;Government&quot; has.  How can it be that the FCC is  funding this disaster and is also in charge of regulating microwave exposures of wireless devices.

Prepping your new life (surreptitiously creating bank accounts, documents, contacts in new residence).<p>4.

Roy Fielding wrote about this topic, clarifying common misconceptions and what REST APIs are not:<p><a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a><p>> A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand). [Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]<p>The need for a document like this in the first place demonstrates that the API is not REST. These systems are simply ad hoc, partially specified RPC systems operating over HTTP.<p>I&#x27;ve almost given up caring about what REST means due to endless debates and misunderstandings about this. REST just means any HTTP-based API where operations and inputs/outputs are modeled with HTTP fields these days.",1441933367

Consider the example of &quot;ring species&quot;--A can breed with B, B with C, .., Y with Z, and Z with A. However, A can&#x27;t interbreed with M. What&#x27;s the species?<p>That&#x27;s a somewhat rare version of a general pattern where that abstraction is leaky. Much more common is a temporal version of that. A might beget A1 and B, with A1 begetting A2 and B begetting C, continuing all the way down. And though A can interbreed with A1 and B, and B with C, etc, Z can&#x27;t interbreed with A25. That&#x27;s speciation, which happens all the time. The only thing that makes it a clear species is defining the concept species while abandoning time invariance.",1441933328
