I think people are getting hung up on &quot;theoretically breaking&quot; changes that don&#x27;t break anybody in practice and are equivalent to the &quot;theoretically breaking&quot; changes that C and C++ (and every other actively developed language) continue to make all the time.</i><p>That&#x27;s good to know. In the language OK, not even in the standard lib?<p>><i>Because a replacement might have more features/better performance/improved security? These are the same reasons you might look for alternatives for any piece of software!</i><p>Most of that (more features, better performance) are orthogonal to Rust. Features obviously (if anything a port will probably have even LESS features initially, as Sqlite got most of its features piecemeal too).<p>And how is better speed assured with the Rust rewrite considering that Sqlite is pretty fast C already?<p>At best it might be the same speed (and if it&#x27;s an algorithmic issue that slows down Sqlite, then of course they can also fix their C code and overcome that).<p>Which leaves us with &quot;better security&quot;. Is it compelling enough to change software? Depends, I say.",1442048333

10207616,comment,10206827,10207569,0,0,lispm,,,"> Clojure was designed specifically with the intent of being a dialect of Lisp<p>The result of that design is that Clojure shares literally zero lines of code with other Lisps: Autolisp, ISLisp, Emacs Lisp, Standard Lisp, Common Lisp. Many basic concepts are absent, renamed or redesigned (&#x27;Atom&#x27;, &#x27;Linked List&#x27;, ...). Clojure is fully incompatible to any other language with Lisp in its name. Programs have to be re-architectured, because the concepts are different: no TCO, but &#x27;functional&#x27;, different approach about side effects (-> avoid), lazy persistent datastructure at its core, different idea of OOP (-> avoid), Lisp infrastructure (-> avoid), ...<p>There is no software I know of, which is shared. The number of tools shared is &#x27;one&#x27;: GNU Emacs. It&#x27;s a different community with different goals, different software, different applications, different libraries.<p>Just think of it: zero lines of code is shared.<p>My problem with that broader idea of &#x27;Lisp&#x27;: it is fully vague  and it has no practical implications. Sometimes it&#x27;s only a marketing slogan. It has the same vague meaning like &#x27;object-oriented&#x27; or &#x27;Functional&#x27;. There is no consensus what OOP in a broad sense means and how it should be defined. &#x27;Lisp&#x27; is just as useless.<p>It does not mean that Clojure is useless or worse than Lisp. Totally not. Clojure has new ideas on data structures put to work and enabled some very productive people enjoying their tools. They are doing wonderful stuff.",1442047254
