It&#x27;s not necessarily the language but the community mindset that doesn&#x27;t seem to care one tiny bit about backwards compatibility.<p>Say I want to run two programs an a server, both written in Ruby. Those programs depend on a bunch of libraries. Ok, so I go on and just install those libraries. WRONG. The programs need specific versions of those libraries (both of which differ from the one coming with my Linux distro) and there&#x27;s no single library version that works with both of them. To make things worse, one program needs a different version of the Ruby interpreter than the other. Only one of those is included in the Linux distribution I&#x27;m running.<p>So instead of being able to (at least partially) rely on the maintenance done by my Linux distro, I&#x27;d have to maintain my own Ruby interpreters and libraries. Yeah, right.<p>For that reason I consider running Ruby programs a liability. Sure, you have to deal with stuff like that everywhere but I never encountered an ecosystem where things are that bad and things break with any other update. I&#x27;ve heard the Javascript/Node people do an equally crappy job but I&#x27;m not going to find out personally.<p>So while I saw a couple of quite nice things written in Ruby, we&#x27;re not going to use them if their maintenance is such a pain.",1442276860

It’s simple to start with no installation necessary. CUJO blocks malware, viruses, phishing attempts, and hacks. You get an app that alerts you anytime your devices are in danger. Best of all, you can get it for only $49 when you back the CUJO Indiegogo campaign.<p>The days of protecting your home with just an alarm system or Antivirus are over. If you have a TV, a smartphone, or even a baby monitor at home, then you are an easy target for cyber criminals. It takes 20 minutes before criminals attempt to hack your newly connected devices. More often than not, they succeed.<p>Why is it important to get extra Internet security for your home? Criminal hackers break into your home devices to steal your identity, watch your cameras, access your financial info, and worse. Kids and older adults are especially susceptible to falling victim for stalkers and impersonators. Your home is full of smart devices but Antivirus software is built to only protect your PC so it is ineffective in most cases. And firewalls are outdated the moment they ship. Your Internet of Things need security. CUJO continuously adapts to guard your entire home Internet.<p>So checkout CUJO today and help us build momentum with our crowdfunding campaign!",1442275579

Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. You could fly on a barn door if you had enough speed,
because attack angle is more important. Hint: why can planes fly upside down?<p>We still don&#x27;t understand areodynamics fully, so you can&#x27;t arbitrarily state
that difference between pressures above and below wings is the main force.<p>And no, I didn&#x27;t downvote you.",1442275558
