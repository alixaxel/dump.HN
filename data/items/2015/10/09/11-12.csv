Typical household hazmat issues are stuff like lead paint, asbestos, etc. All of which can be stabilized (for example, you can encapsulate lead paint and personally dispose of asbestos in municipal trash) without shelling out money you don&#x27;t have on remediation services that are often ineffective, and also make it clear that you were aware of the issue.<p>In this case for example, every neighbor saw the clean harbors guys in spacesuits at his house. When he sells the house a decade from now and the new owner finding more Mercury somewhere, the old lady across the street will tell the new owners, and this person may be sued, even though he nearly bankrupted himself on cleanup.

For low risk customers this is great because they get a cheap rate. For the companies it&#x27;s great because they get to advertise a cheap rate and attract customers (and run really lean administratively... don&#x27;t need a lot of claims handlers etc).<p>Things go off the rails though for customers perceived as high risk. Grouping all these folks together means a higher rate, possibly quite a bit higher.<p>The use of prior claim history as a risk measurement seems like a very cheap way to do underwriting. This feeds into being able to offer the cheapest offering... no need for experienced and qualified underwriters... which means a cheaper product.<p>The original goal of insurance, shared risked, has been somewhat eroded by this.",1444391813

10359422,comment,10351205,10354152,0,0,restalis,,,"&quot;India and China produced just about everything locally that the West could export&quot;<p>Before I begin, let me say that &quot;the West&quot; is a very political term of the actual times and we were talking about the ancient times. Let&#x27;s try to keep our heads lucid by avoiding sensitive topics, by avoiding blame casting (related to opium), and other such things. Now, pretty much every community in the ancient times &quot;produced just about everything locally&quot;, at least everything they needed. Trade usually happens because of cultural differences (even when these differences are induced by other natural factors, like climate), and it just happened that the cultures in question (Roman, Indian, and Chinese) were different enough. Who were the usual consumers of the imported goods? Not the average Joes, mind you! They were the ones that: first - were open to appreciate foreign things for any reason (exotic tastes, cosmopolitan nature, etc.), and second - could afford to! You may assume here that for various reasons the Indian and Chinese high class could have been more closed and not so interested in foreign products, preferring only the good ol&#x27; local produced things, but I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t want to think that their nature was somehow lesser in this regard (because I like to consider human to be equals about that), and I prefer to assume that even if they wanted to, their collective potential that formed the market depth was not deep enough. India accepted the Roman gold. That&#x27;s because Rome happened to have it (from its conquests, mostly), whereas India did not so much! A steep difference of their historical evolution that ultimately shaped their cultures and trade, you see? Another kind of cultural difference between Roman Empire and China shaped the trade between them. Who were the consumers of luxury goods in Roman Empire? Women, mostly! Did women in China have the same leeway in shopping spree? No! That&#x27;s because unlike the women in the Roman Empire, which enjoyed equal social status with men, and many other things, women in ancient China bared a lower social status in comparison! So, another big cultural difference that heavily shaped the nature of commerce between Roman Empire and China. I&#x27;m glad to enlighten, thank you!",1444391577

The radio and far-infrared observations are at much lower angular resolution than the optical and near-infrared, for example. So there&#x27;s less spatial detail in those. Also, some surveys have been carried out in more than one filter/color (e.g., optical, near-infrared) and so the optical image shows some information about the color of objects in the optical. In contrast, the radio image appears to be a single frequency, and so doesn&#x27;t contain that information for the radio sources.<p>However, there is a lot of information there about the galaxy. The distribution of sources, for example – you can see the well-defined disk of the galaxy in all bands. The dust lanes corresponding to gas clouds are apparent in the optical as the dark patches. You can also see that there are some sources which emit brightly in X-rays, but are not seen in the other images. So that tells you about the types of objects in the galaxy.<p>So, despite the fact that the technology affects the images, I would not say that the map says less about the galaxy than about the technology.",1444391245

And subsidization doesn&#x27;t make things cheaper in the real sense, it simply realigns incentives.<p>As is, renewables are heavily subsidized, fossil fuels are taxed heavily, and there&#x27;s still a gap.  It&#x27;s trivial to close that gap through tax policy.  So then the question becomes, what is the correct level of subsidization?  I&#x27;m not sure, but I don&#x27;t think the answer is &quot;more, more, more&quot;.  Because eventually you will eliminate the industry that is paying the taxes to offset the subsidized one. When it&#x27;s no longer economically feasible to pay those heavy subsidies, that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ll see why the <i>real</i> cost of production matters.",1444389608

Get into an accident that wasn&#x27;t your fault? No problem, the other party&#x27;s insurance (which is mandatory) will pay. Get into an accident that was your fault (like I did :( ), your no-claim discount will drop because you f&#x27;d up.<p>My insurance doubled. This was a €900 bill though, so doing the maths, that&#x27;s 9 years worth of no-claim discount (as in, I&#x27;d have to drive accident-free for 9 years with the same policy before I would earn the not-claiming-insurance back).<p>Of course, that&#x27;s based on a motorcycle insurance, which is half as expensive as a car insurance; if I get a car insurance later, that discount (or lack thereof) will persist.<p>TL;DR: I have no problems with insurances becoming more expensive for people that make or get claims for things that were their fault.",1444388853

I can&#x27;t for the life of me understand why the US has trade secret laws in addition to the patent laws. From some light reading on wikipedia, the answer seems to be &quot;why do we need a reason?&quot;",1444388770
