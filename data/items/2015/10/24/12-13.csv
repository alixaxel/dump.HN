Everyone!   I see the amount of $10,000 thrown about.  There are 235 million adults in the U.S.  That&#x27;s $2.35 trillion per annum, more than 13% of the GDP.

It won&#x27;t increase productivity.  If anything it will reduce it somewhat.  Yes, I&#x27;m ignoring the benefit it will be to the truly needy, and that&#x27;s important, but for the majority of the country, the UBI will be way more offset by the much higher amount they have to pay in additional taxes.<p>Social cohesion, my ass.",1445691520

If a password is cryptographically hashed, so long as it isn&#x27;t a dictionary word or date, why on earth do people add in complexity rules that prevent arbitrary character sequences?<p>What I&#x27;m getting at here is that if you had a 8 character password (for the sake of the example), and you can type in lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and punctuation marks the total combinations of values is 95^8.<p>But then you remove all possible values of just numbers, all values that are just letters, all values that are just special characters. That reduces the set of combinations by (52^8) for alphabetic characters, then reduce further by 10^8 for numeric only values, then 33^8 for special characters. That&#x27;s quite a few characters removed!<p>But then you get Apple&#x27;s recent password requirement of no repeated characters in their iCloud and App Store passwords. My math behind permutations is a bit rusty, but that removes a hell of a lot of passwords as well.<p>On top of this, if you require at least one special character, alphanumeric character, and at least one number, then that reduces the number of possible passwords even further!<p>I&#x27;ve never understood how this made passwords safer... What am I missing?",1445688006
