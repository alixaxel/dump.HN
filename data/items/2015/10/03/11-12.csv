Joint the right and left ends by just reflecting itself, so that you have a differentiable periodic function. Now sample that at a suitable rate, take its FFT, derive the FFT of the derivative by multiplying it with 2\pi I. Take the inverse FFT and evaluate it at the point of interest. May be useful if you want to compute the derivative at many points, but seems wasteful otherwise.<p>One of course has to dot the i&#x27;s and cross the t&#x27;s (of aliasing effects, Nyquist limits etc).

Just playing around a bit with neo4j&#x27;s online REPL felt a little more natural to model out data. However, as I dig into it, people seem to take the stance of GDB being particularly well suited for certain applications but stick with Relational where possible. Is this mentality more about Relational being much more widely adopted in society today (and thus more tested, optimized, understood, etc.) as opposed to some deficiency in modelling problems with graphs (I&#x27;m inclined to make a comparison between functional language vs object oriented vs procedural programming languages where thinking in Graphs these days causes a bit of a mental shift and therefore dissuaded b/c it &quot;feels&quot; different -- much like going from C (procedural) to C++ (oo) and now C++ (oo) to F# (functional) )<p>For example, if we just take a simple case: Modelling out a Restaurant Menu that serves Breakfast, Brunch (on Weekends), Lunch, Dinner, Desserts, Drinks, I can see both GDB and Relational being able to solve the problem but why would I necessarily choose Relational over GDB (or vice/versa)?",1443872275

While that topic goes back to the 1800s, I limit my research to mechanical methods for chemical documentation search and management.<p>This started with punched cards in the 1940s. James Perry, then at MIT, was a nexus in the field. It&#x27;s difficult to find people of the era that he wasn&#x27;t connected to.<p>One of these is Calvin Mooers, who is a special focus of mine. Mooers developed some of the fundamental concepts that formed the basis for the computerization of chemical information. (To be more precise, he came up with ideas of how to solve problems. These ideas weren&#x27;t solutions, but were in the ballpark, and ended up influencing the people who actually solved and implemented the problems.) Mooers was a Master&#x27;s student at MIT, where he met Perry, and was influenced by the sorts of problems that Perry was interested in.<p>Mooers&#x27; Master&#x27;s thesis was on a method for superimposed coding which he termed Zatocoding. A superimposed code is one where the keys are assigned to 1 <i>or more</i> bits, and where the bits for different keys may overlap. A Bloom filter is a type of superimpose code. In Zatocoding, there is one pass over the keys to get population statistics, then a bit of information theory to determine the number of bits to use for each key and its bit assignments. A common key ends up with 1 bit, while a rare key might have 7 bits.<p>Mooers is one of the contributors to &quot;Punched Cards&quot;. I likely read the book while trying to track down his publications. I may have read it because Perry was the editor. Or I might have read it because I was trying to understand more about edge-notched punched cards.<p>As for &#x27;seminal&#x27;, I based that on the number of sources I&#x27;ve read which cite it. For something more outwardly visible, there are 100 citations at <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=464718015108686727&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=464718015108686727&...</a> . And of course the book went through two editions.<p>Interesting. One of those references is to &quot;Automated concordances and word indexes: The fifties&quot;. That article says &#x27;Father Busa inaugurated the history of the automatic production of concordances and word indexes&#x27; and &#x27;In 1951, using the punched-card equipment available to him, Father Busa produced and published the first automated word index and concordance to four hymns written by Aquinas for the Feast of Corpus Christi, ...&#x27;<p>It&#x27;s the same Busa who had the chapter in &quot;Punched Cards&quot; about working with the Dead Sea Scrolls; the one that got me to track down the Popular Science sciation. While that chapter doesn&#x27;t establish the seminal nature, it does give an idea that the book was presenting cutting edge work with punched cards.",1443870249
