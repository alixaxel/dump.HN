So the net comparison isn&#x27;t 3.5 hours vs 7 hours of flight time (Concorde vs 747, New York to London); it&#x27;s more like 6.5 hours vs 10 hours of total cab + airport + flight time.  Either way, you&#x27;re probably tired from the trip and won&#x27;t be particularly productive, so why not pay less money for a more comfortable seat in a bigger, slower jet?<p>(While I never flew Concorde, I did babysit one in a museum.  There isn&#x27;t a single seat that isn&#x27;t cramped -- even in the cockpit.)",1445216398

Consider that this was done 17 years ago, so it&#x27;s possible that relative performance differences are very different:<p><a href=""https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/exo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/exo.html</a><p>The speedup they observed was because they could bypass <i>all</i> the layers of the OS and implement abstractions specialized to their particular use-case, making use of information that is available to the application but not to the kernel when deciding how to allocate resources.  For example, Cheetah stored preformatted IP packets on disk, which would be sent straight out to the NIC along with the file contents from the filesystem cache.  There was no need for the overhead of a TCP/IP stack, no need for buffer copies between kernel and user mode, no need for scheduler overhead as the process is put on the wait queue while waiting for the filesystem, no need for kernel-mode context switches.<p>I could imagine several similar cases with modern apps, particularly as the NUMA penalty has grown and we&#x27;ve gotten hardware technologies like RDMA.  Imagine a Node.js implementation with a locality-aware scheduler, for example: instead of running whichever closure is attached to the file descriptor that epoll happens to return, it preferentially executes the closure that was most recently enqueued, on the theory that all of its context is likely to be hot in cache.  Or imagine memcached with full control over the TLB, so that you could lock certain entries (eg. active session objects) into the TLB and never page fault on them.",1445215573

The Seattle Times analysis seems not to take that into account, but rather focuses on purely commercial aspects.<p>New passenger planes are extraordinarily expensive to develop, and only 2-3 corporations in the entire world are capable of it.<p>Boeing traditionally has introduced new models with advantageous features, then continued selling them for decades, gradually rolling out slightly modernized versions that the airlines can purchase to refresh their fleets without completely retooling to support a newer model (retraining mechanics, purchasing new parts, etc.).<p>The article argues that Boeing will take ~5 years to break even.  That actually sounds pretty good. I would give them 10-15 years.<p>The fact that only one Boeing person seems to have been consulted for this article suggests that it&#x27;s mostly speculation by outsiders and former insiders, and not a realistic analysis based on comprehensive data.

My software gives the user the most optimal pick list and the warehouse manager wanted me to change it so his team could pick from alternate bins. His justifications:<p>1. My software doesn&#x27;t know that there is a cart/ladder/forklift blocking the most optimal bin while the bin next to it is easily accessible.<p>2. My software cannot tell if QC is in middle of sampling or if Inventory team is in middle of cycle counting that exact bin.<p>3.

There&#x27;s no additional &quot;payment&quot; or transferred gain. Shorting lets the market incorporate the collective doubt earlier than it could otherwise, but it&#x27;s the same &quot;payment&quot; (share price change).<p>One could make a strong argument that shorting prevents some shareholders from taking a much bigger loss. Some shareholders would have purchased in this hypothetical run-up that short sales would soften. When &quot;it turns out this company is worth much less that they hoped and payed for,&quot; those shareholders would lose more because the difference between what they paid and what it&#x27;s worth would be larger.<p>That&#x27;s particularly true for the quintessential long-term retail investor who fundamentally believes in the company. That person is likely going to own it until the company&#x27;s product is proven or disproven, and the fluctuations in between aren&#x27;t going to affect them (other than as above, if they bought at an inflated price).<p>Shorting also creates an incentive for skepticism. One could argue that, if Theranos&#x27; technology doesn&#x27;t work, making it harder and more expensive (dilutive) for them to raise money is a service to society.<p>[1]: an arguable exception is shorting solely to make other investors lose confidence (rather than due to a negative view of the company). However (a) that&#x27;s not the case here, (b) often it&#x27;s actually the undiscovered seed of a real issue (someone has to be first..), and (c) shorting enough of a stock to meaningfully depress it is much, much tougher to do than it sounds, since the short investor will need to purchase/repay shares at some point,  the possible exposure when they do is unbounded, and they&#x27;ll need capital to cover their unrealized loss in the interim.
