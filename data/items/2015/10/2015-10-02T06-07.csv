In order to meet our priorities, I would like to redefine &quot;feature A&quot; to exclude &quot;component Z&quot;. This means we will have to do manual work around X. The following alternatives are available: (A) change the deadline, (B) move feature A to next release, (C) remove some other feature&quot;.

Take a 650nm led and a 500nm led and try turning them down slowly. The 650nm one will just go off with very limited, if any, dark adaptation. You will be able to see the led glowing, but the room won&#x27;t seem to be illuminated. With the 500nm light, there will be a wide range to which the eye can adapt easily.<p>>The cause of the nearsightedness epidemic (e.g. in East Asia) is children not going outside in the sun during the day. The details of the lamps they use at night (indoors or outdoors) are irrelevant to that.<p>The evidence for light chromaticity seems to be more convincing. It&#x27;s supported by animal models and it provides a plausible mechanism. The light intensity on the other hand is suggested by nothing but weak correlation, which could be bacause children who spend more time outside are on average exposed to less yellow light.<p>You can have a rising/setting sun in your peripheral vision without it feeling unpleasent, the lights are either way too bright, poorly constructed or there is something wrong with your eyes.

I can&#x27;t imagine how any marketing email vendor would possibly be able to distinguish between a legitimate email list (of people who signed up for it) and a list of people who didn&#x27;t, given that the list is (presumably) provided by the company that wants to send the marketing email.<p>If you get spam that&#x27;s sent via MailChimp, that&#x27;s not MailChimp&#x27;s fault, that&#x27;s the spammer&#x27;s fault. If a spammer sent you unsolicited email using their computer&#x27;s built-in mail client, would you blame that mail client for the spam? No, you&#x27;d blame the spammer. So I don&#x27;t get why you&#x27;re trying to pin the blame here on MailChimp.<p>As for the X-Mailchimp suggestion, your assertion here is laughable. Of <i>course</i> they don&#x27;t want to identify messages sent by them! Even though spamming is not their fault, they still recognize that a certain percentage of emails they sent are actually spam (they just have no way to identify that percentage ahead of time). And if they are sending enough spam, then any common identification for their emails is going to end up getting flagged as a spam indicator, which will cause all of their email to get filtered as spam (even though a lot of it isn&#x27;t spam). And since their business is sending email, having all their email filtered as spam is obviously not compatible with their business.<p>Given all that, not identifying their emails as being sent by them is not some sign that they&#x27;re doing something nefarious, it&#x27;s simply common sense.",1443766900

Most green threads implementations have an explicit determinism model, and it&#x27;s typically straightforward to reason about and depend on execution order and suchlike, much as you can with plain asynchronous code, but with Go there didn&#x27;t appear to be any guarantee when or how your code ran.<p>In any case I suppose many styles of Go program will exhibit accidental determinism, but it still seems too difficult to depend on as randomness can be introduced simply by invoking the wrong function, or by using a different runtime version, which to me feels comparable to the hazards of raw multithreading.",1443766066

The result is sort of microfoamy (but usually more like soap-foamy), but doesn&#x27;t have the particular flavour that you get from steamed milk.<p>I&#x27;m (notoriously, among my friends, and probably obnoxiously too) finicky about milk froth quality, and the best solution I have found is a stovetop frother.<p>You have to heat the milk to the right temperature (the steam wand actually works great for this), and then use the plunger for 10-15 seconds. Weirdly enough, the result is almost perfect microfoam.
