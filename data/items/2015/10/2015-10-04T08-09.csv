But the job of robot repairman is a more intellectually difficult job than the factory workers had in the first place.<p>Hundreds of years ago, 95% of jobs could be done with a two-digit IQ, because they were things like ploughing fields and herding goats. But we&#x27;ve been automating all the easy jobs and creating new, more fulfilling jobs, and getting richer in the process.<p>At some point though, which I think is right about now, we cross the point where less than 50% of the jobs can be done with a two-digit IQ. We no longer need manual labourers, we need people who can design and maintain robots. And the fact is that 50% of the population <i>is</i> of below-median intelligence and will have trouble doing these new jobs.<p>What do we do with all these people who are incapable of performing any worthwhile role? In the longer run perhaps we can genetically engineer people so that everyone can be a robot engineer.

This was entirely within the ideological position of one of the coalition partners, but was a bit of a u-turn for the other partner with rather drastic results in terms of support.<p>The Student Loan Company in the UK has to borrow money at commercial interest rates in the financial markets.

It isn&#x27;t clear to me if there will actually be any net saving to the taxpayer at all - I recollect seeing (but can&#x27;t find a reference at present) an analysis that suggested that the policy will actually cost more money compared with the previous direct grant system for the next 20 years or so.

10326904,comment,10324480,10325712,0,0,terminalcommand,,,"T1D for 10 years here, I&#x27;m now 20. The longer you live with T1D, the risk of getting a complication worsens. 
The sad fact is you can&#x27;t control it all the time, the hormonal changes, your stress levels etc. all have an impact on your glucose levels.
Especially if you are young, you want to show people that you&#x27;re not a disabled person, that you can work harder and achieve the same if not better results than the others.
The immediate result of this is that your glucose levels fluctuate, your health deteriorates. 
But complications are in your opinion worse consequences that could happen to you. You are adjusted to seeing blurry, feeling dizzy, vomiting, losing weight from time to time. You generally feel sick. You can cope with that, but having a permanent disability, like going blind, losing a foot... You suspect things, but ignore them because you don&#x27;t want to face reality, you know that something is wrong but you think you can handle it, because you&#x27;ve been feeling sick all your life.
The doctors do know what complications may arise, but living with T1D, they have no clue. You always need to be conscious of lows, aware of highs. After a point, if you&#x27;re a teen you just ignore it. Low blood sugar can kill you immediately, but highs, you can live with them.
My best advice would be: eating less carbs, getting blood tests and eye examinations regularly and hoping for the best. I wish I had the willpower to follow these all the time.",1443947190

So long as the practice is done deliberately and evaluated honestly, I think a quiet ego is an unavoidable result.  (A hint: look out for spasms of defensiveness or other hypocrisy in yourself, since these are exactly the parts which deserve more attention.[1]  Don&#x27;t miss your responses to noticing these things, either.  Also look for exactly what in the world you identify with, and what process is involved in this identification, when you refer to &#x27;I&#x27;.)<p>For something more from a particular tradition, &quot;Mindfulness in Plain English&quot; is a reasonably good start.<p>One confusing thing is the use of the word &quot;ego,&quot; by the way.  A good working definition is &quot;a belief that the self is more than a mental construct,&quot; and so &quot;loud ego&quot; refers to putting this belief at the forefront of one&#x27;s life.  Note that this has nothing to do with believing in a self, the construct of self most certainly exists[2] and is useful (though likely not in the way you think it does or is).  This is in contrast to Freudian &#x27;ego&#x27; which is, as I understand it, the mediator between superego and subconscious.  Like, as an analogy, your stomach is an important organ, but it has its rightful place.  There&#x27;s no need for structuring your life around, elevating, and identifying with the stomach as the seat of conscious experience.  (Though we do structure our lives around eating. The stomach, digestive system, and body still need food to exist after all...)<p>[1] A related feeling which I&#x27;m sure people in the knowledge business would recognize is that unpleasant sensation of coming into contact with something confusing.  If the goal is understanding a subject, then this is a good indicator for the things which could use more work, but it is surprising how resistant we can be to realizing it: it&#x27;s as if confusing things sometimes become invisible!<p>[2] I&#x27;m ontologically uncomfortable to be categorically claiming this, but it seems true enough to me.",1443946801
