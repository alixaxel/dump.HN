10379385,comment,10377467,10378798,0,0,crdb,,,"It&#x27;s been a long time and I took a break from music until I could actually enjoy it again. I vaguely remember the track being (I think) &quot;one more time&quot; and so there was the voice/instrumental motif accompanying the rather limited lyrics, the motif that opens the song fading in and continues as the background, maybe the drum motif in the background, and the number of times it was repeated (I think over 200 times). There&#x27;s also a timbral modulation some time later and some drum changes marking structural changes. And a bell at the end.<p>What is more interesting, and hard to really discuss if you are not familiar with the genre (which I was not and still am not) is why the song writers would use them and what they reference explicitly and implicitly and so on. I would love for anyone to tell me more about the song and its context!<p>Actually, thinking about music, or anything, like this is terrible. I read a book on Japanese architecture whose author (an awarded architecture professor from the US) I have forgotten which was basically listing as context-less observations everything she saw. For example &quot;and this is a join typical of the suki-ya house, it&#x27;s made by hand out of this wood and with these tools. Then it goes here. The suki-ya house has a table here used for writing. The walls are made with plaster over a bamboo mesh.&quot; etc. I learnt very little, although I knew a lot of factoids afterwards. But there are writers (like Marc Peter Keane [1]) who are much better, because they introduce everything with their meaning and where they stand in the tradition and mindset and history of the culture that produced it.<p>[1] e.g. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Garden-Design-Marc-Keane/dp/0804838569"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Garden-Design-Marc-Keane/dp/0...</a> which is actually a nice very basic introduction to how Japanese history shaped its aesthetics.",1444730105

10379376,comment,10378219,10378662,0,0,reubenbond,,,"The Virtual Actor model implemented in Orleans differs from what OTP & Akka offer in that Virtual Actors have managed lifecycles and are never created or destroyed. Instead, they are activated when needed (fetching state from storage if needed) and deactivated when idle.<p>This helps you to reason about your system. You can never know if a node will fail at any point in time (in any system), but with Orleans you can be sure that an actor will be reactivated on a surviving node in event of a failure. In other words, you can continually message actor X without worrying about ever having to reinstantiate it on another node due to failure.<p>By default, Orleans maintains an eventually consistent mapping of actors to nodes (called silos) and relies on the storage layer to give strong consistency. Most of the default storage providers offer strong consistency.<p>By the way, Service Fabric includes an implementation of Virtual Actors which differ in a couple of ways:
1. The actors are placed using consistent hashing. Actor Ids are mapped to a range of partitions, the replicas of which can be moved between nodes in case of failure.
2. Actor state is physically stored on the actor node by default. Because Service Fabric uses distributed consensus to implement stateful services, they can persist each actors state in the partition which it belongs to. The state is replicated to a quorum of replicas on each write.",1444729950

FPGA&#x27;s are used in situations where it&#x27;s not commercially viable to spin your own chips and where you can offset the high cost of FPGA&#x27;s to your consumer.<p>If anything the &quot;future&quot; might be in on-demand core configs similar to how modern ARM SOC&#x27;s are being built from a combination of &quot;small&quot; and &quot;big&quot; cores with different features and performance head space that allows for more efficient power usage for small devices.<p>So core-specific optimizations for different applications (Database, Web Server, Video Streaming etc.) might be quite possible especially when combined with user-programmable micro-code might be much better than FPGA&#x27;s.
Basically you might have a dedicated CPU (that you might even be able to partial design yourself by submitting VLSI code or something similar) which is specifically tuned for your application e.g. a web application server CPU with 4 big cores that handle executing the application code it self, with additional smaller cores that handle things like HTTP, SSL, session cache etc. each with dedicated register/extensions optimized for those actions e.g. LZMA or AES extensions.",1444728101

It would be much easier to parallelize the code that can be easily be parallelized if the gpu context is the same as the cpu context.<p>The second part I think is up to compilers. If we can make better compilers for gpu code which integrate more nicely with cpu code then the super low level programming won&#x27;t be as necessary. GPUs haven&#x27;t been in the limelight nearly as long as CPUs, so it&#x27;s understandable that most modern languages are made for CPU code.

10379264,comment,10378752,10379197,0,0,tinco,,,"A few years ago when I was still learning Haskell and typeclasses I was a bit surprised to learn that Haskell had this fancy typeclass feature but prelude hardly made use of it. I had been using Haskell for over a year already and didn&#x27;t understand one of its best features because it wasn&#x27;t exposed to me. A bit disgruntled I asked in the IRC channel about this and they explained to me that this was actually intentional.<p>It was at that time thought that by keeping prelude simple (pure FP 101 style) it was more accessible to new programmers.<p>Apparently that mindset was reconsidered recently.<p>So the big downside is that now if you teach Haskell and want to use Prelude, you&#x27;ll be forced to almost immediately teach typeclasses.<p>In my opinion that&#x27;s not a bad thing at all. Typeclasses put Haskell (and FP in general) right in league with big feature languages like C# and Java. All big features of Haskell are implemented using typeclasses (such as the reputable IO monad). Not teaching that as a fundamental feature right at the beginning only makes the next hurdle of the more category theory heavy advanced features of Haskell that much higher.",1444727270

I&#x27;d agree with that, and even say it&#x27;s much more fun than other languages I&#x27;ve used (Python, Java, Ruby, etc).<p>But in the end I don&#x27;t think it actually enables us to do anything that we haven&#x27;t been able to do before, so it&#x27;s probably not as significant as Deep Learning in that respect. To be completely honest, I am not convinced it has huge practical application, as I don&#x27;t think it will ever be picked up by industry in its current form.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t think it will be adopted by industry is that a company&#x27;s concerns are typically not really aligned with a programming language researcher&#x27;s concerns. For example, a company probably wants a language that is easy to hire for and easy to train for, and Haskell is definitely neither of these things. Also, from what I&#x27;ve heard, it&#x27;s very difficult to debug and benchmark Haskell programs, perhaps due to its laziness.<p>Take all this with a grain of salt though as I&#x27;ve only been learning it for 1 year and read the majority of two books on it; I&#x27;m far from an expert.",1444727171
