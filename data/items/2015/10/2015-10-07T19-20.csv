If they can&#x27;t even validate the psychiatric drugs we&#x27;re giving to people, how can we expect them to make sweeping decisions for an entire population? It&#x27;s not paranoia at that scale, it&#x27;s just kicking the tires to see if our government actually has the wherewithal to make these kinds of decisions. It seems extremely obvious to me they don&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ve only seen positive change on this front in the last ~seven years at the NIH, FDA, and DEA in terms of recognizing and resolving these past issues.<p>And it&#x27;s not so much that there was a mandate to prescribe risperidone, more that they prescribed me a very, very shitty medication when I was a ward of the state. It&#x27;s their responsibility to ensure the doctors and RNs have accurate, up to date knowledge of the medication they&#x27;re educated to prescribe by the FDA.

If you don&#x27;t think propaganda will align &quot;drug-de-jour&quot; with vaccination, you can go back half a century in the history books and find some surprising artwork. The point is that it&#x27;s a bad precedent to coerce. The whole idea of the federal hammer (all-or-nothing) has betrayed the notions of community and local governance. I see the discussions on Nextdoor.com for my neighborhood, but it&#x27;s ultimately left up to the Feds to mandate. Why aren&#x27;t the states doing this?

Again, what does Reddit&#x27;s unique position as an all-visible userbase have to do with the <i>actual experience of the user</i>? We can make excuses and explanations for why Reddit is the way it is, but that doesn&#x27;t ultimately address the fact that Reddit, despite being massively popular now, also hosts content so horribly offensive that it risks alienating both common users and advertisers.<p>Your city analogy doesn&#x27;t quite fit. People who live in a city are often &#x27;stuck&#x27; there for far more important reasons (money, family, culture) than the reasons people stick to a website.

Or knock.<p>But then maybe I hear about a terrifying disease currently spreading via the saliva of the oogeyboogeyfly, who will chew through untreated bednets, or insecticidal nets older than 6 months, to bite sleeping people, and only new ones treated with skellingtol will work to stop them.<p>In that case, there was<p><pre><code>  - an overriding concern for public safety, from an actual threat

Sure, it&#x27;s the civilized thing to do, but why is the justification to <i>compel</i> it?<p>(And yes, the &quot;anti-vax&quot; &quot;movement&quot; is disgusting - a fine example of the stupidity of crowds. Unfortunately, defending freedom often means defending scoundrels).<p>There&#x27;s a similar argument around fire coverage. The common argument against a more libertarian approach to fire fighting is that if someone&#x27;s house catches fire and is left to burn, then it will easily spread to neighbors, increasing their risk. And this the obvious physical reality, especially where things are dense.<p>But since those neighbors are the only concerned parties, then why (in principle) is that additional risk not theirs to bear and mitigate? It cannot cost any more than the neighbors splitting the cost of the fire protection on the unprotected building. Practically, the fire department would just pool that overhead across all customers.<p>Of course there is the issue of long term second-order effects - freeloading - since most likely if you didn&#x27;t pay the fire department would still try to extinguish your house as quick as possible (possibly just busting it up a bit more in the process). But making coverage mandatory <i>also</i> ignores long term second-order effects when an organization does not have to be responsive to the people it serves (which is usually then handwaved away with the wisdom-of-crowds fallacy).<p>The root of the disagreement comes from different thinking about what society actually <i>is</i>. Is it a monolithic system we&#x27;re all bound to and the only way to change it is top-down? Or is it the constructive result of the surplus that everyone is willing to bring to the table, implying that an individual should have the option to quit the game and take their ball - even if that individual then watches from the sideline or even returns to play but without their ball?<p>Both perspectives are needed, but every society is predisposed towards over-centralization - most people have a very hard time seeing anything besides their own perspective, so they falsely think their desires apply to everyone. Yet as demonstrated by the success of free markets, only decentralization can satisfy and incorporate minority viewpoints.

That to me suggests that what happens is that small conflicts can grow into larger conflicts, and more importantly the larger the conflict the more likely it is to grow bigger.

These tools are so powerful that can capture your `require` statements and convert your &quot;non-javascript&quot; required modules to something that javascript can use.<p>In a similar way I&#x27;m using webpack & css-loader. My JSX file looks like this :<p><pre><code>    // Component.jsx

    var styles = require(&#x27;./Component.css&#x27;); // Component.css is a normal css file that has a .component class inside

    class Component extends React.Component {
       render() { return ( <div className={ styles.component }></div> ) }
    }
</code></pre>
Now your webpack / browserify tools captures those require files, parses their class names and outputs a concatenated &quot;stylesheets.css&quot; file that has all the class names with a hash prefix. And the final Html/Css look like this :<p><pre><code>    <div class=&quot;_12az2X&quot;></div>

1. The people who control what vaccines the Government reccomends are &quot;close&quot; to the people that profit from the vaccines. For example Paul Offit, one of the louder pro-vaxies, voted to put a vaccine on the schedule and he had a patent to a similar vaccine. 3 years later he sold his patent for $182 million.<p>2. The Government has proven that it can be tricked (Volkswagen) and influenced by big money so its easy to not trusts the Governments medical recomendations, and reports.<p>3. Since 1986 vax manufactuers can not be sued for hurting your kid because of the NCVIA. Since 1986 the amount of vaccines that have been added to the schedule has increased. Anybody over 30 did not have as many or the same vaccines that are recommend for children now.<p>Pro-vax
1. Vaccines have eradicated issues that were deadly in the past<p>2. Vax works best if we all do it.<p>3. Yeah vax may hurt you but a seat belt could hurt you too. Still the majority of the time it is safer to where the seat belt.<p>4. I had vax and I&#x27;m fine so my kids can have vax.<p>5.

Two CDOs might both derive their returns from home mortgages in the general Las Vegas area, but their return flows won&#x27;t come from the same houses.  This is very different from stocks, where any two shares in some company are equivalent (provided they&#x27;re of the same share class).  When pricing ABS, people try to pretend they are interchangeable, which is where the fancy computing and dodgy modelling comes in.<p>My use of the word &#x27;bespoke&#x27; here is somewhat poetic.  CDO issuers are more likely to build a CDO and try sell it than they are to make them to custom specifications.  (Investment banks did make custom CDOs & CDSs, of course.  If an investor calls up and says &quot;can you find X, and sell me some&quot;, you find X and sell him some.<p>And yes, you can&#x27;t just buy an MBS through your broker (unless you&#x27;re incredibly rich).  You can invest in mutual funds that own a wide variety of MBS, of course.  But these things just aren&#x27;t sold to retail investors.  This is not so much because of the size of the assets involved --  you can slice off and sell as small a slice of the assets as you want -- but because the fixed costs of arranging a sale are high.  You need to pay lawyers who know what the hell they&#x27;re doing to set up the legal arrangements for these contracts.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense for Uncle Stocktrader to drop $$$$$ just so he can buy a $$$ slice of a CDO.  Much easier to pool the costs in a mutual fund or a money market.",1444246216

scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics ‘global climate
change’ or ‘global warming’. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed
AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing
a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second
phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of
self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW,
97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors’ self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements
among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that
the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.</i><p><a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/0240...</a>",1444246094

Because changing the style might have affected the position, the browser will have to render parts or whole of the page in order to give you that information.

Advanced nuclear designs regularly claim 25 year timeframes for design, qualification testing, licensing activities, supply chain development, and construction. Transatomic is proposing concepts that require long qualification and licensing developments, many of which could make meaningful progress in a small lab with a $10M initial budget. You have to produce your salt fuel and do materials testing with surrogate fission products (e.g. stable isotopes) over long periods of time.
