He probably has a pretty good idea of how beneficial living in Brazil would be for his family.<p>He&#x27;s also very wealthy and can afford to give all his kids personal language tutors if he/they want to learn another language.

If they moved there, they wouldn&#x27;t be living or going to school with your average Brazilian, they&#x27;d be living in a wealthy neighborhood and going to an English-language international school. They live in one of the wealthiest places in the US, so they probably attend very good schools right now.<p>Since they&#x27;re Mormon, many of these kids will end up being missionaries in foreign countries and learning another language anyway and getting a decent perspective on the world outside Connecticut since their living environment as a missionary will be roughly equivalent to the average person wherever they&#x27;re assigned.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate the importance of high school sports to kids that love them and are in high school. I&#x27;d rather my kids have four years of positive team sporting experience than learn Portuguese. One can learn and grow from sports in many ways even if they don&#x27;t become a professional athlete.<p>As for what will best help their career, it&#x27;s probably the stable familiar living environment they currently have at a private school that will best prepare them to get into a good college and do well there.

>Furthermore, national security, public interest and law enforcement
requirements of the United States prevail over the safe harbour scheme, so that United States
undertakings are bound to disregard, without limitation, the protective rules laid down by that
scheme where they conflict with such requirements. The United States safe harbour scheme
thus enables interference, by United States public authorities, with the fundamental rights of
persons, and the Commission decision does not refer either to the existence, in the United States,
of rules intended to limit any such interference or to the existence of effective legal protection
against the interference.<p>>This judgment has the consequence that the Irish supervisory authority is required to examine Mr Schrems’
complaint with all due diligence and, at the conclusion of its investigation, is to decide
whether, pursuant to the directive, transfer of the data of Facebook’s European subscribers
to the United States should be suspended on the ground that that country does not afford
an adequate level of protection of personal data.<p>My reading (not a legal expert) is that data residency is the important bit here. Which in my view is a small step but not sufficient.",1444120179

Your manager is aware of the situation and tried, but failed to get the co-worker to change their behaviour.<p>To make life easy for you, I&#x27;ll lay out your options:<p>- Go to your manager with a plan for improving the co-worker&#x27;s behaviour.  Any other conversation about it will be pointless because the manager has shown that they are unable to fix the problem without help.<p>- Go to your co-worker and find a way to convince them to change their behaviour.  Remember that the manager has already tried and failed at this.  You will have to try an approach other than saying &quot;I would really like you to change your behaviour&quot;.<p>- Engineer the termination of employment of the co-worker by means fair or foul. (Note that going above your direct manager or to HR is essentially an attempt in this direction).<p>- Find a way to be happy in your work, despite your co-worker&#x27;s behaviour.<p>- Engineer your own termination of employment.<p>I think only one of these approaches is easy and none are without risk.  If you are willing and able to help your co-worker, this is likely to have the best possible outcome. The chances for success, though, are vanishingly small.<p>Improving the quality of the team by engineering other people&#x27;s termination is something that is not so difficult if you know how to do it, but it rather paints a big arrow at your head with the caption &quot;I am evil&quot;.  Whether you want to go down this route is entirely up to you.  It often makes your team happy at the expense of the person you are targeting.<p>Finding a way to be happy despite the poor behaviour of your colleagues is a very nice outcome for yourself, personally, but it doesn&#x27;t do much to help others who share your situation.  Still, if you wait long enough, the co-worker in questions may gather enough rope to hang themselves.<p>Finally, you can leave.  Knowing when you have had enough is a wonderful wisdom to have.  There are risks, as you have said and nobody can evaluate them for you.<p>It&#x27;s not a good situation to be in.  It&#x27;s not entirely uncommon, though, given the short period of time people tend to stay in groups in this field, you are likely to encounter the situation again sometime in the future.

Can&#x27;t think of a more important feature that needs standardization than intents. So once this gets standardized:<p>- Mozilla probably will implement, because (barring minor transgressions) they care about users more than everyone else.<p>- Microsoft may, because any chance of increasing their 2.5% market share depends on maximal interop and web-apps being a genuine cross-platform solution to make up for the lack of apps in their App store.<p>- Apple and Safari. This is going to take time, if ever. They might even come up with their own solution, requiring developers to implement two solutions to do the same thing. Strategy-wise, web apps becoming more potent is not in their interest.",1444118644

This article makes me wonder how many people like Ballmer and Balsillie had already been presented with similar ideas and had rejected them.<p>When the iPhone came out, I felt that the clones weren&#x27;t so much people copying Apple but creative engineers being unshackled and being allowed to make what they wanted.",1444118548

He&#x27;s right that nearly all attributions of famous quotes to famous people turn out bogus—the real sources are usually obscure and often interesting. They&#x27;re also often more recent than you&#x27;d think. Who knows if that 1970 find is the origin of this one (probably not), but it&#x27;s exactly the sort of thing that could be.<p>A great resource for these is the Quote Investigator, an anonymous researcher who has slowly been building up an impressive portfolio of all the well-known catchy quotes.
