The company was drowning in the possibilities provided by the incredibly valuable real time data it holds. It&#x27;s not an easy task but what they&#x27;ve failed to do is organise and deliver all that data in a way that provides value.<p>Specifically, the user experience is horrible. The argument from people who love Twitter is that those who don&#x27;t enjoy Twitter need to refine their stream, follow carefully and proactively curate their feed. In my opinion that&#x27;s bullshit, and the onus should not be on users to find value in Twitter&#x27;s data! Instead they should be able to enter their interests and Twitter should do the heavy lifting to give them relevant and interesting information.<p>If every time I open my Twitter feed I find interesting news, information and new contacts I&#x27;m going to keep coming back and engage with the platform.",1444467497

Reducing emissions in lab tests may very well result in car designs that have reduced road emissions.</i><p>This is the logic that European politicians have used in the past.<p>If there were a direct relationship between lab test emissions and real-world emissions, that approach may be acceptable. Unfortunately, that is not the case.<p>In the case of NOx, implementing the Euro standards <i>should</i> have resulted in an 80% reduction in emissions over the past 15 years. As the vehicle fleet is renewed, that <i>should</i> have translated into significant reductions in kerbside NOx levels. But this has not happened, and London continues to suffer some of the worst NOx levels in the world.<p>It turns out that an 80% reduction in lab test emissions has not translated into anything like an 80% reduction in real-world emissions - not even close!<p>The current system is inadequate because manufacturers simply &quot;design for the test&quot;. There is huge real-world variability between vehicles that may record very similar lab test scores. A vehicle may claim similar test score results as another, but in fact have hugely differing levels of emissions in the real world.<p>Test environments need to reflect real-world conditions!",1444467432

10364924,comment,10364197,10364577,0,0,beagle3,,,">  It doesn&#x27;t store them, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t, say, try to make them available in a searchable away to everyone in the world.<p>Back of the envelope calculation: If your messages are 256 char messages, on a 128GB ram server you can fit 500 billion of them in memory; incidentally, that&#x27;s one day&#x27;s worth of tweets these days. I recently got a quote for a beefy 256GB ram server from Dell for $6,000. To make things easier, let&#x27;s assume $10,000 with redundant 1TB SSD and everything else you might need. The data is extremely easy to shard.<p>With proper caching, you can probably keep 99.9999% of all tweets shown in just one such servers, and serve them within a few ms. I don&#x27;t have recent experience with web frontends, but a properly configured nginx could probably server on meager hardware can do a few tens-of-thousands requests per second. a Seastar server on beefy hardware can probably handle a significant percentage of Twitter&#x27;s load.<p>Search is a little harder, but not by much.<p>Is this engineering trivial? Far from it. But I&#x27;ve worked with stunt programmers who can build this in a few months with a 3 person team. At least one of them commands a salary of about $500K last I heard.<p>Is that all Twitter is doing? No, I&#x27;m sure they have 10 backend &quot;things&quot; for every user visible &quot;thing&quot;. They needed something like Bootstrap for <i>internal</i> use, after all. I don&#x27;t really believe you can run Twitter with just $1M/year in capex, just $1M/year in opex and just $1M/year in engineering salary - you need a whole lot more than that; In fact, to pull in revenue of $2B/year (which Twitter seems to be on track for), you probably need 50 people just in accounting.<p>What I am saying, though, is that the technical challenges faced by Twitter (at least those that are visible to users) are highly overrated. If you know what you are doing, Twitter can be run on $50,000 worth of hardware; This has been true since 2007 - Computers were weaker and had less memory then, but Twitter had much less traffic too. I&#x27;ve looked at the numbers every single year since 2007, and at any point in time, the &quot;bare bones essential hardware for interactive response&quot; was in the $50,000 range. Which probably means if they spent more than $1M/year on hardware (or depreciation-equivalent-hosting) at any point in time, they should have hired better engineers.",1444466851

In &#x27;software development&#x27; &#x27;good&#x27; is usually connected to writing clear, maintainable, test covered code. In most scientific research it means something completely different. I think on HN most adhere to the former definition of good and in that sense most researchers (especially in physics, but also CS / ML) are not &#x27;good&#x27; according to that definition (because you need quite a lot of years of experience in a corporate setting usually) and actually even bad. But the code works <i>and</i> implements the concepts in their papers so they are &#x27;good&#x27; in that respect. That is more rapid prototyping to make a POC to show it works, after which you properly rewrite it.",1444464963

Almost certainly this has been an issue of walking backwards into a big mistake little by little, which is the typical process of making big mistakes. You start by figuring out how to game the system right at &quot;the line&quot; as much as you can, then the day comes where you decide to be more explicit about it and build it into the software. You probably decide that you just want to play around at the edges, with incremental differences between &quot;cheat mode&quot; and real driving in the same realm as the bit by bit gaming they&#x27;ve been doing already. But once the system exists the natural process of optimization would push it to the limit of what was capable, and it turned out that was a lot. But by then you&#x27;re committed, and it would take a lot of fortitude to walk back from such a mistake.<p>I&#x27;m sure the same sorts of dynamics have played out in many other auto makers, though it&#x27;s notable that some, with a more developed sense of ethics seemingly, have not gone down that road.",1444464957

Open API&#x27;s, good documentation and community engagement goes a long way in establishing developer trust.  I don&#x27;t believe developer trust is correlated significantly with revenue (directly), but it&#x27;s absolutely correlated with acquisition.  I&#x27;d argue that Angular or React were partially successful because of the stickiness of their communities, and that&#x27;s a powerful self-perpetuating force.<p>2. Monetization is in the queries.  Facebook and Google know this.  Throwing aside all of their auxiliary services, emerging markets, hardware, et al... between 70-90% of their respective revenue is from direct advertising.  If there&#x27;s a way to scale or &quot;ramp&quot; their revenue model, this would be the portion to focus on.",1444464312
