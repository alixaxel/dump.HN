For most economies, it would take a concerted act by a central bank to force deflation in a normal, growing economy. People are making more, spending more. The government has to print more money to keep up, otherwise it will fall short of people&#x27;s needs. Only in special circumstances does this not hold up.<p>> I don&#x27;t see a benefit to prioritizing the interests of debtors over savers.<p>There&#x27;s a huge benefit. We want to encourage economic activity over inactivity. Money in circulation is the very definition of economic activity. Money saved is the very definition of economic inactivity. Nobody borrows money unless they want to spend it, it makes no sense to borrow it just so you can keep it in the bank or under a mattress. Money borrowed is money invested.",1445932442

That&#x27;s it.<p>The censorship blocks alternate opinions from forming around issues everyone knows about - for example everyone knows about the Cultral Revolution in China, but the interpretation of it is strictly controlled by the gov in a way that protects the CCPs legitimacy and Maos legacy.<p>It also stops news about the broken state of the system ever being revealed. For example corruption - occasionally a corrupt official gets &#x27;outed&#x27; on social media and when that happens, the government often has to do something - the official gets sacked or investigated. BUT, it&#x27;s rare it gets to that state. Now imagine if they had a free press or free internet - they&#x27;d have to sack half the government within a week, given the scale of the corruption!<p>Finally, most of the censorship is also aimed at killing activism before it even starts. Online movements never get off the ground, people never coalesce around an issue, the power of the people is never allowed to gather and grow to rival the power of the state/police/political elites.

This ConvNet doesn&#x27;t really answer the question &quot;What makes a good selfie&quot;. It answers a much narrower and more complicated to state question.<p>The absence of reflection in the system means that if it&#x27;s used to answer a question that&#x27;s superficially similar to the designer&#x27;s intent, there&#x27;s no way to reason around the bias in the training data.<p>Imagine I&#x27;m a Canadian who trains an automated turret to classify friend / foe based on data from Afghanistan and Iraq. I&#x27;ve not trained the system to answer &quot;Is this group of pixels a friend / foe&quot;, in the general sense. If the system is used outside the narrow context of its validity, say in Northern Ireland, or in a civilian Muslim neighbourhood in Paris, we should expect bad results.<p>So you&#x27;re right to point out that the racism is in the social context. But I&#x27;m arguing that we don&#x27;t actually want a classifier to learn that if there&#x27;s a good chance it&#x27;ll be used in a way that discards or ignores that social context.

I&#x27;m also in the process of building another very large front-end in Vue.js at the moment.<p>The big thing is that while I personally adore React, it does require ceremony to get stock-standard behaviour. We recently onboarded a new developer (a friend of mine), and teaching him React + Flux (Alt.js) was infinitely more difficult than teaching him Vue.js -- the &quot;thicker&quot; API (which is still an order of magnitude thinner than Angular or Ember) means you don&#x27;t need to either reach out to other libraries to achieve tasks that you otherwise would need to in React.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not a bad thing on React&#x27;s side; it&#x27;s a view-layer, not much more. That&#x27;s okay, and a good thing! For building components rapidly in a regular &quot;client -> designer -> cut-up -> development&quot; workflow, Vue.js is streets ahead of React in terms of code required. But for building very large applications, React&#x27;s smaller API means that you can guarantee behaviour<i>, and things are consistent.<p>Basically, they are both brilliant libraries. I highly recommend both. React and Vue.js are similar in a lot of ways: they&#x27;re both tiny little view layers that are component focused and have modern, ecosystem aware build tooling. They differ in that Vue.js is &quot;classical&quot; (though not really, it&#x27;s far nicer than the older systems) MVVM which has been proven time and time again to be a good architectural choice, whereas React.js takes a more functional (as in programming) approach to the problem -- though I&#x27;d argue not far enough down the functional side, which is why I&#x27;ve been enjoying Cycle.js so much!<p></i> unless you get bitten by event pooling...",1445931472

Anything bigger has to be done through shared memory between processes.  This is great for the kernel; it never has to do a long operation like a big copy, so there&#x27;s an upper bound on the time for each kernel operation.  But with shared memory, one process may be able to mess up another.  The usual library for L4 shared memory puts multiple &quot;chunks&quot; into one shared memory area, with an allocator. &quot;A shared memory area can have multiple chunks.&quot;[1]  Messing with the chunk structure or the wrong chunk from one process may adversely affect another one.  That&#x27;s a bad kind of attack surface.<p>So, although the kernel is secure, server processes with higher privileges than their callers may not be.  Since this is how processes talk to file systems and drivers, it&#x27;s an obvious way to attack.<p>QNX copies data from one process space to another.  This adds copying overhead, but it&#x27;s usually not too bad, because 1) most messages are short, and 2) if you just created a message and sent it, it&#x27;s in the cache.  In practice, the big overhead item today is context switching.<p>[1] <a href=""http://l4re.org/doc/group__api__l4shm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://l4re.org/doc/group__api__l4shm.html</a>",1445930638

The rules have been the same before you got hitched, you knew perfectly well that it is unlikely that she would work in the US (unless she gets an H1 on her own) \nAnd I don&#x27;t understand this fascination of getting a green card; what does that give you? You can still lose your job and be paid unemployment checks which wouldn&#x27;t cover your rent/mortgage.\nFull disclosure: The whole discussion on H1 crippling careers etc is just BS. If you have the talent and more importantly persistence you can achieve your career goals. I always remind people, the rules have been laid out by USCIS, it is what it is. You can either sit on your backsides complaining of how unjust they are or get an I140 and keep extending your H1B and continue towards your career goals.

In fact I like it more than React, which I am not using (still a happy Backbone user).<p>A thought that I share, from the guide:<p>&quot;API-wise, one issue with React (or JSX) is that the render function often involves a lot of logic, and ends up looking more like a piece of program (which in fact it is) rather than a visual representation of the interface. For some developers this is a bonus, but for designer/developer hybrids like me, having a template makes it much easier to think visually about the design and CSS. JSX mixed with JavaScript logic breaks that visual model I need to map the code to the design. In contrast, Vue.js pays the cost of a lightweight data-binding DSL so that we have a visually scannable template and with logic encapsulated into directives and filters.&quot;<p>What do you think?",1445929954

One stems from production, transportation, and financial improvements across the board, the other comes because fewer people want to buy anything.<p>That&#x27;s true, but they are measured the same way: through the nominal value of goods and services. The people that the economists are worried about, consumers, only have the price of goods to guide them, they have no information as to whether the falling price is due to improvements in efficiency or lack of demand.<p>>It&#x27;s not so much about consumers delaying spending. It&#x27;s what happens further up the chain. If the holders of wealth that seed the economy figure out that it&#x27;s better for them to hold on to their >assets rather than invest them, then people lose jobs. We need them to keep investing their money.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve read this as being the main driver of the theory previously. To me, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense since theories concerning deflation don&#x27;t make any predictions concerning the return on investment. If deflation is uniform, then the return should stay the same since the cost of inputs should fall as well. If deflation isn&#x27;t uniform, then you&#x27;d see changes in the allocation of resources as some industries make large profits due to falling input costs, while other industries might go bust due to their input costs staying the same even while their sell prices fall.<p>Personally, I think that that productivity growth is far more important than deflation and will compensate for any short term negative effects that deflation might or might not bring.",1445929210
