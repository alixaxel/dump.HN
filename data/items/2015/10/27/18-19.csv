Also, people are very passionate because it involves strong political opinions (remember when Mayor Bloomberg tried to ban big gulps of soda in NYC), and also personal feelings (overweight people addicted to sugar).<p>It&#x27;s not unlike the discussions on climate change.",1445972349

I&#x27;ve been in <i>many</i> educational environments ranging from home school to private college prep high school, to suburban high school, to inner city high school, to <i>the</i> ghetto school in the area.<p>There were good and bad teachers in all of those.  However, the good teachers may as well have not had existed in the inner city/ghetto schools.  Their talents were 100% wasted, and those classrooms would have been far better served with a police officer in front of the classroom who was enabled to boot the dysfunctional future criminals from the classroom.  With those students in class, there was no point in even calling it school.  Call it daycare, or juvie, or whatever you like - learning wasn&#x27;t much of the process though.<p>I find it hard to blame teachers when their job is primarily daycare, and they have zero tools available to them to deal with poorly performing and disruptive students who have no business being in the classroom.<p>tldr;  Almost all the US education problems can directly be tied back to the parents.  Full stop.<p>This goes for my private schooling as well.  The college prep school I went to was probably more diverse than the inner city school - the only difference was the self-selection of the students and parents who attended.  They also taught with about half the funds.<p>That said, there are tons of horrible teachers too.  The problems go far deeper though, and until you solve the parenting problem you may as well shut the public school system down in many areas.  No amount of epic-level teachers will be able to get anything done in those environments.",1445972315

Plan on a spot for wifi and cable modem.<p>2. Assume that single wire to your cable modem will need to be replaced, so don&#x27;t make it too hard to get to, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d bother with a conduit. It&#x27;s possible that even the main net connection will be wireless one day, but for now it&#x27;s cable, satellite, DSL, or Google Fiber, typically.<p>3. Large conduit for what they call &quot;low voltage wiring&quot; (HDMI, etc.) to where you always want your T.V. <i>may</i> be a good idea, but wireless video being normal is not far off.<p>4. Wireless power is not happening anytime soon, so be sure that you have outlets everywhere you&#x27;d need them, including in the ceiling if you think you&#x27;ll need a bridge or repeater. Note that repeaters kind of suck, so hopefully you can just get by with one or more wifi routers instead. If you can&#x27;t then that is the one (or so) cat6e cables you&#x27;d need to run, because POE isn&#x27;t a great fallback.<p>The non-networking stuff to think about:<p>* Putting holes in a countertop for wires if you want to hide outlets. Only recommend that for places where the outlet is easily accessible, otherwise the wire going into the outlet would get in the way of storage space or cause fires.<p>* Insulation! Get the best you can, imo. Most builders skimp, but you&#x27;ll regret it. Insulate all doors, etc. to storage space. Might not want to fill electrical boxes with foam unless you really need it, since that can be a mess.<p>* Get a nice garage door opener and consider insulating garage door.<p>* Go ahead and get a recommended gutter helmet for your gutters and put in nice siding and roofing.<p>* Be careful with ceiling fans. If the blades have a weak point in the connection with the blade like a centimeter of brass or similar, that will shear eventually.<p>* Don&#x27;t skimp on ventilation, HVAC/furnace.<p>* Go ahead and put decent windows in if you can afford it. Otherwise they&#x27;ll get stuck and you&#x27;ll not use them.<p>* Plan on cheap carpet rolling up and needing to be retightened, or buy good stuff.<p>* Go ahead and put in decent countertops and tile backsplash in kitchen. You will eventually if you don&#x27;t do it now. Put in undercabinet lighting and dimmers for those and most other lighting in kitchen and common areas.<p>* Plan a &quot;mud area&quot; in some area of the home and place for kids or you to put stuff and hang it as you come in.<p>* Even if you like natural wood, consider getting the hardier stuff for decks, etc. or stain and treat. Same with hardwoods- use more gloss than you might want.<p>* Dark hardwoods and counters hide dirt. With dark you get more cockroaches, with light you get more work.<p>Plenty of other things, but those are just the main ones.",1445972265

Not with the blessing of my teacher, nor of my parents. But I knew that my parents wanted to shut their eyes and pretend that my grades were improving for as long as they could until the report card came home. I knew that most teachers could be convinced into letting me make up some work at the end of the quarter to turn my Ds into Cs if need be. And I knew that without doing the homework, I could still swing a 90% or greater in the remaining assignments.<p>I could sit down in class and be fully engaged an learn everything I need to and more. While I avoided some higher-level classes because often they were just the same as the regular classes with more homework, most of the classes I took were of the advanced level. I wasn&#x27;t just coasting.<p>I repeatedly tried throughout high school to change my habits, but for various reasons, many personal, these attempts were doomed to fail.<p>I know I&#x27;m not the average case, but clearly homework is not at all necessary for every kid to do well in school. Other commentors have given the opposite anecdote, saying they did only homework and did well. I think maybe we should accept that these grading policies should be tailored to the student. At the risk of just rambling off my life story, I&#x27;m going to continue to show how these homework problems affected me beyond high school.<p>Despite these problems, I was admitted to a good state university. I had a 3.0ish GPA because I brought it up with easy A classes like band, and because I had several classes that where homework comprised only 5-10% of the grade. I guess that. combined with my above-average extracurriculars got me in. I then essentially flunked out after two semesters.<p>It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t have the study habits. They were probably lacking a little for the academic environment, but I definitely knew how learn independently. I was just so completely used to ignoring my academic responsibilities that I couldn&#x27;t stop. When you&#x27;ve been saying &quot;I don&#x27;t need to do this homework&quot; for years, it&#x27;s very easy to say &quot;I don&#x27;t need to study this thing&quot; even though you know very well that you have a lapse in understanding.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that I would have done at least somewhat better in college if only not doing homework in high school didn&#x27;t feel like not doing something that I had to do; if my parents and teachers hadn&#x27;t treated not doing homework as a bad thing.

So far I have laid out separate ones for signal and voltage to make things stay separate.<p>- WiFi of course, with likely a automation hub supporting all the key standards.<p>- Security system wiring.<p>- Temperature sensors across the house to allow me to adjust the A/C (won&#x27;t happen immediately).<p>- Water sensors, flood detection etc<p>- Soundproofing specific rooms/walls, my office, utility room, kids rooms, garage walls, insulating all walls etc.<p>- Solid core doors everywhere<p>As things have been progressing I have been documenting (and imaging) all the runs for plumbing, electrical etc.  I am being anal about where things are at and being able to find them in the future.  The electricians will hate me in the end, but I am requiring lines to be labeled in the attic space every time there is a change in direction and at all entry/exit points.  I am also requiring they run all electric in a specific pattern, not just thrown about the attic.  The A/C guys already found out I am a real ass about that type of stuff.  But in the end it is you who has to live with it and fix things or pay for them to be fixed and if you can cut out the hunting it saves tons of labor costs later.<p>So far my estimate on extra costs will be around $10-15k above normal, with a lot of that going for the extra soundproofing materials and labor. I am running all signal cables, cameras and extra conduit so that is helping on costs.  I also did some of this in my existing house after it was all put together so I have some benefits of learning from past mistakes.",1445971382

That has to be one of the most valuable reputations in the world -- probably saved over a billion dollars on this deal, just from having good credit.

I am extremely active in my kids lives.<p>My kids are very fortunate in that they always have one and often times both parents to help out with school work.<p>My oldest is 9 - 4th grade. I have a 5 year old in Junior-Kindergarten. Both have homework. (My 2 year old doesn&#x27;t count here, except when he&#x27;s literally eating their homework.)<p>I coach little league, and I talk to a lot of the parents. Some of the parents have kids in the same class as my 9 year old. These are households where both parents work and have more than one child in school.<p>There is a drastic difference in support that the children receive. Now, I&#x27;m not smart. I have a high school education from Arkansas, which is always fighting with Mississippi for the worst rank in education standards. However, I consider my problem solving skills outstanding. I am not doing my kids homework, but I do look at my kids homework. Every night. I help them sometimes. I get on the white board and we go over things. I have them teach the methods back to me.<p>It&#x27;s a difference that just last night, a mother of one of the kids came up to me and was talking about the math homework they had today. Her daughter had spent an hour on it before the game and still doesn&#x27;t get it. I hadn&#x27;t even looked at the homework yet, so I asked my daughter what was going on with the math homework tonight. Her response? Oh yeah, that&#x27;s super easy. You can look at it when we get home.<p>So you have something that takes at least 1 hour (I&#x27;ll find out more about it later if anyone cares!) for one student compared to something that is a nonissue for another student. In 4th grade. That isn&#x27;t really sustainable. And I&#x27;ll go out on a limb here and say that her friend who is having a bit more trouble isn&#x27;t dumb by any means. I&#x27;ve coached her for two years in softball. And we&#x27;re not special in the other direction, either.<p>Oh yeah - my 5 year old in Jr K - she has monthly homework assignments. Things like gather fall leaves and glue them to a piece of paper. Trace your hand and stick leaves on it to make a bird. Fun things like that. Not real homework.

Little things like that could be a costly add-on for a potential purchaser.<p>He also had an &quot;IT closet&quot; built in the house. It houses all the phone, networking, and a media server. It has dedicated circuits, a metal door, concrete walls, and a separate small AC unit built in for cooling. While he doesn&#x27;t intend for it to withstand any disaster, he did want some added time or at least a little more reassurance.

He also has WiFi throughout the house, but for streaming content having the wired connection provides the best quality. Finally for his home office he dropped a fiber connection from the closet.

I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve never lied to Google about my intentions. When I was feeling very depressed, I&#x27;d often search for sad things, or even &quot;ways to kill myself&quot;. I imagine a lot of other people do so as well, and aren&#x27;t even aware their search history is monitored by Google -- and if they are, they think it can be cleared by deleting their Internet history in their browser.<p>There is again a fine line between privacy and what will help the individual and society at large. The most pressing questions will not be what new analytical methods we can create to better identify mental illness from Google&#x27;s data. I&#x27;ve seen the quality of the mental health system from a close friend&#x27;s perspective (in the US at least) and all I can say is you don&#x27;t want to get mixed up with it; it often has the same outcome and social stigma as a criminal record.",1445968917
