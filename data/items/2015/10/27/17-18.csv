But this isn&#x27;t a mistake you just resolve over the mail.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve used toooons of open-source code in my life, lots of snippets, and I&#x27;ve not attributed every single thing although I usually do. When I copy a pretty standard implementation of a sorting algorithm that is used in a minor way to present the final results of some fancy code I completely wrote myself, sure, contact me and ask me to attribute properly and I will. My intention is to build something new, and use some code here and there by others instead of reinventing the wheel, and sometimes you slip up and don&#x27;t track your attributions properly.<p>But in this case, nothing new seems to have been created, it seems to have been almost entirely copied, variable names changed specifically for no real reason (it&#x27;s one page of code, on a big project I understand changing variables to suit your project structure but on a one-pager...), and the work is even referenced as being inferior (by pointing to a 2 year old version, saying that is inferior, then copying the 1 month old version that already solved the issues you&#x27;re pointing out on the 2 year old work, and not attributing anything). At that point, the notion someone is a cool dude looking to build cool stuff and made an honest mistake goes out the window, and the chances you&#x27;re dealing with a guy who inflates his own ego while dissing an author he&#x27;s copying and goes out of his way to muddy the evidence he&#x27;s copying, pretty high.

It&#x27;s legally correct/valid, but means nobody has to add stuff to it.<p>[1]  In the US, it prevents the innocent infringement defense.

From my home office I&#x27;m seeing 20 networks right now. Even a rudimentary dynamic channel-switching implementation could help a lot, but that&#x27;s not what happens.

10459850,comment,10458347,10458347,0,0,codegeek,,,"Hiring is tough. Extremely tough. Here are some of the reasons:<p>- Extremely time consuming and it still could be a long shot to find the right person. I have worked in teams where we gave up trying to hire due to time issues (recruiters were useless)<p>- Hiring without a real purpose. Sometimes, hiring managers themselves don&#x27;t know why they want to hire. This is dangerous as hiring someone without a specific purpose could be bad for both parties. Yes, it happens and happens a lot in enterprisy companies. I know one of my hiring managers once wanted to hire just to build his team in a specific location. Ended up not working out very well.<p>- Finding the right person again is really really hard. Sometimes you are looking for a very specific skill because you have project deadlines. Sometimes, you are ok with someone more broad but again, this depends on the need. Lot of hiring managers fail this test as well.<p>- Difficult to hire and retain good talent in a volatile market specially in tech. If you don&#x27;t offer details of the job including salary etc specifically, it it harder to attract good talent.<p>Overall, my take on hiring is that there has to be a direct interest from the hiring managers in actually interviewing, testing and hiring candidates which is time consuming and never a slam dunk. Lot of pain happens when frankly, there is not much interest from the hiring managers and things are &quot;outsourced&quot; to a recruiter/agency. Not to say all recruiters/agencies are bad but 95% are. I know some really good ones though.",1445968588

In fact, I&#x27;m not sure people even remember that one of the original propositions of cable was that it was ad free.<p>I think a more accurate adage would be that if companies can get away with ads (or gathering and selling personal data), then they will do so. Unfortunately it would appear that giving money directly to service providers does not actually protect you from such things, and I suspect the reason is fairly straightforward: All companies are driven to increase margins as much as possible, and will eventually feel financial pressure to try such measures. Unless consumers object strongly (i.e.: leave the service in numbers large enough to offset the benefits of a measure under consideration), such measures will in general find their way into use.<p>So what we&#x27;re really saying is consumers need to pay companies more than the money would get otherwise. If consumers aren&#x27;t willing to pay that price (and it shouldn&#x27;t surprise us if they aren&#x27;t---this can be a lot of money), then we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if such things show up, regardless of whether the service is paid or not.",1445968491

I&#x27;ve never seen a fit person complain about the inaccuracy of BMI in anything other than a joking manner. It isn&#x27;t precise, but it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; for the majority of people. It&#x27;s a heuristic.<p>On the other hand, people who are clearly in poor shape love to scream up and down about how inaccurate BMI is at determining fitness levels. Ironic because BMI generally puts non-active people in a positive light. If we switched to body-fat percentage something tells me a lot of these folks would be clamoring to get BMI back since it under-reports people who have low enough mass to be not considered obese, but too high body fat to be healthy (thus are at greater risk for diabetes etc).",1445967639

I felt they were the most singular part of the college experience that I was not likely to find elsewhere, they were generally interesting, and you could, if you were lazy like I was, skip most of the required reading if you paid attention to what the professor said.<p>High school was different, the teachers are focused on orienting you toward the material in a more remedial fashion and classroom time was, at least for me, an exercise in boredom and frustration.  Students also don&#x27;t necessarily know how to learn at this age, and some need a lot of step by step guidance and repetition.  Some students require personal attention from the teacher.  Most of the coursework is covered outside of class, in the homework.<p>For highly technical topics there is no substitute for homework - you need to drill to make the material your own.

Firstly, I haven&#x27;t even seen the data; the article just talked about it, and pretty lightly at that. Secondly, even assuming that the research was well-conducted and the results are accurate, social/psychological studies of this nature are easily open to deviations; even if most people do in fact get more out of learning in the classroom than out of doing homework, that does not mean that some people (such as myself) get more out of the opposite. Hence my remark was an anecdote.<p>That said, work by other researchers (Seymour Papert, et al) suggests that students get more out of <i>doing</i> something as they learn rather than passively listening or reading. Going down that trail, well-designed homework would ostensibly might be more beneficial than listening to classroom instructions.<p>So at minimum, I reject that this data applies to me personally. Going further, I suspect that it might not be true for a larger number of people. I might even suspect it&#x27;s not true for a majority of people, based on other things I have read, but I doubt that enough data has been collected on this matter to really say one way or the other.<p>As to my comment (or the thought process behind it) being the core of a world of problems?...

This is the simplest solution I&#x27;ve come up with, but I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback:<p>Hardware:<p>* Tablet, or smartphone with baseband disabled.<p>* Cellular-wifi router (i.e., wifi hotspot), prepaid so the provider doesn&#x27;t need your personal info.<p>.<p>Software:<p>* Android with per-app permissions controlled by user (e.g., user can enable/disable access to location data for particular apps). This could be a fork of Android or maybe there is security software that could be installed, such as on a rooted phone.<p>* VOIP app on phone<p>* VPN<p>.<p>By decoupling the baseband from the handheld computer (i.e., by keeping the tablet and cellular connection on different devices), using the cellular service without providing identifying info, and sending only encrypted data over the cellular connection (via VPN), you would protect your confidentiality from the cellular provider.<p>Because your phone number is decoupled from your cellular service (because you use VOIP over a VPN), nobody can tie your phone number to your location.<p>Of course someone who is determined could track you down. Your identity needs to be tied to your phone number or nobody will know how to call you; and your VOIP vendor could point someone to your VPN provider, who could point them to your cellular provider, who could figure out which hotspot you use.

Lumping them all together meant that they were in the relative location on the disc, so reducing the drive head seek times.

A <li> as a descendant of a <ol> is the way to do it and they are effectively coupled by nature. But this is mark-up, only! The style you give to the list and the list items is a different subject. Imagine that, for some reason, you want to apply the exact same styles to a structure of anchors (<a>) inside a <nav>? Then your selectors (ol, ol > li) wouldn&#x27;t apply anymore, you&#x27;d have to rework the selectors. If you just used classes for the list and the list items, reusing the styles would&#x27;ve been easier and trivial.<p>> In the end, the whole proposal of restricting styling to only class selectors is not enticing or compelling enough for me to make the switch, at least for now.<p>I can understand that, totally.
