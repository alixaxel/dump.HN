10407979,comment,10407244,10407923,0,0,darkmighty,,,"You can! The problem in that case is it&#x27;s not a convolution (blur) per se. Each pixel is an average of subpixels P(1)=S1(1)+S2(1)+...+Sn(1), P(2)=S1(2)+...+Sn(2) -- but as you can see there are no elements in common between pixels, which is the case with convolution. That is, in the deconvolution case there are as many variables as unknowns, whereas in the upscaling case you&#x27;re creating unknowns out of a single variable.<p>To estimate those subpixels then you&#x27;re going to be forced to make additional assumptions; if you assume they are independent you would simply estimate Sk(j)=P(j). The traditional (easiest) assumption is that the image is somewhat &quot;bandlimited&quot; -- it does not have many variations (frequencies) faster than once per pixel (so no equal or faster than subpixel variation). If this were the case, you could reconstruct the subpixels perfectly [1], save for some noise. But this is not always the case (and fails spectacularly when you have edges), resulting in upscale blur. So simple linear upscaling algorithms by reaching a compromise between blur and edge enhancing.<p>If you want to do better though, you have to use non-linear kernels and have good underlying models for your image content. A promising approach is to use machine learning/NNs:  <a href=""http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/05/scaling-convnets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.flipboard.com/2015/05/scaling-convnets/</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampli...</a>",1445169501

You characterized spam accounts as &quot;trusted&quot; even though you didn&#x27;t specify why or how they&#x27;d get trusted in the first place.  There&#x27;s still a gap in your thinking of how the origination of <i>real</i> (not fake) trust happens.<p>It&#x27;s like a 1970s email user asking, <i>&quot;how does the system prevent a &#x27;trusted&#x27; Nigerian money scammer from spamming everybody?&quot;</i>  Well, why would Department of Defense hire a Nigerian scammer?  Would a UniversityOfWhatever hire a Nigerian scammer?  No.  In that scenario, the trust <i>begins</i> with the institution.  For the Nigerian scammer to be trusted, <i>somebody</i> authoritative has to &quot;bless&quot; him.<p><i>>Could you give an example how trust could be used to control abuse ? </i><p>Well, we&#x27;re still using <i>trust</i> right now to help control abuse.  Today, reputable corporations and also millions of honest users (that&#x27;s us) &quot;trust&quot; Google Inc, Microsoft, Yahoo, FastMail, etc.  Spam on a massive scale does not originate from gmail/hotmail/etc because those corporations shut them down.<p>The issue is that it&#x27;s <i>centralized</i> trust concentrated in a few big players instead of <i>de-centralized</i> trust.  That&#x27;s the thorny problem that&#x27;s very hard to solve.  All the clever decentralized proposals (sender pays for storage, outbound payment bonds, cpu-proof-of-work, etc)  are basically roundabout proxies for recreating &quot;trust&quot; on a bigger scale.

Apparently Manila is nearly twice that at 111k.[1]<p>Still, it surprises me overpopulation fears are so commonly expressed. Seems like a greatly overblown meme that will end up doing more harm than good. Much like Malthus opposing projects to feed the poor and hungry, I sometimes hear people going as far as saying we (meaning relatively wealthy, white Americans) should just &quot;let them die&quot; when it comes to impoverished people all over the world. Despite the fact that, if energy consumption and environmental damage is the fear, people in industrialized countries use as many resources as dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of lives in the &quot;developing&quot; world.<p>The world could likely support orders of magnitude more people than we give it credit for.

Those who aren&#x27;t interested in having children could sell their &quot;right&quot; off on a market to people who want to have more than their one child individually, so a couple could buy the rights to more children and a larger family from those who don&#x27;t want to have children.  The market could even fractionalize/derivatize those rights so that individuals could sell &quot;half&quot; a childbirth right and two of those individuals could have a family with one child.<p>The best part is, at two children per two parents, it&#x27;s lower than the replacement rate of &quot;2.1&quot; which means population levels would humanely decrease with no need for wars or murder.<p>Our current societies are predicated on larger youth populations than parent populations to support us in our old ages, but this strategy combined with robotic technology for the elderly and post-scarcity economics would free us from that pyramid scheme.

IBM with its Watson is using supercomputers to make clinical decision support systems, Theranos is using microfluidics to provide cheaper blood tests, we, at Medd are approaching the problem from a different point of view. We are trying to use the available resources and make the system more efficient to deliver more consistent health out comes at more affordable prices.<p>The problem we identified was that doctors in most self-pay healthcare markets take a commission or kickback from diagnostic centers to refer patients to them, artificially increasing the prices by up to 100%.<p>We believed that since many people were aware of this malpractice they would be willing to go to a different lab which provided a high quality service to them at better prices. Our premise was simple, but considered impossible to implement by most in the industry – doctors, diagnostic centers, hospitals, investors.<p>So, we tied with the best labs in the city with NABL (ISO 15189) accreditation and in four years, along with college we were able to grow it from 1 center with almost no patients to 15 centers and over 100,000 patients a year.

They have exact information that one instead tries to assume (author in the article assumed that something in the source - be it noise or something else - behaves according the to Gaussian). If you know how to find the proper distribution, instead of assuming it, you can move closer to the information theoretical limits.<p>Just imagine how fast these filters can be if you put them on an FPGA, it also explains why TV sometimes cost more than $2k.<p>If you knew that your images would only contain car registration plates, you could definitely learn a filter that would be very precise in reconstructing the image when zoomed, you&#x27;d now find CSI zooming a little bit more realistic :D",1445166854

Using very rough figures, T_hot = body temperature = 37 C = 310 K and T_cold = average temperature of the earth = 16 C = 289 K.<p>Thus, the maximum possible efficiency is 1-289/310 = 6.8%.<p>To get 99% energy recovery, assuming human body temperature remains the same, would require that the cold side of the heat engine be at 3.1K, or only slightly warmer than the background temperature of space.<p>The only possible way to achieve that difference is by radiative heat transfer to space. However, we can use the temperature of the buried lunar regolith as an estimate of what the the &quot;average&quot; temperature of the earth could be without an insulating atmosphere. <a href=""http://www.asi.org/adb/m/03/05/average-temperatures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asi.org/adb/m/03/05/average-temperatures.html</a> says it&#x27;s -35 C = 238K.<p>Even if we could use -35C as the cold side of our heat engine, that would still only be 23% efficient, assuming maximal thermal efficiency and, you know, no air.",1445166545

The concept of trust <i>always exists</i> whether informally or formally.<p>When the internet was a small private network between universities and government, how did a new unknown scientist &quot;cold-call&quot; an email?  It was not an issue.  The scientist just sent the cold email.  There was already <i>implicit</i> trust within the system to allow that scenario.  Everybody trusted that researcher@someuniversity.edu didn&#x27;t send a million emails about Nigerian money transfers to researcher@army.mil.<p>Back then, email users didn&#x27;t need &quot;spam filters&quot;.
