That could be because of persecution due to homophobia, transphobia, an abusive ex, religious extremism, or just a person who is only known in their community by a name that isn&#x27;t their legal name.<p>I know several individuals who only ever go by a stage name or alias. I assume it isn&#x27;t their legal name, but every interaction I&#x27;ve had with them or I&#x27;ve witnessed others having with them used their aliases. Is it really less honest to have that be the name on their FB account?<p>And yes, I also know trans people who have lost access to their FB accounts because of inability to change their legal name to their chosen name.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes you transphobic to hold your view, but I do think it&#x27;s an overly polarized stance on a very nuanced issue.",1445187573

The rehabilitation of offenders and the protection of the public are indeed the sole two permissible objectives of incarceration in Germany. But there is a difference between (1) the imposition of prison sentences and (2) how they are being carried out. Judges may take other factors into account to determine the severity of a sentence, but once imposed, rehabilitation of offenders and protection of the public are the only two goals that the process of carrying out the sentence may serve.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stvollzg/englisch_stvollzg.html#p0013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stvollzg/englisch...</a> (and yes, the translation of the section title is ... imperfect).",1445187568

At St. John a visitor and 5 people on ventilators died, but the hospital was otherwise successfully evacuated in an hour and a half as random people with those eeeevil large vehicles we in flyover country are castigated for owning just showed up and moved most of them.  Over a several day period the local ambulance service transported over 1,000 people, a number to much more distant hospitals since I&#x27;m sure Freeman&#x27;s ICU was way too small.<p>We plan for these sorts of things, and had enough spare   hospital capacity, including smaller ones in the county and e.g. the beds for the nursing school at the local college were deliberately fully functional so they could help.  The St. John&#x27;s healthcare workers took their supplies and set up at our big multipurpose Memorial Hall,  \nand per these <a href=""http://www.aocoohns.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Walker.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aocoohns.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Walker.pd...</a> excellent overview slides (WARNING, some <i>really</i> ugly pictures in the latter part of that, you might want to stop at the first CAT scan) a lot of &quot;triage centers spontaneously developed at schools and intersections along the damage path&quot; (we&#x27;re the sort of people who march to the sound of cannons).

The school was near the edge of the zone of total destruction, like my apartment complex, and probably got hit by spinnoff vortexes or whatever.<p>The edge was very capricious, note from page 35 of the NIST report [0] the severe damage to the bottom, south part of the Wal-Mart.  My part of the apartment complex was <i>immediately</i> to the west, along the tornado&#x27;s line of travel, and all that happened was that the &quot;clubhouse&quot;/office etc. got destroyed, and every top, 3rd story apartment got breached as well a few 2nd story ones on the east ... and no one in any of these, including the Wal-Mart, died....

This evidence free diatribe glorifies a non-specific past where &#x27;abuse&#x27; and &#x27;electronic violence&#x27; were apparently less prevalent, and raises &#x27;abuse&#x27; above censorship on the list of things that threaten the web.<p>Where to start... Twitter, like all other such public blogging services, offers simple quick block and mute tools. These tools won&#x27;t prevent brigading, but then luckily &#x27;electronic violence&#x27;, being imaginary, can&#x27;t harm you. Smaller communities (such as subreddits) are free to exclude members on whatever basis they like - and hence overly sensitive web users can reside in their digital safe spaces to their hearts content. However, when you reside in the commons, you are open to public criticism.<p>To participate in the digital commons is to open oneself up to numerous confounding psychocultural narratives. Some of which are vehement to the point of incoherence. But to close oneself off from the possibility of discussion because of &#x27;abuse&#x27; is to be so afraid of disagreement as to wilfully cut oneself off from the possibility of learning from disagreement.<p>Twitter certainly isn&#x27;t growing at the same rate, but to describe it as &#x27;dying&#x27; is ludicrously over the top. Further, to suggest a more virtuous, less &#x27;abusive&#x27; past is to engage in a golden age fallacy. Certainly the intellectually and socioeconomically elite users of the early days of the web were more utopian. But to cite &#x27;abuse&#x27; as the reason for the authors perceived decline, rather than censorship, balkanisation, advertising, and of course the &#x27;eternal September&#x27; is absurd.<p>The kind of &#x27;abuse&#x27; the author seems to be arguing against - i.e.: not threats, but vehement group criticism, can be upsetting. But it is of course &#x27;trivial&#x27;. Since it can be escaped entirely by switching ones electronic device off, or simply logging off a given service for a few days. It&#x27;s quite distinct on the one hand, from the relatively rare and extreme mass public shamming addressed by John Ronson&#x27;s new book. And genuinely threatening harassment (already illegal everywhere in the West) on the other. The writer&#x27;s solutions &#x27;humility, gratitude, reality&#x27; are phatic, non specific and without direction or meaningful content. As is his critique.",1445186407

WikiBrain uses Wikidata to recognize the type of relationships or connections between Wikipedia concepts [3, 4].<p>I suspect larger applications of Wikidata in AI will follow.  For example, as of 2010, IBM Watson acquired at least some of its content from DBpedia and YAGO [5], which ultimately derive much of their content from scraping Wikipedia&#x27;s infoboxes and category system.  Now, come 2015, Wikidata is supplying data for some Wikidata infoboxes, and the proportion of infoboxes that pull from structured data in Wikidata will increase over time.

Everyone else will have heard it second-hand and may due to social circle pressure decide to sever ties with me. The only way I&#x27;ll actually suffer long-term (other than being beat up by a mob) is if I was famous since people like it when famous people do things.<p>The problem is, people continue to think that &quot;The Internet&quot; is just some kind of throwaway void where they can spout whatever they want. Justine Sacco probably isn&#x27;t a racist, and was probably making a joke about &quot;white privilege&quot; or &quot;white bubble&quot;. But she showed poor judgement in assuming that writing that in a public space would be benign. Even with her lack of followers. Text is not a good way to facilitate a joke that requires context. Her joke about AIDS and Africa and white people not being affected is based on some context no one but herself had.<p>If _I_ am at the supermarket and I hear some old cranky dude yell that out. It&#x27;s a story I&#x27;ll probably tell my friends about. They in turn may decide to use that as an inside joke/catchphrase of our circle of friends.

It is inherently hard to classify behaviour as either abusive or not, and for those who are sure, it&#x27;s inherently impossible to reach consensus.

Even this move of nagging you to update to Win10 seems to come out of the brain of marketeers, not engineers. When companies get big enough, they often lose some of their engineering/academic spirit to commercial thinking.

I think they just didn&#x27;t share information correctly and it could have been avoided (dropped the ball). I am always a bit mystified when Americans say that 9/11 was an inside job. If true, their government would be directly responsible for the deaths of 1000s. That should cause riots, not conspiracy theory forums. I think 9/11 conspiracy theories are interesting, because I have a conspiracy theory that most of these theories are propagated by the Middle East (shift the blame) and Russia (destabilize US politics, comparable to Operation INFEKTION, where they tried to paint the US as creating AIDS).<p>I think the lizard people are the product of a troubled mind and plain old antisemitism.

It&#x27;s a form of data analysis to occupy the mind with, only bounded by your imagination.<p>I think the China-themed conspiracy theories are very US-centric.

They have over a dozen projects going on at once, and more in the pipeline.<p>I don&#x27;t like to micromanage, but one of their goals was driving efficiency, so less slacking off. As such, since joining I am always completely on-point all day, hold scrum standups every morning to maintain focus (by the way, this is something anyone can benefit from, ask anyone who&#x27;s worked for themselves and had nobody to boast to.) Likewise we do cooperative planning and review meetings around sprints, to maintain motivation high, keep delivering, keep client satisfaction high.<p>I appreciate the recurring paycheck, but one of my personal (outside work) goals is to continue to plough ahead on more risky projects on my own (allowed). The pay I joined on is below-ave., but I really like working with this team.<p>Given that a lot of my work is client communication, does it sound like I would be in a position to negotiate even fewer hours in the office? Specficially, to suggest coming in in the morning for the scrum motivational meeting and to learn about roadblocks (as an equal), to hold planning and review meetings and meet with the owners; but to do some/a lot of the client contact from my home office?

Of course, if there are any late afternoon meetings (bunch of time zones are involved) I can stick around.<p>What do you guys think? Is this a reasonable thing for a manager to do?

So basically you would still be able to fetch queue messages as you can do now and it will delete dequeued items, but you would also be able to use something like \n&#x27;get queue_name:consumer_name&#x27; \nand it will create a consumer group internally with a stored offset and will serve messages using that offset. In case of reliable read failure each consumer group will keep it&#x27;s own queue of failed deliveries, will check that queue and serve these failed items first. If source queue head has changed and became larger then consumer group offset, then consumer group offset would just start from the source queue head.<p>This way you can get Kafka-like multiple consumer groups per queue as an additional feature.",1445184478

This ad infinitum, as you need a local director to keep the company open. And unlike in Hong Kong not so long ago, it has to be a real director - someone who theoretically can open bank accounts and hire people - so you&#x27;re taking that risk too (the director will, conversely, be taking the risk that you might be a scammer or other criminal whose acts he&#x27;ll have to answer for in court).<p>Then you have to put in S$50k in capital in order to be able to apply for a visa (EP) for yourself, should you want permission to work in Singapore (if not, you&#x27;ll get taxed at home when repatriating profits); this visa will require, today, at least S$4-5k/month in &quot;salary&quot; (which will be taxed).<p>This also assumes that the Ministry of Manpower doesn&#x27;t suddenly catch upon this very convenient way of getting yourself what is effectively an investor visa at a fraction of the investor visa cost (which they did two years ago with the EntrePass, which is today utterly useless for most foreign founders due to its requirement to have funding from a short list of approved VCs). Guessing what MoM wants and is going to do seems to be a bit of Kremlinology which HR directors love talking about as their special value add, but it is a bit opaque and the rules change with time, elections and special circumstances (like the famed riots last year, or the Ferrari and taxi incident).<p>The &quot;plan&quot; should you want to take advantage of Singapore&#x27;s otherwise fantastic conditions for running a business is to get PR, which takes up to 3 years employed locally (depending on salary - someone on a high salary and from a &quot;desirable&quot; country might get it in 6 months). Singapore is fantastic... for local founders. Or if you&#x27;re willing to pay.<p>The days where you could be in business for USD 1,500 and a flight to Hong Kong appear to be, unfortunately, over.

To keep a stable cursor, the consumer would need to persist that someplace, which just pushes the acknowledgement to that persistence component instead.
