They may work for individual people, but they do not work at scale as a public health measure.<p>Why is this concept so difficult to get across? There are _constant_ advertisements in every medium for weight loss programs of every sort. We&#x27;ve already explored the entire parameter space of dieting. Tweaking the food mix and saying, &quot;No. This time we have the perfect mix to keep you health and full!&quot; isn&#x27;t science.

I have a genetic disorder. I am white. It is a predominantly white disorder. I was diagnosed late in life. I did not know I had it when I was younger. I grew up in the racist deep south and I married a white man, who was a carrier, so one of our children also has the disorder. I got diagnosed in my thirties and later divorced. Following my diagnosis, during my divorce, the idea of ending up accidentally pregnant by someone who was a carrier really freaked me out and so I went through a period where I actively discriminated against white men, not because I don&#x27;t like sleeping with white men but because it is a quick and dirty genetics test. (I have blogged about this, if you want the link.)<p>Anyway, during my divorce, I intentionally went out of my way to not signal to men what my dating/relationship history had been because I did not want to repeat the mistakes of my past and I was very aware that if I told men that my ex husband was, for example, blond, then blond men felt more confident about approaching me and non-blond men felt like I was suggesting I was not interested in them and were more reluctant to pursue me. Even with actively trying to eliminate that sort of bias from men who might be interested, I found that if you analyzed the data, I tended to date more of certain kinds of men. However, I cannot say WHY that was.<p>One possible explanation was that I simply had more opportunity to date men of certain categories. For example, I have tended to have more relationships to men who were in the military or former military. On the one hand, my father and ex husband were both career military, so I tend to more readily get along with people with a military association of some sort. They tend to understand me better and interpret my bluntness more positively than people without such a background. On the other hand, I was near a military base and I had friends in the military. So I happened to have a much higher opportunity to meet or be introduced to military personnel and former military members under circumstances that made getting involved with them easier.<p>I was not consciously and intentionally looking for military men or former military members. Nonetheless, my dating numbers did skew towards that subset of the population. I don&#x27;t think it means I straight up &quot;discriminate against&quot; non military members.<p>There are other things like that in the data concerning my relationship history. Military vs civilian is not the only category I contemplated when thinking about this and concluding that you can, for example, date more of your own race without straight up being racist. But I chose that as an example in hopes that it is the least problematic example I can use.<p>Does that make more sense?",1445208560

Your WWW browser is the originator and receipient UA, and Hacker News is the message store.  A copy of a message is only made and sent across the network when you request it with your User Agent.  A lot of Internet-mediated communications are not SMTP-based any more.  The shift to pull-style systems has, in some ways, actually already happened.<p>As such, many of the things that people ask about IM2000 are questions that they can answer from their own direct experiences, with a little reflection.  How do you deal with senders who alter their messages?  Well: how do you the receipient deal with the fact that <i>right here and now</i> I can hit an edit button and modify this comment after people have pulled it for reading it, with no edit history and nothing but the honour system for dealing with letting people know?  The fleshing out of IM2000 set out the idea of downloading to folders in the recipient MUA the messages that one wanted to take off the senders&#x27; mail stores, by the way.",1445208228

Sometimes I would be part of their initial user base because what they&#x27;re selling would genuinely make my life easier/better. That&#x27;s not wrong.<p>The big, flashy ads (you know, the ones that are animated, or play sound or video, or do something dumb if you mouse over them for 1/4 second) are generally purchased by makers of lesser products in order to manipulate users into choosing them, because they can&#x27;t rely on the quality of their products to advertise for them. I don&#x27;t feel bad about blocking them.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think unobtrusive ads are so bad. The trick is figuring out how to let them through.

This view excludes those who want to go for long walks alone on the beach, or hate living where they can see the lights of their neighbors, or want the local ecosystem to continue to support wildlife that does poorly around dense human habitation.<p>As qrendel does not believe there is resource scarcity, than that&#x27;s only because qrendel does not regard things like &#x27;5 million wild buffalo freely roaming the US plains&#x27; or &#x27;ability to see the Milky Way in the night sky&#x27; as resources.

Airliner programmes run at a loss initially, because there were the development costs, the costs for equipment and methods to build the plane, and that it takes way longer to build the plane since that one hasn&#x27;t been built before.  However as more and more are built, the whole process gets more and more efficient making each one cheaper (aka the learning curve).  It is generally measured by comparing the costs on unit N with those of 2N, and for airliners is around 75-85%  (eg unit 200 should cost 75-85% of unit 100).  Javier has two excellents posts - a more detailed explanation and how it happens in aerospace, and then deriving the 787 curve based on public information:<p><a href=""http://theblogbyjavier.com/2014/03/03/learning-curves/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theblogbyjavier.com/2014/03/03/learning-curves/</a><p><a href=""http://theblogbyjavier.com/tag/learning-curve/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theblogbyjavier.com/tag/learning-curve/</a><p>The manufacturers also give steep discounts on the first few planes off the assembly line, as they are less likely to meet the promised specs, probably overweight, and more prone to teething issues.  Consequently the most expensive ones to make get lower revenues too.  But then the manufacturer expects to make it up in volume over time.<p>The 787 programme has all the above applying, but also was done differently.  In the late 90s McDonnell Douglas was bought by Boeing.  The inside joke is that McDonnell actually bought Boeing, using Boeing&#x27;s own money.  Some of the senior management at Boeing for commercial aircraft was also taken over by McDonnell people.  McDonnell was well known for financial engineering, somewhat as a side effect of not having much money,<p>They decided that the 787 would be revolutionary on many fronts at the same time.  That includes extensive use of composites, all electric architecture (current planes use a lot of hydraulics and bleed air), new engines, and advanced systems.  They also farmed out much of the design and manufacturing work (far more than normal for previous airliner programmes).<p>In theory that meant spreading of the risk, and that Boeing would slap the planes together, collect the money and get rich.  The optimism meant pricing them really cheap which led to a huge number of orders, as airlines couldn&#x27;t say no to such a bargain and specs.<p>In practise Boeing hadn&#x27;t discovered new magic, risks hurt everyone, individual manufacturers had problems, different partners had different priorities, things didn&#x27;t run as cohesively as expected, Boeing had to spend lots of money rectifying issues including buying some suppliers, assembly was problematic and the list goes on.<p>The consequence is that the overall expenditures and initial far too low pricing, combined with the actual learning curve means they are unlikely to ever make an overall profit.",1445207685

As it rests, the brandy develops character and aromas. Just before it&#x27;s bottled, it is typically cut with spring water.</i><p>I have done a bit of searching and can&#x27;t readily find a direct answer. I did find a Wikipedia entry on the use of oak in making wine that talks a bit about the converse:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(wine)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(wine)</a><p>I am not much of a drinker. At one time, my dad was a very heavy drinker. He claimed that he could tell by taste alone whether a beer had been bottled in a green bottle or a brown one. I have also been acquainted with a serious wine connoisseur who said he could tell you all sorts of things about where it came from and what not based on the flavor. I was recently reading a bit about Chinese tea and a devoted connoisseur was going on at length about how the source of the water, the type of pot it is boiled in, etc impact flavor of the tea.<p>So, I think the short answer is that, to some degree, probably every step in the process impacts aroma and flavor. But as a guess, I would assume that the point of resting it in glass or stainless steel is to be a flavor neutral as possible at that step in the process. Using oak is apparently done specifically to impact flavor, color, etc. in the brewing/distiling process.",1445207609

Is it just that CO2 is heavier than N2 (44 vs 28 g/mol?)? If we could magically convert the CO2 to O2, would the pressure be lower? Where is all Venus&#x27;s nitrogen?<p>Where does all this sulphuric acid come from? Does Earth have the same amount of sulphur, just locked up in rocks? If so, why doesn&#x27;t it react and precipitate out on Venus?<p>Okay, time to read the Wikipedia article [1].<p>So, Venus&#x27;s atmosphere actually has <i>four times as much</i> nitrogen as Earth&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s overwhelmed by having about a hojillion times more carbon dioxide. There&#x27;s more than enough nitrogen for an Earth-like atmosphere, crushed down into a tiny space.<p>Plus, the lack of a magnetic field means the solar wind hits the atmosphere harder than it does at Earth; hard enough to blow water vapour off the planet, although i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s in significant quantities.<p>Apparently at the surface, the CO2 has enough density and pressure that it&#x27;s supercritical. So it&#x27;s not so much an atmosphere, as an ocean. Kind of. We don&#x27;t have a word for what it is, but it&#x27;s atrocious.<p>As for sulphur, it came from wherever (volcanic eruptions, let&#x27;s say), but the reason it stays in the atmosphere is that sulphuric acid never reaches the ground: if it falls as rain, the heat of the deep atmosphere evaporates it before it lands. I assume there&#x27;s still a lot of gas-phase sulphuric acid at the surface, but perhaps that doesn&#x27;t allow a fast enough reaction to take it out of the atmosphere.<p>And finally, Earth had an atmosphere like Venus&#x27;s during the Hadean era, from its formation to four billion years ago [2]. Despite being ludicrously hot, liquid water oceans were stable due to the high pressure. Those oceans apparently allow some chemistry that takes most of the CO2 out of the atmosphere. For some reason, that didn&#x27;t happen (or stopped happening) on Venus. Maybe because the water was whipped away by the solar wind? Or because Venus was just a bit too hot for liquid water? Or because you need not only oceans but plate tectonics to bury the carbon deep in the crust, and Venus doesn&#x27;t have plate tectonics?<p>Don&#x27;t ask me why Venus doesn&#x27;t have plate tectonics. Probably the same reason it doesn&#x27;t have a magnetic field, which on Earth is generated by stuff convecting around in the core.<p>So, total basket case really.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean</a>",1445207295

But you have to take into account the tools that cancer has to take advantage of when it comes to invasiveness and proliferation. DNA instability is the root cause which results in incorrect signalling, cell cycle progression, cell morphology, and immune system evasion. But take angiogenesis, an extremely important tool for a developing embryo, and how ubiquitous it is for a growing tumor. But we can go farther and consider the factors that influence the guidance of a cell during development. Accutane or Isotretinoin is very similar in structure to retinoic acid, a guidance molecule in the posterior embryo. Consequently isotretinoin causes birth defects. Interestingly isoretinoin has also been implicated as an anti-cancer treatment. Thalidomide, which also interrupts proper development has also been used as an anti-cancer treatment. My point isn&#x27;t to dispute the importance of DNA damage and gene expression profile changes, but rather to emphasize the importance of metastasis and its apparent parallels with embryonic development since metastasis is the main reason (sans leukemias) why cancer has such a high lethality.",1445206963

If a liver cell decides that it wants to be its own immortal organism but doesn&#x27;t express telomerase, it won&#x27;t get very far in its enterprise. The replication limit makes it more likely that we&#x27;ll survive to reproductive age.<p>On the other hand, the Hayflick Limit kills us. Evolution doesn&#x27;t care much about this side effect, but <i>we</i> do. If we can suppress cancer other ways --- or hell, even if we can&#x27;t --- NOPing out the Hayflick Limit safety code is worthwhile.",1445205828

Trust me there are plenty of clients that are willing to pay higher rates.\n2) Don&#x27;t bid on every project that comes along. Only focus on projects that you really want to be a part of. \n3) If you don&#x27;t have a portfolio then build some demo sites where you can showcase your work. Given that you like building scrapers you should be a simple web service that does exactly that.\n4) Only take hourly jobs OR fixed rate jobs where the client provides a clear, documented scope document that you both can agree to.\n5) Don&#x27;t be afraid to say no. The biggest issue with freelancers in other parts of the world is that they say yes to every single thing....don&#x27;t be that guy. Clients will respect you more for it.\n6) Don&#x27;t hand the source code over until you have been paid.\n7) Stand your ground anytime a client challenges your rate. You&#x27;re a professional and not a cheap commodity.",1445205773
