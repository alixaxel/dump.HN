10446130,comment,10445129,10445847,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> It is not about that Relational (SQL) database was designed in a way that is hard to make it distributed<p>Not <i>entirely</i> accurate. Relational database schemas are typically normalized into many tables and make heavy use of joins; it&#x27;s fair to say that the concept of joins are integral the relational model. But joins, by definition, require fast access to data; it&#x27;s extremely inefficient to join across network boundaries.<p>So-called NoSQL databases aren&#x27;t just about ACID or CAP, but also about <i>denormalization</i>. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the single founding tenet of all of &quot;NoSQL&quot; was denormalization across multiple nodes. Google&#x27;s Bigtable (on which HBase is based, and which arguably started the public&#x27;s interest in &quot;NoSQL&quot;) depends on extreme denormalization in its data model‚ which does away with tables and instead treats everything as columns, and also discards referential integrity (the &quot;C&quot; in ACID, which isn&#x27;t the same as in CAP) and isolation (the &quot;I&quot;). Sharding flows naturally out of denormalization. Eventual consistency came later with Amazon&#x27;s Dynamo paper; Bigtable was strongly consistent.<p>A consequence of denormalization is that you can hit any database node and get consistent performance. No query will ever get bogged down in complicated, long-running nested loops and hash joins because the mechanisms don&#x27;t exist. It creates an even playing field for queries because they&#x27;re mostly individual key lookups; the result is (in theory) predictable, stable performance across the cluster. The complexity of join logic that was in the relational database is moved into the client, which gets the burden of untangling data. Which is why Google also invented early solutions like MapReduce and Sawzall, because once you have a huge, denormalized, distributed cluster of data in this poor man&#x27;s relational model, your individual clients can no longer access the data efficiently. So denormalization also leads to parallel computation, and especially <i>precomputation</i>, rather than the ad-hoc queries that relational databases are good at.<p>It&#x27;s all about scale, and fitting the data model to work in your favour at that scale.<p>So yeah, I would definitely say that relational databases are designed in a way that make them hard to distribute. The above is just the tip of the iceberg. How do you enforce referential integrity (foreign keys, etc.) across nodes? How do you assign unique primary keys? You talk about making tradeoffs, but would you really want a distributed relational database without distributed transactions?<p>Can you implement a performant distributed database with joins and other relational features? Yes. VoltDB and Vertica come to mind. They are designed from the ground up to do this, and have complicated logic for partitioning queries. They make other tradeoffs: for example, VoltDB is in-memory and to perform well, all transactional access code has to be written as a &quot;stored procedure&quot;, a Java JAR file that you upload to the server, and transactions are expected to be very short-lived. But they will, pretty much by definition, not perform at scale the way that &quot;NoSQL&quot; databases are designed to.",1445752730
10446129,comment,10445633,10445633,0,0,turkishrevenge,,,"What can I say about this article?<p>I recently moved here, like many other people in tech. I didn&#x27;t come for the draw of nature--which I love--but for a higher paying job and a chance to escape a poor, decaying, east coast city that increasingly felt like an urban hell. The whole undertaking was supposed to be a leg up, moving to that next level of adulthood (whatever that means in 2015). I am a well-paid, well-educated engineer in my early 30&#x27;s. I am not a founder, nor do I intend to be, at least around these parts. California was a promised land, and I was glad to buy a one-way ticket there.<p>Now that I am here and a &quot;resident,&quot; I faced with an ugly truth: the utter impossibility for me to ever buy any kind of property in the city, however modest or dilapidated, even if my salary somehow doubled overnight. The very thought of what it takes to &quot;make it&quot; here borders on the obscene. I&#x27;m lucky to pay $1,300 (which is cheap) for a one-bedroom in the city with 3 other people; outside, the prospects aren&#x27;t much better.<p>The SF (and sadly the bay area in general) of now is a place where boomers made the rules. I can&#x27;t help but feel impotent when thinking about the long-term political changes that will need to be effected in order to benefit newcomers and the working classes that are trying to make a home here. The old guard has such a stranglehold on the political machinations of this place and the chips are overwhelmingly stacked in their favor. I&#x27;m registered to vote--and I plan on it--but I know deep down, nothing will truly change until the Daniel Duane&#x27;s of the city finally flush down the bowl and don&#x27;t resurface. People like him had the great luck to be born during an era where places like this weren&#x27;t fully exploited yet. I can&#x27;t fault people like him for taking advantage of the opportunity to buy when housing was cheap and relatively plentiful. Anyone with aspirations to own a home and have a family would do the same without a second thought.<p>The NIMBYism and political blockading of the old guard is unconscionable. The housing crisis plaguing not only SF, but the peninsula as well, is directly related to their shortsighted, self-serving political ends. It&#x27;s as if they--&quot;they&quot; in this case are my generational bogeyman--never even considered how their children would live. Short of inheriting a property, &quot;tough shit&quot; is the answer to the housing question.<p>My choices now are to stay, make some money, and take it back with me to somewhere cheaper, or hope for a simultaneous bubble-burst and earthquake which will depress home prices and maybe scare some alte kakas to leave.<p>I want to stay here, but it&#x27;s really damn near impossible.<p>So let the Daniel Duane&#x27;s lament about their California dream of the past. I only know about what we&#x27;ve been left by the legacy of his ilk, and it ain&#x27;t good.",1445752535

They got theirs and they were loathe to pay it forward for a state that they felt was being overrun by people who didn&#x27;t share their values and were not like themselves.<p>With the election of Jerry Brown and the dominance of Democrats in the legislature, California seems to have turned a corner fiscally and a lot of the doom-and-gloom headlines that gleefully pointed to the deficits of the previous decade have faded away.
