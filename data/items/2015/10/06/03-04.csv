It creates an environment of stress and fear. Car accidents do the same to a much lesser extent. Smoking related diseases are somewhat more expected, they aren&#x27;t so sudden. People have time to adjust, receive medical attention, and so on.<p>When you put the numbers together it feels like we should tackle the causes of the largest number of deaths first, then work our way to the fewest. But I don&#x27;t think that is beneficial, or even a rational approach to improving our society.<p>You could use those numbers argue for ignoring mass shootings: i.e., there are so few related to other causes of death. But it fails to take into account just how many people they effect and how much it twists society (e.g., having schools perform lockdown drills with 5-year-olds who don&#x27;t understand why they have to hide in a closet [1]).<p>I don&#x27;t think we have a good measure to use to compare murders, to car accidents, to death by disease. As raw quantities they skew our perception and priorities. As pure numbers they fail to indicate to us the impact they could have on our society.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rehearsing-for-death-a-pre-k-teacher-on-the-trouble-with-lockdown-drills/2014/10/28/4ab456ea-5eb2-11e4-9f3a-7e28799e0549_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rehearsing-for-death...</a>",1444103758

It&#x27;s a very common use case.<p>Did you ignore my pointing out that my family and my co-workers call me by different names?  This is _very_ common.<p>> For teachers, sure, but I don&#x27;t see a reason for teachers to be Facebook friends with students<p>I don&#x27;t see a good reason for anyone to ever have a Facebook account at all.  But many people clearly do, and Facebook is doing all it can to ensure that all real-life relationships are reflected in Facebook... but not actually making it possible to do that sanely.  That&#x27;s causing problems, and will continue to cause problems until either people realize that Facebook shouldn&#x27;t be used for all their relationships or Facebook fixes their setup to work better or society in general radically changes how it&#x27;s structured (and not for the better, in my opinion).<p>We can argue about which of these solutions is preferable, and which is more likely (I suspect the answers are different), but let&#x27;s not pretend like the problem doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>As for teachers being Facebook friends with their students, consider the situation in India, where Facebook is pushing for &quot;internet access&quot; that only includes Facebook.  At which point, if you want to communicate with your students electronically at all, you have to do it through Facebook, since that&#x27;s all they can do on the internet.<p>The situation in the US is not that bad, but again some teachers are using Facebook for their classroom communication (by choice).  I agree this is a bad idea, obviously, for oh so many reasons.<p>> You can certainly be searchable by names in different character sets<p>It&#x27;s not just searchability.  It&#x27;s also whether people seeing a message from you recognize who the message is from, say.<p>> why not just make separate Facebook profiles<p>You mean apart from this being explicitly against Facebooks&#x27;s terms of service and the fact that they will shut down some or all of these profiles because they decide that the name on them isn&#x27;t a real name?<p>Again, as I see it my options today are:<p>1)  Lie about accepting the terms of service, deal with the fact that Facebook can arbitrarily shut down parts of my social interactions because it decides it doesn&#x27;t like what some people call me.<p>2)  Set up Facebook relationships in a radically different way from my real-world ones.<p>3)  Just don&#x27;t use Facebook for interacting with anyone I actually care about.<p>My personal choice is #3.  Most people seem to choose some combination of #1 and #2, with a strong lean to #2.  The EFF is claiming that this choice only has to be made because of some particular Facebook policies and users would be better off if those policies were changed so that the choice didn&#x27;t need to be made (e.g. so that having separate Facebook profiles were actually an OK thing and not grounds for having all your Facebook profiles terminated).",1444103641

Among other things... However, the stuff I did repeatedly, like high-level security engineering and assessments, stays with me. Barely relevant here even though it makes plenty of sense that you&#x27;d think that. The short-cut around it is the concept of burden of proof in INFOSEC: one is expected to back up their big, security claims with evidence rather than everyone else expected to disprove them.<p>I certainly could dig back into OpenBSD (and C) to fully understand its current situation, its code, its mitigations, every source change from vulnerability 2, and so on. Those details could benefit OpenBSD in form of contributions I attempt or the reader following along to get a better picture of insides. However, it&#x27;s not necessary for evaluating my concern about the 2 vulnerability claim. We can cleverly cheat around all that knowledge by going straight to fundamentals and claim itself. Then, only acquiring (me) and/or applying (others) that knowledge if the specialist skill turns out to be required. Others and I did this with success when drowning in product and project security claims with finite time to review them. Let&#x27;s apply that.<p>&quot;instead of reasoning about all theoretical directions OpenBSD could have taken.&quot;<p>My main question is a simple, concrete one that I shouldn&#x27;t have to investigate at all: what evidence is there that there have only been 2 exploitable flaws in all OpenBSD releases? To claim this, there would have to be a tracker of every defect fixed in OpenBSD since its inception, an analysis of each one&#x27;s exploitability, and a result saying only two were exploitable. There&#x27;s trackers like that for many projects. Where&#x27;s that record for OpenBSD or, to save you time, do they even analyze <i>every bug</i> for exploitability?<p>If that doesn&#x27;t exist or that analysis wasn&#x27;t done, then the <i>only</i> 2 vulnerability claim can be rejected immediately because it wasn&#x27;t proven. Instead, the claim becomes &quot;Of all X defects found, people only showed two were exploitable remotely. (Optionally) That&#x27;s a defect ratio of X per Kloc with vulnerability ratio of Y per Kloc. (Not optional) The rest either <i>weren&#x27;t assessed for severity</i> or were shown harmless.&quot; Alternatively, the claim is totally false if even one security fix for a remote attack was done after the 2nd vulnerability was fixed. It would have to be changed to a maybe pending further, specialist analysis. This isn&#x27;t theoretical: it&#x27;s a direct implication of the claim they&#x27;re making, an extraordinary implication, and one which deserves concrete evidence to back it.<p>So, I encourage people to reject it until they have that evidence and in a way they can share easily. If I have time or resources, I might attempt a thorough assessment of OpenBSD in terms of design or code. A past study I did comparing it to prior secure UNIX attempts showed some things it&#x27;s missing where there&#x27;s surely issues. It has some other attributes, esp code quality & protections, that help it more than others (including old ones). Nonetheless, the issue I have is an extraordinary claim that pops up repeatedly in discussions over OpenBSD vs whatever with no evidence to back it and high chance of failure. See the problem? Also, do you see how I don&#x27;t need to be an OpenBSD developer to spot it?",1444102381

10336556,comment,10332236,10332236,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"Obviating the OS was a natural consequence of one of the original goals of OOP as conceived by Kay et. al:<p>First, recall that the advantage of universal computers is that they can simulate anything, including better computers. Objects themselves were supposed to be fully universal computers that got work done through message passing.<p>Second, the people at PARC had a &quot;no centers&quot; philosophy. They recognized that the key to building scalable systems is to keep responsibility widely distributed among the components.<p>Thus it&#x27;s easy to see why you wouldn&#x27;t need or want an OS:<p>* An OS is just a simulation of a nicer computer running atop a not-so-nice computer (i.e. the hardware). But, real objects can give you the same thing, and it just so happens that modern hardware components are real objects (i.e. universal computers that get work done by passing messages).<p>* Having centers in your system makes it hard to scale. And by &quot;scale&quot;, we&#x27;re not necessarily talking about things like &quot;number of simultaneous users/processes&quot;, but rather about things like making sure that the Nth modification to the system is just as painless as the first one. The OS is clearly an unnecessary center because the hardware components are now better at handling the responsibility for their respective functionality, but the OS is also an undesired center because its opaqueness and rigidity makes it hard to modify big systems. Fortunately, since an OS is a simulation of a universal computer that means that it can also simulate other universal computers, so we&#x27;re able to abstract away the OS by using it to run simulations of better computers with names like &quot;Erlang&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, etc.<p>Finally, while I enjoyed the article and found it interesting, I do disagree with the author&#x27;s tacit assumption that getting rid of the OS implies more opaque and locked down systems, or that locking down the system implies better reliability and security. Firstly, message passing is already a secure medium; stupid or malicious parser implementations are the biggest cause of the Internet&#x27;s insecurity [1]. Secondly, it&#x27;s an empirical fact that the best way to achieve systemic reliability is with redundancy. This means having components that perform the same function, but that are produced independently by isolated teams that use different technologies and techniques. So reliability means having communication standards of some kind (i.e. protocols). Indeed, as long as companies continue to sell computers (i.e. a thing designed to let me simulate what I think is a better computer), we&#x27;ll end up with more freedom to tinker. What we really have to worry about is companies selling things that they claim are computers, but that lacks that crucial facility (which is why the trend of calling an iPhone a computer, or OSX&#x27;s SIP can be a little disquieting).<p>[1]  <a href=""http://langsec.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://langsec.org/</a>",1444101229

Judge Alex Kozinski wrote very well on the matter in a great article [1]:<p>&quot;Juries are routinely instructed that the defendant is presumed innocent and the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but we don’t really know whether either of these instructions has an effect on the average juror. Do jurors understand the concept of a presumption? If so, do they understand how a presumption is supposed to operate? Do they assume that the presumption remains in place until it is overcome by persuasive evidence or do they believe it disappears as soon as any actual evidence is presented? We don’t really know.<p>Nor do we know whether juries really draw a distinction between proof by a preponderance, proof by clear and convincing evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. These levels of proof, which lawyers and judges assume to be hermetically sealed categories, may mean nothing at all in the jury room.
