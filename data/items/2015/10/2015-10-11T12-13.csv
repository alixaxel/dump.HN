Without it, nobody can use the taxis, with it, rich can use taxis, non-rich still can&#x27;t. Surge pricing is strictly an improvement.<p>Another example: I provide food for a standard price. That price is determined by the weather. I can&#x27;t control the weather, so I can&#x27;t control the price. If the weather is poor, it affects production, the price goes up. I still guarantee to provide the food, yet less people can afford it. It would be strictly worse to stop production of food in case of poor weather.",1444568016

So much of the time resistance to advancement comes about because people are afraid to rock the boat, because they are distressed about being called out, because they don&#x27;t want to be forced to choose a side. They just want everything to be better at no personal cost. As has been said, evil triumphs when good men do nothing. It&#x27;s amazing how much truth there is in that, and how much depth. If you insist on burying the issue every time it comes up or if you insist on &quot;waiting until the right time&quot; you&#x27;re not helping.<p>So many people today think that it&#x27;s fine to just be neutral. And in a way that&#x27;s alright, it&#x27;s certainly better than actively participating in hate, but it doesn&#x27;t make you a good person. A good person takes a stand, a good person makes an effort to make things better, even if it comes at a cost.",1444566555

For example: Russian GDP rose during Putins years tenfold. Russia reduced its foreign debt down to 23% of GDP and a flat tax of 13% for everyone was introduced. (I live in the EU and I am basically robbed by my government - I pay a hefty 50% tax on top of being forced to charge 20% VAT from my customers)<p>If these aren&#x27;t good reasons to vote for someone then I don&#x27;t know what is.

Learn its quirks, how it differs from other frameworks, strengths and weaknesses, it&#x27;s internals and how it works internally. It&#x27;s seldom to find someone who can fully explain how a framework works. Keep yourself up to date with its developments, contribute to it.<p>Or you could master JavaScript instead. Keep yourself with up to date with the upcoming standards, know its quirks, potential uses and even formulate creative uses with the new APIs. Personally, I would go with this as you will be flexible in any environment that runs JS, framework or no framework, browser or some other platform.<p>Since JS is not just limited to the web, there&#x27;s a bunch of other fields to explore. Not all are for finding new jobs, but knowing them could add sugar to your portfolio.<p>- Robotics, there&#x27;s the Tessel.<p>- If you&#x27;re into type-hinted JS, then there&#x27;s TypeScript.<p>- Embedding JS in a microcontroller, there&#x27;s MuJS.<p>- Programming on mobile, there&#x27;s PhoneGap.<p>- Taking that further, where JS is your phone&#x27;s platform, there&#x27;s FirefoxOS.<p>- Into game development, there&#x27;s a lot of game engines for JS.<p>- Desktop app development, there&#x27;s NW.js",1444566225
