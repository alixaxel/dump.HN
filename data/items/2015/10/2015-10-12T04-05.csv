difficult ones, but I was not allowed to do so. In the end we settled on 12 questions. The result of this intervention by

I do basically exactly this - redevelop models into production-quality code for broader deployment. I do this for &#x27;closed&#x27; models as well (code that researchers do not have available for download from a website, for whatever reasons - mostly because they don&#x27;t care, which is fine). Models being &#x27;closed&#x27; this way does not make them &#x27;black boxes&#x27; or &#x27;not reproducible&#x27; - whatever the code does, needs to be described in the paper(s) anyway (the concepts, not the implementation details).<p>The way to do a baseline verification of the implementation of models is by having minimal synthetic data sets and doing unit tests on them. Usually people develop their model based on their full 20000-observation or whatever data set, with numbers with 15 digits etc. - the only way to spot mistakes in such an implementation is if they are several orders of magnitude off.<p>I once found a calculation in some Fortran code that mistook kilometers for meters (or the other way around, can&#x27;t remember; either way, the result was that one component of the model was off by a factor 1000). This hadn&#x27;t been discovered in 10+ years, by many users, some of whom (much to my horror) actually used this model to advise on subsidies for certain sectors. Now, it&#x27;s not that the results where completely unreasonable, because someone would have noticed; it&#x27;s the small mistakes that are the worst, especially when they are non-linear.

For the seller to inform the buyer about any material things they are aware of affecting the item being sold (&#x27;duty to inform&#x27;) and for the buyer to look at the item being sold long and hard to see if there is anything they can find that will affect their judgment (&#x27;duty to research&#x27;).<p>So from an ethics and an honesty perspective you&#x27;re 100% right, and from a legal perspective you are <i>also</i> right but that&#x27;s where it gets hairy. Because the &#x27;duty to inform&#x27; is not specified in enough detail to make that duty an explicit thing without wiggle room these cases (where a seller should have been aware of a defect but did not disclose it) usually end up in front of a judge and it is definitely not an open-and-shut thing that every such case is ruled in favor of the party filing the complaint. It&#x27;s one thing to state that a seller should have been aware of something but quite another to prove that they actually were aware of something.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a deal or two where the seller was &#x27;glad to be rid of &#x27;x&#x27;&#x27; where you&#x27;d expect them to be perfectly aware of the situation and where the buyer did their DD and were totally happy with what they bought. So sometimes it is simply a matter of perspective and the supposed defects are simply not as relevant to the buyer as they were to the seller.

Take the top 10 thousand highest paid professionals in each of these industries and compare them to the same group in Tech. I&#x27;ll guarantee you the tech industry will have less homogeneity. You&#x27;ll see far more non-white-men in high positions in tech than you would in any other high paying industry. It doesn&#x27;t mean the industry has achieved diversity nirvana. It just means that the increasing attacks on the industry are opportunistic and knee-jerk reactions to the growing influence of silicon valley on the rest of the society.",1444622554

I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to it.<p>I ended up taking the Southern Border with Professor Shaiken. That was by far one of the most educational and interesting courses I had taken at CAL.<p>I too would like to see the University&#x27;s side, but I am inclined to believe they can&#x27;t respond for legal reasons, and if they could their response would be far more vanilla then Prof. Coward&#x27;s side.",1444622510

I just think that <i>if</i> every instance of disparate impact is assumed to be solely due to discrimination, then we also need to start treating homelessness and the prison-industrial complex as gendered issues disproportionately affecting men.<p>> The APA has found that men are more likely to become substance abusers, which is linked to homelessness and conviction rates.<p>One could (tongue firmly in cheek) argue that this is due to implicit anti-male biases in society.",1444622462

It does not look good for employers to have the same kind of public litany of complaints against an employee.<p>Some things stand out from a quick skim of the personnel file/included complaint. Among these: he did not practically assign homework or have regular quizzes. This was noted as not being consistent with department norms. It actually _is_ of value to have consistency between multiple sections of introductory classes and as preparation for follow on classes in the same sequences (e.g Calc 1, 2 3 having similar structures in class organization) he seems to have disagreed philosophically with his boss (department chair) on this front. There are some other parts of the files posted that suggest he apparently did not work well with his graduate student instructors (teaching assistants). In my mind those are big enough reasons to let someone go.<p>He might be a great instructor. It might be a huge mistake for them to let him go, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t seem like the only available explanations are completely specious or wrongly-motivated reasons. Also missing from submitted link is some info in the complaint that this was attempted to be worked out with a new incoming department chair, as evidenced by this being posted it seems like that didn&#x27;t work out.",1444622425
