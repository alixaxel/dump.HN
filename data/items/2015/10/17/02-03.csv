The task of removing microorganisms and fungus from water has been well studied.<p>Science knows of effective agents which are proven to purify water of micro-organisms like bacteria and also fungus.  Some of these are being utilized in public water decontamination, and others while also effective are not used because they are less cost efficient to produce.<p>Water purifying agents have a varying range of effectiveness and also and a varying range of toxicity to the human body.  There are a couple of agents in particular however which are both well tolerated by the body and are also remarkably effective at decontaminating water.<p>The one which my research indicates leads the pack in this area is a white crystalline salt named Potassium Iodide, KI.  KI has been used widely by both the military and by campers in portable water decontamination.<p>A solution of Potassium Iodide in water (known colloquially as Iodine) was a leading and apparently very effective drug during the 19th century in the United States.  There are doctors today who prescribe milligram doses of KI (many many times more than the RDA) to treat a wide array of ailments but especially in dermatology.

This means HTTPS, SSH, IPsec, SMTPS, and protocols that rely on TLS are potentially vulnerable. Where’s there’s smoke, there’s fire and there’s a lot of smoke indicating the NSA can do this. They have the money, technology, infrastructure and the technical ability to pull this off.<p>From <a href=""https://weakdh.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://weakdh.org</a>:\n>Breaking the single, most common 1024-bit prime used by web servers would allow passive eavesdropping on connections to 18% of the Top 1 Million HTTPS domains. A second prime would allow passive decryption of connections to 66% of VPN servers and 26% of SSH servers. A close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency’s attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break.<p><i>This is real</i>.<p>It’s all of the networking infrastructure that no longer gets software/firmware updates running 512, 768 and 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman that are likely already being exploited, not to mention all of the old VPNs, email servers, SSH clients, etc. that can’t be easily upgraded and can’t use more secure encryption protocols. After all of the hoopla dies down, this is the ongoing problem.<p><i>But don’t panic.</i><p>On current operating systems, going to larger 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman or using Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH) addressed the problem. As has been pointed out several times, 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman isn’t double the strenght of 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman; we’re going from a keyspace of 2^1024 to 2^2048. So unless there’s an unprecedented crytography breakthrough or quantum computers start sprouting like Dandelions, 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman is firmly in the &quot;it would take more energy than what would be required to boil all of the oceans on Earth&quot; arena.<p>If you’re going the ECDHE route, everyone agrees that the NIST curves are suspect and that Curve25519: <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html</a> is what you want.

It was a reference to the fact that, at your system boundaries the benefit of a strongly-typed language aren&#x27;t only offset by the lack of flexibility, but, in the case of Go, it&#x27;s weak reflection capabilities and type system.<p>A web app has 4 (often more, rarely less) such boundary:<p>- Getting input from users<p>- Querying a database<p>- Getting results from a database<p>- Outputting results to the user (html, json, ....)<p>Within these boundaries, yes, static languages are less error prone. But you get no compile time checks AT the boundaries. You&#x27;ll need integration tests (and it&#x27;s easier to write tests in a dynamic language (where IoC is a language feature) than static languages.<p>You deal with these boundaries via automated mapping (with annotations, or external files (like in Hibernate)) or manual mapping. Automated mapping might not be much more error prone,  but it&#x27;s certainly much more cumbersome (especially with weak reflection). Manual mapping is also much more cumbersome. Does this cumbersomeness make it more error prone? I don&#x27;t think it helps.",1445048079

You can&#x27;t entirely deceive yourself if you don&#x27;t know what you just took.<p>Also, there is some degree of honesty required for this experiment. If someone really wanted to, they could open up the pills and taste them to see if it&#x27;s placebo or not. They could also intentionally lie. But the goal here is to learn about yourself through experimentation, so I expect most people that participate to have some level of desire for truth and honesty.

I was going to write the same as the github title but it didn&#x27;t fit.  It is clearly a toy---<i>ahermmg</i>---semi-serious theoretical exercise, and not a real competitor to bitcoin or zerocoin, you are right in that respect.<p>This (as far as I know) does make it impossible to trace the history of a coin, because there is no recorded transaction history, assuming you don&#x27;t send the transaction details directly from your ip (and valid coin transfers are mathematically impossible to spoof from e.g. an exit node).  You also don&#x27;t need a centralized tracker, you just need a public record of all known coins which is kept in sync across several mirrors.  I should clarify that in the readme; the only reason why I mention assuming a centralized tracker is for the performance estimate, because syncing trackers would induce overhead.  Unless you see something I am missing...<p>The reason why this uses zero-knowledge proofs is twofold; first, to allow anonymization of individual transaction ids by ensuring it is impossible to spoof transactions without knowing the secret key of the corresponding coin, and second to avoid the use of a blockchain which further degrades anonymity.  Again, it may be that you have discovered a reason why this does not hold, in which case I would be interested to hear it!<p>Regarding the matter of coin transfer, this was a design decision because of the project scope.  I could have spent many days implementing a transaction system which did not depend on the secrecy of keys, but I have other commitments.  That being said, there are a subset of transactions (involving money, but also authentication of physical goods in transit, for example) which can potentially be treated this way.  For instance, I can use it to verify the user is in possession of a particular hardware (a physical &quot;coin&quot;) which stores the secret key in encrypted form.  Which could be useful in e.g. shipping applications, who knows.",1445047587
