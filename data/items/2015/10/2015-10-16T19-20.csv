I did that on Schneier&#x27;s blog below:<p>&quot;The room for error here is in the ASIC assessment. We need to figure out how much they can parallelize this, either in cores or custom circuits, in a given ASIC. Then, how many of those can do in one chip at 14-28nm. Then how many they can squeeze in a rack. Then how much factoring can be done with Amazon or Microsoft datacenters full of those. That would be the most paranoid assessment.<p>You see, the unit prices of these things are really low vs initial development costs. That&#x27;s one of main drivers for hardware to shrink. The chips might cost pro&#x27;s $10-30 million to develop with boards a tiny fraction of that. Then, the chips themselves are fabbed dirt-cheap with the boards being inexpensive. If algorithm doesn&#x27;t need much communication, then they can use standard I/O options to farm out the jobs which then just run until they complete. They could add more capacity year after year cheaply with incremental energy cost after spending a ton of money on chip design and real estate just once. They could get 50,000-100,000 chips with multiple accelerators on each every year.<p>So, I think the authors upper bound is lower than the real upper bound. Need to get specialists who have implemented algorithms like this in hardware to show how it will likely be implemented. Need at least one person whose done a 28nm design to estimate how much of the chip can be dedicated to that with the other functions considered. Then multiply that by whatever Amazon has to get a decent upper-bound. &quot;",1445025513

J Edgar Hoover investigated Dr Martin Luther King Jr as a subversive and used the FBI to try to pressure him to suicide himself. Nixon is on tape ordering J Edgar to investigate his political opponents. Perhaps the US political system fails and whatever government replaces it finds a trove of NSA data and uses it to find+convict political dissenters. Just because the 1st Amendment exists and protects open political discussion now doesn&#x27;t meant it will always exist in its current form.<p>* Hackers/crackers/phishers and organized crime. The NSA data troves _must_ be a juicy target. If any malicious intruder gets access to the data (I know, highly unlikely), what could they use it for? Surveillance, tracking, blackmail, extortion, political affiliations, personal beliefs, etc. What if they don&#x27;t target you, but rather political leaders in the US. That would make the holders of that information _way_ more powerful than any political campaign donor.<p>* Have a US security clearance? You are subject to very high standards of conduct. Anything that could impair your judgement or lead to possible blackmail of you or your family is potentially grounds for taking away your security clearance (which likely means you can no longer do your job). Alcohol addiction, gambling addiction, sexual relationships, history of crime, immoral behaviors, etc. Gen David Patreus (Director of the CIA, IIRC) was in an extra-marital affair and tried to his this fact from &quot;the company&quot; and from politicians. In this scenario, he is a &quot;bad guy&quot;.<p>* You are assuming the NSA only uses records for official purposes. We have already heard that some NSA employees have been reprimanded for snooping on their spouses and neighbors using work tools.<p>* It&#x27;s not as if the NSA has a perfect record. Snowden wasn&#x27;t even close to being the first whistleblower and it looks like there may be another post-Snowden disclosure. The NSA doesn&#x27;t have control of its own people (or contractors) so I assume it doesn&#x27;t have perfect security procedures either. That means it is open to threats against its data and procedures from both inside and out.<p>* The NSA is suspected to have tipped off the DEA/DHS and FBI for cases that don&#x27;t involve terrorism or national security. NSA techniques are suspected to have been adopted by much of DHS. This means the threshold to be considered a &quot;bad guy&quot; is now a lot lower than the NSA used to be tasked with watching. Apply the slippery slope argument. What if the NSA quietly helps out with civil cases (such as MegaUpload) and not just criminal? What if it goes even further?<p>* The NSA isn&#x27;t the only organization trying to gain access to sensitive internet communications. If anyone else finds out how to take advantage of some of the same tricks the NSA uses, they could potentially have access to the same data and communications. Think nation-states, organized crime, disorganized criminals, even marketing/tracking companies with questionable ethics.<p>* If SSL / TLS is no longer beyond cracking in near-real-time, MITM is now possible. This could set back peoples&#x27; faith in the security underpinnings of the web even more than it has been eroded in recent years. Even worse if people don&#x27;t find out about it.",1445024536

</code></pre>
This benefit soon disappears due to two reasons:<p>1. If your files change, SpiderOak saves versions of them indefinitely, with each taking up space (of course, all the deltas and stuff). There is no simple way to set it up so that file versions older than X days/years get deleted. The SpiderOak client is completely useless if you want to delete older versions of files because <i>you&#x27;d have to wade through all your directories and subdirectories looking for files with multiple versions.</i><p>2. The SpiderOak client has also been buggy and ends up creating file versions of unchanged files too (like photos you may have saved once on your computer and never touched). So there&#x27;s no easy way for you to get to specific places where files have several versions stored and do some cleanup.<p>This cleanup of older versions matters a lot more if you have a smaller account quota, lesser free space on your account, and you&#x27;re not willing to pay for the $129 a year 1TB option that is heavily pushed (compared to the other tiers) by skewed pricing on SpiderOak&#x27;s part.<p>Overall, SpiderOak is still better though. Dropbox is more dishonest in its approach to deduplication. Dropbox dedpulicates data across user accounts (so if you and I store the same free eBook from Project Gutenberg on our Dropbox accounts, Dropbox saves only one copy) and deduplicates data within your user account for files you may have replicated across folders. But in both the cases it treats your space quota as if deduplication is not done at all, effectively charging you for more than the space you&#x27;re actually using.",1445024448

    &#x27;c&#x27;,

going further, would it also make sense to start an else-if check train with ``if false; &#x27; &#x27; ? e.g.<p><pre><code>  if false;
  else if check 1; etc
  else if check 2; etc
  else if check 3; etc

the second way grants a refactor-er the ability to re-order the elif checks without modifying any of the statements, reducing the chance of basic errors.

Amazon pulled two books from customers that had paid for them, from what I understand over a rights dispute. The books were not only &quot;in the cloud&quot;, but had already been retrieved and stored on the customers&#x27; devices for consumption, and Amazon went out of their way to delete them from the devices as well, using a backdoor. What exactly was the collective benefit of the cloud in this case? How did the shared, administered, cloud-based technologies empower the users in this instance, if we take &quot;users&quot; in this case to mean the affected customers? Is a deliberate backdoor into your device an inevitable aspect of cloud based technologies?<p>Who <i>did</i> benefit from the action? The winners in this were probably Amazon and the claimant in the dispute. It certainly wasn&#x27;t the customers. If it was your intention to address the case in point in the above quote, I think that you are conflating &quot;cloud-based technologies&quot; with a generally shitty customer rights, as if the two need to go hand in hand. Meanwhile, tons of people are using &quot;cloud-based technologies&quot; illegally to download books in without agreements and format and device lock-downs that completely screw them over at the whim of the distributor.<p><i>> Users are willing to accept a massive spike in convenience and utility for the drastically-less-than-1% chance that Amazon kills their favorite book from their device, without their consent, with a refund.</i><p>Some are not, or may not be if they had the effects detrimental to their rights listed to them.<p><i>> That&#x27;s not evil; it&#x27;s the nature of progress</i><p>What do you mean by progress here? In the most general sense of the word this is a rather meaningless conclusion. I don&#x27;t see how the tax analogy explains it. When I pay taxes, I do it for the benefit of society. The money I pay actually go towards infrastructure and welfare. When Amazon removes a book from my library, how does it benefit society?

Based on the evidence we have, we can’t prove for certain that NSA is doing this. However, our proposed Diffie-Hellman break fits the known technical details about their large-scale decryption capabilities better than any competing explanation. For instance, the Snowden documents show that NSA’s VPN decryption infrastructure involves intercepting encrypted connections and passing certain data to supercomputers, which return the key. The design of the system goes to great lengths to collect particular data that would be necessary for an attack on Diffie-Hellman but not for alternative explanations, like a break in AES or other symmetric crypto. While the documents make it clear that NSA uses other attack techniques, like software and hardware “implants,” to break crypto on specific targets, these don’t explain the ability to passively eavesdrop on VPN traffic at a large scale.&quot;<p><a href=""https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/haldermanheninger/how-is-nsa-breaking-so-much-crypto/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/haldermanheninger/how-is-...</a>",1445023783

It&#x27;s an important step, and reducing it to 5 seconds per page doesn&#x27;t magically eliminate tedious downstream processing with other tools[3].

Read a good long book instead.<p>- Meet some good friends, and do it often.<p>- Don&#x27;t give up to yourself. Don&#x27;t work at a boring non challenging job. It will rot your soul from the inside. Keep up with the challenging work. You don&#x27;t have to go over your head, always aim just a bit higher than your comfort zone.

These cases of sexual assault are qualitatively different than acts where the victim is cognizant during the act that the act is assault and unwelcome, and makes that known to the assailant in non-ambiguous terms verbally or through resistance.<p>The trickiest cases are those where the &quot;victim&quot; is intoxicated (but most likely both parties are intoxicated and both may be making poor decisions) and the following day determines it was assault. These examples, when they happen, illustrate the impact of cultural conditioning to how people perceive such events. In our society today, when someone has intercourse with someone who when sober they consider sexually undesirable, we condition men and women to perceive such an event differently. Men are conditioned to view sleeping with someone that they wouldn&#x27;t sleep with sober as an poor decision and to brush it off as a mistake (&quot;keep on keeping on&quot;). In prior decades, women generally viewed such encounters the same way as men do (&quot;Ugg, I fucked up. I should have drunk as much and shouldn&#x27;t have slept with him&quot;). Today, however, the identity politics and gender warfare happening on college campuses are teaching women to instead have the reaction &quot;He took advantage of me when I was drunk. I&#x27;m a victim and have been assaulted&quot; (despite the fact that that other person was probably intoxicated as well).<p>What&#x27;s most unfortunate about such conditioning of one gender to view themselves as a victim after the fact in ambiguous situations is that it delegitimizes real claims of assault and leads society to question and doubt that sexual assault occurred in situations that are unambiguous. Getting drunk and sleeping with someone and regretting it the next day and claiming rape is an insult and disservice to those people who actually are sexual assaulted against their will.<p>I would be nice if we didn&#x27;t use an ambiguous catch all term like sexual assault and instead used a variety very specific terms for the different acts that people currently lump under sexual assault. People who get drunk and sleep with someone they regret sleeping with should not be using the same term to describe what happened as someone who is attacked and forcefully penetrated while walking late at night or someone who is sent to prison and victimized physically by another prisoner.",1445023041

There are several factors to consider in determining if someone may know someone that FB uses. The weight of each factor combined determines the likelihood of the individuals knowing each other. Some of those factors are in no particular order:<p>1. Mutual friends
1a. If Friend X talks to Person Y a lot, and you a friends with Friend X and you talk to Friend X lot via liking and commenting on FB, there is a higher chance of you knowing Person Y. Compared to if you are just friends with Friend X and don&#x27;t really communicate with them.<p>2. Education - did you go to the same school or are you friends with people that went to the same schools.<p>3. Community - do you live in the same community, city, state.<p>4. Work - have you worked together or for the same company. Are you friends with people that work with him or her.<p>5. Are you in a photo, or same album, posted to FB with this individual. For example, if Friend X creates an album and uploads 100 photos to that album. If you are in some of the photos with Friend X and Person Y is in some of the photos with Friend X there may be a good chance you know each other.<p>6.
