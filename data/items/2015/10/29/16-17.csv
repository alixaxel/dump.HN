Of course, our reactions would also not be static.<p>My point was not prediction of specific outcomes, but rather to illustrate the <i>tremendous</i> disparity between the two scales - even in a year when we lost an order of magnitude more people to terrorism than is typical.<p>(You are also correct that there are substantial effects beyond the direct loss of life - but that is true with heart disease as well.)<p><i>&quot;The entire country would be in ruins. There would be no more cities&quot;</i><p>This is still exaggerating the scale.<p>If we say 3000 9/11 sized-attacks and 3000 dead in 9/11, that&#x27;s 9 million people.  In that time, our population grew by 50 million.<p>If we say the 9/11 attacks destroyed 10 million square feet of office space, that&#x27;s 30 billion - about twice what we added between 2003 and 2012 (per <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/buildstock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/reports/2012/build...</a>), so plausibly about what we&#x27;ve <i>added</i> total in that time.<p>There may be &quot;no more cities&quot;, but it would be due to a response of radical decentralization (probably not a bad move, in that situation) not because the cities were physically destroyed.",1446137998

The effect of solar so far is a small dip in noonday demand. The daily high point is about 6pm at the moment, as the end of the working day overlaps it getting dark here.<p>From the rest of the graphs you can see gas and coal ramping up and down over the course of the day. Gas is capable of fairly rapid response. At the peak, the pumped storage (Dinorwig) is turned on.<p>Until rooftop solar pushes daytime net demand below the 4am current demand low, I don&#x27;t think we need to panic about storage.<p>The government policy on subsidies is incoherent; subsidies for renewables are being cut, but the Hinkley Point C nuclear deal includes an obligation to buy the power at a price far above market or renewable levels.<p>Personally I have 3.8kW of panels on my roof. At some point I&#x27;ll go and have a look at the data logger and see what conclusions to draw.",1446137932

[0] The &quot;targeted men&quot; are more likely to receive negative and neutral tweets and less positive tweets than the &quot;targeted&quot; women that are often cited. I see Chu being shit on more than anyone else, honestly.<p><i>>personal observations of many tweets</i><p>My entire experience with #GG has been with a large transgender crowd and an entire community panicking and trying to contact local authorities or family of a member because they were contemplating suicide after someone outed them as trans to their employer. Any &quot;harassment&quot; I&#x27;ve seen is calling people out on their bullshit.<p>e.g Anita&#x27;s newest list of harassment, someone said they &quot;recognized a lot of names from #GamerGate&quot; - nobody active in #gamergate recognizes <i>any</i> of the names. Are the tweets harassment? Yes, most of them were. Are they tied to #GG in any way? No, they aren&#x27;t.<p><i>>plus many different articles by journalists</i><p>I hope you don&#x27;t mean the same journalists being slammed for their ethics. They found that the people accusing them of being morally corrupt are &quot;actually&quot; the morally corrupt and should not be listened to? Well, okay then. Or do you mean <i>different</i> journalists who don&#x27;t have any skin in the game?<p><i>>claims that the media was distorting what happened at SXSW</i><p>The last 3 &quot;positive #Gamergate [panel, gathering, etc]&quot; have received bomb threats and have been cancelled due to it. That&#x27;s being ignored by the media entirely and swept under a rug as if it doesn&#x27;t matter. If it were an anti-GG [panel/gathering/etc] and it received bomb threats <i>the media would never shut up about it</i>. That&#x27;s my understanding of the SXSW issue going on.<p>Actually - I just took a break to check the tag really fast. It gets worse than people shutting down the panel, <i>GG is being blamed for shutting down its own panel</i>. [1] But if enough people write about it, that makes it true I guess? That is blatant bullshit. #GG has been trying to get a platform to speak on for well over a year. Every time has been shut down like this, but this time they&#x27;re putting the blame on #GG itself. The sheer absurdity of the claim coupled with <i>fifteen</i> different articles on it to push the narrative is corrupt as fuck. This is the type of shit that is keeping #GG around. Media collusion to push a narrative regardless of facts.<p><i>>It won&#x27;t hurt to get journalists to admit when they&#x27;re being paid by advertisers, but it won&#x27;t do any actual good either</i><p>Of course it will do good. It&#x27;s good for the <i>consumers</i>. I can take their review with a grain of salt knowing there is a bias. <i>Not knowing</i> is worse than knowing without making the assumption that <i>every</i> review is paid for - which is a lose-lose for reviewers. If every review is paid for, they aren&#x27;t reviews and I wouldn&#x27;t listen to them. That&#x27;s bad for the reviewer (nobody listening to them) but good for consumers.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m less likely to trust someone not known for taking freebies who gives a glowing review to a game only to be found 3 months after release they were paid $1,500 in merchandise to give a good review to a shitty game nobody ended up liking. That&#x27;s both <i>bad</i> for consumers and <i>bad</i> for the reviewer (but only if caught!).<p><i>>So how do you deal with journalists being too close to those they review?</i><p>&quot;Hey, I&#x27;m dating the girl who worked on this game. I should let Paul review it because he isn&#x27;t expecting to fuck her tonight and won&#x27;t have an incentive to praise the game if it&#x27;s bad.&quot;<p>&quot;I&#x27;d love to have $2,000 in merchandise but that&#x27;s a <i>bribe</i> that I&#x27;ll have to decline. I&#x27;ll accept the pre-release game in order to review it but I <i>will not</i> accept the $2,000 goodie-bag you&#x27;re trying to bribe me with.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s actually been done before, believe it or not! Some people are ethical enough and take their job seriously enough to deny bribes! The people who can admit they <i>might</i> be too biased to give a <i>fair and honest review</i> are the people I trust the most to be writing about things.<p><i>>P.P.S. I am at this point tiring of this discussion. I will cede you the last word if you reply, otherwise it&#x27;s been an interesting chat. Thanks for keeping it civil. Yes, that&#x27;s a point in your favor.</i><p>That&#x27;s understandable and I&#x27;d like to thank you in return for keeping things civil.<p>[0] <a href=""https://medium.com/@cainejw/a-statistical-analysis-of-gamergate-utilizing-newsweek-data-e2bada31ea7e#.y3v74chux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@cainejw/a-statistical-analysis-of-gamerg...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/mombot/status/658829030431420416"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/mombot/status/658829030431420416</a>",1446137925

The new report estimates that there were roughly half a million cases of multi-drug-resistant TB last year, double the number from the year 2000. Conventional antibiotics can&#x27;t cure MDR-TB. Treatment can take two years or more with drugs that cause severe side-effects; some patients are left completely deaf.&quot;<p>I did a semester-long report on TB in college, and our findings were that multiple drug resistant TB and poly-drug resistant TB would be growing public health problems in poor countries in the coming decades. This was a conservative way of framing that problem. Realistically, TB is wildly infectious, and extremely dangerous to societies that can&#x27;t afford treatment.<p>The clinch is that TB is entirely treatable, but it is very money and resource intensive to do so, requiring reliable access to medication and quarantining from healthy people over a long period of time. In poor countries, compliance with single drug regimens isn&#x27;t great a lot of the time due to nonexistent infrastructure for distribution and treatment monitoring-- requiring a cocktail of drugs to deal with drug resistant TB is no different. Additionally, TB-specific hospitals, where they exist, are largely places that people with TB go to die. Their relatives frequently get infected from visiting a TB-infested hospital den, of course.<p>The rise of XDR-TB (poly drug resistant) means that a growing number of people get a death sentence from an otherwise treatable disease. The suggestions I made in my college report were to invest in healthcare infrastructure and secured involuntary quarantine facilities; the former to help those with MDR-TB and regular TB, and the latter for the rest, who probably can&#x27;t be helped rationally under utilitarian economics of a poor country. Best to limit exposure to the healthy.",1446137286

In fact, when I was a computer science and math student, I lamented many of the modern texts (math and physics ones being the most egregious) for their overly fluffy delivery, compared to my father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s math textbooks from (at the time) 20 and 60 years earlier. I would use theirs to study because they were much better at conveying the topics than the recent calculus or statistics or whatever book we were given.<p>Now, in industry, and in the software industry in particular, this is more applicable.

One for ~15 years and one for ~6 years. The reason for the quotes? Neither of these debts are mine.<p>I was a minor and someone at the hospital assigned something to the wrong patient. I hadn&#x27;t gone into that hospital that entire year, the previous year, or the preceding year. Yet, they keep trying to collect from a 15 year old kid who only went to that hospital once when he was 11. I somehow doubt they forgot to bill my parents for 4 years. This is the date on the actual documentation, so its not like my parents ignored it for 4 years and I was unaware.<p>1) The hospital refused to admit fault and could provide 0 evidence I was actually there when it happened.<p>2) Years later it went to collections, and I was 17. They robocalled and threatened me with jail time and a bunch of other shit. I told them I could prove I wasn&#x27;t even in the state of California [which was true, I was visiting family on the date I was supposedly at the Hospital ... on the other side of the country ]. Proof was provided.<p>3) They&#x27;ve since sold this debt several times, and this year, I still get some debt collector calling me. I call them up and point out I can still prove it was physically impossible that I was in the hospital on the date I supposedly incurred this debt.<p>---------<p>The &quot;other debt&quot; is a parking ticket on a car I can prove I haven&#x27;t owned for years [ I have both insurance and DMV paperwork showing I sold the car years before this ticket happened ], in a city I&#x27;ve never been to, on a date I can prove I was [literally] a thousand miles away at a gas station within an hour of the date/time stamp on the ticket.<p>Guess what happened?<p>1) They sent mail to the wrong address [ literally 5+ years old ].<p>2) They falsely claimed I owned the car at the time and convinced the state tax board to hold my refund when I failed to respond to this &quot;notification&quot;.<p>3) The man on the other end of the phone when I called was abusive, called me a liar, and insisted that I owned the car. He intentionally gave the wrong address verbally to mail documentation proof too. The information he gave didn&#x27;t match their site at all. When he insisted he didn&#x27;t get any of the mail I sent him after a couple of months and I must have &quot;sent it to the wrong address&quot;, I moved on to the next step.<p>4) I had to get a lawyer and take the &quot;debt collector&quot; to court in order to get my money back + legal fees. The moment he was notified I filed, I got a phone call saying there was &quot;No need. He found the clerical error and was correcting it.&quot; and cut a check for ~$4000 that I got about 48 hours later via overnight mail.<p>5) Despite the fact this asshole knew he was trying to collect from the wrong person at this point, guess what? He sold it some other schmuck who tried to pull the same shit a couple years later. The only difference was he couldn&#x27;t get my tax refund hell and just resorted to calling me.<p>---------<p>Now, maybe, I just have exceptional bad luck and I&#x27;m just extremely hard to find. I doubt this somehow.<p>> But if that is the route they want to go the FCDPA clearly states that they can force the debt collector to cease communication for the most part and the avenues that remain open are via written mail.<p>Yeah, every time I do that, they sell it to another debt collector who then calls to &quot;notify me about my debt&quot;. I get these same two calls every year.",1446135672

That DAG is strictly ordered (commits point to their parents and this is part of their identity so changing a commit parent makes a new incompatible commit).<p>Darcs (which predates git, by the way) represents a repository as a loosely ordered set of patches (just the changes, not the full state at any given time). Darcs works to know how to rearrange patches in time to create new states. The difference/benefit to this approach is best illustrated with cherry-picking: in Darcs it is very easy to state that I want the patches my fellow developer created for modules X and Y, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s done with module Z yet so I&#x27;m going to skip those. The patches can be interleaved and recorded in any order and Darcs will do all the hard work of figuring out how to grab just the ones I want, and do so without changing the physical identity of those patches (they are still the same patches my coworker developed). When this works, and it works 98% of the time without an issue, it is a wonderful magic. (Contrast this to git cherry-pick which builds new commits and is likely to have future merge issues with the commits it was built from, even those commits are somewhat &quot;the same&quot;.)<p>Pijul is an attempt at getting some of the same magic of a patch-oriented approach (and smarter patch merging) in a post-git world.<p>Also, it&#x27;s definitely early to talk about switching to Pijul.",1446134641

Two years back, I was getting somewhere along the lines of ten-fifteen calls a day about a debt under a completely different name. They were all robocalls that didn&#x27;t give the option to stop them contacting me, and repeated calls from me to their company, asking that they cease the harassment and that the person they&#x27;re calling hasn&#x27;t used that phone number for at least six years resulted in a lot of &quot;Yeah, okay, we&#x27;ll stop&quot; only for the frustration and annoyance to continue.<p>In the end, I spent somewhere along the lines of three hours of my time in a single day to get in touch with a high-up enough person that could actually take action and stop the calls. This does not include the numerous previous times I called the company and asked my phone number to be removed from their list, or the amount of frustration the numerous daily calls caused.<p>From what I understand, debt collector agencies tend to be on the shadier side. Not saying there aren&#x27;t companies that actually handle matters the way they&#x27;re supposed to, I&#x27;m sure they are, but from what I&#x27;ve seen they&#x27;re the minority.<p>There was even a case where an agency had decided that I had a debt (Amusingly, the amount there was $8.95) and went as far as contacting my grandmother in another country and threatening her that they&#x27;d take her house away if she didn&#x27;t contact me and make me pay the debt I owed them.<p>I&#x27;ve also heard of stories where parents/relatives of friends were contacted and passively threatened with remarks like &quot;We know where you live&quot;.<p>So no, free reign to make robocalls isn&#x27;t a good thing in my opinion.
