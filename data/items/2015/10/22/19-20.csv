After all they are a company and most probably try to develop products that will yield a return in the future. So why would someone chose to work for a Google firm that has no real track record in the Life Sciences versus the many life-science companies that already have amazing logistics/experience in place (Novartis, Biogen, Takeda to name just a few in Cambridge, MA). Outside &quot;data-science&quot; projects like genomics, or very technical project like  lab-on-a-chip devices, I wouldn&#x27;t see a big advantage moving to the bay area.

But then he could go for weeks at a time being totally fine; usually about 4-6 weeks, and in one case a full 6 months. This already started making it hard to keep employment, though, since employers tend not to like random unscheduled absences that are likely to continue indefinitely into the future (even if they understand the reason). Fortunately, he was a lawyer, which is an area where at the time it was relatively easy to find flexible part-time work. That worked ok for a number of years. Once the attacks got more frequent though, even this no longer worked out. Also he was no longer able to maintain a driver&#x27;s license. So by his mid-40s he went on disability, even though he was still ok probably 50% of the time. He would definitely have preferred to keep working in some capacity if it were possible, because it gave him something to do, and even his previous part-time job paid more than the $700/mo disability gave. By his late 40s he definitely couldn&#x27;t work in any capacity (started having mental issues in addition to physical ones, and full-time physical ones), but there&#x27;s a few years there where it seemed unfortunate that we don&#x27;t have a way to better accommodate people who are somewhat but not really fully able to work.",1445543804

There are of course a lot of investment companies who would love to help with that, and first I had to pick one. I picked Merrill Edge because it seemed the easiest to set up the automatic deposit with.<p>At that point, the site told me: Welcome! You want to invest in a mutual fund, right? Here are EIGHT THOUSAND of them you could choose from. Good news! You can even filter them by 20 different criteria that you would know what they mean if you worked in finance!<p>All the highest-rated funds of course have statistically indistinguishable rates of return, so there is no real financial basis to make the decision unless I think I&#x27;m clever enough to know who is a better fund manager than who, which of course I&#x27;m not.<p>Oh, by the way, they&#x27;ve tried to address the problem.

Egad.<p>I have been through a process that was much better than this. It wasn&#x27;t on the Web, it involved actually walking to an investment bank&#x27;s storefront. Aside from unavoidable questions about taxes, they asked me two things:<p>* What year do you plan to retire?<p>* How much risk can you tolerate?<p>And then they picked one fund.

While it may be spot on in some scenarios, it couldn&#x27;t be further away in others.<p>As a co-founder, I didn&#x27;t take a salary until a year into the startup (same with my other two co-founders). Even when we received our accelerator funding, all of it went towards our first hire&#x27;s (an engineer) salary and operating expenses. At this point, our risk was significantly higher, not slightly. If the company didn&#x27;t succeed, I can tell you our first hire was next in line for a cushy market job, and he was being actively poached, not us.<p>After we graduated the accelerator we raised a ~$1M seed round. We hired more two early team members at market salaries. Each of the co-founders were taking $33K salaries. Why? We wanted the budget to hire great people. So no, they definitely not a similar pay cut. In fact, it&#x27;s increasingly hard for early stage startups to hire good talent at less than market rates because there are plenty of amazing startups hiring above market. Our risk at this stage was even higher, because failing would burn most of our bridges with our new investors (maybe a couple wouldn&#x27;t hold it against us), where as if our engineers went on to start something, no investor would think twice about their history working at a failed VC-funded startup.<p>We didn&#x27;t increase our salaries again until we were generating revenue. Even now, ~four years in, I&#x27;m taking $20K less than the starting salary for a junior person in the role I have. While I want to increase that a little more as our revenue grows, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to take a market salary at our stage.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining, but to say being an early employee is a rotten deal is unfair. If our startup goes under, I definitely have the more rotten deal. It only looks like I had the better deal if we succeed.<p>And if you want to start a startup, I encourage it, that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll know how truly hard it is.<p>NOTE: This comment is a rehash of a comment I made on a similar statement. I am reposting it because I feel like it addresses this and sheds a little light on the other side of things.",1445542892

Jobs are never a sure thing in the first place and being a first employee or an employee at a newly funded startup is always going to have some risk.  If you aren&#x27;t willing to take on the risk that comes along with the job, you can work for a non-startup.  Plenty of people do this.<p>&quot;But consider someone who has the ability to get hired as a senior SE at a place like google or netflix, who instead works at a startup for, say, $150k a year. That&#x27;s still probably close to $75K in lost income a year, and I really do think I&#x27;m keeping these numbers conservative.&quot;<p>An opportunity risk, maybe.  However, if the person loses their job..they don&#x27;t really lose that money.  It&#x27;s pretty unfair to put that responsibility on the employer and impossible to prove one way or the other (How are you going to prove an opportunity that will or will not happen??)<p>You could also make that same argument for any company (not just a startup).  If I work at a place making $75K, I could be potentially leaving money on the table because another unknown company might want to hire me for $100K.<p>&quot;1) they may be taking on vastly more risk than you have estimated through lost opportunities/salary/lack of job stability,&quot;<p>Which really isn&#x27;t taking on more risk in regards to the company, which is my point.  We are all taking on risk with almost every decision we make.  Nothing is a sure thing.<p>&quot;they may be entitled to more shares even at lower risk levels because their skills are very valuable (truth is, they may be more valuable than the founder in some cases).&quot;<p>They aren&#x27;t entitled to anything and nearly all employees are expendable.  How do I know?  I was the valuable employee in many companies before I started my own.  I, and everyone I ever worked with, could be replaced.  Was it easy? Of course not.  But the work in most companies isn&#x27;t rocket science...and when it is, the company compensates the employee accordingly and tries to keep them there at all costs.<p>Once again, shares in the company is directly proportional to risk.  If as an employee, you are willing to take a paycheck directly related to the success of the company and, or take on debt when the everything crashes, they you have the leverage to get a higher percentage of the profits.<p>The way I see it, you want a higher percentage of the profits for no more increase in risk, which doesn&#x27;t really make sense.",1445542558

By the time you are 18, probably even earlier, your potential is fixed. I am not saying you can&#x27;t start programming in your 30s and become really good at it or that you can&#x27;t pick up Chinese when you&#x27;ve retired and become fluent in it even though you haven&#x27;t learnt a foreign language before. But whether or not you can do that is determined way earlier. Be it genes, the social surroundings of your childhood or the quality of the elementary school you went to.<p>The only way to avoid disappointment on a tremendous scale is figuring out as early as possible what you&#x27;re good at and then spend most of your time honing your talent.<p>The funny thing is: people who are talented in a certain way succeed even when they do everything &quot;wrong&quot; according to the &quot;experts&quot; who are revered by all the people who will always suck at what they aspire to. For example, I know an established electronic music producer who constantly bought new gear that he didn&#x27;t know how to operate. So he sold those items as they (surprise) didn&#x27;t give him the &quot;pro-sound&quot; and bought some more. Now most experts probably said: &quot;The instrument isn&#x27;t the important factor. Don&#x27;t buy any more gear until you&#x27;ve mastered what you&#x27;ve already got.&quot; Now, people who don&#x27;t make it probably would have taken this advice to their heart and 5 years later they&#x27;d still not put out a record that somebody would buy. Instead they became some sort of experts themselves who have ridiculous discussion on minor technical details and flame wars in web forums.<p>People who archive something great possess the right tacit knowledge that others lack in their &quot;ROM&quot;, i.e. the stuff you got during the time before your birth and before you leave school.",1445541747

One was a paperback physics reader for a very large class, available from the department for $20 (or from upperclassmen for less). The other was for a small math class, was not unreasonably expensive, but also was not very good, but when the professor left halfway through the semester with health problems, the department bought us all copies of the new book. My professors were always accommodating to anyone who wanted to buy an older edition, and in one case explicitly told us not to buy the expensive new edition.<p>In my current department at a large public university, I know of only one professor who requires his own book. It&#x27;s about $40 and has only had one edition since it was published 15 years ago. In most lower division classes we use an in-house online homework system, although we don&#x27;t have a good database of problems for differential equations, so we&#x27;ve typically required the latest edition of Boyce and DiPrima so students can use the publisher&#x27;s homework system. But we&#x27;ve started work on our own problem sets, and we are at the point where we can use our own in-house homework system for it, if the professor is willing to put in a bit more effort organizing and debugging homework.<p>Anyway, this sort of exploitation is not typical in my experience.",1445540852

It is very common, almost universal for younger people to earn less than older people, also their value to the organization is less well defined.<p>Also I would like to say that it makes sense as a young employee to focus on salary, but I&#x27;m not really sure of that.",1445540503

It had one product manager whose job was to come up with product features, about a dozen engineers and a tech lead. The product manager was a nice guy, but we (the engineers) consistently used to come up with better, simpler and useful ideas/UI for the product <i>all the time</i> - this was without any of us talking to any of our customers while the PM constantly used to ask/receive feedback from customers (sometimes our ideas would be shot down, only to be accepted in the next release).<p>My boss (tech lead) was making a pittance compared to the PM - without my boss the product would literally come to a standstill. The inequality/unfairness of it all was just sad.<p>I don&#x27;t see this changing anytime in the near future.",1445540472
