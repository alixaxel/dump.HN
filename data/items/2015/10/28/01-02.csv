My argument is that Go and Rust&#x27;s secret sauce is you wouldn&#x27;t have to write things spiritually similar to that </i>in the first place<i>. (x</i>2)/2 is a bad example, since nobody would write that on purpose, but loops are a great one. C&#x27;s only interface to elements of an array is a pointer. So C has to say that accessing out-of-bounds pointers are UB, as is even <i>having</i> a pointer that&#x27;s neither in-bounds or right at the end, because it simply has no way to distinguish &quot;pointer&quot; from &quot;pointer that is in-bounds for this array&quot;. The type of an array iterator in Rust (and I think also Go) carries knowledge of what array it&#x27;s iterating over, and how far it can iterate; since it&#x27;s part of the type system, the compiler has access to that knowledge. So you can just say `for element in array`, and the compiler knows that you&#x27;re only accessing in-bounds pointers, and generate the same code C would, without needing to define a concept of UB.<p>Of course if you do generate pointers in unsafe code, you are subject to UB, same as in C. Rust and Go simply give you a language where most of the time, you don&#x27;t need to reach for constructs that require UB to be performant.<p>(There is, however, an actual bit of secret sauce, at least in Rust but I suspect Go has an analogue: Rust&#x27;s ownership system allows it to do far stronger alias analysis than even C&#x27;s -fstrict-aliasing, without the risk of false positives -- you <i>cannot</i> construct overlapping mutable pointers in safe code.)",1445995084

The political effort to even get this to the planning stage is already astronomical. Then you get into the endless committees, finding a mayor with the cojones to confront his constituency with the up-front costs, somehow keeping everything compatible between each and every city you do this in (because each will be done by different contractors, each with their own ballooning expenses - 10x cost is not uncommon), and hoping to god the other cities don&#x27;t get cold feet after watching the vanguard get eaten alive come election day for blowing through $5 billion or more (did I mention ballooning costs?). And then of course there&#x27;s coordinating with the car companies...<p>The fact is, autonomous cars as they&#x27;re being done now will win by default, because besides the already huge political momentum they have, they also involve little-to-no cost for municipalities.
