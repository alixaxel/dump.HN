One benefit of the FFI route is that the result wouldn&#x27;t be Rust-specific.<p>Remember that one of the goals is to become confident that the implementation is correct without also having to analyze whether rustc is correct or whether the Rust language has meaningful semantics. If we involve rustc in it, then we&#x27;ve greatly expanded the scope of what we have to analyze.<p>Even if asm! were stable in Rust, I would still prefer to have my assembly language in separate .s/.asm files. rustc gets updated every 6 weeks, which is great, but I&#x27;d really kind of like my assembler to be more static than that. Assembly language benefits massively from having macros, but Rust actually is not as good of a macro language for assembly as existing assembler macro languages. I&#x27;d rather see rustc improve at compiling Rust code than have it try to also compile ASM code.",1445414284

10424183,comment,10423455,10423928,0,0,junto,,,"As another European I concur. Moreover I&#x27;m British but I left to live in &quot;continental Europe&quot; over a decade ago, so I&#x27;ve seen some of the Anglo, Anglo-Saxon and the southern European models.<p>When I worked in the UK, many businesses had a work environment that steered towards the US model, but 9am - 5:30pm was the norm. More flexible working hours are starting to be more common, but statistically the total hours worked is very static over the last decade. [1]<p>On the other hand, here in Germany the concept of &quot;Feierabend&quot; is sacrosanct. Feierabend is the word Germans use to describe the time after work (and the point at which they &quot;clock off&quot;). Germans start work earlier than in the UK, but many finish around 4:30pm or even earlier on a Friday.<p>That being said, the productive hours of work here in Germany appears to be different (possibly just observer bias). They seem to get a lot done in those hours. I see less meetings and less general chit-chat throughout the day. In the UK I would often experience the collection of people around the coffee machine discussing last night&#x27;s TV programs. I&#x27;ve never seen that kind of thing here.<p>Spain was a completely different experience. People didn&#x27;t appear to work so much, but that was simply because initially I didn&#x27;t realise that many people have two jobs, with siesta parked in the middle. They often start earlier and finish late in the evening. The statistics show that Spain (and Greece more so) have a higher number of hours worked annually than Germany (and the UK).<p>From an economic perspective though, those extra hours haven&#x27;t traditionally produced growth in the same way as the Germans have. That&#x27;s not to say that the Germans are particularly more productive (I think that is rather hard to quantify and there are many more factors in play than just being &quot;productive&quot;), but in terms of pure economic success, Spain and Greece are certainly well behind their northern European partners.<p>A lot of that is also due to the kind of economies these countries have though. Germany produces things for export and benefits greatly from a depressed Euro and has done so for the last 15 years. Spain and Greece do not have such economies, and have been hit with the triple punch of economic depression, reduced EU financial support and forced austerity. It is like taking a heroin addict (EU grant money) and forcing him to go cold turkey, but also removing all the furniture in the room and leaving him with a cold concrete floor and walls and leaving one barred window that overlooks a methadone clinic day centre.<p>[1] <a href=""https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS</a>",1445414151

10424173,comment,10418879,10423861,0,0,wfo,,,"Well, the fact that the killings are secret means that all we know is that there are nonzero of them since we know there is at least one; if you choose to believe the number is tiny then that&#x27;s fine but don&#x27;t act like it&#x27;s known. That&#x27;s the very problem behind secret laws/courts/killings; we don&#x27;t know the scale, we can&#x27;t. If we interrogate people in court about it to try and find out they will lie under oath and say it&#x27;s their duty to lie.<p>And of all the many, many issues brought up you cherry picked the only one which only effects a (likely) small number of Americans so honestly I&#x27;m inclined to give that to you since you&#x27;ve let the other 10 or so very serious charges stand. Hooray, you&#x27;ve established that given what&#x27;s public knowledge it&#x27;s reasonable to believe we probably don&#x27;t secretly execute -that many- american citizens without a trial, if that&#x27;s what &#x27;defending the establishment&#x27; looks like then consider the establishment defended.<p>I think police state is a little much but honestly it&#x27;s an amorphous term with no meaning other than as a rhetorical tool to evoke some horrible regimes from history.

10424127,comment,10423850,10423850,0,0,nbadg,,,"As a disclaimer, I&#x27;m working on a competing(ish) protocol called Muse.[1]<p>Unfortunately the documentation for the federated social projects I&#x27;m aware of is always severely lacking (believe me, my own included). It makes some key points very difficult to understand. With that caveat aside, this is what I <i>think</i> I understand about the general system architecture of Diaspora, Hubzilla, and Tent:<p>* Everyone runs their own server. Data on the server is plaintext at rest, but encrypted in transit.<p>* The protocol (only text-based?) governs communications between servers. It describes the kind of things you would expect social websites to need to do: make comments, have profiles, etc. Examples of protocol outputs: Tent[2], Hubzilla[3], Diaspora[4]<p>* Internally, the servers deal with privacy, sharing, etc. Your personal server and their code together determine what data is acquired, stored, shared, etc.<p>If this mischaracterizes any of the above protocols, I would be really grateful for corrections. It&#x27;s to everyone&#x27;s benefit to understand the high-level technical details of these projects. However, the system architecture described above is not, in my mind, a tenable approach to distributable social applications. Simply put, this kind of &quot;private server as my digital avatar&quot; + &quot;protocol so avatars can talk&quot; paradigm completely misses the appropriate choice of abstractions and division of concerns for social applications.<p>First and foremost, this is still yet another example of &quot;privacy by promise&quot;. It just so happens that the promise is given to you by the servers of whomever you&#x27;re sharing with. But then, as data is decrypted at rest, you must also trust their coding ability, their deployment ability, their... this gets very messy, very quickly. The security footprint for implementing these protocols is immense.<p>Secondly, this approach focuses on one specific use case: websites. The vast majority of publicly-networked applications will, at some point, have a need to perform identity, sharing, or content management. However, they may not necessarily have anything to do with text: for example, a distributed sensor network might communicate only using binary messages, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less social. Since bytes are the more basic unit, any general-purpose social protocol should therefore support them natively.<p>A much more robust approach is to address the &quot;social protocol&quot; at a much lower level: to provide only the bare minimum that any social application will need, giving transport-layer bytestreams cryptographically-enforced privacy with many-to-many capability. Only then can you escape requiring everyone to operate their own web service, which is, I firmly believe, an unrealistic goal.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Muterra/doc-muse</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tent/tent.io/master/source/docs/api_examples.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tent/tent.io/master/source...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/bartekrutkowski/hubzilla/blob/master/examples/request_dump_example.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bartekrutkowski/hubzilla/blob/master/exam...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Federation_protocol_overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Federation_protocol_over...</a>",1445413033

10424073,comment,10421379,10423761,0,0,KMag,,,"Passing out from breathing pure helium for too long is slightly pleasant and I imagine nitrogen would be similar.  Though my friend said my foot was twitching.  (I regained consciousness right when he figured out I wasn&#x27;t joking around and had really passed out.)<p>In my misspent youth, I was once helping a friend with a project involving a couple of weather balloons full of helium.  When he was done and we were cleaning up, I was playing around with breathing pure helium.  One breath of pure helium was fine, and I followed it up with a second breath of pure helium, figuring I would feel hypoxia start to set in.  It sets in fast and is actually euphoric.  I remember saying &quot;whoah&quot; and realizing I was about to pass out, and I remember hearing my head hit the rubber floor I was sitting on.  (I did sit down, since I realized there was a danger of my passing out.)<p>EDIT: I should point out that I used to be in favor of the death penalty, but now feel that it is usually little more than state-sponsored vengeance.  I would like to see a cultural shift in America away from all forms of vengeance , and legitimizing vengeance against murders is worse than helping the families of murder victims realize that vengeance is neither necessary nor sufficient for closure.<p>If we as a society are determined to kill murderers, my experience suggests that breathing pure nitrogen would be one of the least barbaric ways to do so.",1445411282

I&#x27;ve spent hours reading the HN, and Stack Exchange stuff on this - and I think the conclusion is, &quot;/dev/random is really bad, because it blocks, breaking all sorts of programs, and 99.99% of people who use it instead of /dev/urandom aren&#x27;t getting <i>anything</i> that they couldn&#x27;t get from /dev/urandom, <i>except</i> the blocking behavior.  The one <i>possible</i> exception is on a system in which /dev/urandom hasn&#x27;t yet been seeded, but there are many ways to fix that, the most straighforward of which is to seed /dev/urandom from /dev/random, and then never look at /dev/random again.  Or, better yet, use <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html</a> which provides a guarantee of entropy, as well as non-blocking nature once it&#x27;s been properly seeded.  The only time it would ever block would be on boot-up prior to it collecting the very few (approx 256?) bits required to generate effectively endless bytes.&quot;",1445411034
