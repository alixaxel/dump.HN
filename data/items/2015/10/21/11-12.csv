10424833,comment,10424276,10424276,0,0,Blahah,,,"#icanhazdf, Sci-Hub, libgen, etc. are all symptoms of the disease. Science is in something like turmoil as it adjusts to the internet. Of course, the rest of the world has already adjusted to the internet - science hasn&#x27;t because publishers have used their monopoly over our scientific knowledgebase to systematically prevent progress.<p>Some food for thought: science is mostly funded by public money. A small portion of that money goes to paying scientists - the rest goes on products and services bought in the process of research. Some of these are necessary. But publishing takes a large chunk of that funding stream - they charge us <i>thousands of dollars</i> to put articles we write on their website. In almost all cases they add no value at all. Then, they charge us, and anybody else, to read what we wrote.<p>But maybe it just costs that much? There are two issues here: firstly, for-profit academic publishers have some of the highest profit margins of any large business (35-40%). Secondly, they are charging thousands of dollars for something that with modern technology should be nearly free. They are technically incompetent to the extreme - not capable of running an internet company that really serves the needs of science or scientists.<p>They systematically take money that was intended to pay for science, and they do it by a mixture of exploiting their historical position as knowledge curators and abusing intellectual property law. They also work very hard to keep the system working how it is (why wouldn&#x27;t they? $_$) - by political pressure, by exploitative relationships with educations institutions, by FUD, and by engineering the incentive structure of professional science by aggressively promoting &#x27;glamour&#x27; and &#x27;impact&#x27; publications as a measure of success.<p>The biggest publishers are holding science back, preventing progress to maximise their profit. We need to cut them out, and cut them down. Take back our knowledge and rebuild the incentives and mechanisms of science without them being involved.",1445428568

10424813,comment,10417697,10418494,0,0,asgard1024,,,"> Arguably, if you knew the exact system date and all other software installed, you could predict exactly how your program would behave.<p>First of all, there is a difference between what you can predict about the system and what you want the system to be. Since even on nondeterministic system you can build a deterministic one, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you can or cannot predict about the underlying system. If you want a deterministic system, you can simply ignore the unpredictable parts by averaging over them.<p>Although, if you know the other software, you could predict the system. But normal application, unless it has root privileges or there are privilege escalation loopholes, cannot inspect the whole system and cannot see all the processes that go on. Therefore, deterministic modelling of the system from a perspective of one application is impossible.<p>But there is actually a simpler example. Just take an application using the pseudorandom number generator. You can&#x27;t know if there are other processes using the generator too, so once you use pseudorandom generator, your application <i>becomes</i> non-deterministic. If on the other hand the application <i>wants</i> to be deterministic, all it has to do is not use system-wide generator of randomness, regardless of whether the generator is actually deterministic or not.<p>The point is, for free will to exist, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the universe is deterministic. Just as it doesn&#x27;t matter in D&D game if the result is determined by dice rolls or a pseudo-random number generator with a known starting seed. People cannot calculate the latter in their heads, so the difference won&#x27;t affect their reasoning (these things are conditionally dependent on the observed reality); that&#x27;s all that matters.",1445428190

I have some experience of it myself.<p>The first thing that strikes me, is why do we (I guess I really mean here, I) undertake these huge projects? What are our underlying motivations, and do they make sense? When death overtakes us, will they still have value to us? Will we look back on them as time well spent? I know I like to dream that my projects will be a success, that they will be recognised - that one day perhaps _I_ will be recognised? But recognised for what, and to what end? As a long time python programmer I used to use some of PJ Eby&#x27;s work such as python eggs, now he is a kind of &#x27;thinking&#x27; consultant. Reading his early blog posts on how to think he is constantly questioning his motivations. I sense in them the snake eating its own tail, because in the absence of a fundamentally recognised base motivation for all that we do, his quest is doomed. Myself as a thoughtful muslim, I consciously strive to overcome my inbuilt motivations and instead focus on &#x27;the good&#x27; - I recognise the problem of knowing where the desire to do good comes from, but at least I feel I have a general intellectual framework to build on without disappearing down my own navel. I value the background force in my life that pushes me to do good (sure, even though I ignore it far too often), before that last day arrives and it&#x27;s too late.<p>Secondly, whatever grand scheme we work on for our own edification, and for whatever reasons, the recognition it will receive is only partly dependent on the quality and utility of the work in question. Other factors such as marketing and simply being in the right place at the right time come into play, probably with much greater effect. As an experienced developer that knowledge, perhaps regretfully, functions as a huge source of &#x27;stop&#x27; energy - I don&#x27;t have the naivety any more to think that I can easily complete the very difficult.<p>Thirdly, reading more of the detail of the work he has done on Mythryl and his future plans for it, the project seems to be one of fighting the good fight of what he believes is the right way to code applications. However, the flavour that is presented to me smacks of a previous generation (my generation) and doesn&#x27;t feel as if it is paying attention to the current tide - to mobile apps for instance. As someone who loves to do it the right way himself and ignore the naysayers I see the temptation - but I ask myself, if it ends up unused as a consequence, what is the point?<p>As for Jeffrey himself, I sense disappointment - of course, it&#x27;s right and natural.

10424712,comment,10422609,10422609,0,0,kastnerkyle,,,"If this really works, the only options I see are that a) it works at a massively ineffective power transfer rate or b) it is dangerous if you accidentally get in the focused beam (or c) a combination of the two). Any kind of beamforming which can get a decent power transfer will, naturally, transfer that energy into whatever is where the power is focused. Granted, uBeam claims to stop power transfer if line of sight between beamer and device is blocked, but then you are counting on a safety mechanism which is &quot;default off&quot; in some sense. I personally would want to see more tests than a 5 week pig trial as mentioned in the techcrunch piece [1]. After all, radium used to be seen as a &quot;health medicine&quot; back in the early 1900s - it was only after years we realized that radiation was really, really dangerous. It would be great to ensure that kind of thing would not happen in this case - but this means something like a multi-year trial period, which is not good for a startup.<p>If it is inefficient, the energy issues we already have in the world make it seem irresponsible (to me at least) to use something that operates even more inefficiently than the current system, which is already causing global problems with respect to energy consumption and generation. Even inductive chargers have efficiency issues, and it seems like converting to ultrasound and back would have some inherent loss, though it is really dependent on the quality of implementation. If they can avoid danger, and only have inefficiency issues, I could see some success here for low-energy requirement devices.<p>If it is dangerous, well that is pretty obvious. No one wants to slow microwave their dog/child/foot/hand if the beamforming is slightly off.<p>I just don&#x27;t see a way for this product (or any number of other related products, or RF energy harnessing generally) to succeed without some (unknown) fundamental breakthrough or incredibly expensive hardware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/how-ubeam-works/?ncid=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&sr_share=twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/how-ubeam-works/?ncid=rss&u...</a>",1445426273
