This is not spoken against in the Bible, but his adultery with another man&#x27;s wife was condemned.  To me, this is implicit support.)<p>One can also talk about whether Jesus himself would have supported Paul&#x27;s interpretation and writings about marriage.  I tend to find their respective teachings disharmonious.<p>Paul very much believed in the order of things, and in authority. And in this case (as in the case of master/slave relationships!), the man has authority.  Both masters and husbands have obligations to use their authority kindly, but Paul did not decry the authority of one individual over another.<p>So yes, in the most common interpretation of evangelical Pauline Christianity (i.e. that practiced in Heartland America), the men are not bullies, but they do possess power and authority over women, and I think this power is the thing liberals and humanists take issue with.",1444798393

</code></pre>
While I&#x27;m not going to claim I hold the same tenets as a book I&#x27;ve never read, I guess that I&#x27;m in one of the &quot;conservative religious denominations&quot; which the author is indicating here.  I can certainly see some resemblance between a few of the examples cited from the book and my current (religiously-inspired) views on marriage.<p>However, one thing I&#x27;d like to explicitly disclaim is the notion that there is any prescriptive support in the Bible for the victorian-era idea that wives should be Doormat Debbies, as alluded to throughout this article.<p>The most often-cited passage in this regard is Ephesians 5:22-24...<p><pre><code>    Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do 
    to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife
    as Christ is the head of the church, his body,
    of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits
    to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands 
    in everything.
</code></pre>
If this is all you know of &quot;Christian marriage philosophy&quot;, please take the time to inform yourself.  I&#x27;d suggest you find someone who claims to follow the Bible in their marriage and ask them how this passage specifically plays out in their married life.  (Hint: If the passage is truly being followed, what you will find is anything but a bully of a man and a brow-beaten woman)",1444797162

Standards committee work is a difficult thing to dramatize, which is presumably why Isaacson gives COBOL no more than a passing mention, but as historian of technology Janet Abbate recently noted, his omission slights several women who, unlike Hopper, were on the technical committee in question. Among them is Jean Sammett, who made the largest single contribution to the design of COBOL. Sammet has stated that Hopper was &quot;not the mother, creator, or developer of COBOL,&quot; an idea Hopper reportedly endorsed by calling herself the &quot;grandmother of COBOL&quot; rather than its creator.<p>> [...] Sammet has not been forgotten, as a fellow of the Computer History Museum and a winner of the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award, but sits on the wrong side of a growing chasm separating the handful of women chosen for public veneration from those whose names are known only to specialists.<p>> This is an example of what sociologist of science Robert K. Merton called the &quot;Matthew Effect,&quot; the tendency for the most famous person involved in any collaborative project, however peripherally, to be remembered by the public as the key contributor.

The reference implementation doesn&#x27;t have to be optimised or produce optimised code, but should be written to follow the standard closely, favouring clarity instead of efficiency.",1444795788
10384977,comment,10384380,10384720,0,0,StillBored,,,"Yes if you need more memory bandwidth, POWER is where its at. OTHO, as I&#x27;ve been saying the base cores don&#x27;t do as well on single threaded loopy or problems with a decent L1/L2 cache hit rate. The specint_rate numbers look good because of the x8 threading, the single core results probably don&#x27;t look that good.<p>So for many workloads it won&#x27;t be that great. For the one I was working on out of the box, the power was 1/2 as fast. But that wasn&#x27;t fair because we had a couple highly optimized x86 code paths. Doing some basic POWER optimizations brought the performance in line with the x86. But on some benchmarks it would win, and lose on others. So while we utilized a _LOT_ of memory/IO bandwidth the fact that there was nearly 2.5x available in the power system over our E5 didn&#x27;t give us enough of a boost to make it worth the higher price tag (nearly 3x in our case, cause we were comparing with a supermicro machine). Maybe this newer power machine changes that a little.",1444795760
