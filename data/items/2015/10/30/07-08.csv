The issue is dated Saturday and goes on sale each Friday.<p>I know from reading it semi-regularly that it comments on significant economic/political developments from around the globe. It does this by breaking the world in regions (Europe, Asia, Africa, Americas) and then choosing to the stories from that region. Elections, power struggles, wars, economic fortunes, social/political movements, biographical sketches. The Economist also has special features on a weekly basis that cover global topics in depth, could be Bitcoin one week, renewable energy the next, the €zone crisis another week, also scientific topics.<p>By necessity (because it is published weekly and because its scope is global) the regular news stories are not in depth but I wouldn&#x27;t therefore call them shallow. They are condensed is the word I&#x27;d use. Maybe they lose a bit of nuance but that&#x27;s understandable.<p>When they do scientific and technical articles I find that their fact-checking and research seems to frequently attain a very high quality. People have commented on this feature of The Economist here on HN. Only The New Yorker seems to be more fastidious. What you call opinion or conjecture is actually their editorial stance§. The Economist is unashamedly biased. They believe in the free markets and I would say have a very liberal (in the British/European sense of the word liberal) philosophical outlook. They often defend their values. To have values is to be biased. What&#x27;s worse I think are publications that report the news and pretend they&#x27;re unbiased, when you can tell they&#x27;re not either by sins of omission or misreporting whether deliberate or not and slanted recounting.<p>§ I personally don&#x27;t share their worldview, I am more socialist than they but I recognise that disagreement on values isn&#x27;t the same as that &quot;well, that&#x27;s just, like, your _opinion_ man&quot;",1446191144

They&#x27;re stealthy - silent and very calculating. You can tell many of them are part domestic dog and they don&#x27;t seem phased by proximity to people and appear to understand the workings of the city to some extent. I have seen the mentioned looking both ways when crossing roads, and also use of sidewalks.<p>Coyotes are very good at not calling attention to themselves when needed. In fact I lived next to a den of them in LA for years and never heard a peep, despite seeing them staking me out from my neighbor&#x27;s roof in broad daylight, testing the perimeters of my house more than a few times.<p>The thing is they&#x27;re smarter than we give them credit, adapting to the man made environment and expand territory very quickly. We talk about controlling their population but they can parry - adeptly skilled at out-maneuvering people. Hold eye contact and you realize even though they look like a little dog, they&#x27;re not your friend - they&#x27;re studying you.<p>The speed at which they&#x27;re expanding territory and where they&#x27;re headed on the East coast now, is interesting. Growing up in southeastern Pennsylvania we never saw coyotes really, but in the last few years I&#x27;m hearing lots of stories about them from family. And now even here in NYC they&#x27;re making an appearance as well.<p>The coyote / dog mix in LA seemed to not only have adapted to urban areas but use it to their advantage. Now add wolf to the mix and drop them in the environs of bountiful woodland and endless suburban sprawl of the eastern seaboard, what happens?<p>If an apex predator were to adapt into becoming an anthropocene survivor species, a prerequisite would be having intelligence enough to outwit humans. A species partly forged in human company, with increased intelligence, that uses our own environment as an advantage, and can hunt and eat us. Oh and reach full maturity in about a year. They may seem cute now, but give them a few generations and they might not be so cute any more.",1446190148
