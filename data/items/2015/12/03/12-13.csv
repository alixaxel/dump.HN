I&#x27;ve read more than my fair share of code that reads exactly like this story because of this lack of programmer understanding.<p>Consider:<p><i>You are born with no body parts.</i><p><pre><code>    Person me = new Person();\n</code></pre>\n<i>Should anyone attempt to interact with you before your organs have finished arriving you will die.</i><p><pre><code>    me.interact();\n</code></pre>\nThrows a NullPointerException because the class designer improperly initialized the instance. The designer should have provided a constructor.<p><pre><code>    public static Person() {\n        this.organs = new Organs();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<i>One by one, your organs are pushed into you.</i><p>Instead, the class designer probably followed the JavaBean pattern and provided a setter method for Organs:<p><pre><code>    public void setOrgans(Organs organs) {\n        this.organs = organs;\n    }\n</code></pre>\netc.<p>(For those that don&#x27;t remember: The JavaBean idea arose because early versions of Java had no way of performing introspection, something that software tools really, really need. JavaBeans broke object encapsulation by design. Many programmers had to write beans to take advantage of their tools, and learned a very bad habit.)",1449147338

There are tons of libraries that have annotations written either inline or provided third-party for one or the other, but the existence of two competing syntaxes fractures the community and tooling possibilities. The capabilities and visions of Flow and Typescript are pretty similar[0][1], so I think there&#x27;s a real possibility of standardization. It also appears that Flow is, at a minimum, intending to support the automatic conversion of Typescript definitions to Flow[2], which would be a good start.<p>A convergence in the two standards would also potentially open the door to a typed-ECMAscript official standard, which would allow for improved tooling, greater support in libraries and transformers, and eventual browser adoption.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1265"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1265</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/sweet.js/issues/482"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/sweet.js/issues/482</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://flowtype.org/docs/coming-soon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flowtype.org/docs/coming-soon.html</a>",1449146880

10669184,comment,10662461,10669092,0,0,pron,,,"> What exactly makes it arbitrary?<p>The word effect in the PFP world denotes anything that a language-level function does which may affect other functions and is not an argument or a return parameter. That definition is not valid outside of PFP/LC, because it defines as effects as things that are indistinguishable from non-effects in other models of computation. E.g. it calls assignments to certain memory cells &quot;effects&quot; while assignments to other memory cells non-effects.<p>Again, my (very minor) point is that the word &quot;effect&quot; as you use it simply denotes a PFP <i>linguistic</i> concept rather than an essential computational thing. The only reason I mention it is that the word &quot;effect&quot; has a connotation of something that&#x27;s real and measurable beyond the language. That&#x27;s true for IO and time (computational complexity, which, interestingly, is not generally considered an effect in PFP), but not true for jumps (or continuations) and mutation.<p>> delimited continuations (that is, normal higher-order functions)<p>Again, you are assuming PFP nomenclature. Delimited continuations do not require language-level functions at all, and higher-order functions can be defined in terms of delimited continuations just as the opposite is true. Delimited continuations are no more higher-order functions than higher-order functions (or monads, rather) are delimited continuations. PFP is not the only way to look at abstractions and not the only fundamental nomenclature.",1449145114

They used to bundle something called BrowserGuard, which contains a PUP by Conduit. Conduit have since been partially acquired by another company Perion. I followed that rabbit hole last year, Lenovo point blank refuse to acknowledge it is spyware.<p>And it IS spyware. I created a Perion account to see what they actually had going on. They have an online form you can upload your executable to and it wraps their malware in the form of a toolbar. I tested it by uploading notepad.exe, and sure enough it works quite easily.<p>They capture your location and a whole bunch of data about your computer. They also have remote update facilities built into it. It&#x27;s pernicious, and the company structure has been designed to make it very hard to determine who owns it. And Lenovo were very happy to use them.<p>Oh, and here is an article that confirms the autoupdate:<p><a href=""https://support.lenovo.com/au/en/documents/ht101178"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.lenovo.com/au/en/documents/ht101178</a>",1449144369
