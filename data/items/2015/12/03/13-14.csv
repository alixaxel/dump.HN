10669548,comment,10662461,10669184,0,0,tel,,,"Purity can be defined very nicely against the arrows in a compositional semantics of a language and then effects follow as reasons for impurity.<p>This is absolutely just a choice. It all ends up depending upon how you define equality of arrows. You could probably even get weirder notions of purity if you relax equality to a higher-dimensional one.<p>So, it&#x27;s of course arbitrary in the sense that you can just pick whatever semantics you like and then ask whether or not purity makes much sense there. You point out that &quot;passage of time&quot; is an impurity often ignored and this is, of course, true since we&#x27;re talking (implicitly) about &quot;Haskell purity&quot; which is built off something like an arm-wavey Bi-CCC value semantics.<p>A much more foundational difference of opinion about purity arises from whether or not you allow termination.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see a semantics where setting mutable stores is sufficiently ignored by the choice of equality as to be considered a non-effect. I&#x27;m not sure what it would look like, though.",1449151156

That is, the language gives me no guarantees whatsoever that my immutability is actually respected and that other code somewhere else that I did not write (either application code written by a coworker or library code written by a stranger) respects the immutability.<p>I find this argument similar to asking why bother writing in any high level language when you can implement the same things in assmembly.

In the same way you can look at code written by a UX guy and just <i>know</i> it wasn&#x27;t written by someone formally educated in CS, the converse applies when engineers try to do UI.* Engineers historically just cared about the functionality - e.g., &quot;Does this UML depict the information as precisely as possible? OK. Good. Next problem.&quot;<p>You saw the same problems with XFree86 WM/DEs. I spent <i>months</i> trying to get XFCE to be perfect in the late &#x27;00s, but it just always looked <i>off</i>. I&#x27;m a keyboard-consoler 98% of the time anyways, so staying in my `screen&#x27; instance was fine (in fact preferable,)with a nicely configured Konsole (or was it aterm, or did E17 have it&#x27;s own Term? One of those..) full-screened. But such is the folly of projects like DIA and GV. It&#x27;s getting better as NYT and all end up hiring people who have multi-disciplinarian abilities (I think Square or AirBNB open-sourced their dashboard which has a lot of good vis tools) but I really just want a standard, declarative language I can embed in Pandoc that looks good whether I export to PDF, HTML or print it.<p>*LaTeX not withstanding.
