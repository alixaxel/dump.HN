So I guess something like &quot;Yeah, they really fucked us over on that one.&quot; could have been what he said, and it would be misogynistic and thus makes sense to be something that shouldn&#x27;t be said around women especially. The next step is to eliminate saying it around men too, because misogyny hurts us all.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m being half-sarcastic here. It seems like if you want to question this definition of misogyny, you have to concede that every such thing, like casual uses of the terms &quot;trigger&quot; and &quot;microagression&quot;, is suspect. Why is &quot;fuck&quot; so acceptable to say around women that they feel left out when you try to abstain, but saying &quot;forking&quot; and &quot;dongle&quot; was a mini sexual assault that one time?<p>[1] <a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_for_foul-mouthed_feminists?oldid=32221"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_for_foul-mouthed_fe...</a>",1450443577

No studies have empirically gotten at the root causes of the gender gap. Sure, sexism probably accounts for some percentage of women deciding not to choose such a profession, but there&#x27;s no evidence to think it&#x27;s a predominant role.<p>Sounds like you may be projecting your own attitude towards women onto others, possibly? I&#x27;ve never acted smarmy towards female coworkers, and haven&#x27;t seen anyone else do so. Nor have I ever heard them complain about such a thing. Occasional social awkwardness; some older gentlemen being a little too eager to help (not in a smarmy way or with romantic/sexual overtones or anything like that, just polite &quot;old-fashioned&quot; behavior); but that&#x27;s about it. That doesn&#x27;t mean it hasn&#x27;t happened to them, but if it did, they probably would have said something to someone if they felt it was a big enough issue.<p>Of course, I can&#x27;t speak for women in general; maybe a lot of them do deal with smarminess in the workplace. All I have are anecdotes. But your anecdote doesn&#x27;t mean you can speak for them in general, either.

If you confront them on their sexism, they will deny all of it, and truly believe it. It takes a lot of introspection to see one’s internalized stereotypes. Therefore, a lot of the time, you cannot be sure if you have experienced sexist behavior, and there is no way to find out for sure, since the perpetrator doesn’t know either. There are many false positives and false negatives there.<p>Thousand times this.<p>I know that things like racism and sexism is bad and evil. But I also know that I am these things — subconsciously. Having lived in a country with a long tradition of racism and sexism, and given I&#x27;ve ever talked to a black person for a first time half a year ago, I know that there&#x27;s no chance that I don&#x27;t have these stereotypes inside on some level. Of course, I try to fight that and become a better person, and on a rational level I know exactly why these traits are evil.<p>But when I&#x27;m trying to explain it to someone, too often they just hear &quot;I&#x27;m racist&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m sexist&quot; and decide that I&#x27;m a total asshole :(",1450442871

This one showed us not only a potential solution, but also proved it&#x27;s effectiveness.<p>Lea Verou (the author of the article) perfectly explains that even though there is undoubtedly a problem, a problem whose degree is not/can not be calculated (she also indirectly, simply by not giving it more article-time, makes us understand that the lack of statistics doesn&#x27;t mean this problem doesn&#x27;t exist or should not be resolved), this problem can and has already been solved, not by company policies or special rules, but simply by people treating others (women included) nicely, or as my first grade teacher taught me, by following the golden rule, treat others the way you want to be treated, and amazingly across all mindsets and ways of thinking this rule means, for anyone beginning from the wee age that they understand what those words mean, that one should be treated in a way that is free of bias, fair and rational.<p>I will read this article again, and I will recommend it to friends and acquaintances and family, because sexism is a problem beyond tech too (in certain industries it might be an even bigger problem).

I&#x27;d be afraid of super-human charm much more than super-human intelligence.<p>Mental disabilities aside, very high IQ seems to be correlated with relatively low charm and low ability to solve particular problems (how to get people to do what you want) that are far more dangerous than the kind of problem-solving intelligence (or how we commonly define it) is capable of solving. &quot;Super&quot; intelligent people are <i>terrible</i> problem-solvers when the problems involve other humans.<p>Ironically, the fact that people like me view the AI-scare as a religious apocalypse that is as threatening as any other religious apocalypse implies one of two things: 1) that the people promoting the reality of this apocalypse are not as intelligent as they believe themselves to be (a real possibility given their limited understanding of both intelligence and our real achievements in the field of AI) and/or that 2) intelligent people are terrible at convincing others, and so don&#x27;t pose much of a risk.<p>Either possiblity shows that super-human AI is a non-issue, certainly not at this point in time.
