Facebook is one such app for Facebook that uses React. Instagram is one such app for Facebook that also uses React. I honestly don&#x27;t know any such app for Google that uses Angular. Until that changes, there is very little incentive for the Angular team to keep <i>improving</i> upon the existing solution instead of building something completely new with no regard for the people that depend on it.<p>The so called upgrade path they offer for Angular 1.x is a complete joke. That you can &quot;mix Angular 2 into your existing Angular 1 application&quot; would be a true statement with any component-oriented framework in place of Angular 2, like React, and Ember. And this was not true for Ember just a few months ago, which is living proof that gradual improvement can in fact be accomplished with any framework, but of course, throwing everything away is much easier, so the framework developers need to have strong incentives to not do so.",1450223912

10741402,comment,10740363,10740363,0,0,lollipop25,,,"Nope. Not entirely at least and here&#x27;s why:<p>- There are still companies who delegate site development to web development firms. These firms are normally comprised of people who do Drupal <i>and other technologies</i>.<p>- If you are focused on Drupal, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. One should never be stuck with a single technology. I know people who do Drupal with Laravel, Symfony, and even Spring.<p>- Some sites are still sitting on D6 and need upgrading to D7. Some sites sitting on D7 and need maintenance and upgrades.<p>- And if you know what&#x27;s right, you don&#x27;t jump in the &quot;new technologies&quot; bandwagon until a year or two after, when it matures. D8 was just released, there&#x27;s bound to be bugs.<p>- Most common modules that are being used for D7 development aren&#x27;t even fully ported over to 8. That means you can&#x27;t migrate, nor even port over custom code until those are fully fleshed out. And even after they get ported, they&#x27;d still have bugs.<p>- Custom systems will have custom code. This means there is code that&#x27;s maintained outside the Drupal core or modules. This means there will be developers that will handle them.<p>If you think &quot;middle class&quot; developers are affected by this, then you&#x27;re concept of &quot;middle class&quot; developer is not the right one. Also, if you think about it in the other way, D8 simplifies the work of a lower-ranked developer. Why create code when a module or a core feature already does that for you? Besides, a developer and a site builder are two totally different roles. They may meet at some common point, but their differences are quite extreme.<p>And there will always be the need for custom code. Otherwise, we&#x27;d all Drupal sites would look the same.",1450223793

10741397,comment,10740029,10740029,0,0,csense,,,"Beginning CS students frequently don&#x27;t see the point of object-oriented design, because intro-level class projects are by definition small, simple programs that can be readily comprehended by a single person and written from start to finish in a few hours.  For such simple programs, the modest organizational gains from OO programming don&#x27;t seem to justify the extra boilerplate and conceptual complexity.<p>The first time I started using Django, I was really confused and everything seemed incredibly bloated and complicated.  Flask seemed much more attractive -- but as soon as I had a Flask project started to grow a moderate number of features, Django looked better and better.  For simple projects, the modest gains from using Django&#x27;s features don&#x27;t seem to justify the extra boilerplate and conceptual complexity.<p>I know someone who insists that assembly language is where beginners should start.<p>The common thread:  It&#x27;s hard to start working at a high level of abstraction, because understanding the lower level of abstraction first is what gives you the grounding for appreciating exactly what the higher level abstraction does and why you want it to be done.<p>I think the author of this article is at a point in his web dev learning where working at a low level of abstraction is easier.  When he gets to larger, more complicated projects, he&#x27;ll probably end up writing his own half-baked home-rolled MVC, or having a project implode under the weight of its own spaghetti architecture.  Then he&#x27;ll start to see the advantages of using a framework.<p>Nothing negative is implied by going down this path -- it provides valuable learning experience and an intuition for what the internals of a good framework do without even using the framework (since you&#x27;ve experienced first-hand things that seem like they would be common pain points and how they&#x27;re dealt with at the lower level, you&#x27;ll (often correctly) suspect that standard higher-level tools might have ways to help people deal with those pain points.)",1450223710

Because of the new JsInterop system was designed for GWT 2.8, that is shared by both GWT and this new compiler, low impedance interop between Java and JS will be possible, as well as a tool that reads WebIDL and typescript libraries, and generates Java types.<p>As an example if the level of low impedance between the languages, consider the @JsFunction annotation,<p>@JsType(isNative = true)<p>interface EventTarget {<p><pre><code>  void addEventListener(String event, EventListener listener);\n</code></pre>\n}<p>@JsFunction<p>interface EventListener {<p><pre><code>  void onEvent(Event event);\n</code></pre>\n}<p>Using Java8, you can write code like:<p>document.createElement(&quot;button&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, x -> Console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;));<p>The difference between GWT running this, and the new compiler, is that the output of the new compiler is a standard ES6 module.<p>The JSweet claims about GWT are out of date.

I think this conundrum continues to be at the heart of the Yahoo! problem -- they just can&#x27;t decide.<p>The SpringOwl proposal essentially says Yahoo should just get with the program and be a Media company. And, I like that pitch. The playbook is essentially:<p>1) Massively cut staff, and some other one-time things like real estate<p>2) Stop trying to compete on hard tech like search, because they can&#x27;t beat Google or Facebook<p>3) re-monetize the home page and create a more walled garden by creating apps that kick ass over competitors (note these are now media competitors) and are directly fed by the media channels that are working: they like finance and sports to start.<p>To me, this plan reads well, although I don&#x27;t buy the austerity on top of layoffs angle -- who would continue to work there? One way or the other, you&#x27;re going to have to provide a competitive comp, upside and lifestyle story unless they move to Kansas.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it really gets the value creation they say it will, but if well executed, I think this is a believable way for Yahoo! to carve out its best shot at a niche and audience. If I imagine a Yahoo Finance app made by truly great devs up against any number of competitors, I think it could be a win.

A user&#x27;s requested parameters may not have needed the menu, for example.<p>That&#x27;s just scratching the surface of the problem. Okay, let&#x27;s say I create a model called restaurant that&#x27;s actually a Python class, where menu and photos are fetched only when called. That&#x27;s fine and dandy, but now, what if the user&#x27;s request actually needs to render 10 menus, and it so happens that the API cost of getting N menus doesn&#x27;t linearly scale? For example, what if I could fetch all those menus in 1 API call and spend only $X? Now all of a sudden our abstracted Python class is terrible at minimizing costs, because it will make a separate call for each restaurant object.<p>Now add in silly time-based rate limits. Photos API allows upto an average of 10 requests/second in a continuously-moving time window of 5 minutes, while menus API allows 50K requests per day, resetting midnight in Pacific time for American restaurants, and another menus API allows 20K requests per day, resetting midnight in Chinese time for restaurants in China. However, you have nearly unlimited requests for the American menus API if the user has used some login method that gives you a user-specific access token instead your application access token. Oh, and the API that provides Chinese menus doesn&#x27;t support asking for multiple menus in one call. Also, since you have access limits, you choose to not provide menus for less important anonymous user requests, based on some importance criteria, in order to best serve the users that are most likely to stick. You now have a real mess of a framework.<p>In general, MVC breaks very easily for practical purposes when you&#x27;re not in charge of the database, and the people owning the data have business motives and arbitrary access restrictions.<p>If you own all the data and it&#x27;s in a nice little MySQL database on your own servers, then sure, slap an ORM on it and go MVC as far as you can, I totally agree.",1450222621

I&#x27;ve pasted the output from running &quot;$(&#x27;a&#x27;)&quot; on github.com here[1] using both Chrome and Firefox. Firefox gives you a massive chunk of output that can&#x27;t be minimized, while Chrome gives you a condensed output that you can actually navigate through (with pagination). It&#x27;s annoying that outputting a large-ish object instantly destroys the log with way too much output.<p>Stack traces are another annoyance, in Chrome I get a trace that I can minimize and maximize, with all the line numbers resolved using sourcemaps and with hyperlinks to the debugger. My experience with Firefox has been an unresolved giant minimized stacktrace that is really no fun to look at. The debugger also often just takes me to my concatenated 100000 line app.js file rather than using the sourcemaps.<p>I guess it does come down to different mindsets, I&#x27;ve been playing with Firebug while writing this and it seems a lot better than I remember.

It&#x27;s not exactly what I would&#x27;ve done, but then, the meta-lesson from this post is that <i>you don&#x27;t have to do what everyone else is doing</i>.<p>The comment here about the point of MVC frameworks being for communication is true.  However, this guy isn&#x27;t working on a frontend dev team.  He is a consultant doing primarily server-side development, building a landing page for his business.  The code he wrote in this entry probably took him all of about 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, many of the comments here say that he should&#x27;ve used Jade, or Angular, or Knockout, or Flask, or Jinja.  How long would it take him to get up-to-speed on that?  That&#x27;s time he doesn&#x27;t get back, which won&#x27;t be spent <i>working on the things that make money for him</i>.<p>I wrote a similar build script to try out different landing page concepts - in about an hour, I&#x27;d wired up Babel, PreCSS, and Marky-Markdown so I could write all my marketing text & tutorials in Markdown, my CSS in CSSNext, and have a common page layout for everything.  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the MVP generators on the net, it&#x27;s easier to change and gives me more flexibility than Bootstrap, and it&#x27;s a lot less code than writing everything from scratch in HTML.  No, it bears no resemblance to any living framework, and no, it&#x27;s probably not intelligible or sane to any other frontend developer.  However, it doesn&#x27;t have to be.  If I get to the point where I&#x27;m hiring frontend devs, they&#x27;ll be rewriting everything anyway in the framework of <i>their</i> choice, so my opinion doesn&#x27;t matter anyways, and in the meantime, the landing page and product description helped me discover that I didn&#x27;t need a frontend component at all, at least for an initial version.<p>Optimize for the problem you have, not for the problem other people have.

Summers are a bit hotter/muggier (especially in the city) than some might like and winters have more snow than some would like. Personally, I prefer the weather in New England on balance but it comes down to your tolerance for winter.<p>I&#x27;d actually have said Philly had better weather than DC though. It&#x27;s enough further south that summers are starting to get more southeastern in temperature/humidity (which I personally hate) and, while winters are milder, snow storms still happen but they&#x27;re infrequent enough that chaos ensues.",1450220649

In my own volunteering with local anti-trafficking groups, this slavery/trafficking debate comes up. But the choice of words is not straight forward. Yes, people have a clear understanding of what slavery was (at least in the American context). But many people think slavery is part of long ago history and become very quick to shut off the conversation. Using the more unknown term &quot;human trafficking&quot; sometimes allows you to start the conversation.",1450220589

Hence unlikely I will try TypeScript.<p>Despite all its glaring flaws, javascript is an insanely productive language due to excellent mix of features.  To improve upon that Id need to go to lisp / clojure [ but it lacks wide commercial acceptance .. not a criticism at all ]<p>I&#x27;m actually wary of using the newer additions to javascript language - ES6, Promises and arrow notation don&#x27;t seem that much of a win to me, I&#x27;m very sceptical of new being good in language design...<p>whereas I really love Ramda.js as a general underscore / lodash replacement.<p>Productivity seems more a function of how we structure our code [ eg. keep state so we can jump back into where we were in the web app, thus iterate easily - as per the Om approach ] and thinking functionally.. rather than language syntax additions.<p>I don&#x27;t see the need for an IDE .. they tend to come into their own when Your.ColourfulAndCompleteMethodNames are so long they need auto-completion.
