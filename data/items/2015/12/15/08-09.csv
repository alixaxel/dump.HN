10736678,comment,10723734,10734908,0,0,punee,,,"> Once you have one human level AI you can make more replacing each human in the production of the human level AI - you basically start at the end point and working backwards replacing each job performed by a human with an AI.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t see how that follows. Once you know how to build something, you can do it again. Of course. But what if building a functioning AI that can replace a human costs $100 bn?<p>Certainly it&#x27;s not going to be economically viable to replace tasks that do not produce high ROI, even if you assume AIs are paired with indestructible robot bodies made out of unobtainium that are as versatile as the human body (have we even built one of those ever?).<p>I&#x27;m familiar with the idea that AIs could make better AIs and lead to some intelligence singularity, etc. Again, I think there&#x27;s a lot of handwaving behind those ideas. We have no idea what the complexity of building more complex intelligence is, or what it even means.",1450169970

10736667,comment,10732523,10736583,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> My opinion on the intent of the post was to highlight the reality of an &quot;internet famous&quot; person. There is this notion floating around that if you get enough subscribers / fans you can make enough money to quit your job and sign autographs. While many people have gone on to do this, this is not the norm whatsoever. It takes hard work, a head for marketing, production experience, photography, videography...or just a really good idea and/or personality.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m underestimating the naivete of the average person, but I didn&#x27;t realize that people thought this was a thing. Hell, the concept that Internet fame isn&#x27;t necessarily lucrative is so well-understood that even freaking South Park got around to satirizing it almost 8 YEARS ago (and South Park doesn&#x27;t have a tendency to satirize super-niche concepts).<p>Even if I&#x27;m wrong about that and it is somehow novel and interesting to write a long article about how subscriber counts don&#x27;t turn into dollars, I still find the article&#x27;s premise and insistent emphasis that the economics of these distribution channels are somehow sad to be completely wrongheaded.",1450169641

If I would somehow be forced to see ads in order to view the content, then it would not be worth my time or data, and I would not go to the link.\nThe advertisers/website take a risk by placing ads. They know people hate ads. They know people might use adblockers. They know most people that don&#x27;t ignore the ads anyway.<p>People who run botnets that spam the living fuck out of millions of email addresses have the exact same business model. Send lots of unwanted advertising to masses of people hoping for that one idiot who will take the bait.\nIs using a spam filter obstructing their business model? No, because one of the main risks that the business model accounts for is the fuckload of spam filtering that is used.<p>Putting ads on your website as a business model, is using a business model based on risk. The risk that many people will have no response to an advert.\nPeople who use adblockers are built into that risk. So I am not obstructing it. \nSo I don&#x27;t see how it is hypocrisy at all.<p>To me personally spam and ads on a website are exactly the same thing. In fact all advertising (radio, TV, posters, door to door sales, cold calls) is spam by my definition.\nI don&#x27;t want to be told what I need/want. I know what I need/want and I will go find the products/services to satisfy that need/want by myself. No advertising necessary.<p>Why are you a little bit mad? What would you suggest everyone should do?\nI fully agree that advertising will grow worse and worse. And I also agree that adblockers are accelerating this process. And I&#x27;m glad about that.\nI can&#x27;t wait for the whole advertising industry to become so evil and abhorrent to the human civilization that it becomes illegal on a global scale. \nIn the mean time, let the arms race continue. I don&#x27;t see how the advertising industry will ever win.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t run adblock to &quot;Stick it to the man&quot;. I run adblock because I hate adverts. \nBut if by &quot;the man&quot; you mean the advertising industry, then yes. Congratulations to me. Fuck them. I hope I make their lives difficult.

I myself for sure wouldn&#x27;t like it (which is why I don&#x27;t buy bonds) but I&#x27;m aware that I generalize here.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a matter of definition, in the contract is probably written that the principal + interest must be repaid (so devaluation is ok) but the creditor probably wanted principal + interest @ comparable purchasing power.<p>Unfortunately, today&#x27;s creditors often work with other people&#x27;s money (think pension funds) and just pass on the devaluations.

There were obviously plenty of people who cared in the same period, but that&#x27;s not really what &quot;fashionable&quot; means.<p>So no, I&#x27;m not particularly old, but caring about those issues in particular for a couple of decades gives me something like a 15-year head-start on the epoch we&#x27;re currently in, when suddenly even the most ignorant and apathetic person in the country can quote factoids from a Robert Reich book or whatever.<p>At any rate, it was a throwaway remark to point out that I&#x27;m not just pretending to care about the deeper issues underlying how &quot;sad&quot; Internet economics are because I think it&#x27;s the &quot;in&quot; thing to do (I know plenty of people who are like this for any social issue that&#x27;s currently in vogue).",1450168970

I&#x27;m a Portuguese guy, working for a German company. Half of my team is German and based in Germany, but we visit and are visited very often. As you certainly know, and much like the Greeks, Portuguese rank very high in the amount of hours worked, and very low in productivity.

Most current ACC systems use radar, which should not be affected by weather but has other problems like high cost, narrow field of view and you only get speed and distance as data points which are not always easy to interpret correctly. Ideally it&#x27;s combined with a camera to get more information about the environment like land markings, so that you know if the car in front of you is actually in your lane or just going around the corner in the lane next to you. The camera is obviously prone to glare, raindrops, etc.. When the car ahead changes lanes or exits the freeway, the system will try to find another car as a target vehicle and adapt the speed accordingly to keep a certain timegap, if it can&#x27;t find a target it will behave like normal cruise control.",1450166822

How would thinking a problem is &quot;not important whatsoever&quot; imply that someone must love or hate any potential solution? I couldn&#x27;t care less how sports team X fixes their losing record, and yet your claim is that that would somehow correlate with me having extreme opinions (love or hate) about their decision to draft Player Y? Very much to the contrary, I&#x27;m apathetic about any solution, which is pretty much the definition of finding a problem &quot;not important whatsoever&quot;.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m not even sure how &quot;extreme opinions of the problem&#x27;s importance&quot; is relevant to what we&#x27;re talking about.  The original quote was &quot;to the extent that anyone cares about [the problem] at all&quot;. That&#x27;s anywhere from &quot;I care a bit&quot; to &quot;I care a ton&quot;, not exclusively &quot;I care a ton&quot;.<p>Finally, even if you weren&#x27;t very wrong about the premise of what we&#x27;re talking about: &quot;X is correlated with Y&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;X implies Y is a tautology (or close to one) because they&#x27;re the same thing&quot;, which is the original statement I was responding to.",1450166692

Running an adblocker is <i>exactly</i> instructing my computer to use scissors and cut out the ads from the page. What is the difference in your opinion?<p>To make it easier to compare, assume I am Trump/Koch wealthy, and I ask my butler Jeeves to cut the ads out of every newspaper I receive. Did I or Jeeves vandalize or violate any law? Now, times have changed, and JeevesBot is a robot rather than a person. Does that qualify as vandalism or violation? And now the newspaper has been replaced with an on-line one, and JeevesBot has been replaced by AdBlockPlus. How is it any different? How is it a strawman?<p>> Except that such a script is DRM by definition.<p>The DMCA requires an &quot;effective&quot; DRM.

And all AdBlockPlus does is edit pages so that they are more to my liking - just as my user CSS does, and as my preselected fonts do.<p>I think your interpretation of the law is wishful thinking. It&#x27;s not that DRM/DMCA cannot be, in some form, used to make some forms of ad blocking illegal. I suspect it can.
