If nothing, then making a monolithic system is only going to make your life miserable.<p>Well-designed compilers are already split into (at least) two subsystems: frontend and backend. Frontend takes the program and spits an AST (very roughly speakign, although there is also the semantic-analysis phase, and intermediate-representation-generation phase). Backend is concerned with code generation. What your build systems needs is just the frontend part. Not only your build system, but also an IDE can benefit greatly from a frontend (which as one of the commenter pointed out, results in wasteful duplication of effort when and IDE writer decides to roll his/her own language parser embedded in the tool).<p>I think AST and semantic-analyzer are going to play an increasing role in a variety of software development activities and it&#x27;s a folly to keep them hidden inside the compiler like a forbidden fruit.<p>And that&#x27;s the exact opposite of monolith. It&#x27;s more fragmentation, and splitting the compiler into useful and resusable pieces.<p>(At this point I have a tendency to gravitate towards recommending LLVM. Unfortunately I think it&#x27;s a needlessly complicated project, not the least because of being written in a needlessly complicated language. But if you&#x27;re okay with that it might be of assistance to your problems)",1449543374

They&#x27;re not always successful, but the instinct for self-preservation usually gets them out of the way, at least for slow aircraft like a typical helicopter. Helicopters make a ton of noise too, which probably helps a lot.<p>Going 90MPH on the highway is a pretty major offense in many places.

I would always have to wait 20-30 minutes to get a DVD of the studies (PET, CT Scan or MRI even ultrasound, but those are worthless) and then bring them to the doctor. The doctor would be forced to use whatever the portable image viewing program that came on the DVD and then they had to be sent to the IT Department to be imported into their system.\nWe would be there to remove some horrible tumor but before half his surgeries (I can&#x27;t count how many surgeries he had) we would have to go in the day before (3 hour round trip) to get the expensive scan done again. One time I had a scan at 11 PM - Midnight and then drive home around 2 AM and be back at the hospital at 7 AM check in for a 10 hour surgery.

Does it need to carry a camera? Does it need to be a multirotor? Is there a size limit? Is my 1.5oz CX10 a &quot;drone&quot;? My ~1kg GPS guided autonomous quadrotor? Where&#x27;s the line?

Indeed, as amply documented in 2001 (following the collapse of Enron) and 2008 (following the collapse of Lehman Brothers), the avowedly marketized society does not even prevent economic disaster; we need to regulate markets firmly and fairly.&quot;<p>The author jumps to a conclusion fairly quickly: that free-market capitalism caused Enron and Lehman Brothers (and not perverse incentives wholly separate from free-market ideology).  This isn&#x27;t the place to debate that, but rather it&#x27;s illustrative of a larger point about academic professionals: they spend most of their effort engaged in very deep speciality, but occasionally they come up for air and assert broad knowledge, usually about politically charged topics.<p>In those cases, there&#x27;s a palpable anxiety based on the knowledge that they do not make as much money as their intellectual inferiors who went off to work in business, or even worse, to use their professional credentials in the service of business (as a side note, for proof of this dynamic go read university professors&#x27; blogs about Mark Zuckerberg and his billions -- in the hierarchy of &quot;deserves their money,&quot; tech nerds rank last, because they&#x27;re simultaneously capitalists and social inferiors).  This must be explained, internally and then externally -- their life choices are admirable, others&#x27; are not, and something must be done so that elites in the university and in government institutions can reign in the parasites.<p>I agree professional certification is important for healthcare and law -- when my life or liberty is at stake, I want to be sure my chosen expert actually has expertise.  But the author is arguing that some sort of quality of life and cultural recognition should be automatically granted in exchange for completing training and passing tests -- something I don&#x27;t think is worth caring about too much.",1449541434
