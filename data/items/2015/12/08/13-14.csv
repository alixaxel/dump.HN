Knowing someone is present or that some device is in use is significant information.<p>Does the device you are proposing authenticate the reader before transmitting anything?

If you want to read the entire crypto transaction from the next building, then yes, an expensive antenna[1] will be required. If I just want to detect who is carrying a security device, you won&#x27;t need a particularly accurate antenna - it just needs to have a decent gain.<p>My point with that example is that it&#x27;s never a good idea to underestimate how much time and effort people will put into an attack. If criminals can add a man-in-the-middle chip piggybacked onto a chip-and-pin smartcard[2], they can made a decent cantenna.<p>> So do you or don&#x27;t you think RF communication in a security device is an inherent problem in and of itself?<p>RF is an extra risk that should be avoided whenever possible for security devices, <i>especially</i> when effective alternatives are available.<p>In your linked video about the hospital, the smart card was slotted into a reader. This would work well and has no need for RF.

I subscribe to the NHL GameCenter (same thing, different sport) and for the money you pay, the things you can&#x27;t watch are ridiculous (it&#x27;s worse than the NBA one). Only out of market games are allowed, no nationally televised games (always considered &quot;in market,&quot; even if they&#x27;re showing on obscure channels), and the NHL doesn&#x27;t give you <i>any</i> of the post season. I follow an out of town team that&#x27;s bad, so it works for me.<p>It&#x27;s the weird straddling of &quot;old model&quot; and &quot;new model,&quot; and the big players trying to catch up while keeping contracts happy. Up until this year, for example, when I watched my team play on their home channel, I&#x27;d get all the commercials too. So, same as being in-state. Now I just get a message about a commercial break.<p>The weird crux of it all is that you <i>can</i> watch many of the games if you want to wait 48 hours after the broadcast ends. However, in a world so connected, even not being on social media, even following a team 2,000 miles away from me, it&#x27;s <i>still</i> hard to be purposefully oblivious to what&#x27;s happening.<p>I was sorta hoping the next round of contracts would leap the content divide and make streaming a first-class citizen along the rest (I don&#x27;t mind watching commercials while streaming, I&#x27;d assume that would just make those spots even more lucrative.)

10696288,comment,10692841,10696124,0,0,VLM,,,"The other death of sports issue was very carefully not mentioned in the article... look at the median age of baseball fans over the past decades.  Its literally a dying sport, as in the fans are aging and dying and not being replaced.  Obviously not an issue for some of the other sports.  However being a sports nerd in the sitcom stereotype sense is definitely a boomer and pre-boomer generational thing, not so much with younger people, and old people have a way of dying off.<p>The biggest mistake the article made was conflating sport related spending with the housing bubble.  The housing bubble blew because the last entrants into the ponzi were tapped out.  The cost of sports is microscopic in comparison and very few people give up cable because they&#x27;re completely and utterly tapped out.  They just spend the $100 on something else.  Probably a smartphone and some subscription services.  Certainly the last entrant into the ponzi of paying a billion bucks for a team on the assumption you&#x27;ll sell to a greater fool at two billion has not been reached, nor has the very last new sports fan been born yet.<p>The biggest oversight in articles of this type is no one wants to discuss bundling.  The kind of business that forces all video subscribers to pay $30/mo for sports even if they&#x27;re not sports fans, could, with just a couple clicks on a keyboard, change the bundle so all the cablemodem subscribers pay the same $30 extra for their cablemodem, but now it comes with free ESPN video or some kind of web access deal.  There are, after all, only a handful of monopoly providers.  So either pay $30 for ESPN, or disconnect yourself from the internet.<p>Trying to avoid paying for sports is like trying to avoid paying for organized crime.  Or disorganized crime, for that matter.  Unfortunately you can either pay up, or leave the geography and culture entirely.  The government and corporations certainly are not going to help us because they are the organized crime in this analogy.",1449582763

So if I want to reduce bandwidth at my site - or scan for malware, I can install a SSL-certificate my clients trust, and proxy the HTTPS connections, with eg. squid? Just because there are many nefarious uses of an SSL proxy/mitm, doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t good uses for it too?<p>As bandwidth to even home users go up, the need for local caching proxies might go down -- but at the same time, Netflix is an example of how the current architecture of the Internet isn&#x27;t enough if you want to do individual media streaming (they maintain their own caches, but that just means that if one wanted to distribute a few TB of hd video, say an independent documentary series, or even a video diary, one might expect to either have to pay a high bandwidth bill, or do some &quot;proximity caching&quot;). Alternatives exist of course, such as using a torrent for distribution -- but throwing out all ideas of content proxying &quot;beacause TLS&quot; seems misguided.",1449581488

I don’t find this argument compelling, if for no other reason than this: in a world where everyone is moving to HTTPS, we’ve forbidden any proxy or caching nodes that are not under direct control of the server.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI do find this reasoning to be perfectly valid and have implemented many APIs accordingly for quite some time.  It has a lot to do with the first place to look when something goes wrong.  Does the 404 mean I mistyped the URL or that the Application can&#x27;t find the Resource?  Did the endpoint crash or did I mess up the rewrite in the nginx config?<p>That said, Michael&#x27;s counter-argument is well worth consideration.  I&#x27;ve generally left HTTP status codes and Application status codes completely separate for any sizable project, but I find this article and argument worthwhile and will continue to reconsider, as I generally do upon every new project, whether using HTTP status codes to represent general application state is worthwhile.<p>The original point regarding complexity is most important to me, but Michael&#x27;s diagrams do an excellent job of showing how Application state can be considered an extension of the Protocol in specific cases.",1449581363

I just think viewership will continue adjusting where they get their content from.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen anything about changes to streaming in the new deal other than the contract leaves the issue open for negotiating a joint-partnership that could supersede previous limitations, which included teams in your local market, nationally televised games, and the playoffs.<p>I absolutely love NBA basketball and although I don&#x27;t watch a ton of it, it probably makes up for 90% of my television watching while it&#x27;s in season. But I have to pay a cable bill upwards of $100 / month to do so. I really hope professional sports follows the decoupling model and offers higher-value streaming options in the future.<p>The NFL&#x27;s online offering is equally restricting, but local NFL games are generally broadcast over-the-air, so you can pick them up with an antenna, making cord-cutting easier.",1449580790

Anyone seen such a thing?

What does it cost to guarantee at least that, given the variations in sun (or wind) and the fact that the grid absolutely, positively, needs to supply current for any need that gets switched on, anytime, regardless of the weather?<p>Tony Seba&#x27;s big handwave is that the &quot;god parity&quot; happens in 2020 where photovoltaic is cheaper than transmission costs, so even if fossil fuel cost zero, it would cost more than rooftop PV. Ta-da!<p>Ok, for what percent of the population does that give you how many nines? What&#x27;s the complete story that handles conditions in Seattle, London, and really most of Europe?<p>Tony also likes to refer to Molten Salt Solar as &quot;baseload&quot;.

NHL - NBC.<p>I&#x27;m sure the sports that are on ESPN can find an home elsewhere. I&#x27;m not sure the dog shows are raking in huge TV money from ESPN that some PETS CHANNEL can&#x27;t cover.",1449579845

If you wanted efficient, safe, and reliable, battery storage the utility or an independent would be better off setting up a dedicated facility for it. Even if just a series of boxes at the front of a subdivision/apartment complex the manageability goes up a lot.<p>tl;dr utility company just riding the cool wave as it really doesn&#x27;t benefit their consumers. far better options than relying on small storage spread across private homes",1449579666
