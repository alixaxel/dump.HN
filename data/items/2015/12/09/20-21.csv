But there is one more thing that really convinced me already some 15 years ago to migrate a high profile site to static site generation: Security. The attack surface is reduced to your httpd.<p>PS: The site did not see too many changes and not many editors - hacking a solution in pmake and some perl for editor UI was done in half a day and everyone was happy, including the sys-admin (me, again) who only had to apply security fixes every 2 years.<p>PPS: Also, another important reason for some, though for me it was only an afterthought, if at all: Sending a static byte array is much, much more energy efficient than scheduling a meeting with your database for every request.",1449694749

I&#x27;m extremely happy with the decision to switch.<p>Benefits of Electron:<p>* Much more active development, more frequent releases, more quickly addressed bugs (this is huge)<p>* More active ecosystem<p>* Lower level API that requires you to perhaps do a bit more work to achieve the same cross-platform behavior but gives more control and fewer weird issues<p>* Much better documentation<p>* Much better error reporting. It may have just been me, but when I had a JS error in NW.js, the process would simply crash with no feedback whatsoever (which as you can imagine is infuriating). I opened a couple issues about it and never got any help or feedback. Electron pops up a dialog with a stack trace.<p>Edit:<p>* Another major difference is that NW.js uses a shared global object for communicating between the main process and renderer (BrowserWindow) processes. Electron uses evented message passing using an `ipc` (inter-process communication) module that makes for more robust code.<p>* Besides being lower-level, the API is just (IMO) a lot better/more powerful in general",1449694706

10706692,comment,10704115,10705936,0,0,evmar,,,"Thanks (as always) for your informed comments!<p>I agree that you can make pattern matching work without expressions.  My intuition is rather that it&#x27;s not especially useful, because you need some way to make use of the result of the match.<p>Either you embed the rest of the function into the branch of the match statement, or you&#x27;re back to stuff like:<p><pre><code>    foo := ... # Some zero value ...perhaps nil?\n    match get_foo() {\n      Some(x) => foo = x\n      None => return\n    }\n    # now use foo here\n</code></pre>\nThat is, to make <i>use</i> of the result of the pattern match you need a way to get the value out of the pattern match which puts you back in the kind of code where there&#x27;s no pattern match.  You could make just &quot;match&quot; be an expression but now the arms of your match must be expressions which runs again into the problem of Go being a statement-oriented language -- for example, you might want to construct a struct in your match arm but if you can&#x27;t fit the struct construction into a single expression you&#x27;re stuck again.  (It&#x27;s a similar problem to Python&#x27;s lambda.)<p>There might be some other nice way to make this work, of course!  All I am suggesting that if one does the effort of making a concrete proposal you&#x27;ll find that any small feature like this brings in a bunch of related ideas (like Rust&#x27;s semicolon) and is not as simple as &quot;just add option types&quot;.",1449694650

You will have the opportunity to learn low-level features but know how to wrap them up inside highly performant, high-level components.<p>Rust is interesting, but I think it will remain an interesting language outside the mainstream without any major commercial backers (Mozilla does not count). In addition, C++ is taking a lot of the ideas from Rust and incorporating them along with tooling that will provide 95+% of the value of Rust while still keeping the advantages of C++ (see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEx5DNLWGgA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEx5DNLWGgA</a>)<p>What is interesting with C++ is that although a lot of vendors are pushing their own languages - Microsoft with C#, Apple with Swift, Google with Go, Facebook with Hack, Mozilla with Rust - they are all deeply involved with C++ because C++ powers their mission-critical code. Another way of putting it would be that despite all the promotion if all of Mozilla&#x27;s Rust code were eliminated tomorrow nobody would notice, but if all of Mozilla&#x27;s C++ code were eliminated, it would cease to exist.<p>Also, C++ is rapidly evolving and by learning Modern C++ 14 now, you can avoid a lot of the mistakes of C++ that were common in the past and write safe, elegant code. C++ is also experiencing a renaissance (see <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/cpp/cpp-today-oreilly/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jetbrains.com/cpp/cpp-today-oreilly/</a>).

I think perhaps we would have better success with subtle raising of the exposure of women in the industry[1], so instead of explicitly mentioning the gender, have a higher frequency of posts and news articles where women were the lead of projects or of teams that have a majority of women researchers.<p>In short: I think that increasing the public&#x27;s perception of how many women there are in a field without drawing attention to it as a special case, would increase the amount of women studying in the field.<p>At the same time, this is more difficult to implement.

You might think it&#x27;s a good idea, because C++ is based on C, and most of the features of C are available in C++. But writing good C code requires idioms that are useless in C++.<p>For instance, suppose you need to write a function that opens a file, reads the contents into a some data structure, and then returns a result. Before the function returns, it needs to free the memory in the data structure and close the file. If you write this in C, you either have to make sure you only return at the end, or use nested &quot;if&quot; statements, or use &quot;goto&quot; statements.

They don&#x27;t get the expensive tutors, and their parents might have to work longer hours, they cannot afford that trip to Europe the rich kid wrote their essay about, and their home life could be a lot more disruptive.<p>And the nice &quot;perk&quot; of discriminating based on household income and or poverty is: A lot of minorities will benefit because they&#x27;re already in that group.<p>It also solves another issue we&#x27;re seeing: Second generation kids of minorities whose parents are college educated and or professionals. The affirmative action program is designed to give kids with a disadvantage a more fair shake, but it is being used by minority kids who are by all definitions from middle class or from affluent households even more of an advantage, which is stealing spots from poor minority kids that actually need it!<p>So I would like to see affirmative action based on race scrapped.

Along the way a few books and other recommendations are thrown in.<p>This is all rather trivial stuff.<p>While, I don&#x27;t disagree with everything that the author says, I think that it should be acknowledged that his claim is pretty much unfounded. There are those who have not done any (or all, or much) of these things and their rating is above 1800, and there are those who have done all of these things and their rating never comes close to 1800.<p>Beyond that the author does not seem to be aware of the well-known debate on this subject.<p>There are at least, broadly, two views on chess improvement. One side, as represented by Silman and Aagaard, argues that chess &quot;meta-knowledge&quot; is key. A player must first look at the characteristics of the positions (e.g., understand Silman&#x27;s imbalances), and with this understanding, and only then, can a suitable move be found. This group usually advocates a &quot;thinking process&quot; as well. The other side, as represented by Watson and Hendriks, argues that it is only the moves themselves that are important, and the correct move in many cases contradicts the &quot;rules&quot; of strategic analysis. For this group, only &quot;concrete analysis&quot; of a position (i.e., looking at the moves without prejudice) has any possibility of leading to a good move. In this &quot;concrete analysis&quot; group, at least Hendriks (if I understand him correctly) argues that in a tournament situation where there are significant time restrictions, and experimentally moving the pieces is not allowed, only knowing the position itself, or similar types of positions, can help the player find the correct move.<p>So, we have the &quot;meta-knowledge&quot; group advocating the learning of strategic and tactical ideas, and then applying that knowledge to a given position with proper thinking technique. Accordingly, this group believes that if you want to improve your chess, you need to learn more strategic and tactical ideas, applied with an improved thinking technique.<p>And we have the &quot;concrete analysis&quot; group advocating the learning of the correct move in specific positions. Accordingly, this group believes that if you want to get better at chess, then you must learn many hundreds, even thousands, of positions.<p>The truth is probably somewhere between the two extremes. My own experience is that as far as tournament OTB play is concerned, I have benefited more from the concrete analysis approach than anything else.",1449693273

One common language used globally dramatically decreases the chances of information getting lost. It also has the benefit of increasing access to information over time. A great breakthrough can be shared globally, not insulated in one region.<p>I question the need to preserve a language if it inhibits the positive spread of information.

However, a lot of emphasis there is on the asynchronous model. Results that hold for the asynchronous model generally hold for other models. The main point a layman needs to know about the asynchronous model is that a slow node cannot be distinguished from a dead node. \nImplementers of distributed systems will generally ignore most results on the asynchronous model. A slow node might as well be a dead node, so we can use heartbeats and timeouts to exclude these nodes. Typically, robust distributed systems in industry will follow some form of partially synchronous model, adapted to the type of environment it works in: LAN on baremetal => reliable, almost synchronous when not overloaded; WAN (Internet) => as close to the asynchronous model as is practical.",1449692478

Needless to say, I feel in love with the idea, especially as a computer science girl geek.<p>Summation: It reintroduces the physical world back into the physical and makes DIY learning really fun for kids and parents. \nIt was so compelling, I reached out to the CEO Mark  (<a href=""http://bit.ly/MarkPavlyukovskyy)to"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/MarkPavlyukovskyy)to</a> see how I could help them and is why I am making this post today.
