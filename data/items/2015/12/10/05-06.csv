Quakers like all people are fallible, and Quakerism especially embraces the idea of continuing revelation and moving beyond previous barbarisms. There were early Quakers who did own slaves for example. While there were actions that us modern Quakers would not condone, I don&#x27;t know of any interpretations of history (other than perhaps the book you cite, which I admittedly have not read) that indicate that the Quakers of Pennsylvania engaged in some kind of barbaric war with the Scotch-Irish. While they still wielded considerable power they were never the only residents of the colony and it by-and-large still followed the norms of the day. Quakers were proponents of (what were thought to be at the time) humane punishments such as solitary confinement. I&#x27;m not going to condemn the idea of pacifism due to the fact that we were unable to obtain complete purity of fact two hundred years ago in an entirely different society.",1449726270

However, you asked, so I&#x27;ll try to share my take on violence and sin. Keep in mind that I&#x27;m not an expert theologian. I&#x27;m willing to be wrong on these points if someone can show me how I&#x27;m missing some detail or theme in the teaching of the Bible.<p>Also, since the importance of sin is in the intention behind the thoughts and actions and not in the actions themselves, it&#x27;s possible for both violent and nonviolent acts to be sinful (a).<p>To start, most forms of violence are currently illegal, and Christians are supposed to submit to their government, even oppressive ones. There are quite a few references for this (b) (c). Finding more examples isn&#x27;t difficult if you want more. So for violence to be OK, it has to be legal, at a minimum, which is a reasonably high bar in Western countries.<p>In the Bible, it is made clear that governments are supposed to enforce justice, including with violence (d). It&#x27;s not clear if &quot;the sword&quot; must extend all the way to capital punishment, but given the fact that capital punishment was prescribed in the Mosaic Law, it seems to be in the picture in some contexts. That being said, I think people can argue in good faith that modern Western countries are civilized and rich enough to afford every possible chance at rehabilitation. But to insist that capital punishment is <i>necessarily</i> murder is ethnocentric at best and possibly false teaching if someone claims to speak for God.<p>As far as war, it&#x27;s clearly not sinful in itself (e). Neither is being a soldier or general. Many (most?) of the judges in Judges were involved in battle in one way or another. As were Abraham and Moses. As was King David (he killed Goliath, remember?). But can countries sin by prosecuting unjust wars? Certainly. Can soldiers sin in their behavior on the battle field? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s difficult not to.<p>Ultimately in any behavior, violent or not, God promises rewards and punishments will be fair at the end of the day (f). Christians are supposed to live without sin, with truth, and in love. Of course they have failed and continue to fail in this. But God promises to make everything right, with his blood if necessary. And according to the Bible, it was necessary, because Jesus came to save the world, not condemn it (g).<p>Is abortion murder? It&#x27;s a sin in the cases that it&#x27;s motivated by self-interest, callousness, or even fear. For a Christian that should be reason enough not to do it. What would the point be in calling it murder? To damn people? We don&#x27;t have to reach far to find that we are all flawed (h). Lust, lying, hate, despising people, neglecting charity, being unforgiving, envy, greed, addiction, gossiping, cheating, consumerism, coveting... everyone does these things already. There&#x27;s not much point in trying to rub peoples&#x27; noses in how they don&#x27;t follow God&#x27;s commandments. They either already know they&#x27;re not following God or don&#x27;t care (which is basically the same thing).<p>(a) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14</a><p>(b) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13</a><p>(c) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A13-25&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A13-...</a><p>(d) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A4&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A4&v...</a><p>(e) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A1-8&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%...</a><p>(f) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=collosians+3%3A23-25&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=collosians+3%3A...</a><p>(g) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A17&version=ESV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+3%3A17&ver...</a><p>(h) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:21-30"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:21-...</a>",1449725733

The FCC had identified the top 140 metropolitan cities and assigned each at least one channel; a total of 400 were to be allotted.  The FCC received many more applications than it had available channels.  In an effort to provide with as many channels as possible, the FCC routinely threw away the &quot;safety factor&quot; of mileage between licensed transmitters.<p>But problems began to appear. So, even with just 50 stations on the air, interference problems were beginning to appear.  Meanwhile, the FCC had reduced the minimum distance between stations using the same channel to just 80 miles.  An engineering study released by the FCC warned of interference problems if immediate action wasn&#x27;t taken.  That lead to an FCC report issued on may 5, 1949, that rules that television could no longer share its frequencies with fixed and mobile services, and that the 72 to 76 MHz band could be used for fixed radio services only.<p>But where could the mobile services be located if they could no longer share the television allocations, and could no longer be used for use the 72 to 76 MHz band?  There was only one place to go -- the television industry would have to give up another television channel.  But which channel would that be?  The American Radio Relay League (an association of amateur radio operators) urged that Channel 2 be deleted so that the second harmonics of the 28-29.7 MHz amateur radio band would not interfere with television reception.  The television industry, although not pleased about losing yet another television channel, agreed that 12 clear channels were preferable to 12 shared channels.  If they had to lose a channel, they preferred that it be Channel 1, because its absence would have the least impact on commercial television.<p>The FCC went along with the television industry&#x27;s position, and on June 14, 1948, Channel 1 was deleted from the allocation plan.  Channel 1&quot;s frequencies were assigned to the land and mobile services.  At the same time, the FCC decided not to renumber the channels -- that is what happened to Channel 1.</i>",1449724268

10708989,comment,10700766,10708814,0,0,danharaj,,,"> Lastly: From the tenor of your comment, it would seem that my writings have touched a nerve.<p>Let&#x27;s establish one thing first, and it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m not a teenager and therefore my command of language is such that I have some degree of control over the tone I convey in writing. It does not take a struck nerve to litter someone&#x27;s writing with fucks and write pointedly. Your writing style is as artificial as mine and I find its dryness uncomfortable to the eyes.<p>> So, if I understand your point correctly, it&#x27;s that the world is so mired in the use of violence, that logical discourse, a respect for facts, and the avoidance of mental patterns of hate is pointless hypocrisy because everyone is essentially either already guilty of being part of the violence or on the receiving end of it. Therefore, there are no moral limits on the behavior or speech of the victims and those who claim to be siding with them.<p>You have a moral framework. It emphasizes rationality and strongly penalizes emotion. I could write endlessly- but I won&#x27;t, about how naive frameworks like this can be. I won&#x27;t say yours is because we&#x27;re speaking in ridiculous abstractions and I don&#x27;t have a concrete example. You haven&#x27;t even named a single instance of outrage on the Internet to demonstrate the validity of your sentiments. So really there&#x27;s a lot of vague language that clearly resonates with many people but clearly doesn&#x27;t resonate with me; it&#x27;s possible a more concrete example would sit better or it might be that I could vehemently disagree with any particular moral judgment you&#x27;d like to offer up.<p>Moral frameworks exist strictly in the mind. This is not to say that morality isn&#x27;t real. I personally am a moral realist but I acknowledge the epistemological problems inherent in applying a mental framework to the world. When you talk about &quot;logical discourse&quot; you are merely saying that if you disagree with someone, they are being illogical. When you talk about &quot;a respect for facts&quot; you are merely saying that if you disagree with someone, they are being disingenuous about their observations. When you talk about &quot;mental patterns of hate&quot;, which is a real mouthful for &quot;hateful behavior&quot;, what you are saying is that if someone claims grievance or conflict that you disagree with, they are being hateful.<p>I am emphatically <i>not</i> saying that there are no moral limits. That&#x27;s fucking asinine. The issue is, everyone is justified in their own moral framework. Everyone sees themself as logical. Everyone sees the facts as they see them. Everyone thinks their anger is righteous. You have named your values &quot;logical discourse&quot; and a &quot;respect for facts&quot; but that does not say what your values are. It does not say what logical reasoning you use to come to your conclusions. It does not say what your observational context is that determines how you interpret your experiences into facts. Your moral indignation is as petty and boring as everyone else&#x27;s. You are not taking a high road. That&#x27;s the point. No one has the right moral framework. The reality of morality is not making judgments according to the right principles because human principles can be internally consistent in one&#x27;s mind or in a group&#x27;s discourse without being reified into action consistently.<p>So when the West bombs Syria to stop Daesh, it is righteous according to their moral framework, but when they ravage the levant, install dictators, deny people their autonomy, reduce their cities to rubble and plunder them of their resources, their morality is deafeningly silent. Your moral framework is just as pernicious and flawed: It cannot police itself from being inconsistent. It cannot verify itself. It cannot claim possession of the truth.<p>People who engage in &#x27;pseudo-activism&#x27;, whatever the FUCK that is because it is your description is sorely lacking in specifics and feels like a philosophical boogeyman, they, too believe that they are being logical, and have a respect for the facts, and are fighting hate. It so happens that we were all inculcated in Enlightenment (capital L) values since the day we were born. I believe the difference between you and me is actually quite minuscule, because I wring my fingers over the failure of those values as they are reproduced materially.<p>I know this is, like, the most offensive word on Hacker News, but it pays to become acquainted with postmodernism. A little, tiny bit of critical theory goes a long way in ripping away the veil of false consciousness every moral framework and ideology creates. There is always a gap between mental conception and material implementation. It is that gap where good and evil fight.<p>Anyway: People get outraged because they think things are worth getting outraged about. You&#x27;re not more correct because you aren&#x27;t outraged. Your values are different. Your experiences are different. A human being is a vast, overwhelming compilation of lived experience. It is a cognitive bias that must be consciously suppressed that we can know other peoples&#x27; lives better than they can with a relative paucity of observations. You&#x27;re not outraged because your values aren&#x27;t being violated. They are outraged because they are. This is tautological.<p>Judging people is cheap. Finding out how they think, why they think it, what they see, how they see it, and what they value is difficult. A skillful apprehension of morality is one which enables understanding and communication. Blaming others for their failure to measure up to one&#x27;s own morality is dry pablum for people who want to be reassured that the world is mad and they are not. It is moral elitism.<p>Also, those Internet activists aren&#x27;t killing people. Seriously. There are far greater violations of morality in the world and they are in service of a status quo you take no outrage in. Because outrage is bad or something. Whatever.<p>People like you have existed since time immemorial. Pick any fight that moved the moral barometer in society towards a more harmonious status quo: There were people like you complaining about fake activists doing everything wrong and being just as bad as their oppressors because you don&#x27;t like their behavior. You&#x27;re not as knowledgeable of their motivations as you think you are and the world wouldn&#x27;t magically solve all its problems if everyone just listened to you. I really hope your biggest complaint with the world isn&#x27;t that people on the Internet have a greater stake in changing the status quo than you do.",1449723794
