We just soft-launched a couple of weeks back. It is what we call a Lean BPM app.<p>The idea behind TMail21 is that is starts with Topic-Oriented Discussions and then allows a user to progress to Goal-oriented Discussions and finally to what we call Lean Processes.<p>TMail21 was designed to look and feel a lot like e-mail, so it feels instantly familiar to most business users.<p>Until now, traditional Business Process Management (BPM) has been a code-oriented solution not geared towards regular business users. TMail21 is definitively geared towards regular business users. We refer to this as Lean BPM and in fact have created a Lean BPM Manifesto <a href=""https://tmail21.com/lean-bpm-manifesto/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tmail21.com/lean-bpm-manifesto/</a> to enumerate the principles of our approach.<p>I should also mention that Lean BPM and Project tools like Asana/Basecamp/Trello solve different problems. Some differences\n1) The Process-to-project ratio in a typical work environment is very high (often 100:1). So there may be 10,000 process instances vs. 100 projects. So, obviously this calls for a very different interface.\n2) Processes are really good for capturing recurring work patterns. In Lean BPM, patterns that repeat often can be easily institutionalized into Process Templates.\n3) Unlike tools like Asana which are primarily orchestration tools, a key element of Process tools is capturing and evolving a meaningful process state.<p>These points are best illustrated with an example. Let&#x27;s consider the example of a Blog Post. An organization may do hundreds of Blog Posts. These could be done as Projects, \nbut are probably better done as Processes as they tend to have similar goals, process state and tasks.<p>So the Sections (Process State) of a Blog Post may contain \na) Title Ideation - A text Section, to brainstorm titles\nb) Article Outline - A rough outline of the article\nc) The Actual Article - A text Section with the actual article\nd) Blog Form - A form Section with fields like \n     Blog Title, \n     Process State  (CONTENT-CREATION-> OUTREACH-STARTED -> OUTREACH-ENDED), \n     Blog link, \n     Tweet link, \n     Facebook Post link, \n     Google+ post link, \ne) Planned Tweets - A text Section \nf) Hashtags and keywords - A text Section with hashtags and keywords that will be \ng) Influencer Outreach - A Grid Section with a list of influencers that will \n      there will be outreach to.  Each row will represent a single influencer and their \n      outreach state\nh) Checklist - A checklist that lists the tasks required to complete this Process.",1449727501
