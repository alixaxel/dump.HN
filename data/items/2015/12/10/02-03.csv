Some of them can be actually used for remote calls, but a lot are used for local rpc.<p>They&#x27;re unsuitable for the same reasons that we&#x27;re using json instead of asn1, and http instead of custom interactive protocols.

I have been with the company for almost an year now and to my surprise I recently discovered that it does not have an appraisal policy yet. This means no 360 degree reviews, no feedbacks and transparency in promotions. Having spent 4 years in a larger company before this, I feel that a lack of a structured performance review and appraisal is detrimental to my career. It would help if I know whether this is the trend across all companies of my employer&#x27;s size. In case not, I&#x27;m sure, I would be better off in a place where I would have better and a more transparent career growth.",1449716222

A general reason is that most people post reviews to sites like these to either rant or rave, and the employees who had neither a great nor a bad experience (the majority of employees) have little to no incentive to post thoughtful reviews. Arguably, however, companies that a higher proportion of stellar reviews are clearly doing a better job keeping employees happy, so the overall rating may be worth trusting. But heed this warning: I know of one company that has a <i>policy</i> of posting positive reviews on Glassdoor. And they&#x27;re clever enough to always populate the &quot;Cons&quot; section (and avoid overly glowing reviews) so that they won&#x27;t give themselves away. Apparently they were having a hard time recruiting new employees, and one of the reasons was negative reviews on Glassdoor.

Also, something related to security isn&#x27;t necessarily at all intellectually stimulating (again, please don&#x27;t flip my quantifier...).<p><i>> I object to your dismissal of my industry as &quot;configuring firewalls and installing AV&quot;.</i><p>This wasn&#x27;t my intention. FTR I respect security professionals and IT folk of all stripes.<p>But there are boring jobs in every indsutry.<p>My observation is only that diverting a student to the nearest person whose job has anything to do with &quot;cyber security&quot; is not likely to end with that student showing up at a security research lab. Similarly, I think it&#x27;s a laughably bad idea to try to get a kid who is already checking out of school to prep for something like a CREST certification exam.<p><i>> Certainly the security industry is not for everyone</i><p>This was more my other point.<p>I doubt that most students who are interested in computers and who are also acting out using computers are necessarily interested in computer security. I think that assuming this fundamentally misunderstands/conflates two very different things going on in the student&#x27;s life -- their interest in computers/science/technology, and anti-social behavior.<p><i>> A lot of people in the security industry would not even consider &quot;configuring firewalls and installing AV&quot; to be security work</i><p>Unfortunately most of the teachers/parents reading that webpage are unlikely to know the difference.",1449715165

Pennsylvania was a remarkable place, with a lot of very impressive accomplishments. Fisher is full of praise for their Old World-quality infrastructure, much of which is still in use today; he also points out their peaceful coexistence with the American Indians, their roughly equal rights for women, and their rehabilitative prisons, concern for animal welfare, and interest in vegetarianism. But there&#x27;s also how they refused to bear arms and expected the British military to protect them -- and how they enforced sumptuary laws and the like with corporal punishments, and drove off the Scotch-Irish as being just this side of subhuman.<p>Admittedly, one could make a very strong case that the Scotch-Irish really were just this side of subhuman. They were lawless, xenophobic, and economically improvident, as well as scornful of the laws and customs of war; they committed savage atrocities in just about every war they engaged in, and were more or less responsible for the Indian Wars, the Mexican War, and the lawlessness of the Wild West. Andrew Jackson, who ethnically cleansed the Cherokees and the other Five Civilized Tribes, is still regarded as a hero in Appalachia today, and his atrocities are either brushed off or openly celebrated.<p>A large and politically powerful Scotch-Irish population would have poisoned Pennsylvania; the Quakers had the choice between self-destruction and rejection of their principles. They chose to reject their principles -- and then they kept preaching them, completely unmodified, as if they&#x27;d never rejected them at all.<p>I&#x27;m Catholic, so it&#x27;s not surprising that I&#x27;d say this, but I&#x27;d say that Catholic social doctrine -- with its strict criteria for just wars, and various prescriptions for government and suppression of crime -- is a better choice than denying the necessity of violence and then having to improvise a solution when violence turns out necessary anyways.",1449714861

Defining it as &quot;not being Christian enough&quot; is problematic for at least two reasons:<p>1. If people self-identify as Christian, how do we identify the liars and the self-deluded?<p>2. If we can&#x27;t trust people to identify themselves properly, how do we identify each other as Christians? What is the standard?<p>The Bible actually says that we can know Christians by how well they follow the commandments of Christ (a). Among the commandments of Christ is the commandment to be at peace with each other; we are supposed to reconcile with each other even before we perform (therefore insincere) religious rituals (b).<p>...the Bible doesn&#x27;t say that &quot;sin&quot; is the cause of violence since violence (and hate generally) is itself sin. Instead, Paul teaches that sin, including murder, is a result of rejecting God for other things (c).<p>So given all that, it&#x27;s tautological from Biblical principles that violent people are <i>not</i> followers of Christ. In fact, the Bible is full of warnings about people who claim to be Christian and are actually false teachers.

And yes, reference counting is the bare minimum you&#x27;d probably like for these structures (GC is even better)<p>However, we&#x27;re talking about Go here - a language designed for writing servers that has a GC.<p>The solution in Haskell is actually quite nice: MVars [1] plus immutable data structure. An MVar contains the current state, represented by one such structure. takeMVar &quot;removes&quot; the variable - a thing which can be done atomically by the updating thread when the data becomes stale. After that, subsequent attempts to readMVar from other threads would block until there is a new updated value, to ensure everything is in sync. Finally, the updating thread does a putMVar, and all readers get the new value and continue executing.<p>The best part is they don&#x27;t have to worry that the updating thread might start another update in parallel while they read: the data structures are immutable so the value being read is guaranteed to remain immutable. Even if the updating thread continues &quot;modifying&quot; the new structure in the background, it doesn&#x27;t have an effect on the other consumer&#x27;s version.<p>But yeah, all this is pointless if you have realtime constraints and therefore need super-tight control over execution time. It might be doable in a fast reference counted language, but it will also be much harder to reason about the time it will take to release the memory for the segments that aren&#x27;t in use anymore.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Contro...</a>",1449714489

Or do you think that the noncapitalist economy of preindustrial Europe could produce enough widgets to sustain the modern standard of living?<p>>My point is that labour does not need capital to produce value (Although access to capital can increase the amount of value labour can produce.) Capital without labour is, quite obviously a lame duck.<p>This is looking more and more false by the day, to be honest. At this point, companies that employ hundreds of thousands of assembly line workers that produce &quot;actual value&quot; are less profitable than companies that automate that same assembly line using capital. On the flip side, the return to human capital in the form of educated workers has certainly increased.But I challenge you to build Google or Facebook without the venture CAPITALists who provided the money to purchase the infrastructure and hire the labour. The knowledge economy is great, but at some point the software still has to run on hardware purchased with, you guessed it, capital.<p>The point being that capital and labour are both necessary for a functioning economy, and concluding that labour is the only thing that matters and that anyone rich must be a rent-seeker leads you to becoming Venezuela or Argentina.",1449714247

And being mostly a one-industry town was another part, in an age of rapid globalization, and with strong unions making Detroit the more expensive place to produce.<p>Moreover, the core of Detroit was sliced up by an extremely extensive network of freeways, and in patterns where you get a fairly intense breakup of neighborhoods when you compare to other northern cities of the time who were building expressways through theirs. Detroit&#x27;s postwar suburbs came calling for all of those automobile-owning middle-classers back in the D.<p>Also, most Detroit housing was quickly-built wooden construction, which are a lot more vulnerable to breaks in maintenance. While brick buildings can wait &quot;on inventory&quot; much longer, much of Detroit&#x27;s wooden stock was expensive to maintain, and didn&#x27;t last long waiting &quot;on inventory&quot; to be put into re-use. Michigan suffers dramatic freeze-thaw cycles, rain/snow/ice, and loose ground that can bust-up under-maintained buildings in no time.<p>Another, a perhaps seminal event, at least for people living in city, were the 1967 riots (which you could connect to all that redlining that went on). All through the central city. That was the &quot;last straw&quot; for most everyone who could leave and wanted to leave. Many people I know personally remember as a kid moving out not long after &#x27;67. And the race riots seemed to have made race relations worse in the region, in my unsubstantiated opinion.",1449713130

(It was useful for a period of time when SQL-based RDBMs systems were quite predominant, so it could be used as a gross differentiator).<p>Now the best way to think about it is that there are database platforms with varying features, one of which is support for SQL.  When you evaluate which platform to use, you should have a list of business-derived criteria, such as SQL support, support for various relational integrity constructs (i.e. foreign keys), latency for typical queries (e.g. Hive), fault tolerance, ACID compliance, partitioning schemes, read or write optimization, etc. and act accordingly.<p>&quot;NoSQL&quot; used to be shorthand for a vague subset of database features that usually involved relaxing data protection in favor of multi-server scalability, but now it just muddies the waters, especially as many NoSQL platforms now support SQL or a subset thereof.",1449713088
10708381,comment,10705400,10705400,0,0,Myrmornis,,,"I have a question, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t sound too stupid.<p>Basically my question is: do you have any recommendations for reading about &quot;concurrency&quot; but at a higher level than &quot;concurrent programming&quot; and less formal than &quot;distributed systems&quot; algorithms? Here&#x27;s an attempt at explaining what I mean:<p>Suppose I worked for a company which mostly writes web apps in python. They don&#x27;t write much multi-threaded code. They don&#x27;t write native desktop graphical apps or do &quot;systems programming&quot;. So books about &quot;concurrent programming&quot; with threads, or in go/scala/clojure/erlang etc seem, superficially, slightly irrelevant. Also, books about formal distributed systems algorithms seem, superficially, slightly irrelevant. But &quot;concurrency&quot; is still highly relevant! It&#x27;s just at a higher level than is meant by &quot;concurrency&quot; in a programming language and it&#x27;s not as formal or regular as is usually meant by &quot;distributed systems&quot;.<p>What I mean is: the company handles concurrent HTTP requests resulting in concurrent database transactions; celery tasks might also be running at the same time; message-queue type problems come up frequently; they are increasingly tending towards a &quot;service-oriented&quot; architecture which is inherently concurrent; and, at the end of the day, all the higher-level &quot;business logic&quot; is some sort of emergent property of a complex, and concurrent, underlying system of apps communicating via HTTP, with asynchronous background tasks, etc. Wise senior programmers say: &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re going to need to apply some row-locking there.&quot;. Wide-eyed junior programmers say: &quot;Oh yes, of course&quot; and wonder, &quot;What should I be reading to know this?&quot;.<p>What should they be reading?<p>Also, how the hell do people diagram this stuff in order to talk about it? Google searches tend to end up either in UML languages that seem to be unfashionable (but might in fact be just the right thing?) or in academic CS papers that seem to be uninfluential. But there must be something better than those pessimistic paragraphs from No Silver Bullet:<p>> Software is invisible and unvisualizable... The reality of software is not inherently embedded in space... As soon as we attempt to diagram software structure, we find it to constitute not one, but several, general directed graphs superimposed one upon another. The several graphs may represent the flow of control, the flow of data, patterns of dependency, time sequence, name-space relationships... In spite of progress in restricting and simplifying the structures of software, they remain inherently unvisualizable, and thus do not permit the mind to use some of its most powerful conceptual tools. This lack not only impedes the process of design within one mind, it severely hinders communication among minds.",1449713086

10708375,comment,10704115,10708237,0,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"First:  I didn&#x27;t say that Go was good for that subset of cases.  In fact, I said that I wouldn&#x27;t want to write that kind of program in Go.  I said that Go wasn&#x27;t the wrong answer <i>for the reason you stated</i>, namely immutable data.<p>You want an example?  Here&#x27;s a video router for a TV station, which has multiple sources of user input (human-pushable control panels on two different data buses, plus serial data coming from multiple automation systems).  You need to keep those control panels and automation systems updated with what&#x27;s connected to what, even if they weren&#x27;t the source of the command that changed it.  And you need to keep the actual hardware switch up to date, too.  And commands to the switch can fail, which you need to report back to whoever made the command.  (One way the command can fail is if someone else locked an output to display a particular input.)<p>Faced with that problem, we implemented a single &quot;state of the switch&quot; data object that mutated as commands came in.  But you could think about trying to implement it with immutable data.  That would mean creating a new copy of the state of the switch for each (successful) command that was processed.  That would mean copying a fairly large chunk of data many times a second, which would have been a challenge for the processor we had.  That would also almost certainly mean a garbage-collected language which, when you&#x27;re trying to respond within one TV frame (1/60th of a second), is a really bad idea.  More to the point for our discussion, it would <i>also</i> mean that threads, which in our design only had to respond to one source of control, would now also have to handle state-of-the-switch updates pushed to them from other threads (or from some master).  That seems like significant additional complexity to me.  (Yes, I know that data races have their own complexity, but for our design, it was <i>very</i> clear how to prevent that.  And if you&#x27;re going to say that we could have had a separate thread receive the updates to update the control panels, now we&#x27;ve got a race as to who owns the hardware control bus to the panels.)",1449713005
