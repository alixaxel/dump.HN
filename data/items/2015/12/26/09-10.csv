For example increasing speed of manufacturing procedures and improving knowledge about how to design complex systems. The end seems to be extremely dense blocks or spheres of highly optimized computation substrate, where each atom sits very precisely at the right place. But the state of the art is merely a few layers of crude photo-lithography. Imagine nanobots being programmed to move atoms around to assemble 3D circuits at the 10nm scale. I think this is where we are heading, and this will likely grant a couple of decades of continuing exponential progress. And by then our computation power will be insane.

10793751,comment,10792091,10792576,0,0,lolc,,,"The terms they chose do not have a well-defined meaning. I trust them on that. It is easy to verify by asking an expert whether that term has a meaning in their field. One can try and guess from the words what the meaning of an unknown expression is, but to claim any familiarity with the concept is deceiving oneself. Even if the term had a meaning to you you would still have to get others to agree to that meaning.<p>I find it unlikely that the meaning attributed to the made-up terms would have made a substantial discussion possible. Either the participants would have to define their mutual understanding of the term first or there would be a lot of hand-waving and disagreement.<p>Just because you can come up with meaning for a term does not guarantee that somebody else will agree to it. Once you&#x27;re sufficiently proficient in an area, you realize how much guessing is involved when people try to make sense of unfamiliar terms. If you think you haven&#x27;t done this, think again.

10793732,comment,10791712,10793514,0,0,Smaug123,,,"If we&#x27;re <i>really</i> careful about how we program the AI, then we might be able to make it shut down after doing some limited-scope task. However, if its task is not extremely limited in scope, then it has strong incentives to continue itself so that it can complete its task.<p>An idea of how things could potentially go wrong if you&#x27;re not ever so careful in this way is the following thought experiment:<p>> You told the AI to make exactly 100 paperclips. But the AI is made of (and knows that it is made of) human-made components, which are notoriously fairly-to-mostly reliable but not 100% reliable. Say they&#x27;re 99.999% reliable. The AI&#x27;s sensors are currently giving it the answer of &quot;I have made 100 paperclips&quot;. Can it trust them? It really really wants to have made 100 paperclips, and it&#x27;s not completely sure of having made 100 paperclips, so it decides to verify whether it has made 100 paperclips.<p>Boom, suddenly you have unbounded behaviour: &quot;verify a probability&quot;.<p>If the AI is not extremely carefully designed, unbounded behaviour will lead to the AI acquiring resources and perhaps attempting to improve itself, in order to better fulfill its task. Look how readily humans attempt to learn new things and get better at what we do, even though our own goal systems are extremely fuzzy: we don&#x27;t pursue one task with single-minded devotion like we hope an AI would. (If our AI&#x27;s goal systems are fuzzy, then we won&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s doing, and then it&#x27;s probably curtains for humanity.)",1451121706

The regulator&#x27;s consultation paper is not specifically about internet.org, it&#x27;s about differential pricing in general. Like I said, before the activism, ISPs were already declaring they&#x27;d charge extra for messaging and VOIP, so it&#x27;s not &#x27;alarmist&#x27;, it&#x27;s planned and declared.",1451120950

Problem solved.<p>But if Firefox is to make their own free-er stick... They now have\n15-16% browser market share which they can leverage and no on-line\nservices which they can use to further increase the value of that\nstick.<p>If they can make it &quot;Chromecast compatible&quot; that&#x27;s obviously a\ndifferent story, but that means Chromecast apps now also need to be\ncompatible with the Gecko rendering engine.<p>Looking at the sorry state of the mobile web in the end of 2015, we\ncan already see a significant amount of developers whose only mobile\ntest-target is Webkit. Some even skip testing Android completely,\nfocusing only on Ios and Mobile Safari.<p>And do we expect developers to bother 1. getting and 2. testing for a\nChromecast-compatible device with a sub 1% marketshare when there are\nalready millions of chromecasts out there?<p>To me this just smells like Firefox OS all over. Maybe a good idea,\nbut it&#x27;s too late, and it probably wont win any developer mind share\nfrom the established platforms.",1451120859
