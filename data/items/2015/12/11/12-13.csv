There is Wifi privacy police for android, and probably something similar for ios.<p>I actually did just that at work. First of all I had a raspberry pi that got all the device names connected to my company wifi (the guy responsible for the network is actually just the janitor, so the wifi is basically the wild west). After a bit of puzzling I knew the MAC-addresses 90% of my closest colleague’s phones. From there it was easy to do the rest. Just set up your own wifi network and monitor SSID broadcasts.<p>This worked fine until iphones started randomizing their mac addresses, but since I know when a certain device appears on our work wifi, I could probably just compare when a scan was made to when a certain device was connected. I just can&#x27;t be bothered.<p>The system is still up and running, and now even has a nice web interface that I can access from home.<p>I&#x27;ll eventually release it as FLOSS, but I&#x27;ll have to clean the code quite badly.

The population at the time was a decent mix. Lots of ethnic minorities, but also students and probably middle class families along the edges.<p>During the past 15 years, loads of new restaurants have opened here, there&#x27;s a small movie theatre, the dodgy-looking call shops and phone shops have disappeared, the snack bar that changed ownership every year has now turned into a fancy wine bar. Some old buildings have been turn down and replaced, others have been renovated. Generally, this seems to me like a great example of gentrification.<p>And I&#x27;m sure housing prices are rising, and I don&#x27;t doubt the new and renovated buildings are more expensive than the older ones. But the population doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed all that much. Maybe there are more affluent white people now, but I still see kids from a variety of ethnic backgrounds play in the streets (though I don&#x27;t see groups of adolescents and young adults hang around the square where that dodgy snack bar used to be), and there are still plenty of Turkish shops (though some have closed, sometimes to be replaced by a new Turkish shop, sometimes not).<p>I don&#x27;t know how many people have been forced out due to the gentrification. They include my brother-in-law, who had lived there for ages until his house was to be renovated. But for the most part, the population doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed much, and the neighbourhood seems to be more vibrant, more stuff to do, less need to go to the center of the city if you want to go out.<p>So if this is gentrification, my impression of it is pretty positive, though I don&#x27;t have any stats to back it up. Of course with those people who hung around on that square, I have no idea who they are or where they are now. It feels safer, but that might be subconscious racism talking.",1449838242

10716716,comment,10704115,10713982,0,0,4ad,,,"> It means that some of the data structures the scheduler examines on every run are shared data, with locking.<p>This is true for every scheduler, not only for the Go scheduler.<p>> That makes it effectively single threaded<p>It would limit parallelism to one, if there was a single lock. This used to be the case, but now the locking is more finely grained. But this only matters if there&#x27;s lock-contention anyway, which is not the case for current Go programs.<p>> single-threaded scheduler<p>Again, no such thing as a single-threaded scheduler. Even when talking about systems with a big kernel lock, or with a global scheduler lock. The scheduler is not &quot;single-threaded&quot; or any other term like that because the scheduler is not a thread, it&#x27;s not an independent thing, it only runs <i>in the context</i> of many other things.<p>> Put another way it means that it&#x27;ll never run faster than a single-threaded scheduler would.<p>As mentioned already, this is not strictly trye for Go, but this matters more for thread schedulers in kernels, less so for the Go scheduler, mostly because the number of threads executing Go code is very restrictive, maximum 32 threads at the moment. It&#x27;s very likely that this situation might change. For example, the SPARC64 port that I am doing supports 512-way machines, so I&#x27;d need to increase the GOMAXPROCS limit. Then maybe we&#x27;d have more lock contention (I doubt it).<p>It&#x27;s true that the scheduler will probably not scale this well, and will need improvement, but it&#x27;s unlikely it will be because of lock contention.<p>> You mean preemption inside the linux kernel, in some kernel-space threads?<p>Yes, voluntary preemption inside the Linux kernel, not preemption of user-space threads. The Linux kernel can run a mode (common and useful on servers) where it <i>might</i> yield only at well defined points. The name is a misnomer, this is not really preemption, but it&#x27;s not cooperative scheduling either. It&#x27;s something in the middle and it&#x27;s a very useful mode of operation, nothing wrong with it.<p>> So it&#x27;s cooperative.<p>It has the good parts of both cooperative and preemptive scheduling, but yes, it&#x27;s certainly cooperative.<p>> The standard that is normally used is simple : does &quot;for {}&quot; crash(&quot;block&quot; if you prefer) some part of the system?<p>Not with GOMAXPROCS > 1, which is now the default on multi-way machines (all machines).<p>> On the Go scheduler, the answer is yes.<p>Only sometimes. This is fixable while still preserving voluntary preemption, since the voluntary preemption-check is so cheap that you can do it on backward branches if you really need it. This wasn&#x27;t done since this wasn&#x27;t a big problem in practice, even with the old GOMAXPROCS=1 default, but there&#x27;s room for improvement.<p>> On the linux scheduler with proper ulimits it&#x27;s bloody hard to crash the system, for instance, forkbombs, memory bombs, ... won&#x27;t do it. I hope we&#x27;ll get a language where you can do that too.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the analogy. It is not clear what &quot;crash&quot; means here, and it is not clear how it would apply to a runtime environment. All that stuff, forkbombs, etc, means that you can configure the system so <i>arbitrary code</i> can&#x27;t affect the system in those particular ways.<p>But for a language runtime you don&#x27;t have arbitrary code usually, you control all the code. So I don&#x27;t understand how any of these would apply.<p>Coming back to the scheduler. There&#x27;s always room for improvement. Until relatively recently, the Go scheduler barely scaled past two threads! (although not because of lock contention). Now it scales really well to (at least) 32 threads. There are still improvements to be made, and I am sure they will be made. I was just addressing the &quot;single-thread&quot; issue.",1449837398
