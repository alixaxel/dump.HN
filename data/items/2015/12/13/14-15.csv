The sentence is composed by the user by adding words in sequence until the sentence is complete. This has an important benefit: it uses a metaphor (the sentence) that the player already grasps, thereby collapsing the menu navigation problem into a construct that the player is comfortable with.<p>This essentially describes how the UI of Doug Engelbart&#x27;s NLS system worked. Each command was describe in a DSL called the command meta language. These grammars where then compiled into a tree over which the command interpreter followed as the user entered in commands. At each step the UI would display feedback to the user about what input they had already entered.<p>I implemented such an interface in my first prototype of the system that I built in anyone wants to play around with such an interface.[1] I am currently working on a cleaner and more accessible version, but it is still in the design phase and not\nusable yet.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-wiki</a>",1450018600

The other, usually dominant, component is &quot;What is the real value of my work product?&quot;<p>A teacher&#x27;s real value is the teaching they&#x27;ve provided to X students. In a physical setting, X has a ceiling. But say, ceteris paribus, we compare to an online teacher who can teach Y students, where Y>X.<p>The online teacher&#x27;s employer can afford to pay him or her more, because they have created more real value ($value/student * greater number of students). Even if the work they do is no different.<p>The miracle of computing systems is that they leverage output. &quot;Do&quot; a calculation once, and you can repeat it as many times as you want.<p>So, accepting that computers increase productivity generally speaking, what do you think the real value created by the people who can program the things that leverage a worker&#x27;s value is?<p>In essence, we get a piece of the following pie: total_created_value = ((existing_worker_value * improvement_multiplier) - existing_worker_value) * number_of_affected_workers<p>Where workers can be actual people or just systems<p>But the key is that our value scales with number_of_affected_workers, <i>with limited additional effort on our parts</i>. So if we can make an improvement for 1,000 people, there&#x27;s always going to be a decent living in that -- because the consumer can <i>afford</i> to pay for the work. They may choose to save that money themselves, but in my experience people are willing to pay to get better product (more reliable, on time, more features, etc etc).",1450018298

While reading I started thinking that Stephenson tried to create a &quot;moment&quot; by overstreching. A scenery. Something you see in those slow artistic movies for example. But then there is another problem. Stephenson is unable to describe the environment in which the scene plays. Instead he concentrates on completely irrelevant details in the current area. A good example for this was when the protagonist traveled a region where former cities were. It looked like that: &quot;...traveling along those dead cities we&#x27;ve learned to distinguish the time period in which the cities have been build...&quot;. But he describes not a single one. You end up having absolutely no picture of the environment. He tells you that there are launch pads and anti-missile turrets but not how they look. Instead he drags you through several sentences regarding the steel rubble they get from the cities. Spoiler: it&#x27;s rusty. Same poor writing goes for character development (main character is supposed to be clever according to the context but is plainly stupid and really slow...), basic aspects like the love story or the weird way he describes women.<p>I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I&#x27;m just too demanding but I currently read through some of Alestair Raynolds works and it makes Stephenson look like a rich school boy whos private teacher was afraid to mark the basic mistakes for him.<p>I&#x27;ve read Snow Crash many years ago. When Neuromancer and the art of those times was still in my head. Fortunately because it was exactly the same thing. Please read Snow Crash again and try to focus on the world he un-describes. I had the feeling like Stephenson took it for granted that you&#x27;ve already read Gibson or Sterling and knew how the world is supposed too look like so he can concentrate on world details that are completely irrelevant for the story and make no sense without describing the place they stand in.<p>You see...I fell twice for Stephenson which was a mistake on my side so I&#x27;m pretty angry on myself and try do divert the fault to him...",1450018071

10726449,comment,10722587,10726172,0,0,virmundi,,,"One my active questions in this area is &quot;does FP need an IDE as much as OOP?&quot; I don&#x27;t know. When done properly FP decomposes into smaller, easier to thing about functions. They often get glued together in a piper->filter way. As a result, the glue logic doesn&#x27;t really require much introspection.<p>Where an IDE could be helpful is in refactoring and code generation. If your code does&#x27;t require much generation due to its simplicity, you might need half-an-IDE. If you can get decent refactoring by having higher-level functions as the default, maybe you end only needing a quarter of an IDE?<p>That&#x27;s why I keep bouncing between LightTable and Counterclockwise (nope hate IntelliJ and Cursives, but that is a taste thing). I&#x27;m more comfortable with Eclipse than Light Table. I just don&#x27;t know how much of it I need.<p>One caveat is debugging. I do fallback on that. I think that might be a sign of me failing to breakdown my code into isolated units. Regardless, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to do debugging in LightTable.",1450017977

Though it should use GPG and have a variant for Android, iOS, and native desktop clients.<p>The cloud service offering should be email and instant messaging, email, and some levels of sync (but not the private key).<p>It should be/do:<p><pre><code>  - Open source\n  - Generate a private key as part of the setup\n  - Upload your public key to the public key servers\n  - Access camera to read a key (qr code) from another device\n  - Display QR code of your private key (so you can sync it\n    to another device)\n  - Display a QR code of your public key (so someone you meet in\n    public can copy it and you can then trust that key)\n  - Show confidence levels based on how trusted a key is. Help bubbles can explain the confidence level.\n  - Import your contacts\n  - Periodically query public key server to see if your contacts have uploaded a public key.\n</code></pre>\nAdvanced options like importing your own key, adding &quot;Trusted keys&quot;, and using your own email provider should also be a thing. I suppose keys could be exchanged using NFC as well, but I think that&#x27;s still beyond most people.<p>For the most part, this should be presented as a secure communication app/service. If you want to start communicating securely with someone, you ask them to install the app. You should be able to do it while grabbing lunch together(which results in trusted keys exchanged between the both of you). Or you can invite them to use the app, which results in them getting an encrypted email address and IM system.<p>Finally, encrypted emails and messages could be synchronized between devices, maintaining state.<p>The goal of the app and service is that Johnny will see this app as their secure communication. They will know that until the other person sets up their copy of the app, that they can&#x27;t send a secure message to them. And since it relies on public gpg servers, if they come across an advanced person out there that setup GPG on their own, it will be able to email that person just as easily (and that advanced person can email the app user).",1450016904

10726410,comment,10704115,10726017,0,0,burntsushi,,,"> I admit to not knowing when you would prefer statically checked mutable data structures to immutable ones except for a few cases (dynamic programming arrays, fast matrix libraries, memory constrained environments).<p>Those sound like pretty compelling use cases to me, and also ones that seem to be well suited for Rust. You might also consider looking at Servo; I bet its engineers could list a myriad number of reasons why immutable-only data structures are insufficient.<p>I note that performance is not the only trade off worth examining (to be fair, I think you acknowledged this). Another aspect of the trade off is abstraction, albeit this is fuzzier. Mutation can be more natural to a lot of folks. My pet theory is that we&#x27;ve built up a defense mechanism against mutation because it&#x27;s the source of so many bugs; but Rust&#x27;s static guarantees are worth consideration here. They remove many of the problems normally ascribed to mutability. For example, Rust not only prevents data races, but it also prevents aliasing mutable pointers to data at compile time, which defeats another class of bugs not related to concurrency at all.<p>My main point of contention with your comments is that you think you&#x27;ve stumbled on to the &quot;right&quot; way of doing something. In my opinion, that&#x27;s nonsense. What&#x27;s the point, even, to declare such a thing? Instead, focus on what the trade offs are, then make a decision based on the constraints you&#x27;ve imposed in any given situation. (Valid constraints absolutely include &quot;immutable data structures are easier for me to reason about intuitively.&quot;)<p>> In projects where I can afford a GC, I&#x27;d always take the GCed option (in my case an overwhelming majority). Same for immutable data structures (use whenever they can be afforded). Are those bad heuristics? (Afforded here refers to performance/memory constraints only)<p>They don&#x27;t seem like bad heuristics to me. They don&#x27;t really correspond to my own heuristics, depending on what problem I&#x27;m trying to solve. (I once chose a language for a project based purely on the fact that I wanted to target non-programmers.)",1450016829

It also increases risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, and renal failure for those with pre-existing conditions or who are at-risk for other reasons: genetic conditions, obesity, etc.<p>Most of us (myself included) will take long breaks from their medication. I don&#x27;t take it while on vacation, I take most weekends off of it, etc. I take it when I need to be at my best for work and I take it if I am on vacation and feeling like my emotional reactivity is too high, etc.<p>Ritalin is actually shown to mitigate the effects of amphetamine toxicity, as well, surprisingly, because while it also work on dopamine it uses a different strategy. Instead of causing your brain to produce it (thus potentially frying the cells that do so), it simply prevents the brain from re-absorbing it, much like an SSRI does with serotonin. So, I&#x27;ve heard of some people switching back and forth between amphetamines and Ritalin, though I have not done so myself.<p>Lastly, there are other drugs such as Cymbalta and other SSRI/SSNRIs that seem do help some people. SSRIs have a whole slew of side effects (especially weight and sexual side effects), and, while SSNRIs tend to have far fewer side effects (Cymbalta seems to have barely any for most people), they are still a fairly new class of drug comparatively so I could understand someone being cautious.<p>All that being said, the risks are worth it for me.

Even for a technical person this can be daunting with so many options that if you don&#x27;t know all that much about encryption you can easily make mistakes.<p>There really should be an easy-setup mode which defaults to the commonly recommended options. Give the user fewer options and they will make fewer mistakes. I am surprised there isn&#x27;t such an option actually. Most things in the FOSS world have be streamlined/simplified over the past decade (for example look how difficult it used to be when partitioning a hard drive during a Linux install, now it is all done for you if you just want the defaults).",1450015366
10726358,comment,10724460,10725807,0,0,y0y,,,"Just realized you had asked for what treatments I had.<p>I use medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. They are a tandem duo and neither alone would be nearly as effective.<p>First, do yourself a great favor, read the book Driven to Distraction. It&#x27;s a super easy read and will give you a great amount of insight.<p>Second, try to really re-evaluate your fear of medication. ADHD medication gets a bad rap. My opinion is that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s over diagnosed in children and abused heavily at the college level. For those who truly have ADHD, however, it can be a life-change overnight. I mean that.<p>The ADHD brain lacks dopamine, this shortage is a major component of the behaviors that follow. A low amphetamine dosage should have no ill effects on the patient (you&#x27;re not trying to get high on speed here..), but what it does do is artificially boost the dopamine levels in the brain. This covers the shortage that your brain is constantly trying to fill by jumping from exciting thought to exciting thought or through thrill-seeking. Suddenly, your executive functions are much better and you can direct your focus far better. You&#x27;ll never be &quot;normal&quot;, but it&#x27;s a world of difference. For me, not only did I immediately regain better control over my focus, but I also found I could transition better, I didn&#x27;t procrastinate as much, and I wasn&#x27;t as emotionally reactive as I normally was which has always been a major issue in my personal relationships.<p>This alone, however, won&#x27;t fix all the issues. Once you have the medication and are able to wield your focus, the next step is unlearning all those bad habits you&#x27;ve learned over 40 years of struggling and compensating for your ADHD. This is where Cognitive Behavioral Therapy shines.<p>These two things together, along with accepting and learning to appreciate your brain for what it is and making use of tools (lists, calendars, regimented scheduling, written goals, etc.) that complement your way of thinking will go a long, long way.<p>Anyway, your mileage may vary, and your feelings on medication are between you and your doctor, but this is what worked for me and what I recommend to everyone I know who is thinking of seeking treatment. Best of luck.",1450015355

If you made the planet more dense, it would be smaller, making the comparison less impressive. Squeeze the planet all the way down to a black hole, and it would be about the size of the magnet.<p>I think it works better to think of it in terms of the minimum force you can get. Imagine two test masses a fixed distance apart. The minimum non-zero electromagnetic force you can get between those two test masses is the force you get if each test mass has a charge equal to that of an electron.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the lowest mass particle is that you could reasonably hold near a test point, but since you can reasonably confine an electron to a small region the gravitational force between two electrons is an upper bound on the minimum gravitational force, and that is a ridiculous number of orders of magnitude lower than the minimum electromagnetic force.",1450015250
