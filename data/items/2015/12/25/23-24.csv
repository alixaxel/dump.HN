But if Jobs believed that NeXT&#x27;s real value was the software (as OS X, and especially iOS, bear out), then you can imagine a strategy that used a web browser as a Trojan Horse for a platform that could overthrow the currently dominant Windows monopoly. That was basically Netscape&#x27;s strategy a few years later, after all.",1451087956

It is just a start but more sensible than what facebook chose to do.<p>Now this is what I think. Facebook is interested in being a monopoly and this step will ensure its rivals don&#x27;t get in (because facebook pays for it). This is what all the argument is about. Saying billion people will get free internet is just an eyewash.

Kurzweil thinks AI is the bees knees and doesn&#x27;t see much risk in it AFAICT. Second, neither Bostrom, MIRI, nor the Future of Life institute claim Moore&#x27;s law will continue indefinitely or in any way endorse Kurzweil&#x27;s work.<p>As for his other comments on AI risk, here&#x27;s what I wrote last year on a similar thread:<p>Nobody is afraid of today&#x27;s AI algorithms. But if we make machines that are smarter than us and have desires, they will influence the future to achieve their desires. If these desires conflict with our own, things will not end well for the dumber party.<p>As we really have no idea what we, collectively, think of as a moral terminal goal, and less so how to formalize this, there is no reason to expect the first AIs to have goals that correspond to what we want. If AIs self-replicate in a competitive ecology, what would be selected for would be agents millions of times more intelligent than us who use their intellects only to make more copies of themselves - using all available resources including those we need to survive.\nI&#x27;d recommend this summary of the arguments: <a href=""https://medium.com/@LyleCantor/russell-bostrom-and-the-risk-of-ai-45f69c9ee204#.shqn6fqa4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@LyleCantor/russell-bostrom-and-the-risk-...</a>",1451087805

The paper discusses hubs that need to provide various guarantees, like being continuously online and routing payments for arbitrary third parties. This is not at all the same thing as a wallet and Chris is right to point out the distinction.<p>With respect to your point about becoming a punching bag, I&#x27;m afraid I am not particularly sympathetic. When Blockstream started floating LN as an alternative to raising the block size (which is what they have consistently done) you should have condemned that and them right away, loudly and clearly, as it was obviously an absurd suggestion and not going to happen anywhere near in time.<p>LN is a highly theoretical system that doesn&#x27;t have any implementation that ordinary people could actually use. There is no practical experience with running such a network. It doesn&#x27;t even have answers to basic design questions, like how routing and addressing would work. The chance of project failure is therefore quite high, as is always the case for research projects.<p>Thus to imply LN is some sort of dead-cert thing is hubris. Academics have been producing e-cash white papers for decades. Almost none of them actually turned into real-world systems. Nobody will know if LN actually works better than Bitcoin does (or did) until it&#x27;s built and has competitive usability, which is a very long time away.<p><i>> There is a clear obvious misunderstanding of core principles in computer science, wishful thinking does not solve real problems</i><p>That&#x27;s not very charitable is it?<p>I can assure you, the CS understanding of the people who disagree with you (like Chris, Gavin, myself and Satoshi) is just fine, but I have to question your understanding of engineering. The calculations were done years ago that showed for typical payment network loads that global broadcast could work just fine. Computer science doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;some algorithms never work and some always work&quot;. It just gives us the tools to analyse costs. By simply ignoring complexity and engineering costs of LN, as well as some rather tricky algorithmic costs around pathfinding in global non-suspended networks, you can obviously make any actually existing system look bad in favour of a theoretical proposal.",1451086402

The whole reason the World Bank had to raise it to $1.90 a day from $1.25 a day was because in many parts of the developing world, $1.90 a day <i>buys you less</i> than $1.25 did at the start of the measurements!<p>More importantly, $1.91 a day still makes for a pretty miserable life anywhere in the world.
