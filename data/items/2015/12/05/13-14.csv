10681844,comment,10680055,10680055,0,0,lordnacho,,,"Before we venture into whether it&#x27;s good or bad, here&#x27;s a couple of observations.<p>1) The point of insuring is to reduce tail risk. If you have a 1/1000 years chance of your house getting flattened in an earthquake, you want to spread that bill over 1000 years. If you don&#x27;t you might get away with it most years, but you&#x27;ll have a new house to buy if you&#x27;re unlucky.<p>To contrast, if your house is flooded every other year, someone insuring you will ask you for roughly half the likely damages each year. That&#x27;s not smoothing it out by much, and you might as well save up for the inevitable.<p>2) If you&#x27;re going to smooth out risk, you need to know what the risk is. For that, you&#x27;ll need information. For instance if women are less likely than men to get themselves hurt while driving sports cars, you will want to know whether someone is a man or a woman. If old people are more likely to get cancer, you want to know how old someone is.<p>3) If you do not heed the above observation, there&#x27;s something called adverse selection that will get you. Suppose you have a bunch of high risk people mixed with low risk people. You&#x27;ll calculate a premium that&#x27;s somewhere in between the two pools. The problem is the low risk people will look at it and conclude it&#x27;s expensive for them, and they&#x27;ll be less likely than you&#x27;d realised to sign up. So you then get a bunch of high risk people who think it&#x27;s a great deal signing up, getting killed in accidents, and costing you more than you thought likely. It also means if you as a low risk person got into an accident anyway, you&#x27;d be without insurance.<p>So is it good that insurance companies want more and more info? For the most part, yes. It lets them price the premium more precisely, which helps everyone get insured. We&#x27;ll be able to pay for unlikely events at a cost that reflects the likely average. And you wouldn&#x27;t be paying for people who are more risky, and you wouldn&#x27;t be receiving anything from people in lower risk groups.<p>One thing to look out for is how we treat expensive-to-insure people. Even if there&#x27;s going to be a more accurate price for them, they may be very small groups whom the insurance companies decide aren&#x27;t worth the effort. For instance if we know that 80% of people with the BRCA2 gene will get cancer by age 50, you&#x27;re going to calculate a huge cost for them. You&#x27;d be collecting money from 5 people to hand it out to 4 of them, plus the expense of handling a claim.<p>One interesting thing about this new information fountain is you can lose money by having tests done. Say you have a parent with BRCA2, and people who aren&#x27;t tested have a 40% chance. WTF do you do then? You will either pay a huge premium or barely anything.",1449323056

One derp sitting in his Ford Thunderfuck XL EarthDestroyer 5600 is incredibly stupid. Like the author of the commented a train is massively more efficient, has higher throughput and scales better.

In general they would love every single order they put in to trade, so long as it happens in the right order.<p>When a spoofer puts in a spoofed order, that order is all cost.  Under no scenario do they want that order to trade.  The hard distinction to make in this case is not between normal market making behavior and spoofing, but between normal hedging behavior and spoofing.  Hedges look like pure costs, but they are costs you are happy to pay to give up some risk.  So spoofing all comes down to intent, which seems pretty easy to prove when you have chat transcripts.<p>Whether spoofing <i>should</i> be illegal is another discussion, and probably one the legislature should have, but for now while it is illegal, it should be aggressively enforced as if it&#x27;s not, it incentivizes the bad actors.",1449321673

10681766,comment,10681392,10681647,0,0,FLUX-YOU,,,"The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an opinion rejecting the government’s attempt to hold an employee criminally liable under the federal hacking statute—the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”)—for violating his employer-imposed computer use restrictions. The decision is important because it ensures that employers and website owners don’t have the power to criminalize a broad range of innocuous everyday behaviors, like checking personal email or the score of a baseball game, through simply adopting use restrictions in their corporate policies or terms of use.<p>The court also ruled that the government cannot hold people criminally liable on the basis of purely fantastical statements they make online—i.e., thoughtcrime.<p>The case, United States v. Gilberto Valle, received a lot of attention in the press because it involved the so-called “cannibal cop”—a New York City police officer who was charged with conspiracy to kidnap for posts he wrote on fetish websites about cannibalism. Valle was also charged with violating the CFAA for accessing a police database to look up information about people without a valid law enforcement purpose, in violation of NYPD policy. The jury convicted Valle on all counts, but the trial court reversed the jury’s conspiracy verdict, stating that “the nearly yearlong kidnapping conspiracy alleged by the government is one in which no one was ever kidnapped, no attempted kidnapping ever took place, and no real-world, non-Internet-based steps were ever taken to kidnap anyone.” The trial court ultimately found that holding Valle guilty of conspiracy to kidnap would make him guilty of thoughtcrime.<p>But the trial court upheld the CFAA conviction. And on appeal, we filed an amicus brief with the Second Circuit, urging the court to overturn the lower court’s dangerous ruling.  We argued that the lower court’s ruling would make criminals out of millions of innocent individuals, and the Second Circuit agreed—throwing out Mr. Valle&#x27;s CFAA conviction and joining two other federal circuit courts in rejecting the government’s attempt to expand the reach of the vaguely worded federal statute: “We decline to adopt the prosecution’s construction [of the CFAA], which would criminalize the conduct of millions of ordinary computer users[.]”  The court went on:<p>While the Government might promise that it would not prosecute an individual for checking Facebook at work, we are not at liberty to take prosecutors at their word in such matters. A court should not uphold a highly problematic interpretation of a statute merely because the Government promises to use it responsibly.<p>The Second Circuit also upheld the trial court’s decision to throw out the conspiracy conviction, as we had urged in a second amicus brief filed in the case, holding that “[t]he mere indulgence of fantasy, even of the repugnant and unsettling kind here, is not, without more, criminal.”<p>Thanks again to the Center for Democracy & Technology, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the Internet scholars who joined our CFAA amicus brief, and to UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh of the Scott & Cyan Banister First Amendment Clinic for writing our amicus brief regarding the conspiracy charges.<p>Related Cases\nUnited States v.

Whether that improvement suffices for a satisfactory level of service is another matter and will depend upon the reciprocal interaction between demand and capacity - which the article does not go into. But there&#x27;s no such thing as a panacea to free movement, whether you like the current form of public transport or not. Even if we got Star Trek&#x27;s transporters I&#x27;m sure there would be complaints about the congestion in transporter room five.<p>There are significant costs to public transport that the article hasn&#x27;t addressed as well. The switching costs of using public transport, whether you stay with the same form of public transport or not, are significant. The time you spend waiting for connections; the time spent waiting for all the other people to board, and alight, at their connections; the bother of finding which platform your train is going to be on when under time pressures to make the connection; the incredible cost paid when a bus, or train, is overloaded or unavailable.<p>It&#x27;s all very well to observe that a train can carry a particular number of passengers per mile per hour on a particular space of track, refer to the maximum theoretical capability of the system when trains are running within a certain safety distance. If you look at figures for energy costs, then public transport will similarly come out as the vastly superior option. But the cost of a form of transport is assessed in more than simply its use of space to move people through or its translation of energy into passenger miles.<p>Even when one is going to be stuck in traffic, it&#x27;s often more reliable, faster, and certainly less bother, to drive to the destination. Especially since the bus is going to be sitting in traffic anyway, that&#x27;s a tragedy of the commons problem going on there but it doesn&#x27;t change the underlying trade-off. For some that trade-off is so great that when denied access to private transport they can&#x27;t make the trips at all - I know people who don&#x27;t own cars, who cannot work 10 miles away, because the buses don&#x27;t run that early in the morning, or because there is one bus that runs that early in the morning and if it&#x27;s unreliable they&#x27;ve taken on a financial liability in gaining the job that they&#x27;ll be unable to effectively discharge because they&#x27;ll lose their job.<p>None of which is to say that public transport is a bad idea. I love the idea of fast regular trains that are little bother to get on, despite the fact that most of the time I drive to work. But if one&#x27;s in favour of it, perhaps it would be better to be in favour of it - in favour of improving it - rather than against something else.",1449320879
