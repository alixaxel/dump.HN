10801039,comment,10798534,10801027,0,0,Lukasa,,,"Oh if only that were possible. However, many people are using older OpenSSLs with no route to upgrading. For example, Ubuntu 14.04 is using OpenSSL 1.0.1 currently, and will not upgrade to any later release of OpenSSL. It&#x27;s unlikely to get backported to earlier releases because it fundamentally changes the logic and API of that OpenSSL release (by requiring a whole slew of extra functions that affect cert chain building). This would mean anyone not using a bleeding-edge system is caught in this situation where they can&#x27;t upgrade.<p>It&#x27;s definitely an interesting idea to allow constraints to be set on what certificates can be used during chain construction, but the scope of the problem is <i>very</i> large: there are lots of fields in an X509 certificate, many with complex values that complex filtering may want to be done on. In principle this can be done using callbacks from OpenSSL, but because of the potential up-and-down nature of building these trees there will be a substantial amount of complexity in place.<p>And the reality is that backward compatibility is <i>already</i> right. OpenSSL, today, is backward compatible with SHA1 certs. The problem here is <i>forward</i> compatibility: making older SSL stacks meet the security requirements of the modern day, many years after they were written. That&#x27;s <i>hard</i>, and may actually be impossible.",1451310575

They hand OpenSSL the certificates the remote server gave them, a pile of root certs, and say &quot;tell me if you can build a trust chain&quot;.

PHP comes with the FPM server and an opcode cache which makes this execution model performant in a way that was not possible before with CGI. With PHP, a lot of development effort went into making this work really well.",1451307713

Most hackers just use vulnerabilities which other people have discovered and they rarely innovate themselves.<p>Even discovering new vulnerabilities isn&#x27;t that hard. Once you know a particular codebase well enough, it&#x27;s pretty easy to find new vulnerabilities. The average programmer will likely identify and fix many such bugs/vulnerabilities each day as part of their regular job but they don&#x27;t get the same recognition that hackers get.<p>Also, social engineering is hardly engineering - It is just another name for deception/trickery.<p>I fully support hacking where the intent is to improve a system but doing so with the intent of achieving personal fame and fortune is just wrong and the tech media should make more effort to distinguish between the two.",1451307620
