10750489,comment,10745483,10750415,0,0,bad_alloc,,,"> I mean people are really, really good at communicating.<p>On my experience, people are usually really bad at communicating. It requires additional effort to imagine what information might be required for somebody else to follow your train of thought. Think of code documentation: What the original author percieves as obvious is cryptic to somebody else because context has been omitted for the sake of brevity. The author needs to invest a lot of time to actually dump his entire mindstate into documentation. Even if he does make an effort, not everybody is a good writer. If he doesn&#x27;t care about others understanding his stuff (which also seems to be the case with Mochizuki) it gets even worse.<p>Also remember that Mochizuki basically worked alone on his stuff for 20 odd years. He built his own world to work in and it&#x27;s just as hard for collegues to catch up to his level in that world as it is for e.g. non-programmers to understand programming (which takes years).",1450345915

Missing mechanisms like memory protection, which are often called as a condition for multitasking, are system stability issues only. The MP/M operating system already proved, that multitasking on Z80 computers is possible.<p>While the MOS Technology 6502 can not move the stack, the Z80 can freely replace it to any position in the memory, which is more or less a condition for pre-emptive multitasking. The existance of an alternative register set accelerates the content switching between the tasks dramatically. The restriction of Z80 systems to a 64 kB address space can be solved with bank switching.

If it was correct, what would be point of doing science? Let&#x27;s face it - the point of science is to build models of reality. And every model (except of usage of the world in logic) by definition is a type of inductive reasoning about reality. The reason why we want to have models is to be able to predict situations where we don&#x27;t have control; for instance, we don&#x27;t want build two bridges that are to be used by people to see which one fails. So you&#x27;re pretty much rejecting inductive reasoning in that sentence.<p>The AGW theory, specifically, is not a fact (GW is a fact), it&#x27;s a <i>model</i> that tells us what&#x27;s gonna happen (conditionally on our emissions) with the planet. And you can believe it&#x27;s a good model even without having control (just like you can believe that a computer model of a bridge is a useful tool). For instance, because you understand laws of thermodynamics, and you can measure what greenhouse gas is.<p>(Oh, on 2nd reading, I understand where you&#x27;re coming from. Model is technically not a fact, fact is some observation. But I guess in common language, most of the things we call facts are actually models.)",1450344206

It&#x27;s a photo of a famous athlete touting their product. After they process the image,  the output has a higher MEM-score—but only because the athlete is now dressed in the attire of their competitors.",1450342937

That&#x27;s weird.<p>* Selecting a specific DB (what I don&#x27;t really want to do) still shows me the wrong table list from a different DB. &#x27;Forget Schemas&#x27; does not work. Weirdly enough, I can query the DB I selected, it just won&#x27;t resolve the table names (and do autocomplete).<p>Though, it&#x27;s probably just me having this problem since there&#x27;s no way this would go through the testing phase.<p>EDIT2: The price is also way too much in my opinion. It basically costs as much as PHPStorm. Not sure why you would by DataGrip instead of Navicat.",1450342808
