They did a lot of interesting things over the years, but their view of the world is so fundamentally out of touch with what the world is today, that they can&#x27;t help but lose mindshare. They&#x27;re still quite strong, as there&#x27;s no alternative to them on the desktop (for most people), but they never quite gained dominance on the server (and continue to further fuck it up by introducing more and more bizarre licensing arrangements), their development environments and APIs look like a bad joke, and most decent engineers would rather have their balls/ovaries removed than code for the Microsoft platform. Nearly a decade ago, when I actually did develop for Windows, I asked a fellow engineer who coded for Linux why he refused to admit how superior C# was to Java. He basically said that he is not interested in chaining himself to any given platform. In the years that followed, I saw just how right he was.<p>So my message to Joe and other solid folks like him: there are tons of opportunities outside MS campus.

What Berner did, was to use the Interface Builder&#x27;s precursor on the NeXT he got as a toy to put a gopher-like link into the text properties field, where the font boldness, size ...and colour and underline were. This was a graphical workstation, and not spread world-wide at the time (NeXT was an expensive toy). Hardly an innovation. And not everybody was allowed to toy around -- certainly not &quot;western equivalent&quot; eastern europeans.<p>Nobody has really heard of Groff, Pellow, Nielsen and the rest, who made it work multiplatform, over the command-line, etc. ie. a universally world-wide. Nobody was astonished by them back then, because what they were doing was nothing special: several such systems existed already both commercial and academic. They were the cheap students, whose work allowed it to be opened up and given away without charge.<p>WWW grew like it did because of two reasons: it was free of charge, because it was actually made by cheap and disposable students, and the then changing climate of the deregulation of the internet, of which some companies ie. Vermeer, Netscape could take early advantage of.<p>CERN likes cheap students&#x27; work, and sell if off as stellar examples of innovation by CERN.

Overall, GTD felt like it requires too much willpower to run.<p>Have you tried Mark Forster&#x27;s Autofocus or Final Version Perfected systems? If not, you owe yourself a try. The systems, at their core, are very simple:<p>1. You have a long list of tasks (the same &#x27;ubiquitous capture&#x27; principle as in GTD and other systems) 2. You scan the list for tasks that &#x27;stand out&#x27; for you as &#x27;ripe&#x27; to be done / worked on. This means that you&#x27;re mentally ready to do these tasks. 3. Work these tasks for as long as you feel like. It&#x27;s not necessary to finish these tasks. 4. After you&#x27;ve dont with a task, you either cross it off the list, or re-append it to the end of the list.<p>I found his systems much more tolerant of creative work, and much less willpower hungry. A downside of these systems is that they&#x27;re not capable of handling tasks with start / due dates.<p>Also, regarding de-cluttering todo lists, I firmly believe that:<p>1. ALL your tasks and actionable thoughts must be captured in your system. 2. Your <i>current</i> todo list must only show items that you are ready to do <i>right now</i>, at the moment. For example, your todo list shouldn&#x27;t show the task &#x27;Vacuum the floor&#x27; if you&#x27;re not at home. Therefore, there must be ways of de-cluttering your todo list that allow you to defer the tasks until your external (or internal!) conditions are more conducive to working on these tasks.<p>(I got fed up with the inability of most todo apps to do the above, so I&#x27;m working on my own todo app).",1450603088

So you bothered to find an abstraction in the code, you described it, gave it a name, and yet - you didn&#x27;t tell the computer - here I am using this abstraction! And you rely on other humans to correctly infer what abstraction you used from reading your code, instead of just telling them.<p>So what should really be done, design patterns, once identified, should be replaced with proper abstractions in the programming language (mostly functions?) and die.
