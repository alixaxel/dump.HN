If something does need to be stored on the server a resource should be created. The state that is passed back and forth may then contain a reference to the resource, a resource identifier (in case of the web usually a URI is being used).<p>The server is stateless because it receives the latest state from the client (location, cookie and other headers) and sends an new updated state (location, set-cookie and other headers) to the client again along with an optional representation. There is no need for the server to keep the state in memory anymore. Because the server does not keep the state it does not matter which copy of the server (in case of load-balancing or fail-over etc.) handles the next request as everything needed can be derived from the state sent along with request from the client.<p>Keep in mind that it is best practice to be able to reproduce a representation by the use of a resource identifier, like with &quot;pure functions&quot; in functional programming, it should be deterministic. The content of a representation may change but not the semantics of it.<p>The part that is stateful is the state that is being passed back and forth between the client and the server.<p>Does that answer your question?",1450669592

In many situations, you can totally do away with interface creation by just using a lambda instead. Consider all the lines of code saved in a legacy code by just using lambdas in code!<p>2. <i>Default methods:</i> Again, `Interface patching` is a curse that a lot of Java projects suffer from. Requirements change slightly and what your typical enterprise Java dev does is add patches upon patches and layers upon layers in an interface. With default methods, you can just add default methods to your existing interfaces without affecting the ABI of your app. Again, tons of redundant code saved here.<p>3. <i>Type annotations</i>: Again, your typical Java devs have to resort to ugly hacks to place any constraints on the object properties. With type annotations, all you have to do is:<p><pre><code>    @NonNull String str;\n</code></pre>\nAnd lo and behold! The variable `str` cannot be assigned any `null` value. So, lots of validation code being saved here again.<p>To the best of my knowledge, none of the above features exist in the `C#` language (yet), so I take it as a Java&#x27;s edge over C#.",1450669515

APIs for such apps are usually exposed by using a library, so a lot of emphasis is placed on access privileges at the language level (ie private/internal/public) instead of at the interface level (ie pipes/REST).<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that the capability doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s that corporations are either unaware or unwilling to experiment with alternative approaches.<p>For example, one employee could spend half their time collecting data in Excel files from multiple members of a team, organizing it in a presentation-ready format, and emailing it up the chain.<p>Alternatively, the team members could each have a Google Spreadsheet where they input the data and a timed trigger fires off a bot that processes the data, saves it to a new file, and emails the link up the chain.<p>Both accomplish the same result. The second is a lot less prone to error/bias, and is also a lot more cost effective. But, to get an organization to adopt the latter approach requires convincing the organization to give up Excel as their canonical tool for organizing data.<p>I have fought that battle and it&#x27;s a lost cause. Even when adequate proof of cost/time savings are presented in a business-friendly format, inertia trumps reason.<p>A company <i>could</i> theoretically hire a developer to deploy a digital assistant to streamline/automate the mundane and repetitive business processes. Except, devs are expensive, in short supply, and it&#x27;s a really hard sell business leaders on the idea of adopting processes/tools that they don&#x27;t fully understand.",1450668912

There is quite a lot of misunderstanding of the topic.<p>REST as a concept was created as a way of characterizing a successful architectural style seen in web applications, a common set of constraints and advantages realized from those constraints. REST is attempting to characterize the architecture of the web, so I think it would be accurate to say &quot;the web itself is RESTful&quot;:<p>> The first three chapters of this dissertation define a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles, revealing how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. Common architectural styles are surveyed and classified according to the architectural properties they induce when applied to an architecture for network-based hypermedia. This classification is used to identify a set of architectural constraints that could be used to improve the architecture of the early World Wide Web.<p>> Architecting the Web requires an understanding of its requirements, as we shall discuss in Chapter 4. The Web is intended to be an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, which means considerably more than just geographical dispersion. The Internet is about interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries. Suppliers of information services must be able to cope with the demands of anarchic scalability and the independent deployment of software components. Distributed hypermedia provides a uniform means of accessing services through the embedding of action controls within the presentation of information retrieved from remote sites. An architecture for the Web must therefore be designed with the context of communicating large-grain data objects across high-latency networks and multiple trust boundaries.<p>> Chapter 5 introduces and elaborates the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. [...]<p>> Over the past six years, the REST architectural style has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web, as presented in Chapter 6. This work was done in conjunction with my authoring of the Internet standards for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), the two specifications that define the generic interface used by all component interactions on the Web.<p>(To be clear, I&#x27;m not intending to comment on whether REST is good or bad, nor its suitability to a purpose like API design. I just mean to comment on what it factually is and is intended to be, since from my perspective it frequently seems to be misunderstood.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/introduction.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/introduc...</a>",1450666867
