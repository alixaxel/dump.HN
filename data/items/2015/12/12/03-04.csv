In other words, will my code be littered by conditionals to support non-prod jobs?\n* Can my devops team run this or does it require additional staffing?\n* How many layers is this adding between me and the security primitives offered by my platform (Windows AD, AWS IAM, etc)\n* Is it serverless, or does it require me to run additional servers?\n* How do I ensure continuity if the software is no longer actively developed?\n* Can it deploy secrets to dev and test environments in the same way?\n* What&#x27;s the revocation story?<p>The answers to most of these questions for most of the tools that have made it to HN recently are not promising.

Marine life is severely threatened by these small pieces of plastic: the creatures that make up the base of the marine food chain, such as krill, are prematurely dying by choking on nurdles.[7] Nurdles have frequently been found in the digestive tracts of various marine creatures, causing physiological damage by leaching plasticizers such as phthalates. Nurdles can carry two types of micropollutants in the marine environment: native plastic additives and hydrophobic pollutants absorbed from seawater. For example, concentrations of PCBs and DDE on nurdles collected from Japanese coastal waters were found to be up to 1 million times higher than the levels detected in surrounding seawater.[8]<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_particle_water_pollution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_particle_water_pollu...</a>",1449890657

In that situation I was perfectly satisfied hiring junior folks with only 0-3 years of experience but a good head on their shoulders and a desire to learn, because there was enough slack in the larger org to make up for temporary slowdowns resulting from training & general learnings.  In my current role, I have a team of a half dozen, 4 of whom are skilled analyst/PM types.  If I want to build something, I either have to outsource or hire one of two of the very best &quot;full stack&quot; developers that I can trust to throw anything from front end design to web + mobile dev + data structures & reporting/analysis on the backend.  As a result, I&#x27;m almost always searching for people with 10 years of industry experience who have spent all that time learning & practicing a diverse set of skills.<p>I think one thing that&#x27;ll cause disappearance of low end jobs is the upcoming/increasing automation of business processes using click & drag workflow platforms (and better leaner ERPs & CRMs).  My previous employer has about 200 IT people just keeping Oracle running, and another 150 or so working on manufacturing software.  I think the majority of those kinds of jobs in big enterprise are going to disappear in the next 10 years... and that&#x27;s A LOT of jobs.

In fact even generating a random permutation is quite tricky.<p>Usually the easiest is to just use Fisher-Yates to get a random permutation and reject it if it doesn&#x27;t fit the criteria (people shouldn&#x27;t pick themselves etc.). For nearly all practical problem sizes this should be fast enough.<p>Trying to reject permutation half way and fixing it has a tendency to cause subtle biases.",1449889421

You do mention some general harm in community friction and worry, and I do agree that is a concern - but that&#x27;s happening anyhow right now. Yes, it&#x27;s bad, but removing the word &quot;slave&quot; won&#x27;t change that.<p>I do get the worry about overreach. Node.js has a PR that will automate looking for &quot;problematic&quot; words, which starts to sound Orwellian. However, the opposite extreme of &quot;change no words no matter who is offended&quot; can&#x27;t work either. We need to find a reasonable middle ground.<p>It seems like removing &quot;slave&quot; is fairly reasonable - that&#x27;s my feeling. What I find far more unreasonable are drive-by comments that complain without offering to do some work to help. But work to help is exactly what&#x27;s happening in this (small part of this) story.",1449889362

Uber doesn&#x27;t do any of the leasing itself, instead sending drivers to 3rd party leasing companies. Uber gets either zero or very little kickbacks since Uber&#x27;s primary motivation is getting drivers in nice cars on the road. The California decision was by some employment office with no real authority on the case of a single driver and so pretty much irrelevant.",1449889331
