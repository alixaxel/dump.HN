Blogs are not a problem, but you have to (manually) refresh the static site after each blog entry. For a business site (what I set up) with essentially static content, that is fine.<p>I no longer have access to the site, so I&#x27;m writing this from memory... I used a standard plugin that generated a static site out of the dynamic content. The plugin was for supporting static site serving on the local server, not a separate server. Being the more paranoid type, I used a Wordpress &quot;authoring&quot; server that was not publically accessible and a separate publically accessible &quot;static&quot; site server. I either had the plugin suboptimally/mis-configured or it had limitations, so I had to run a sed script on the output to change the web server host name from the internal authoring host to the static publically accessible host name (the link paths were fixed up properly). I then rsync&#x27;ed the result to the public host (with --delete to clean up obsolete files) using ssh keys for authentication, not passwords. I put this in a shell script, which made it simple and convenient for a sysadmin (me) to use but it was not user friendly for the Wordpress (not really computer literate) users.

When was the last time you fired up Tor just to browse the web?<p>I think all of us that want things like Tor to exist need to start making sure we&#x27;re users of Tor to do legitimate things on a regular basis. When people are asking for &quot;privacy&quot; on public wifi for basic web browsing, maybe we should be pointing them at the Tor Browser Bundle instead of a commercial VPN service, Hotspot Shield or the like.<p>I think there is a lot of talk around Tor&#x27;s legitimate uses, but I think a lot more of us should put our actions where our mouth is and make sure we use Tor on a regular basis. Tor has a lot of uses that aren&#x27;t underscored by its team or the usual privacy message:<p>1. Tor&#x27;s great at getting around firewalls and web filters. Have a bad ISP that proxies everything? Torify. Stuck in a school in which you can&#x27;t view materials you need for research? Torify.<p>2. Tor is cheaper than coffee-shop/public Wifi VPNs and is likely fine* for browsing the internet <i>privately</i> (note I did not say <i>anonymously</i>, since you will likely log into services from the Tor exit that will give up your anonymity.)<p>3. Tor hidden services are an easy way to set up a very secure connection to a remote service; the anonymity is just an extra feature. Do you live with five roommates in a house connected to someone else&#x27;s NAT box, and he/she won&#x27;t give you admin access? Tor hidden services are great NAT traversal tools. Run sshd behind a hidden service and you can shell into your own computer from anywhere for free.<p>The greater the critical mass of Tor exit IPs being used by legitimate people, also the less people will be inconvenienced by them places. I often use Tor to log in here to Hacker News, and I have to fill out captchas every now and then. If 10,000 people were using Tor to visit Hacker News, it&#x27;s likely these would get easier or go away.<p>If we want these tools to be legitimate, we have to make them legitimate, not just say &quot;hey, there are legitimate uses for it!&quot; Run the browser bundle. If you have extra resources, run a bridge or a relay; you can even run a middle relay from your house with likely no ill effect according to the EFF. If you really have power and are willing to deal with abuse requests, running an exit helps everyone.<p>* Note I said <i>likely fine</i> because I wouldn&#x27;t log into anything particularly sensitive from Tor. I personally believe a far greater proportion of the Tor exits are malicious to the network than the project wishes to believe, whether that means they are run by nation-state surveillance or people good at setting up transparent proxies.",1449935350

Not everyone can do that, which is why people who could do it invented gods, for the use of those who couldn&#x27;t.

The CTO&#x27;s reports included the QA director, Dev director, and Project Management director.<p>On any given project, we had a Product Manager who set the business requirements, a Project Manager who ran the project, a Dev lead in charge of the development team, and a QA lead in charge of QA. None of these people could override the others because of the reporting arrangement, so we had to collaborate instead to make sure we all met our goals.<p>Early on this arrangement worked really well. But it started falling apart when ownership of the company changed and politics became a factor as people who cared more about moving up through the organization than about the success of the company and quality of the products were hired and promoted.
