You also don&#x27;t have to trust news and media outlets.  All science reporting sucks, and this is mostly true of reporting around AGW.<p>That leaves the scientists.<p>One one side you have a very small number of scientists who don&#x27;t believe that climate change is happening and that climate change is a result of human activity.  And when you look at those scientists you see people who were previously employed (ie, paid for work) by tobacco companies to spread fear and doubt about tobacco (and those techniques were so successful that even today, when we know most lung cancer is caused by smoking, we have people who don&#x27;t understand what the actual risks of smoking are) or who are paid to do similar activity.  That&#x27;s not real science, that&#x27;s not testing the data and testing the claims.<p>There&#x27;s a very much larger group of scientists who believe climate change is happening, and who believe that human activity is probably a cause.  There&#x27;s some discussion in this group about the science, but that&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s how science works, and that debate should not be misused to say that AGW isn&#x27;t real or that climate change is not happening.

Since you can download a new compressor in under a minute and should be able to assume that your users are pretty sophisticated.
