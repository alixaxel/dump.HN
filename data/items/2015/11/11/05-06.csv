10545055,comment,10538200,10544324,0,0,insoluble,,,"I agree that it&#x27;s no easy task. I&#x27;m thinking maybe when real-time brain imaging (including EEG) improves sufficiently, the effects of social exchanges could be measured more directly without having to rely on surveys. Either this, or humans would need to be placed into a giant maze where all their interactions are recorded.<p>Surveys can sometimes be somewhat informative if done correctly. I once ran a morality survey (on TolunaQuick) where I quantified categories of morality across socioeconomic statuses using a three-tier questionnaire. The approach was much like that employed by common personality tests, where each measurement is made from multiple questions essentially targeting the same topic. By having related questions on different tiers (levels of magnitude or intensity), the subjective information was somewhat quantifiable across individuals. Like with many systems, it would be recommended to begin with a simple scenario (one type of event, one variable being measured) and to build from there.<p>Without having a method of quantification, the formulae for human interactions would remain as nothing more than abstract hypotheses. Hence, quantification is necessary for scientific analysis.<p>On a related note, I believe that one of the most detrimental flaws in everyday human communication is that magnitudes are expressed using highly subjective, discrete categories. For example, someone might ask, &quot;How much fun did you have?&quot;. The answer would generally be limited to a scale having just several steps such as &quot;a little bit&quot;, &quot;a fair amount&quot;, &quot;quite a bit&quot;, or &quot;a lot&quot;. It is unfortunate that humans are unable to give a more fluid answer that is somehow standardised, such as by saying &quot;3.5 F worth of fun&quot;. Another deplorable example is when journalists take scientific findings and say something like &quot;X was found to be significantly more likely to give you cancer than Y&quot; while not giving any details as to the absolute <i>or</i> relative quantity of difference. For all we know, X increases the risk of cancer by 0.01% compared with Y; and the general public seems ignorant of the uselessness of the statistical term &quot;significant&quot; when not accompanied by the numbers whence it sprang. Common tongue is inherently deceptive, and many people have a bad habit of taking advantage of this ambiguity for propagandist purposes.",1447221398

I&#x27;d love to hear others&#x27; experience with them.<p>It&#x27;s a very good no-nonsense service based on standard protocols, although a bit pricey (compared to a grandfathered,  free Google Apps account). They&#x27;ve lately been expanding to offer a more complete offering (CalDAV, CardDAV, etc).<p>This means it plays nicely with any platform where these standards can be applied (Googley or not) and it also means it&#x27;s easy to take data ownership seriously, if that&#x27;s your thing.<p>I only have positive experiences with fastmail, and I like that they don&#x27;t have messed up and bloated their WebUI like Google have.<p>Currently I&#x27;m only using it for my personal email because of price. It&#x27;s not that expensive, but because it&#x27;s 100% free for me, I still have the rest of my family on the Google apps account.<p>The reassuring thing about paying for a service like this is that you know who the customer is.

If they differ, containsAndAdd returns false and the process should write the event. If the ids are the same, containsAndAdd returns true and the process can safely drop the event on the ground. Occasionally, two byte arrays may hash to the same index. When this happens, containsAndAdd will return false and a duplicate write will be emitted. However, since duplicate items come close together in time, this is relatively rare.",1447220028

With such a high turnover, the overwhelming majority of employees are probably much happier achieving the supposed glory of making something new rather than understanding and maintaining the old system.<p>Maybe another reason for the change is that, back in the Marissa Mayer days, hiring standards used to be much more brutal. Google was still reaping the rewards of bucking the trends of web portals jammed with ads, but eventually lost its confidence in nerd-driven products and instead began to imitate Apple, Facebook, and inexplicably, Microsoft...",1447218451

Reason not one big IT shop or Consulting companies want to hire anyone with experience. They want to hire the cheapest H1b&#x27;s to do coding. Since they accept such low salaries and everyone claims they are a coding expert. In reality it is bodies vs the rates. So if the clients are willing to pay 100 dollars per hour and it costs you 30 dollars per hour by hiring a H1b. You pocket the 70. Since these guys do such a bad job now you can milk the client for all the bug fixes etc for the crappy job. Since there is no easy proven way to evaluate quality other than the number of tickets closed it just does not matter.\nAt no point am I referring to companies in silicon valley like Google, FB, AMZN etc. This is for the consulting industry in the rest of the country where this gets completely misused.<p>I have seen most of my fellow programmers change their career since having 15 years of experience is bad thing because we are not willing to work for 60K.",1447218382
