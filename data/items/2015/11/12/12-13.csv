10552804,comment,10551280,10551280,0,0,haberman,,,"Interesting stuff.  The article is quite verbose -- here is the Cliff Notes versions:<p>The trie is a well-known data structure for storing string sets or string-keyed maps (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie</a>).  You can compress a trie by using a DAG/FSM instead of a tree -- this lets you share states for suffixes, whereas trees only let you share states for prefixes.  But for large sets minimizing a DAG is too expensive to perform on the whole trie.  If you insert the keys in-order, you can minimize the DAG on-the-fly much more cheaply.<p>If you have a map instead of a set, the DAG is called a FST (finite state tranducer) instead of a finite state acceptor.  In this case every edge has some value that you accumulate into the final result.  For example, if the map values are integers, each edge can be an integer that is added to the final result.  It takes a bit more cleverness in the algorithm to share prefix/suffix states while maintaining the tranducer invariants.",1447333140

I wonder if they would still think it was moral to limit their children to a 3rd world education because it&#x27;s only fair that education (level) be equal for everyone?<p>Human progress is made by those who are exceptional. It is only through the efforts of exceptional people that everyone else&#x27;s lives are improved. Imagine if Faraday and Einstein were forced to not publish, and even destroy their papers because it wasn&#x27;t &quot;fair&quot; that they had discovered something that other people hadn&#x27;t.<p>Is this view of &quot;fairness&quot; fair at all? Should we break the legs of a natural runner, so they can only run as fast as the average person? Should we damage the brains of the gifted so they are equal with everyone else? Rather, shouldn&#x27;t people have the freedom to excel as far as they can?<p>The intellectually gifted should be encouraged to excel as far as they can, because their work and discoveries will cause tremendous improvements to the human condition. It would be more fair for there to be special schools for the gifted, so they are not slowed down by the lowest common denominator.<p>Imagine that you had the intellect to cure cancer, or make solar power more economical than fossil fuels. Now imagine that you are denied from accomplishing these things because it isn&#x27;t &quot;fair&quot; for you to earn more money than others. Guess what? It takes tons of money to do research and development. The only reason Elon Musk is making the major improvements for humanity that he is, is because he was able to use his intellect to earn lots of money so he could do even better things.<p>What would become of humanity if we decided to hinder everyone to the same skill and wealth levels?
