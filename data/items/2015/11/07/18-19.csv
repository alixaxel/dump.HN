Airport body scanners, all the Internet surveillance stuff... For our recent authoritarian governments, national security paranoia seems to trump privacy concerns every time, and blatantly ignoring European rulings to the contrary appears to be standard procedure at the moment.<p>I haven&#x27;t made up my mind yet about whether we&#x27;re better off in the EU than out. It&#x27;s obviously a complicated question. But something that is a big factor in favour of leaving is that there is so much one-sided co-operation: the EU seems to be used as a convenient excuse to justify unpopular rules that might cause political problems at home, because we &quot;have to comply with the EU directives&quot; or some such, yet apparently we have no trouble not complying when the EU rules are less convenient.",1446922777

10525793,comment,10517175,10524024,0,0,zanny,,,"> It sounds a bit sexist (as if moms should stay home and their spouse, male of female should be employed)<p>I never implied that. Preferably society would be rich enough both parents could raise their kids without having to fend for survival while doing so. I would hope we have advanced as a species enough at this point, generated enough wealth at this point, to enable that.<p>And if that were not possible, I <i>know</i> classical sexism would drive the women to stay home, but preferrably whoever preferred their job would continue working and the other could raise the children, irrespective of sex.<p>> For example, with basic income<p>UBI is almost certainly the optimal solution here. I&#x27;d argue because it enables that joint parental rearing much more often - if parents have any financial assets they could potentially both drop out of the workforce to optimally raise their child, and depending on their wealth they could both withdraw for variable lengths of time. Even in the worst case scenario one successful careered individual in a family of two with joint UBI should definitely be able to have a stay at home parent and a working one maintain a working class lifestyle.",1446922549

10525790,comment,10525377,10525420,0,0,elevation,,,".qcow2 files have two main advantages when building system images compared to a loopback device.<p>First, when building a system image with make, it works best to have each step result in a separate image file so that make can rebuild your image when a dependency changes without having to completely start over.  Using .qcow2 images means that only the diffs are stored in each image file, instead of having a dozen 4GB .bin files.<p>Second, because the loopback device requires root by default, you end up running &quot;sudo make&quot; as part of your build process.  But with .vmdk or .qcow2 files, tools like libguestfs can mount the filesystem for manipulation without root.  If you&#x27;re planning to distribute your work, then &quot;git clone && cd project && make&quot; is more accessible directing your users to modify their user permissions or elevating to root.",1446922504

Focus has to do with the fact that the real world can only be projected on to our retina sharply at one distance. The letters in your peripheral vision are hard to make out not because they are out of focus but because they are falling on a part of the retina that has low resolution (also see &quot;visual crowding&quot;).

10525762,comment,10524791,10524791,0,0,hwh,,,"This reminds me of my first mention in a Linux kernel commit message: <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0a489cb3b6a7b277030cdbc97c2c65905db94536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux....</a>\nIt&#x27;s the fix for a bug I found in the kernel. This sounds quite boring, but the fun part is the background story:\nAntivirus vendor X (actually forgot which one) bragged about a new, dangerous virus that can spread on Windows as well as Linux platforms. Joe Barr reported on that for NewsForge, claiming that the Virus didn&#x27;t work at all (on Linux). I jumped in and tested too, and found that it wouldn&#x27;t work (meaning: infect other binaries) on newer kernels since there was an actual bug in the kernel preventing it from doing so.<p>Why I&#x27;m reciting that story is this: It is perfectly fine for a binary to write executable code to other files. Your typical compiler does. The kernel isn&#x27;t there to prevent that. The kernel is supposed to prevent it if you configure a security policy that forbids it - starting with things as simple as file ownership and permissions. This is pretty much clear for anyone who knows some things about what the computer does. For people who only have some fuzzy ideas, fixing the Linux kernel to make (in this case) a virus work again sounded a bit weird.<p>Well, ransomware is in the news these days because of the raid in the Netherlands, and here there&#x27;s another &quot;security specialist&quot; trying to use this for its PR. But again there is nothing that indicates that this is all about standard functionality. Yes, you can encrypt all your own files on a typical machine. Yes, a piece of software can do it for you. Yes, you can run such software. And if you&#x27;re careless and follow orders easily, someone else might give you the software to do it.",1446922145

It really must suck to be one of those that can&#x27;t handle opiates (sincerely; my mom can&#x27;t either).<p>Due note that the side effects do release over time in some people. For instance one patient I&#x27;m familiar with had an adverse reaction to hydrocodone frequently (1:1 to 1:3). But within a year it was closer to 1:50 and years later is around 1:200. There are other options that are more powerful and have less side effect. Combining with an anti nausea med seems to work (dimenhydrinate (Dramamine)).<p>I&#x27;ve read at least one study that showed improved cognitive due to opiates (from the pain relief). Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find it right now (but I now get the point of a bookmarking service).<p>Addiction itself isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. If the user doesn&#x27;t want to be addicted, there easy ways to slowly get off. Take time, there&#x27;s no rush. It&#x27;s only the legal and financial aspects that make it problematic. If a doctor gives someone half a gram of hydrocodone for pain, they should be legally obligated to provide significantly more over time in case the patient starts to suffer any withdrawal symptoms. But doing so now, even admitting you took an extra one some night, gets you listed as a bad person. That&#x27;s what needs fixing.",1446922145

It&#x27;s a huge administrative burden that literally makes many micro-businesses unviable, and it imposes prohibitive overheads on slightly larger businesses that are just getting going.<p>To add insult to injury, it&#x27;s also impossible in practice to comply with the rules fully even if you make a good faith effort, unless you have a specialist VAT accountant&#x27;s level understanding of each EU member state&#x27;s tax system. Obviously no business except for large multinationals actually has this level of understanding available to it.<p>What is particularly appalling in this case is that the authorities who spent all that time working on the new rules <i>didn&#x27;t even realise all those smaller businesses existed</i> until the very end. A huge campaign against the new measures was started with just weeks to go. Most of the authorities across all levels of government pointed to years of discussions, said they consulted earlier, and asked why the small businesses didn&#x27;t say anything before. It didn&#x27;t even occur to them that the microbusinesses didn&#x27;t know, because no-one had thought to contact them, unlike larger businesses with well-established VAT management, and because someone running a £500/year side business from their kitchen table to fund their kids&#x27; christmas presents might not be following the intricate details of EU tax negotiations.<p>The icing on the cake is the often dysfunctional systems put in place to administer the new systems, which have made it very clear that even the national tax authorities often don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. Case in point: Multiple national tax authorities have already sent waves of wildly incorrect and extremely hostile demands for payment of supposedly unpaid VAT to small businesses in other countries.<p>Imagine how you&#x27;d feel if you spent a year building up a side business, then one morning you woke up to a demand for over a million Euros, far more money than you&#x27;d ever made in your year of trading, saying if you didn&#x27;t pay faster than you could sensibly get legal or tax advice then you&#x27;d be taken to court without further notice, inevitably killing your business.<p>This is the reality when the EU gets to play with legal and tax rules but the people making the rules fail to understand the basic nature of how those rules will affect smaller businesses or individual citizens who aren&#x27;t over there playing the games with the politicians. It&#x27;s a scary prospect, and the way forward some of the EU bureaucrats see for the Internet and for intellectual property as we&#x27;re discussing today seems many times worse than the short-sightedness they showed with the VAT mess a year ago.",1446921570
