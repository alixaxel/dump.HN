I never argued about first order logic or learning reasoning so I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re bringing that argument up - I said that basic programming lets you do stuff that&#x27;s useful in majority of office work - it helps analyze/transform/collect data and interact with software in a more productive manner. You don&#x27;t even need to learn programming just going trough the process should give you some insight so when you encounter a problem you can know what to search for and go trough the motions to use an existing solution (eg. knowing how to run a script you downloaded because you know what a script is and what it&#x27;s supposed to do, or knowing how to modify some formula/query even if you couldn&#x27;t write it from scratch)",1446937007

10526537,comment,10523668,10526430,0,0,T-R,,,"It&#x27;s definitely relevant that my complaints are from a Haskell perspective (as this is a Haskell thread). If I&#x27;m working in just about any procedural/OOP language, sum types are a completely foreign concept. If I&#x27;m working in PHP, I don&#x27;t expect a consistent API. If I&#x27;m working in a strict language, I don&#x27;t expect to be able to abstract my data model away from how I loop over it in memory. If I&#x27;m used to anything without some support for dependent types, I just assume that an empty list, or a list with too many entries couldn&#x27;t possibly be detected at compile time. The high level constructs it does have are strictly less powerful, largely as a function of not being composable/consistent and certainly not as polymorphic as the kinds of things in Foldable/Traversable, though certainly better than writing your own for-loops.<p>The thing is, these are practically all you do in SQL, so it&#x27;s pretty frustrating that, when working with it, so much time is dedicated to dealing with these <i>solved</i> problems. They&#x27;re the reason you can&#x27;t import a &quot;votes&quot; or &quot;comments&quot; package to your database, and why being a database expert is such a niche, specialized, and lucrative position - because so much knowledge isn&#x27;t captured in the language, or the compiler, or libraries (even though it quite feasibly could be), but just spread by books and blog articles. It&#x27;s why building complex things on relational databases is so hard - the level you&#x27;re working at is strictly limited to &quot;what keys do I join on to get the result set I want&quot; and &quot;how do I make this only loop once&quot; - it&#x27;s not inherent in the relational model/relational algebra, it&#x27;s strictly a problem with SQL.<p>To add, as a declarative query language, it&#x27;s worth also comparing to things like Prolog/Datalog. Prolog certainly doesn&#x27;t get you all of the things I mentioned, either (e.g., no dependent types), but it is a much higher level of abstraction - you can describe things like &quot;this is a one-to-one relationship&quot; at a high level. The flipside is that, to write performant queries, you need to understand the Warren Abstract Machine, but because of its consistency, that&#x27;s a significantly lower barrier to entry than trying to understand a specific database&#x27;s optimizer implementation, or the arbitrary decisions in the SQL spec, and the knowledge there is actually transferrable.",1446936524

Even with the changes they&#x27;re making to reporting, the user&#x27;s account completely disappears from the site until the &quot;issue&quot; is resolved.  People might think something happened to them, and of course the user is still shut off from what may be their only means to communicate with some (or even all) important people in their lives or support groups.<p>Also, from what I can remember from helping my mom through that process, I don&#x27;t think you can even export your own data if your account&#x27;s been flagged.  Even if you could, the export process is broken:  exporting private messages is broken (a long, 50,000+ message conversation with a close friend doesn&#x27;t export in full for me, and archived conversations also don&#x27;t get included), and according to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254</a>, your notes, your own timeline posts, your posts on others&#x27; profiles, things you&#x27;ve shared, things you&#x27;ve liked, and your following list are also not included.

I&#x27;d say they should give a 45- or 60-day warning before shutting off access to the account, and even then still allow the user to export their data (and fix the export process) and/or close the account.  They also need to let other users access the suspended profile if the user doesn&#x27;t choose to close it.",1446936515

Many agencies will give you a much stronger initial product, since they&#x27;re used to making good v1 products.<p>Usually to be successful, the non-technical team must have  complementary strengths, such as great domain knowledge and industry contacts, good sales ability etc. Purely technical startups are rarely successes outside of Silicon Valley, usually the tech needs to be married to a strong non-technical team that sets up sales, distribution networks, operations, etc",1446935935

I&#x27;m pretty close to hating my current job, despite that fact that I work on a well-known product with millions of users.<p>The analogy that comes to mind is a pro race car driver who is forced to only drive on an obstacle course, never exceeding 20 mph. The driver has skills that enable him to drive successfully on the obstacle course, but he yearns to do what he loves, opening up on a proper racetrack. In the same way, I have the skills to do tedious debugging of a large, absurdly complex system with tons of technical debt, only making minimal changes to avoid the whole pile of spaghetti collapsing. But I wish every day that I was designing and implementing systems instead, and I&#x27;m good at that, too.<p>Ironically, it was early in my career that I had the most autonomy to implement new features and write a lot of code, even if it was on obscure products. In the latter part of my career, I guess my mistake was allowing myself to be lured into working on &quot;famous&quot; things at big companies, even though it amounted to being mostly a maintenance programmer on sprawling, spaghettified legacy software.<p>I guess that next time, I should be more diligent about trying to find out what the day-to-day work will be like (which I find very hard to get an accurate idea of in the interview process. obviously the interviewer is going to paint a rosy picture), and at this point I would rather work on something totally obscure, if it meant I got to do more design and coding.",1446934498

As a declarative query language, I can describe a join between two arbitrary (no need to do anything besides have the tables exist) tables and the query optimizer will do a very good job of choosing among several different algorithms to perform that join for me. Without a thought to any statistics of the data, the query is optimized appropriately, including the construction of a temporary index if that is the best way to compute the join.<p>Or, transactions in general - ACID guarantees are maintained with a simple transaction - almost no boilerplate, just saying where it begins and where it ends with some options for specific behavior, and the transaction is guaranteed on arbitrary data structures without any other code necessary.<p>I won&#x27;t go into the data consistency guarantees you can make just by defining a couple of foreign keys and constraints (performance aside - these can be optimized - this would be awful to put together by hand in a project)<p>These are some of the abstractions in SQL which are absurdly high level compared to doing something similar in another language. Several of your bullets also support that it is a high level language, e.g. 4 &quot;others may be implementation dependent&quot; - this is not a statement ever made about assembly for example.<p>SQL is, at the end of the day, a query language built around relational algebra, already an abstract topic, and implemented on arbitrary hardware, operating systems, filesystems, and so on. It&#x27;s not got a lot of high level concepts that exist in other languages, sure, but it&#x27;s got a lot of stuff built in that would be a bear and a half to implement on your own. Its high level concepts are in general very orthogonal to those in other languages.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not disagreeing with your bullets, and I appreciate the time you took to reply and your points are exactly the sort of thing I was asking for.
