This new OS would get direct updates from Google, like ChromeOS. To get legacy support of apps designed for Android, simple repackage every existing application with ARC.

From what I heard from my Singaporean colleagues the haze during my time there was pretty much cleared up.<p>They have a number to measure how bad it is, they call it &quot;PSI&quot;, see e.g. <a href=""http://www.haze.gov.sg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haze.gov.sg/</a>. This is used in multiple countries, though the definition on what number constitutes bad air differs. During my entire stay, the number was 50-100 or so. Keep this in mind.<p>So my experience: One evening there&#x27;s like a fog, you can maybe see for 50 meters max. But the fog isn&#x27;t water particles in the air, it is leftover material from the fire. Meaning: what you&#x27;re seeing is utterly bad. Most of the time I spend either in the office, restaurant, a bar and public transport (AFAIK not only air conditioned but also filtered air).\nI wear contact lenses. Though only spending maybe 30 min in open air max: I got red eyes, had to clean my contact lenses again and had to buy eye drops to fix my red eyes.<p>The haze was way worse before I arrived there. Only 1.5 day it was really bad. However, you could never see the sky. Just filthiness in the air preventing you from seeing it.<p>I had it badly with 50-100 of &quot;PSI&quot;. Before I was there it was around 300!<p>Singapore is pretty interesting (fooooood! :-D), but living there will really shorten your life thanks to this.<p>I never really understood haze until I experienced it myself. It&#x27;s good to remember that it&#x27;s not like the fog I am used to. It&#x27;s like staying in the smoke of a burning building.",1446547260

They run at lower RPM than similarly designed gas engines, and last longer between rebuilds.<p>Reliability is one of these stubborn diesel myths that refuses to die. The lifespan of modern gasonline engines -when driven normally- is several multiples of what the average owner will drive the car for before it is replaced. You can easily put 300K kilometers on a gasoline engine before it needs a &#x27;rebuild&#x27; (which typically involves not much more than changing the piston rings and rod bearings). Around 150K you may need a mild cylinder head revision (valve seals, valve seats, tappets) if you torture the engine enough. You won&#x27;t have to break the bank for either of those. I don&#x27;t know a single person except myself (driving a 25 year old car with a high-performance engine) who ever needed an engine rebuild.<p>Meanwhile, regular servicing for diesel engines is guaranteed to be more expensive compared to a gasoline engine, so in the long run you will not save any money on maintenance unless you drive your car without any care for reliability.",1446545045

So if you want this feature I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll have to build it yourself or find an alternative.  There have been multiple mentioned in the thread, one in particular I have heard good things about is Shout-IRC.",1446544833

Looks like FUD-bait to me.<p>This is how I would write the article (and this is probably all there is to the article)<p>Over the past 15 years, death rates for whites per 100,000 people aged 45–54 remained basically the same, with the natural increase lifespan being offset by increases in both suicide and alcohol/drug issues. This difference is statistically significant, but it is on the order of 1 or 2 extra deaths per thousand people for their lives from 45-54. It is highly unusual for death rates to change like that. The last great change in the west of this magnitude was with the introduction of HIV/AIDS. For context, the average middle class white american would experience the same increase in risk if they took up canoeing over the same period.<p>But maybe I missed it. I got a graph where one line stays the same where others decline, and I got a graph where risk increases for a couple causes of death by a very small amount (out of dozens not listed)<p>Also I have approximately 50 comments lamenting the rise of third world conditions in places like Peoria and the death of all things good and decent in the USA. I believe if a little more context was provided by the news outlet in this case, perhaps our comments would be more aligned with the actual impact of the news being reported.",1446544807
