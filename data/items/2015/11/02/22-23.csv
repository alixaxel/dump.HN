However you do need some sort of liquidity event for that and I worry that some Unicorns will become Ponzi-corns as early investors contribute their shares to be re-sold to the later investors as a way to cash out their 2X and move on. Then its &quot;last one in, loses everything&quot;. Of course a couple of take out re-capitializations will probably put a damper on some of that zeal.<p>Mostly the people being screwed here are employees with 100% common stock. That argues that high value employees should be negotiating for preferred stock grants rather than common stock ISOs. That will come with a bigger tax bill but has a better chance of providing a return on their sweat investment.",1446505183

10495996,comment,10495304,10495689,0,0,danjayh,,,"While I&#x27;m certainly not making excuses for VW cheating, I think that maybe the EPA needs to revisit its diesel emission standards. The EPA standard is the strictest in the world, and they have successfully ruined many diesel powered devices. Examples:<p>1) I was recently looking at compact tractors. To meet the standards, new tractors are fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters. Even if they don&#x27;t flat-out fail (which happens too often, and costs thousands of dollars to fix), these filters require &quot;regeneration&quot;, which is code for &quot;a light comes on on the dashboard, your tractor stops moving, and runs wide-open throttle for 20 minutes while you stare in bewilderment&quot;. Google Kubota B3350 Regeneration if you want lots of fun horror stories.<p>2) Diesel commercial trucks. My uncle drives a large cube van over the road. When his truck goes into regen mode, it doesn&#x27;t require wide-open throttle like a compact tractor, but it does lose power and tops out at 40-50MPH. If you are on a freeway where the flow of traffice is at 80MPH, this is dangerous and a major problem.<p>3) Diesel pickup trucks: Many trucks, in an effort to avoid additional hardware above and beyond the DPF, have taken to injecting fuel during the exhaust stroke. The idea is to have the unburned fuel get pumped through the engine and on to the DPF, where it burns and increases the temperature to the point that the carbon burns out of the DPF. Problem is, when you inject fuel into an engine during the exhaust stroke, it dilutes the oil in the cylinder, reduces lubrication, and causes premature wear/engine failure.<p>In the two cases I am familiar with, diesel motorhomes and diesel compact tractors, the value of used vehicles has increased quite a bit in response to the fact that all of the new ones suck. My Dad owns a gravel pit, and he (along with everyone else in the industry) buys and re-builds existing vehicles from the frame-up to avoid having to purchase new products, which are unreliable, sometimes dangerous, and uneconomical to maintain. Google &quot;glider truck kits&quot; -- it&#x27;s basically the idea of purchasing all the parts of a new vehicle (except the powertrain), and then manually taking the powertrain from a worn-out truck, re-building it, and installing it into the glider kit. This is often done at an expense that is similar to that of purchasing an entirely new vehicle.<p>Many equally horrible solutions to this problem are employed. Some designs incorporate a fuel burner directly into the exhaust design. Others require a separate tank of catalytic fluid that must be filled regularly. One thing that all of the designs have in common is poor performance and piss-poor fuel economy. Many vehicles from multiple manufacturers have had trouble with catching on fire due to emissions control systems.<p>If the EPA wants to make tough rules that will force manufacturers to produce products with the best available technology and encourage development of new technologies, that&#x27;s one thing. When the EPA makes rules that result in dangerous and/or non-functional product designs, I think it&#x27;s time to back off just a bit until the technology has come closer to being able to reasonably achieve the regulated cleanliness levels. It&#x27;s completely insane to make a truck that will force you to slow to 40mph while you&#x27;re driving it, or to make a tractor that will force a farmer to take an unplanned break in the middle of the day (remember -- farmers work all day long, and daylight is a limited, precious commodity to them).<p>EDIT: To be completely clear, if you are doing work with the tractor that can be done at full RPM, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to park it. However, if you&#x27;re doing something that requires lower RPM (using a PTO attachment that needs low RPM like a post-hole digger, or a spreader, etc ... or doing low-speed work on a tractor with a geared transmission), then it&#x27;s time to go get some coffee. Personally, the two major things I want to do with a tractor are run a large snowblower and maintain our horse pasture. For the horse pasture it&#x27;s not a big deal, but if I need to clear the driveway before leaving for work in the morning, an unplanned 20 minute wait is completely unacceptable.",1446505141

Even Graham and Santorum, who weren&#x27;t even on the &quot;main stage&quot; of the recent GOP debate, have won U.S. Senate elections and have national name recognition that far outstrips Lessig.<p>Lessig seems to think that if he eked his way onto the stage of a televised Democratic debate, he&#x27;d have a chance of jump-starting a national political campaign on the issue of campaign finance.<p>But it&#x27;s actually the reverse: you only get onto a debate stage if you already have a campaign. The polling criteria is not a gotcha. It&#x27;s just the easiest way to ensure that only people with actual popular traction get stage time. The debate is not intended to be a &quot;big intro&quot; opportunity.

Since the beginning, he made known what he really wanted, at a minimum, was the chance to make this issue more of a priority among all candidates.<p>This is just my opinion, but being a &quot;spoiler&quot; for the party never really appeared to be a likely outcome for Lessig, nor did being an agent for change.

I sort of touched on this in another comment, but perhaps the emission standard on these vehicles is what&#x27;s unreasonable.<p>We have a more-or-less arbitrarily set maximum allowed tailpipe emissions for a given class of vehicles.

First, the world is not as rigid as some would have you believe.  There&#x27;s been a <i>lot</i> of work on service and system management, cron alternatives, and other stuff over the years.  For a less radical cron than runwhen, witness Bruce Guenter&#x27;s bcron.

It&#x27;s interesting to observe, as I have mentioned before, how much influence the daemontools family has had over the past decade and a half.  Looking at cronie, to pick an example, one can see it nowadays is yet another member of the club of programs sporting a &quot;don&#x27;t do all that bogus daemonization stuff&quot; option, -n in this case.  GNU cron (a.k.a. Mellor cron) actually does not &quot;daemonize&quot; <i>by default</i>, and one has to explicitly choose that with a -d option.  To look at old Vixie cron, one might come to the erroneous conclusion that <i>cron always and unavoidably &quot;daemonizes&quot;</i>, something that was indeed a problem for daemontools users in the late 1990s.

If any part of the path to exit breaks down, the whole system will start to fail.<p><i>There are real problems with these distorted &quot;valuations&quot;.  Employees these companies hire often think of them as real valuations.  It also often makes the company think of itself as much bigger than it is, and do the wrong things for its actual stage.  Finally, too much cheap money lets companies operate with bad unit economics and cover up all sorts of internal problems.  So I think many companies are hurting themselves with access to easy capital.</i><p>Sounds like Sam has (unwittingly) become an Austrian. Friedrich Von Hayek on inflation (1970): &quot;The initial general stimulus which an increase of the quantity of money provides is chiefly due to the fact that prices and therefore profits turn out to be higher than expected. Every venture succeeds, including even some which ought to fail. But this can last only so long as the continuous rise of prices is not generally expected. Once people learn to count on it, even a continued rise of prices at the same rate will no longer exert the stimulus that it gave at first.&quot; [1]<p>Sounds a little bit like QE stimulus which has been channeled into the private financial markets. I wonder why it hasn&#x27;t translated into higher salaries.<p><i>But no matter what happens in the short- and medium-term, I continue to believe technology is the future, and I still can’t think of an asset I’d rather own and not think about for a decade or two than a basket of public or private tech stocks.</i><p>I&#x27;d rather own real estate than a basket of private tech stocks, especially if that basket includes Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or really any company where user growth rates and advertising revenues are heavily informing valuations.<p>Users can and will migrate between tech platforms pretty easily - homes, offices, businesses - not so much. Plus, the government has been very pro-landlord lately, soaking up trillions in mortgage debt at the federal level and allowing insane housing bubbles like SF and NY to continue to grow unabated at the state level. Looking for fixed, usury income in a ZIRP and QE-infinity world? Look no further.<p>The only consolation one can take in this situation is the fact that less and less people are even able to play the investing game anymore. Only 26% of individuals under 30 are investing in the stock market, as compared with 58% between the ages of 50 and 64 [2].

Lets say company B is half equity value and half debt ($50 and $50).  Lets also say the company is paying 4% on its debt.

And so it would seem that at the hypothetical interface between the Ferengi and the Federation there would be not just a huge culture clash, but moral and political scandals of the highest order, mostly concentrated around (1) the exploitation of Federation members by Ferengi (2) incidental macroeconomic chaos within Ferengi society due to the Federation sending free aid, setting artificial price restrictions within their markets, etc.<p>If one redesigned the Ferengi with a non-goofy appearance and a cool demeanor they could be made relatable, in the same way that one can relate to the various capitalist villain archetypes: wall street narcissists, oil tycoons, drug kingpins and so on.",1446503249

Basically, a big company called Internet Brands bought Jelsoft, the makers of vBulletin.  They pretty much said they wanted vBulletin 4 out stat, even if it meant outsourcing a significant amount of development.<p>The old Jelsoft team then left to start XenForo.  vBulletin 5 came out (with half the staff being new and the price being ramped up significantly), and the negative feedback basically overwhelmed the official site for a few months.  People left en masse to XenForo.<p>Internet Brands then sued XenForo for &#x27;stolen code&#x27;, which ended up costing everyone a lot of money and dragged on for a few years before the case was dropped.<p>They then released vBulletin 5.  Reception was... negative.  To put it lightly. Features were missing, the style was half complete, bugs were everywhere.  People left even quicker.  Marketshare for this version is roughly at about 1%.<p>Either way, you&#x27;ve got a company in meltdown that had to get somewhat inexperienced programmers to take over both PHP 4 era legacy code and somewhat put together a new forum script at the same time.  Something was sure to break.<p>IPB released IPB 4, which cause a sizeable amount of discontent in that community, partly due to features that were removed because the staff thought they &#x27;weren&#x27;t necessary&#x27; any more.  Many people disagreed.<p>Digitalpoint moved to XenForo.<p>And the free scripts?  Well, there&#x27;s currently a bit of a divide between &#x27;old school&#x27; forum scripts and &#x27;modern&#x27; forum scripts.  On the one side, you have phpBB, MyBB, SMF, and their various forks and spinoffs.  On the other, there&#x27;s stuff like Discourse and NodeBB.  PhpBB got a bit ignored simply because it was seen as behind the times and not adding new stuff fast as.<p>(that said, big phpBB sites do exist, Gaia Online runs a modified version and quite a few others are out there too, especially for large open source projects).",1446502970

It has a whole chapter on creating service bundles, and lays out in detail the three-pronged approach to ports that nosh enables.  This is just a précis.<p>* run scripts are short and simple.  One can just write one for a port.  It can be a shell script, a perl script, a python program, an execline script, a nosh script, or something else.<p>* You&#x27;ll find that ports are growing systemd unit files.  Indeed, they not only are but <i>have been</i>.  The writing has been on the wall about this development for some years, now, and it&#x27;s well into actually happening.  The nosh toolset includes a mechanism that can take the majority of such unit files and generate a native service bundle from them.<p>* One can just take the stuff that&#x27;s already out there and that&#x27;s already supplied.  Recently the 157 rc.d scripts part of the project has hit the Russian news.  That&#x27;s only part of the story, though.  Read the <i>nosh Guide</i>, and you&#x27;ll find pointers to four prominent collections of daemontools/runit scripts that have existed for years.  Look into the package itself, and you&#x27;ll find almost four hundred service bundles pre-made and supplied in the box.  Which of course feeds into the first approach: One can take an existing service bundle for a similar program and adapt it.",1446502687

When you&#x27;re doing 10k angel rounds, you spread the money around and hope one of the companies take off. When you&#x27;re investing tens of millions of dollars at nine and ten figure valuations, you do so more conservatively in a way that is more likely to guarantee a return. They&#x27;re not saying they don&#x27;t believe in the companies at this point - in fact, you can almost argue that they&#x27;re saying these late-stage companies are definitely good for the money - but more so that the companies at this point are less likely to make astronomical gains.",1446502556
10495743,comment,10495402,10495610,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Secrecy actually makes it <i>more</i> likely that terms reflect correct valuations, as long as each of the firms have independent decision making power and see a wide variety of deals.  See eg. The Wisdom of Crowds, which found that a group makes better decisions than an individual iff each individual relies on their own data and comes to their own decision.  If one individual unduly influences others&#x27; decision-making (eg. the &quot;YC stamp of approval&quot; which inflates valuations at demo day), then you get information cascades that can lead to exaggerated boom/bust cycles.  If the parties left in the dark lack decision-making ability and independent information channels (eg. Theranos), you get information asymmetry and a market for lemons.  But a market where each firm sees a continuous stream of deals and independently decides on each one without any regard for its competitors is pretty much the definition of a competitive market, which implies prices should converge toward accuracy very quickly.  I&#x27;d argue that that&#x27;s much closer to the situation now than it was in 2000.",1446502551

What changes is the number of people with fingers in the pie. Certainly the production values of Daredevil were as good as anything on TV at the time. The combination of better CGI (lowering location costs and the costs of set dressing) and streamlining the number of people who want to make a nickel, changes the game with respect to getting new shows on to the viewer&#x27;s screen.",1446501670

As if the in vogue trend towards increasingly revolting ways in which we Americans comport ourselves, facial hair and otherwise, is not dismal enough, we have smoked ourselves so stupid to not even be ashamed of a piece like this. For an at least somewhat literate adult, to take even a few minutes to research that war and be left still so unaffected they could follow through with a bad late night party joke is nauseating.<p>When there is nothing left of your culture, know you are responsible. How funny do you think it would be to live in a world with no genuine scholarly journals? This whole &quot;post-human dignity&quot; generational trend is sickening. Mocking literacy itself.
