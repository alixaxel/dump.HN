I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d have noticed without that.<p>In vertical orientation, viewport width is better, and an annoying glitch where font size changed apparently randomly on some nested comments is gone.<p>Overall UI/UX of links and controlls needs improvement. Especially voting arrows. I&#x27;m told an undo is in the works.<p>My view is that HN&#x27;s basic page layout needs a full revamp at least internally, to give better styling control via CSS. This doesn&#x27;t mean huge theme changes, though that&#x27;s also possible.<p>Building the page around a sane line length would be a really good start.<p>What issues are the result of braindead mobile browsers (lack of ctrl-+ font zoom, click registration errors, left/right click distinction, click vs select, etc.) I don&#x27;t know, though I suspect that&#x27;s part of it.",1446458364

It is cross-platform: Windows, Mac, mobile - not Linux though. A very nice interface and the basic version is free. The Pro license brings you cloud storage and syncing.<p>Citavi (www.citavi.com) is probably the ultimate desktop software for managing scientific literature. Apart from organizing your library, annotating PDFs and writing notes, it also has plenty of tools to help you write your own articles. Unfortunately, it only runs on Windows and comes with a hefty price tag (though many institutions have a site license - check if you are eligible).<p>Mendeley (www.mendeley.com) might be the best choice for you. Like ReadCube, it concentrates mainly on library management and paper annotation. However, it also provides plugins for browsers and word processors that add some neat functionality (such as automatic citation insertion for LibreOffice). It is multiplatform (Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile) and free. Syncing is included in the basic free plan, the premium plan gives you more storage space and teamworking functions.<p>Sadly, none of the above is open source, and only Mendeley works on Linux.

My trade certificate actually says &quot;Engineering Tradesperson&quot;. I operate a laser cutter, and have written scripts to automate some of my computer related tasks, and have a rudimentary understanding of Python. I&#x27;ve also worked at an ISP in NetOps doing physical security and infrastructure.<p>I live in Australia so I can only speak for the system we have here: trade school is <i>formal education</i>, the on-campus component of trade education is delivered throughout the nation by TAFE[1] campuses. We are formally educated to build things that don&#x27;t kill people, and can certainly be held responsible if our actions or omission of action leads to injury. We are expected to escalate anything we see on workshop drawings that could be problematic. Each of the tradesmen in our workshops are required to perform a weld test every six months, which is examined using ultrasound techniques, to ensure our work meets or exceeds AS1554[2]<p>While us tradespeople aren&#x27;t the ones engineering the bridges, we are the ones building them.<p>Comparatively, the software development discipline is still in it&#x27;s infancy, whereas the construction trades have been around for millennia. Structural Engineers and tradespeople build physical structures to withstand Category 5 cyclones, but my bank (in the top 10 globally by market cap) can hardly have a month go by where some software system doesn&#x27;t fail.<p>The advent of bootcamps is probably a side effect of &#x27;coding&#x27; becoming relatively easy compared to it&#x27;s more esoteric history, with the advent of high-level languages like Python and Ruby. Or maybe that stuff about the average IQ increasing over time is correct, and more people have the capacity to understand writing code. Probably both.<p>Another comment here spoke about TDD - Test Driven Development, that&#x27;s probably closer to the physical engineering disciplines with destructive testing of random batches of building materials.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_and_further_education"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_and_further_educatio...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/PreviewDoc.aspx?saleItemID=2247480"" rel=""nofollow"">https://infostore.saiglobal.com/store/PreviewDoc.aspx?saleIt...</a>",1446457476

Use newly designed interface elements for groups that, inside of them, shows the latest 4 to 6 products last posted in that group.  In other words, you will basically see a large square, representing a group, with a bunch of small squares inside of it (representing the latest products in it).  This will get rid of the spammy look and also emphasize the fact that the elements on the home page are actually groups of products.<p>2. Modify the header section to explain what the site does and what is unique about it.<p>I will be working on these items tomorrow and should have them completed by the end of the day.<p>Thank you for taking the time to provide your very constructive feedback.",1446457237

We&#x27;re growing at a dizzying pace. I&#x27;m dizzy just thinking about it. All open jobs: <a href=""https://www.stitchfix.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stitchfix.com/careers</a>)<p>We&#x27;re solving some REALLY interesting problems. I just joined as Principal Engineer and I&#x27;m loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms & machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women&#x27;s Fashion e-commerce / subscription service. In english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag &quot;#stitchfix&quot; and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month&#x27;s &quot;Fix&#x27;. Our customer referral to friend statistic is off the charts.<p>On the business side, it&#x27;s a startup but we&#x27;re profitable and we&#x27;re not planning on seeking additional funding. Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success.\nOn the Engineering side, we&#x27;re solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I&#x27;m responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. When people hear this sometimes they ask &quot;so what the engineers just sit around and invent features?&quot;...well its not like that. What Product Managers do is talk to all the business stakeholders, customers, consult the A/B testing results, take UX design input into account and then try to put that all together. Of course there is still one key business stakeholder that makes the high level calls, but there is a lot of Product Management type work that happens between that decision that typically falls on a product manager and here it falls on the Principal engineer.<p>There is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics) They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer satisfaction.\nDon&#x27;t let the industry (Womens Fashion) put you off. The smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider it. The engineers I&#x27;m working with really care about the craft of Software Engineering and this is a great environment for anyone that feels the same.<p>Check out our engineering and algorithms web site: <a href=""http://technology.stitchfix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technology.stitchfix.com/</a> and here is our jobs page <a href=""https://www.stitchfix.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stitchfix.com/careers</a>.<p>To reach the hiring managers and recruiting team directly, email tech-jobs (at) stitchfix (dot) com (its not a black hole - it actually goes to the right people.)

Both in performance and simplicity.<p>It&#x27;s possible to manage a ringbuffer without any locks.  The trick is to have a counter for the producer thread, and a counter for each consumer thread.  Whenever the producer wants to know &quot;Is it safe to add a message?&quot; it takes the minimum of all consumer counters, modulo the size of the ringbuffer.  The result is the smallest index that the producer must not write beyond.<p>In other words, you always know when you&#x27;re producing messages too quickly and need to wait on the consumers.  And the consumers know when there&#x27;s a message waiting -- they just look at the producer&#x27;s counter.  Blazingly fast, and no locks.  Cool trick!",1446455518
