If &#x27;normal&#x27; plays have a tendency towards a 10/20/30 yard line, what about plays where the ball placement is challenged? Don&#x27;t know if your dataset has this, but under your framework, we&#x27;d expect to see a more even distribution of placements because of increased attention, though probably still with spikes at the 1 yard line and goalline.\n2. Even though it&#x27;s probably intuitive, the unimodal distribution of ball placements was cool to see.",1446674362

You kind of waved off my concerns and didn&#x27;t really ask a question. So I am concerned that replying is a mistake. But I seem to be damned no matter what I do when it comes to topics like this. I mean, why did you reply? The manner in which you replied seems pretty dismissive, given that I closed with a statement that I have a condition where transplants are common.<p>But assuming you answered in good faith and just honestly don&#x27;t see how bad your reply could sound to me, here is what disturbs me:<p>If you have certain conditions, doctors don&#x27;t really try to help you maintain better health. They chalk up bad outcomes to your official diagnosis and kind of wash their hands of trying harder. Then heroic interventions, like transplants, get all kinds of glowing press.<p>When you get listed for transplant, you basically sit around waiting for someone relatively young and healthy to die tragically in an accident so you can have a second shot at life. I can&#x27;t imagine the toll that takes on your psyche.<p>That isn&#x27;t a criticism of patients who accept the only option they are really being offered. But I think we can do better than that, and real quality of life is being given short shrift as medical professionals zealously pursue the &quot;Ooh, shiny!&quot; options that will get them impressive headlines. I also understand the pressures on them which lead to that, but it is the patients who suffer horribly because of it.<p>It just makes me think something is very, very broken.

Faster startup time for new builds. Running kati and then ninja \n  results in builds starting about 25% faster than GNU make. \n  2. Much faster incremental builds. kati caches the mtimes of files \n  and directories it read, what environment variables it used, etc., and \n  only re-reads all the makefiles if something has changed. This \n  includes globs like $(call all-files-under). Incremental builds with \n  a warm disk cache will start within 5 seconds. \n  3. Better build command output. Ninja buffers the output of each \n  command and prints it without mixing output from multiple commands, \n  meaning error messages will be printed as a group after a build \n  failure, and not mixed with other concurrent build output. Ninja also \n  prints a configurable status line that defaults to printing the \n  percentage of build commands that have been run, the number that have \n  been run, and the number that need to run, giving a reasonable \n  approximation of the progress through the build. \n  4. Incremental builds should be more reliable. Ninja considers \n  outputs whose command line has changed to be dirty, which will catch \n  changes to global cflags, etc. and rebuild anything that has changed. \n  \n  The use of ninja should be transparent, it is wrapped by the top level \n  Makefile, so all make-based commands should continue to work. \n  \n  These changes are a precursor to a much larger change that will \n  replace all the Android.mk files with data files using a format that \n  provides much better error checking, even faster builds, and 100% \n  reliable incremental builds.</code></pre>",1446674187

But if it fails by, say, dumping all your blood into your chest cavity, then adding redundant hearts increases your chance of death, rather than decreasing it.<p>Since you mentioned airplanes, making sure redundancy reduces rather than increasing risk is a big issue. For example, single-engine airplanes are prone to crashes due to engine failure. The solution is to add a second engine and you&#x27;re much safer, right? Except that twin-engine planes can be very challenging to fly with a dead engine, and if you&#x27;re not very careful with design and training, you&#x27;ll end up with an airplane with two engines that crashes if <i>either</i> engine fails, greatly increasing the probability of a failure rather than decreasing it.",1446674056

There&#x27;s really not a significant difference between the cops wandering through a residential neighborhood, looking into houses from the street, and if they see anything through the windows that looks attractive to thieves, checking if the any exterior doors or windows are unlocked, and, if they are, entering the house, taking the item, and the calling the property owner listed on the deed (who may or may not be the current <i>occupant</i> of the real property, or the owner of the item of personal property removed; similar issues exist in the case of autos) to let them know that if they want to recover the confiscated property, they need to turn up at the police station during limited hours and present ID, and if they don&#x27;t do so soon enough, the property will be sold and the proceeds pocketed by the government.<p>> I also think the notion that this is all a front for probable cause is a bit far-fetched and cynical. For one, do only criminals leave their cars unlocked with valuables in plain sight? What exactly would the &quot;cover for probable cause&quot; strategy accomplish?<p>Its not so much a cover as a substitute. Since under this policy they can enter the car to &quot;confiscate&quot; easily stolen items, they no longer need the probable cause they would need for a search, but this gives them an excuse for entering the car and conveniently &quot;noticing&quot; items that would not be apparent without entering the car, or for seizing and inspecting items that they would not have had probable cause to enter the car to inspect closely.",1446672910

Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m old and rural, but I&#x27;d prefer to live in a society where the societal convention is that &quot;theft is wrong&quot; regardless of whether it requires breaking a window, rather than implying that the victim is to blame for failing to to push a button to properly signify their desire that their belongings not be stolen.<p>What are the limits to this approach?  Should the police break the window and empty the glove compartment, on the theory that windows are easy to break and one shouldn&#x27;t keep anything valuable in the car? Should the police try out their bump-keys on empty houses, and pro-actively remove the valuables from the 90+% of houses where these work?  Should they &quot;kidnap&quot; the kindergartner who is in public without chaperones so that no one else does?<p>Or should they figure out ways to punish those who break the law rather than those who are obeying it?",1446672606

(Linus, as an example, has a strict rule about not breaking userland applications due to kernel changes.)<p>It&#x27;s impractical (and undesirable from a security and other standpoint) to statically link all dependencies into every binary simply to &quot;simplify&quot; packaging.  Not only would that be a waste of storage space and memory, but it prevents fixes (security or otherwise) applied to the libraries used by the application from taking effect without patching everything that statically-linked it.<p>Even if you ignore the storage space issue with some amount of hand-waving, larger binaries means greater I/O and network bandwidth requirements, which means it takes longer to update systems or create images for deployment.  That in turn leads to increased downtime or increased sustaining costs, which effectively leads to reduced availability of the system.<p>This can be mitigated somewhat by using difference-only-style update mechanisms, but it only partially mitigates the issues created by statically-linked binaries; it does not eliminate them.<p>Dynamically-linking dependencies also ensures that future performance and security updates don&#x27;t require a rebuild of existing applications; you can simply update the dependency, and if done properly, every application linked to it will automatically receive the benefits.<p>Obviously, if a given dependency is only ever used by a single component, and the component is always rebuilt when the dependencies are, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re statically-linked.
