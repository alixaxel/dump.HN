One day I was trying to look something up and got a pop-over to confirm my account info. I clicked through and went on with my day. A few weeks later I received notice that my account was deleted. I contacted them and was informed I was too young to use the site and there was no chance of account recovery (I was a few years over 18 at the time). All of my reviews were gone. Emailed them, no chance of getting those back, though I was welcome to create a new account.<p>So, they managed to disappear all the reviews I left. They did it on a technicality and it was well within their terms of service. However, I view this as vote manipulation. They&#x27;re pushing really hard now to say they don&#x27;t do that. They burned me once though and now I actively avoid the service.",1448909962

They will simply resign.<p>It so quite possible the long term productivity will be better with the mediocre programmers team regardless of their tooling.<p>If you have a team of great programmers you also need to give them the possibility to do some interresting stuff.<p>And that&#x27;s basically that, when the great programmer will come and ask to change tooling or improve you&#x27;ll refuse. They&#x27;ll understand you prevent them to do anything efficiantly and so they&#x27;ll resign as they waste their time here.<p>But even with great tools at their disposal, a mediocre team of programmer will perform averagely.<p>Because you don&#x27;t just need to have the tool lying around, you have to know how to use it, what is good, what is bad, when to do this or that. if there not somebody behind them to coatch them all the time, they will not leverage it.<p>When for example a person learn design patterns, they want to use them all the time.<p>The great developper know the patterns, understood the key concepts behind and know when to use and not use them.<p>As for the language it is more crutial than you think. It is basically the shared basic knowledge and discussion medium in your company. And your APis are also part of it. If you have high level concepts coming from both your API and programming language and your developper know them they&#x27;ll think directly in theses high level concepts and will be able to ignore the irelevant details.<p>What make Java more efficiant mostly is that you can forget to think about freeing memory and it is almost impossible to get a core dump. Instead of having to learn and speak the concepts of allocating and freeing memory your developpers will be able to concentrate on other things.<p>And what make C more efficiant than assembly is that you can actually write easily functions, that you can define structures and that the compiler take care to compute the proper shift in memory to access the differents field and so on.<p>But java, especially before version 8 is lacking key concepts like basic functionnal programming. So when a developper want to filter a collection, a pretty common operation, he will just iterate, check the condition of the filtering and return a filtered collection. It will be very specific and the level of expressivity of this code will be quite low.<p>A great developper would at leas isolate that code into a function with meaningfull name or define a generic filter function and pass predicate as anonymous functions. But the lack of proper lambda expression will prevent to fully leverage it.<p>But once everybody is accustomed to functionnal programming they&#x27;ll just use filter and a predicate. The intent is much more clear, almost self documenting.<p>The more expressive you can be, the more common knowledge you can have, and the more you can concentrate on issue key to your program and the less you can spend time on unecessary details, the more productivity you get.<p>And yes, this start with a good programming language with a good echosystem and a team that efficiant with it.<p>That&#x27;s why Java or C/C++ are so often used: they are the easiest languages when you need to hire because more people know them.

The US is massively solvent in fact. Furthering this point, the US is now growing as fast as China in real terms (given pretty much every credible study indicates China is at least lying about half of their growth); the US is also gaining substantially against most of Europe, as its economy continues to grow faster than Europe even with a stronger dollar.

The plugins include the ability for the ES2015 module loader to directly load AMD and CommonJS modules, thus none of the legacy AMD is technically lost and you also don&#x27;t necessarily need something like Browserify/Webpack in a build process or Node-style modules (CommonJS). JSPM is a package manager for SystemJS and for the most part it can be fairly straightforward to move from Bower to JSPM.<p>With regards to Typescript: I don&#x27;t think it is a &quot;dead end&quot; and I definitely think you are wrong about the future of it. Typescript has been relatively careful at keeping &quot;an eye to the horizon&quot; and having some idea of the &quot;forward compatibility&quot; of its features. For instance, the module format in Typescript was built before the ES2015 standard finalized, but the final standard was surprisingly close to what Typescript used and nothing necessarily required being rewritten and it was very easy to clean up the old style incrementally if you did feel like being particular about using the final ES2015 syntax. I feel like the same can be said about Typescript&#x27;s type annotations. They are definitely informed by ES4 (&quot;the lost version&quot;, what forked into ActionScript, sort of) and in turn, yes, the Typescript team is certainly influencing the standards to possibly add type annotations to the EcmaScript standards (&quot;this time for real&quot;), or at least a Python 3-like approach where type annotations are safely ignored by browsers when left in the code.<p>At the very least, if ES standardized type annotations are suitably different from Typescript there will presumably be a Typescript transpiled output to it (just as the old Typescript module imports get output correctly when targeting ES2015), and you can even use that output to bootstrap your conversion to the new syntax (thanks to Typescripts attempt to remain a pure superset of ES).",1448909642

Of course, with sufficiently lqrge and complex data stores, you&#x27;ll want a documented structure and method for accessing that data no matter what format you use, but unlike XML, JSON provides structure to get started on a small scale very easily.\n Consider this python:<p><pre><code>    import json\n    import sys\n    sys.stdout.write(&quot;%s\n&quot; % json.dumps(json.load(sys.stdin).get(sys.argv[1], None)))\n</code></pre>\nThis will accept JSON on standard input and will return the value of an object with the key name specified by the first command-line argument.<p><pre><code>    $ echo &#x27;{ &quot;value1&quot; : { &quot;sub-value&quot;: 5 }, &quot;value2&quot;: 99 }&#x27; | python json-test.py value1\n    {&quot;sub-value&quot;: 5}\n    $ echo &#x27;{ &quot;value1&quot; : { &quot;sub-value&quot;: 5 }, &quot;value2&quot;: 99 }&#x27; | python json-test.py value2\n    99\n</code></pre>\nSuch a program will look similar in any language with a json library that maps objects and arrays to native data structures.

10650980,comment,10648831,10650188,0,0,fmap,,,"Ok, there are a number of points you can make comparing set theory and type theory... but the most important point here is that it is a false dichotomy! From a logical point of view &quot;type theory&quot; is a particular formalism for describing logical frameworks. ZFC is the &quot;type theory&quot; of first-order predicate logic plus a few axioms which add a type of sets, a predicate for set membership and assert certain properties of set membership. You can add function types to ZFC and you do obtain a strictly stronger system (Higher-Order ZFC). The main practical advantage is that you do not need to encode your problem into first-order logic.<p>For instance, in higher-order set theory a (very strong) form of the axiom of choice asserts that there is a function &quot;epsilon : set -> set&quot;, such that &quot;epsilon x \in x&quot; for x not empty. Expressing the same in first-order ZFC turns the whole statement on its head since you need to encode this function somehow. This leads to (almost) equivalent but misleading statements, such as &quot;the intersection of a set all of whose inhabitants are non-empty is non-empty&quot;. Now if you look into TLA+, you will find that this choice operator epsilon has been added to the language, because it is so useful in practice! And this is just one instance of something that &quot;type-theory&quot; can add over classical ZFC. More to the point, higher-order specifications are crucial for the verification of higher-order programs. Higher-order programs are in turn one of the most useful tools for writing modular code.<p>Sorry for the nitpicking; let me get back on topic.<p>The main advantage of Martin-Löf style type theory is that it makes it easy to build new abstractions. For instance, the Bedrock project (<a href=""http://plv.csail.mit.edu/bedrock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plv.csail.mit.edu/bedrock/</a>) builds an extensible program verification environment within Coq. This is only possible because the underlying logic is so expressive that you can build internal models for whichever pet logic you want to reason in. From a practical point of view dependent types and the conversion rule - computations in proofs - allows you to build scalable (reflective) proof automation while retaining a small trusted base.<p>The constructive aspect of Martin-Löf type theory is very pleasing from a philosophical point of view, but again in practice it&#x27;s not the most relevant aspect. The main reason for me to use something other than classical logic is that there are more models of intuitionistic logic than of classical logic. This gives you more freedom in designing a logic which makes it easy to reason about your particular problem domain. For instance, if you work with Cyberphysical systems, you might like to work within the framework of synthetic differential geometry where all functions are smooth and the real numbers are as simple as they can ever be.<p>What so many people seem to be ignoring is that the logic you use for reasoning is part of your design space. Saying &quot;I&#x27;ll just use ZFC&quot; is exactly the same as a programmer exclaiming &quot;I&#x27;ll just use COBOL&quot;.\nLeslie Lamport designed TLA+ to make it easy to reason about distributed systems. There may well be a nicer logic for reasoning about distributed systems, but you will probably not find it among the models of classical ZFC, since there aren&#x27;t really that many of them...<p>On the other hand, there are many different flavors of type theory, just waiting to be discovered. And in my view that&#x27;s the main advantage of looking beyond set theory.",1448909594

While it&#x27;s true that P6 draws inspiration from a variety of languages and techniques, from Smalltalk through Reactive Extensions and more, a laundry list of features is not necessarily the best reason to adopt a language -- especially one with a small ecosystem.<p>Instead, I think that P6 is worth looking at because of the &quot;feel&quot; of the language, or perhaps another way to put it is the way that all the pieces fit together. I found it easy to do the following in Perl 6:<p>1. Quickly write a small proof of concept program<p>2. Heavily use concurrent and asynchronous code in a way that &quot;just works&quot;<p>3. Fluidly mix imperative, functional reactive, and object oriented code<p>4. Add types for safe refactoring / further development<p>Even though Perl 6 still abides by TIMTOWTDI (There Is More Than One Way To Do It) there was &quot;something&quot; that gave a consistency to all of the above. Or perhaps, nothing felt bolted on, which is perhaps a luxury of essentially starting from scratch. :)<p>Perl 6 is not only fun to write, but also easy to read (once you of course learn the syntax, which is quite different coming from not-perl). My hope is that the ease of using its OO features and type system will help avoid the &quot;hash-of-who-knows-what&quot; problem.<p>Lately the two languages I most enjoy using are Perl 6 and Go, which would appear to be almost total opposites!

Python3 made the  language more consistent, made a lot of little things simpler and easier, and added several features that makes using it generally more straightforward than Python2.  It&#x27;s essentially the same language, with warts removed. Library support lagged a bit, so on the odd occasion I need an old library, I just use Python2.  Both versions can coexist on the same system, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>More relevant, though, Python3 was announced and then released when they said it would be.  Some parts of the library community dragged their feet with support, and in a lot of cases they were replaced with even better libraries.  The important thing is that the language was out and people could use it, and everybody&#x27;s on the same page that Python3 is the future of Python.<p>The Perl transition has been a total mess in comparison.  Perl6 is not just removing the warts from Perl5, it&#x27;s an entirely different language.  It&#x27;s been &quot;right around the corner&quot; for almost 15 years now, and as far as I can tell, still isn&#x27;t released.  And good luck porting 25k CPAN modules to a completely new language.<p>To put it another way, in 15 years Perl6 has gone from announced to still not existing, while in 8 years Python3 was announced, released, and has had vast parts of its library ecosystem have been ported.

There, employees are encouraged to be brutal in their criticism, a policy called “radical honesty.”  In one meeting, the criticism got so harsh that somebody started to cry.  The conversation was taped, and an executive decided it would be a good idea to send the taped conversation, tears and all, out to the whole company to listen to.  He thought people could learn a lot from the incident.  My friend who worked there learned he wanted to get a job at a company with a different kind of culture.<p>The intentions here were probably not as bad as the results.  The leaders at the company wanted everyone to say what they really thought.  The idea of radical honesty is really appealing to me.  But, I saw two big problems with this approach to encouraging criticism.  The obvious one was encouraging public rather than private criticism.  Public debate and disagreement, yes. Public criticism, no.  This mistake was compounded--criticism wasn’t just public, it was  publicized in a way that humiliated an employee.  The less obvious mistake was that the policy of “radical honesty” inadvertently sowed the seeds of arrogance, not humility.  Why?  If honesty is good, surely radical honesty is better.  Interestingly, it was the words of a Jesuit missionary in the Congo who best explained the problem with honesty to me.  “It’s very important to tell the truth,” he said, and then looked heavenward.  “But who knows what the Truth is???”  When somebody says, “I’m going to be honest with you,” it implies they know the truth and you don’t.  There’s not a lot of humility in that.<p>This is why I use the term “candor.”  “Honesty” can lead to arrogance.",1448907780

10650735,comment,10646491,10646491,0,0,grandalf,,,"What is candor? Speaking one&#x27;s mind?  Revealing one&#x27;s deepest thoughts? Mentioning things that you know some people won&#x27;t want to hear?<p>When we think of candor we imagine a straight-talking cowboy type, or a brash New Yorker, or a direct and confident woman, etc.  These images make us feel that if only we could tell it like it is all the BS would go away.<p>What candor really means is being unguarded.  Think candid camera.  We are candid when we make no pretense and avoid posturing, when we keep it real. This means we don&#x27;t tailor our perspective and behavior to get a specific result or to seem impressive, we just do our own thing, like the victims of candid camera videos.<p>Real candor requires trust. Where organizations have major trust lapses is where candor seems the most lacking.<p>If a project is behind schedule, the organization should simply respond appropriately, which means either changing scope or changing the timeline. When there is finger pointing and pressure to lowball estimates, there is a trust breakdown from the outset.<p>If there is sufficient trust, there is no issue with candor because you just say what you want and everyone knows you are trying to make things better.  When trust breaks down, your words might seem critical or like personal attacks.<p>So having radical candor is great, but it means having radical trust.  It must be safe to be on either end of the candor event :)  That includes cases when a team member is not able to perform or when a team member wants a promotion that he/she isn&#x27;t quite ready for.  It must be OK to be honest in either direction, which means the firm should respect it if the employee wishes to leave, and the employee should respect it if the firm isn&#x27;t happy with performance and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a path to improvement.<p>All in all, having a systems mindset and a growth mindset goes a long way toward having a high trust culture.  But startups are at a disadvantage from the start since everyone is expecting a massive growth trajectory and in many cases founders are quick to blame mistakes on specific individuals to explain a bad quarter.  Having a culture of trust requires the team taking it on the chin and the board supporting and encouraging a systems approach.<p>So if your founder is the only one in board meetings, chances are that is because blame is being cast and deception is occurring on in both directions.",1448906809

What you might not know is that the people they are mainly concerned about is themselves. It is very hard to corrupt, defraud, steal and cheat on a project that is just about technology. So they have to make it about something else, something that transcends technology so that they don&#x27;t have to accountable by any metric.<p>All of this, am sure, may sound a bit harsh for people who are unaware of the inner workings of foundations behind their political, marketing façade.
