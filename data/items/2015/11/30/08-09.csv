Not that they&#x27;re running completely in js disabled mode.  Even though it&#x27;s a subtle difference I think it&#x27;s relevant to the strategy one goes in with regarding noscript tag.<p>So this would make sense to me.  If that&#x27;s right, that most noscript users are just running these plugins, then those folks know that they&#x27;re going to miss out with some sites, or they&#x27;ll selectively enable javascript on a case-by-case basis.<p>This would probably require more extensive review of logs, to see if the person who originally downloaded the noscript image eventually came back to the site with javascript enabled.

They are a company which builds much of their image on issues such as integrity and privacy, and that image is what got me to choose them over other options which were slightly(!) more expensive. So, all the sudden you have a company that gets a lot of appreciation from the public, and it&#x27;s not like they are spending more money on their infrastructure just because they do everything they can to avoid tapping their customers&#x27; traffic.<p>This seems like a no-brainer decision, which is why I find it hard to understand why it&#x27;s not like this everywhere.",1448873273

I find it saddening that the &#x27;health&#x27; of the web has deteriorated to a point where it&#x27;s arguably uncompetitive for a vast number of modern applications including information discovery. I find it troubling that information discovery is moving away from the open web into non-neutral native application environments such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. Sure, information discovery on the web was driven by search engines. But I think search engines are really just part and parcel of the web (and arguably a feature that ought to have been built into web browsers from the beginning). A search engine doesn&#x27;t express bias towards any information source (at least not by principle).<p>What troubles me is imagining a future where a vast majority of information that we consume is selected and curated by commercially driven, black box, non-neutral platforms.<p>I read an article recently about how Google is experimenting with removing the need to download apps by &#x27;streaming&#x27; app content through a search box. Presumably, this is how Google search stays relevant in the post-web era where more and more information flows through walled gardens installed on mobile devices. Now, instead of re-inventing the web, shouldn&#x27;t we be working towards &#x27;fixing&#x27; the one that exists?

We ignored this warning.&quot;<p>This was the mistake (and strongly reminiscent of the mistake they made with sweetch) they ignored the people who set rules for their business. Overcoming the incumbent competitors is a challenge because they&#x27;ve existed for quite some time, a less idealistic (more mature?) businessman could&#x27;ve identified this and started conversations with the appropriate people in power before they were forced to seek their assistance as an unknown.<p>If things operated like they were supposed to, Vatler would&#x27;ve stood a chance, in most cities there is a complex web of politics to navigate and these guys ignored that twice. Airbnb has gotten by because it&#x27;s impossible for hoteliers to identify the residences that are taking their business, valets are on the street and labeled so they have to address the issue much sooner.<p>These guys are super talented and I want them to succeed but I hope they finally learnt their lesson about getting ahead of the politics, otherwise their next business will end the same way as the last two.",1448872163

10648348,comment,10644539,10644539,0,0,maximgsaini,,,"Disclaimer: We run a Heldesk software, Busibud.com which maps out a company&#x27;s customer support process and helps them outsource only the mapped out part. The helpdesk software is free to use.<p>I&#x27;ve been helping companies setup their customer support processes for some time now. Initially, founders/core team members must do customer support on their own. This should happen till your team has some visibility of the process (what kind of questions you get and how to reply to them).<p>------- What are the ways to handle customer support?<p>You can do it synchronously (chat or phone call) or asynchronously (email). Usually, async customer support requires lesser money/time because things can be structured. But, before you have some visibility of the process and are still finding p/m fit, I would suggest you talk to people.<p>------ Outsource vs do it yourself?<p>Before you know your process, do it yourself. No one can decide how things can be answered. Once the process has been mapped out, a lot of the startups I know of ask every team member to pitch in for customer support. This may lead to better quality but leads to huge costs as well. I&#x27;ve seen salesmen spending 1-2 hours everyday on customer support answering what they call &quot;dumb questions&quot;. You can outsource it as well, which comes with problems of its own. For starters, it will be very hard to find an outsourcing partner who will be ready to deal with extremely small volumes.<p>Even if you do manage to outsource, your process will now be managed by someone else. Ad-Hoc changes become difficult to communicate and the people giving out support for you will also be giving out support for other companies....hence leading to quality issues. Unfortunately, most outsourcing companies still rely primarily on training to ensure quality. They don&#x27;t use the technology they should be using. Thus, quality will depend on the infrastructure of the outsourcing partner (training managers, quality managers, etc).<p>Once you reach a decent size, hiring people and creating your own customer support team is an option but is usually more expensive (HR/payroll/training/infrastructure). But, it also leads to better quality. Do remember that customer support teams have a huge turnover rate...people keep going and coming in. Thus, training and quality monitoring costs can be huge!!<p>------ What is the average time to resolve queries?<p>I&#x27;ve seen a first response time of 5 minutes and also first response times of a few days. Don&#x27;t know what the average is but depends on a lot of factors. The one doing it in 5 minutes usually has happier customers.<p>------ How much budget do you allocate for CS?<p>This is a tricky question. Even huge companies have a problem with this. The amount of budget to be allocated would depend on a lot of factors. What I would suggest is that your get started with a particular level of resolution time (which would determine your budget) and then try to optimize it using a series of A/B tests with retention/return being the metric being monitored (the metric too can depend on a lot of factors). Once you use these metrics, you would have a better idea of how much budget you should allocate. I might be wrong, but Busibud.com is perhaps the only customer support tool that I know of that lets you A/B test customer support strategies.",1448871039

10648332,comment,10642458,10647240,0,0,ars,,,"> That means the gamma factor is now (to a very good approximation) 500 (rest mass 2M times gamma of 500 times v approximately 1 gives momentum 1000M), which still corresponds to an ultrarelativistic velocity.<p>OK, I see your point. At those speeds a tremendous reduction in speed-energy (AKA relativistic mass) is only a small reduction in speed.<p>> the faster the hole is traveling, the lower the cross section will be.<p>At these masses gravitational attraction (that could pull in matter if given some time) is basically nil. I am assuming direct front-end collisions between the black hole and matter, so the speed doesn&#x27;t make much difference.<p>Although thinking about it, I suspect the cross section (event horizon radius) of a proton massed black hole would be smaller than a neutrino.",1448870616
