The unloading/loading of luggage, refueling, and restocking is what takes the most time. If you took the Mythbusters solution and boarded everyone as quickly and efficiently as possible, you would still be waiting around on the tarmac for another 15+ minutes for the plane to be ready for take-off. In fact, I believe that&#x27;s why they <i>don&#x27;t</i> use the most optimal board algorithm, because while you&#x27;re attempting to board the plain, you think that other passengers are the problem and not the airline. (citation needed)<p>So I&#x27;m not <i>super</i> clear on what, exactly, this solves in that regard. If there were modular fuel tanks and some sort of cannon that shot your luggage from check-in directly into the luggage compartment, maybe... :)",1448470795

Is the world so fundamentally unfair that we&#x27;re stuck without autonomy, doing tiresome tasks for corporations which don&#x27;t even offer us basic economic security in return? Much less the opportunity to improve that world?<p>There does seem to be an option, at least early on: Labor for those who respect neither their employees nor customers. Or find/create energetic work which can make us and our surroundings better. Either decision feeds on itself. The first path limits options, the second gives some chance for things being better.<p>But I don&#x27;t want this to be a blame-the-victim argument: that your father made a poor early career choice, and that Bret Victor chose wisely. But one element of Victor&#x27;s argument is that our career choices (if we have them) have consequences for the world as well as ourselves. If we can find work which is not cynical and destructive, it may make the world better, and even set a good example. If we struggle for work which is emotionally, financially, and creatively unrewarding, then we&#x27;re suggesting to others that that is the world, and they may find it easy to make similar choices.<p>The recent essay (by a presumably enfranchised techno-aristocrat) <a href=""https://medium.com/@ystrickler/resist-and-thrive-1d36819853ca"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@ystrickler/resist-and-thrive-1d36819853c...</a> covers a similar territory regarding career choices, also pre-supposing that we have some autonomy.

This includes 40,000 Daesh, 10,000 Boko Haram, the military wings of Hezbollah and Hamas, Maoist rebels and Hindu nationalists in India, Basque separatists, FARC in Colombia, neo-Nazis and other violent white supremacists, etc.<p>So the Bayesian prior is something like 5e5 / 7e9 = 0.00007. Even if 70% of terrorists are Islamic, with 1.6e9 Muslims, knowing someone is Muslim only changes the posterior to about 0.0002. Since there are many non-Islamic terrorists, this is probably overstated.<p>If the article is right that engineers are overrepresented among terrorists by a factor of nine, then law enforcement would be more justified in targeting engineers for investigation than they would be in targeting Muslims generally.<p>That&#x27;s obviously ridiculous. The posterior is so low for both engineers and Muslims that it would be a huge waste of time with an astronomical false-positive rate.<p>Just looking at the math shows that these broad generalizations are useless.",1448470475

10628040,comment,10621238,10621238,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"All of the current crop of research resulting from heterochronic parabiosis studies and telomerase studies are most likely just hitting different ways of ordering stem cells back to work. So you get increased tissue maintenance, and surprisingly less cancer than one might expect from putting damaged stem cells to work in damaged environments and damaged tissues.<p>The decline in stem cell activity is just one of the things that happens in aging, and it seems likely that this reduced activity is a response to various forms of cell and tissue damage. Researchers are now starting to identify some of the cellular cross-talk and signaling that mediates this reaction.<p>Putting stem cells back to work doesn&#x27;t deal with lipofuscin in long-lived cells. It doesn&#x27;t deal with glucosepane cross-links that our biochemistry cannot break down. It doesn&#x27;t reduce nuclear DNA damage and the accompanying cancer risk. It may be somewhat helpful for amyloid accumulation via increased immune activity, such as the beta amyloid in Alzheimer&#x27;s and transthyretin amyloid linked to heart failure, based on some studies. It doesn&#x27;t appear to do much for accumulations of senescent cells or mitochondrial DNA damage in cell population. It doesn&#x27;t reverse immune system dysregulation (inflammaging) all that much, though again there are some studies suggesting that cell transplants can suppress inflammation and this may be one of their modes of action.<p>So there are whole swathes of damage linked to age-related disease that this line of work doesn&#x27;t help. It should probably be thought of as a parallel line of stem cell research, with expected outcomes and development akin to that achieved through cell transplant therapies. It is good, helpful progress, but not the cure for aging on its own.<p>Separately, examining epigenetic changes in blood and tissues appears so far to be a plausible road to a robust biomarker of aging. Such a thing is very much needed in a field in which the only way to tell right now if a possible rejuvenation treatment works is to wait and see. That costs a lot, millions and years even in mouse studies, and so the pace at which new ideas can run through the system is pretty slow. A lot of things are just never tried or validated. If instead you could run a treatment on mice, then a month later run a blood test with a reasonable expectation that the results correlated well with remaining life expectancy, then a lot more can be done with any given amount of time and money.",1448470135

The app serves that function eloquently so what advantage does the website give them? Users aren&#x27;t discouraged from using their site, but what Instagram does not want is users to upload hundreds of images at once from the albums stored on their home computer. Not having the ability via the website helps to prevent that user. In addition, outside of uploading and altering images the website really is not missing any other functionality compared to the app.<p>Why have a website at all you ask? My response would be why not have a website? It&#x27;s a place for their business as a whole to have a web presence. Just because a product is mobile-centric, does not mean they can&#x27;t have a website. I think their website is perfect for the product. It is minimal, you can search for users, see what others are posting, participate in the comments, and like photos. The only piece I do wish they would allow you to do is see who is following you and who you are following. But to be honest, I rarely use the site at all. In fact the only time I will find myself using the site is if I am on Facebook on my laptop and want to share a photo from Instagram to my FB friends.

In the evening, before we get to bedtime stories (bedtime stories being a nice way to end the day), we have to persuade them all to bathe, use the toilet, clean their teeth, change into pajamas, get their clothes ready for the next day and then actually get into bed (the persuading part being a nice way to go crazy). My five-year-old can often be found sitting on his bed, fully dressed, claiming to have clean teeth.

10627909,comment,10620419,10620419,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> The difference between “access without authorization” and “exceed[ing] authorized access.”<p>I never really understood why this distinction is considered so contentious. The law itself defines &quot;exceeds authorized access&quot; as &quot;to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.&quot;<p>Which isn&#x27;t that helpful because it&#x27;s approximately what you would expect it to mean if it wasn&#x27;t defined. But I&#x27;m not sure where the ambiguity between &quot;access without authorization&quot; and &quot;exceeds authorized access&quot; is supposed to come in. The plain meaning is clearly that in one case you have no legitimate access (i.e. the system doesn&#x27;t allow anonymous access and you have no account) and in the other case you have some legitimate access but not to do what you did. Kerr makes the argument that it is possible for &quot;access without authorization&quot; to imply &quot;exceeds authorized access&quot;, but that is one place where the statutory definition is useful: The definition of &quot;exceeds authorized access&quot; first requires you &quot;to access a computer <i>with authorization</i>...&quot;<p>The real trouble with the CFAA is that it doesn&#x27;t make the scope of authorization clear in either event. The canonical way people know whether they&#x27;re authorized to do something to a computer system is that it allows them to do it. If you aren&#x27;t authorized then it comes back with &quot;access is denied&quot; and you can&#x27;t do it.<p>So the only way to break the law is to get the computer to do something it isn&#x27;t supposed to let you. But where is the definition of <i>that</i>? How are you supposed to know what the computer is supposed to do, if the normal way of knowing that is to look at what it actually does, and the only cases that matter are the ones where that doesn&#x27;t apply? There may be some obvious cases (e.g. logging in with someone else&#x27;s account), but by what rule or principle are these cases supposed to be distinguished from others?",1448468620

First, it&#x27;s mostly written as a series of dramatized scenes with dialogue that&#x27;s both phony and cheesy. Second, it&#x27;s mainly a book about marketing rather than any of the many things of that period that I&#x27;d find interesting. That&#x27;s just glossed over. Sure, there&#x27;s a few great stories you can tell about that. (The stunt they pulled to get Sega into Walmart was hilarious).

You&#x27;re trying to come up with a set of abstractions and rules for how those abstractions interact, with which you can intuit, without performing a full simulation, the answers to experimental questions. That is, your model should produce concrete predictions: if I prod the brain at A, B will happen; invisible effect C is correlated with visible effect D; nebulous phenomena E and F are well-defined instances of type G. A good model is more like a type system than a simulation; it gives you names and concepts that match (with some loss of fidelity) those used by reality. It lets you write valid programs (explanations) that match programs (physics) that are being executed by reality.<p>The report that a person had multiple personalities and some of them were blind, leads to the logical &#x27;program&#x27;:<p>Either<p>(this person has a brain structure that was so bizarre it isn&#x27;t related to the rest of the species&#x27; brains) [assume this is false]<p>Or<p>(it is possible for humans to contain multiple personalities which are not equally able to interact with sensory organs)<p>Therefore =><p>(it is possible for human brains to contain multiple personalities)<p>(sensory organs are wired into personalities)<p>(personalities can lose their wiring to sensory organs without physical damage to the organs)<p>That is, a single report cuts out a huge swathe of model-space. With a single example we are obliged to include in EVERY model concepts of personalities (or something, er, homomorphic to them), and a concept of a wiring to the sensory organs, and the ability to express that this wiring can become broken.<p>A perfect model must explain every example (or leave a place for as-yet-undiscovered mechanisms to explain them). New examples put new burdens on every existing explanation. They cut model-space down by, presumably, percentage chunks (&quot;excise the subspace of model-space that doesn&#x27;t model personalities and wiring personalities to sensory organs&quot;). If you imagine that there are something like 2^N possible models at a given granularity, then, the cuts are approximately reducing us to 2^(N-1) each time. Our models with N degrees of freedom that has to explain E experiments has more like N-E degrees of freedom (disregarded &#x27;covariance&#x27; between experimental results). What this means is that a random model is overwhelmingly likely to be <i>wrong</i> with each successive experiment. (In practice our models have large dark spots where we leave many degrees of freedom open - but even still, it&#x27;s likely that any explicit modeling choice we make ends up being incorrect, and quickly.)<p>(This math is pretty made-up. We could do better with something akin to Kolgomorov complexity rather than degrees of freedom, since type systems should be discounted by how complex they are so that systems more complex than reality actually is end up contributing nothing to the total.)<p>Summary: I enjoy stories about weird neuroscience because they defy my mental model of &quot;how brains work&quot; almost every time, even if I keep revising it.",1448468219

Using a bluetooth keyboard in your lap is inconvenient if you&#x27;re snuggling with your spouse (or cat). Much less using a mouse or other pointing device (even the Wii remote).  Just awkward.<p>I think the future for PC on TV is going to be voice control.  Either the upcoming Cortana on XBox, or something like Amazon&#x27;s Echo combined with their Fire unit.<p>You could tell it to skip a movie forward 40 seconds to jump past the scary scene that would frighten your child. Or if you&#x27;re cooking in the kitchen and your hands are covered in flour, tell it to play some Top 40 hits.",1448467379

The speed is unparalleled: anecdotally, it generates a couple thousand pages in ~400ms (which would take an order of magnitude longer in Pelican).  However, dealing with ACE templates was like pulling teeth, and I was considering switching away just to save me the stress; I&#x27;m glad to see that they&#x27;re working on improving the actual templating process (and that ACE apparently supports base templates now?)",1448467329
10627795,comment,10627192,10627683,0,0,ufmace,,,"It&#x27;s secondhand, but I worked with a C/C++ embedded guy once who did exactly that - worked remote doing embedded software, carried around prototype device and interface hardware and shipped it back and forth as needed.<p>I also helped hire and support a consultant who was updating some C++ drivers for some proprietary hardware we had. He never actually came into the office, I just shipped him the device, supporting software, and emailed instructions.<p>So it&#x27;s definitely possible to do, but it isn&#x27;t the easiest type of job to get, especially if you can&#x27;t visit the premises at all.<p>For the OP, I&#x27;d suggest relaxing your preferences on what type of code/language you want to write for now. Try to find a job doing something you already have the most experience in, but at a company that either has the C++ projects that you&#x27;re interested in, or seems likely to have connections to companies that do that. Once you establish your competence with them, you may find it easier to switch over to C++ while still being all remote.",1448467326

And now with the new 30+% speed increase in the `hugo server` command, it just got a lot better.<p>My favorite feature is the single, no-install, no-dependencies binary than works perfectly on all OSes. This is huge for Windows users. You may get lucky with the Ruby/Bundle madness of other static site generators on Linux, but Windows support is often lagging or non-existent. With Hugo, one binary and done.<p>Recommend.",1448467301

Everyone owns at least some art in some broadly defined sense.<p>If we are talking only about buying art then the article is exactly on point. Selling art <i>is</i> selling emotion. But we are talking about selling apps not just art. Trying to sell every app as though it were art is doomed to fail (except for games). In terms of everything from tip calculators to pdf readers, I couldn&#x27;t care less about the &quot;feeling&quot; beyond some minimum threshold of UI quality. Can you talk at length about <i>all</i> the other things you own? Can you even talk at length about <i>most</i> of the things you own? Or are most purchases emotionless and pragmatic? I bet the latter.<p>I was a bit hasty with my words on people who enjoy veblen goods. What I meant was &quot;in fact, if you do this I assume you&#x27;re vapid&quot;. In general I find this heuristic works but like all heuristics it is not 100% accurate. The important thing is that when faced with evidence (EG someone who actually knows all the finer details of modern time-pieces and still choose the $3000 obscure mechanical watch) I am happy to reject my initial assumption.",1448467227
