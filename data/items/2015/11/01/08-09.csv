They run code in an environment optimized for user safety and convenience. These environments will always be able to tell your site&#x27;s server- and client-side code exactly what it wants to hear while showing something different to the user. You can&#x27;t stop it. The client will always win.<p>We may eventually get to the point where clients use various computer vision techniques to recognize ads. If I can clearly distinguish jiggling, improbably large elf anatomy below a flashing yellow &quot;PLAY THIS ONLINE RPG&quot; from content I want to see, so can an algorithm, at least to within an acceptable error rate.<p>Advertisements that are so borderline that they can&#x27;t be detected as advertisements are ones I probably don&#x27;t mind seeing anyway.<p>Spammers have already tried all available countermeasures and they&#x27;ve completely lost. Spam is so completely ineffective that it&#x27;s actually dipped below half of email traffic.<p>No, the client will <i>always</i> win in the end.",1446368315

There are only two parties that can win, Democrat and Republican. This goes to the question of, &quot;What is diversity in this context? More Republicans in academic positions?&quot; I don&#x27;t think so.<p>I think the fact that people are in the Democratic vs Republican party is related to their views on power (and winnability, but only 2 parties really win) rather than their views on politics. It just so happens right now that the Republican party collects votes with denial of climate change or evolution. The Republican party has made itself hostile to science, in that to back its claims, it has had to say that academia is engaged in a conspiracy to lie, and that academia brainwashes children into being liberal.<p>So regardless of your political beliefs, in terms of your power beliefs, voting Democrat is a good choice for those in academics. If Democrats started advocating for benefits for electricians, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;d have more Democrats there. That does not mean that the political beliefs and attitudes of electricians are shifting. Does it surprise anyone that working in the petroleum industry strongly predicts political party?<p>There are also other reasons why the Republican party is quite difficult to support, like their lack of positive regard for secularism. You can&#x27;t argue with the Texas GOP platform when it&#x27;s splattered with God and Christian issues.<p>Take a skim through this Texas party platform document published 3 years ago.<p><a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012Platform_Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/texasgop_pre/assets/original/2012Pla...</a>",1446368220

10485822,comment,10481752,10485697,0,0,asgard1024,,,"> The economic answer would be that the possible costs it could impose on you can be expressed as violations of your property rights<p>Let me explain a specific example: If a person A cheats person B out of his money, it affects me negatively. It poses a risk in the future that person A, being a cheater, will repeat this many times and eventually will have enough money to cheat me. (Both B and me will agree to be cheated by A at the time when we will be cheated, yet it won&#x27;t be our preference. Kind of like getting a forced move by check in chess.)<p>Now I am not sure your claim, that this problem can be expressed as property rights, is correct. At very least, these would have to be collective property rights. In fact, I think what we are getting here, if we are to express this correctly as property rights, to is state control over transactions, in one way or another.<p>> Being absurd doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it less philosophically valid.<p>I would say it&#x27;s a good way not to be taken seriously, but YMMV.<p>> On a more concrete level, the rejection of quantifiable utility is based on rejection of the extra assumptions it requires.<p>Which is a bullshit excuse. We have mathematical capabilities to deal with these kinds of problems - probability, fuzzy logic, whatever. It&#x27;s just laziness of economists to show that the free market assumptions hold under these new assumptions. (To be fair, it&#x27;s probably not laziness, I doubt they would hold.)<p>In particular, we can model things like this in computers. I don&#x27;t know of much cases where this was actually done, but I heard that free market in silico very quickly collapsed into an oligopolic mess.<p>Anyway, your assumptions should be close to the real world as much as possible. That should be the criteria for choosing them. It&#x27;s a nice curiosity to have free markets work under some weird, unrealistic assumptions, but it&#x27;s rather useless in the real world.",1446367560

I think that most people today would see creative problem solving, social empathy and long term planning as more indicative.

It takes a while to merge such changes and to even just get them right in order to feel fine with submitting such changes.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in an area close to that (TCP performance tuning), my patches never made it to the kernel. Someone else later came and took a slightly different approach and wrote a much cleaner code and got the changes in.<p>Small patches are rather easy to get applied, more intrusive ones (and changing locks is highly intrusive) is much harder. Not impossible though and the reward (for the community) is high, the internal feeling for succeeding is also great :-)",1446365618

Nobody uses any other format, because a) people who read scripts can make reasonable judgements about timing / pacing etc if you use the standard format and b) writing in a non-standard format is a good enough reason to immediately discard your script and move onto the next one from the neverending pile.<p>Apparently Mad Max: Fury Road was written as something more like a storyboard than a traditional screenplay. There may be other exceptions, but not many.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a small element of cargo cultiness to it as well. And you can write any old shit and put it in The Format and from a distance it looks like a proper screenplay. But really, there&#x27;s not much reason to do anything else.",1446365560

In the historical context, that&#x27;s when a European power uses military force to take over land which was controlled by a native population, and re-purpose it to fit the European, and predominately British, way of life. (We don&#x27;t, for example, talk about the Spanish homesteads in the American southwest.)<p>But here it&#x27;s used with a specific libertarian definition, which I can&#x27;t help but think echos the historic meaning. Based on this essay, it&#x27;s the process of taking unowned land and assigning initial ownership. (I point to Iceland as an example of what truly unowned land was like. Not the American historical context.)<p>In this case, no, the essay didn&#x27;t establish what it means by &#x27;unowned&#x27;. It asserts that we should view things as &quot;spectrum&quot;. That&#x27;s a specific philosophy that was created by regulation. It&#x27;s not a natural definition. Before we had spectrum-based continuous-wave radio, we had spark-gap radio which generated broad-band signals.<p>Over time, legislation banned these radios because, in modern terms, they are noisy and interfere with the spectrum. The government could do that because these are the public airwaves, under public control.<p>Take that away, and where do you reset? Why shouldn&#x27;t the original uses be allowed again, and what other historic uses did the government take away? I don&#x27;t know, but the fact that I can point to one suggests that there were others.<p>Of course, viewing the topic through a post-regulation framework makes it easier to justify a specific apportionment, just like how the historic homesteaders used the simplicity imposed by government authority to justify occupation of land that was in use by others.<p>Even that philosophy aside, no, it doesn&#x27;t answer the question. I&#x27;ll phrase it a different way:<p>Can I buy radio silence for my land? (That is, I have my own radio telescope, and want no artificial radio signals in a given frequency range with power levels above a certain threshold.) If so, how? If not, why not?",1446365449
