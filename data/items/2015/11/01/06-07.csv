On the other hand, there is also latency. But it is hard for me to tell how latency factors into this.<p>Could someone explain how they would decide whether copying packets is cheap or not?",1446360976

My bias is that they simply don&#x27;t happen or only happen very rarely , that wealth and power are almost completely illusory and conflate status and money to an embarrassing degree.<p>I think that some people like stories about oppression ( I used to be one of those people ) and that this explains much of how it is that people disagree about this.

Often times, in software, gaining knowledge of the existence of a solution is about as useful as gaining knowledge of the application of that solution.

Indeed, companies with a female founder performed 63% better than our investments with all-male founding teams<p>The comparison is not clear, but is not women versus men, but between companies with X number of males plus at least one female founder, versus those with zero female founders and Y male founders.<p>If we skip a step and take this fact as having some predictive value, it could be lots of things, including off-the-top-of-my-head:<p>1. Bias against women - which extends to teams that include men, e.g. the bias against woman exists in the presence of male co-founders.<p>2. That the personality traits shared by groups where women co-found startups with men are positively correlated with success. It is quite possible that these groups have much better EQ, while still retaining the IQ to impress the required amount to be selected.<p>3. That startups with at least one female select, and I am using this term in a very stereotyped way, &quot;not-white-male&quot; startups. Many Unicorn startups, from Atlasssian to Dropbox, specialise in problems faced by, again for wont of a better term, &quot;white males&quot;. Given the mantra of solving problems we have ourselves, it is possible that mixed groups choose less male subjects. As men have been the founders of the majority of startups to date, there must be a plethora of such startup ideas left untouched. One example is DIAJENG LESTARI who started <a href=""https://hijup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hijup.com/</a>, described as &quot;A pioneering Muslim Fashion store. We sell fashion apparel especially for Muslim women ranging from clothing, hijab/headscarf, accessories, and more.&quot; Little to no chance the archetypal &quot;white male hacker founder&quot; has that idea.<p>That&#x27;s three ideas off the bat, only one of which is bias. It could still be bias, but I feel that points 2 & 3 are at least good candidates for exploration. Personally, I think there must be a lot of low hanging fruit in ideas not aimed at men, and female founders seem ideally poised to have those ideas.",1446359550

Without the age of secular reason building a society to hold them in check, Christians would continue to be as barbaric as they were in the middle ages. To this day, it is easy to find Evangelical Christians with batshit beliefs about demons and people living with dinosaurs, Mormons who believe blacks have the mark of Cain, and Christians in general who believe in hell and that homosexuals are going there. Without our strong enforcement of secular laws, I shudder to think what medieval punishments these people would dole out on unfortunate gays, blacks, and non-Christians.",1446359389

There&#x27;s a recent article on the payday loan industry that confirmed my hunch that the people using them aren&#x27;t total imbeciles and know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>I use credit as a management tool, it gives me options I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise.

WWII machine gun designs reflected WWI trench warfare experience - fixed gun positions, fire in the general direction of the enemy.  WWII didn&#x27;t go that way, mostly because everybody had tanks, and could now operate against machine guns.<p>The most effective tank of the war was the USSR&#x27;s T-34. More T-34s were produced than any other tank, including Shermans.  The T-34 had a good gun, a decent Diesel engine, and an adequate transmission.  The Sherman was a lighter tank, and early Shermans had a rather weak gun and some strange powerplants.  (One version had five V-8 car engines arranged in a circle around one crankshaft. Chrysler had a good plant for making V-8 car engines, but the specialized machinery could not make a bigger engine.) The Sherman&#x27;s big strength was simply that it was a good driving machine, and tens of thousands of them were driven from the French coast all the way to Berlin. Patton&#x27;s &quot;War as I knew it&quot; talks about this, in the chapter &quot;Touring France with an army&quot;. Many of the heavier German tanks would wear out on a long road trip; within Germany, tanks were often moved by rail.  Basic truth: the tank that makes it to the battlefield beats the tank that doesn&#x27;t.<p>(The overly complex Tiger tank transmission thing is real, but confusing. Tanks steer with the transmission. The Tiger tank had a steering wheel, which controlled the relative speed of the two tracks.  The Sherman had two foot clutches which disengaged the left or right track, and turning was more of a lurch than a smooth turn. The Sherman could not turn in place. There was a Tiger variant with an electric drive, like a Diesel-electric locomotive, but that was harder to keep working than the hydraulic/gear system. Modern tanks steer like the Tiger, but now the technology works.)<p>The article author&#x27;s info about the U-boat was is totally bogus. There was a big worry that Germany would be able to starve out the UK. Liberty ships, convoys, &quot;jeep&quot; carriers, periscope-spotting radar, and Ultra intercepts reduced the effectiveness of U-boats. The US Merchant Marine puts the number of ships lost to U-boats between 2,742 and 2,919.[1] The figures for 1940 are from 470 to 520, compared to the author&#x27;s 127.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.usmm.org/battleatlantic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usmm.org/battleatlantic.html</a>",1446358141
