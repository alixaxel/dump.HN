The system may be fantastic, but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing.<p>Consider the following key characteristics of &quot;anti-caching&quot;:<p>(1) Cold data is moved from RAM to disk.<p>This is cache replacement. Eventually, caches fill and you have to choose what to evict. While there are many replacement algorithms, one of the most popular is LRU, which is what is used here. In conventional CPU caches, data is moved a cache line at a time, moved transactionally. Here, it is a tuple at a time, moved transactionally.<p>(2) There is only one item present in either RAM or disk.<p>This is (almost) exclusive caching, which maintains exactly one item in all levels of the cache hierarchy (as done by the AMD Athlon). The key difference is removing it from the bottom of the hierarchy. This approach may be novel, but as far as I can tell, it is the primary novelty.<p>To be clear, adapting all of this to DBMS architecture may be a great idea, but let&#x27;s call things by their names.",1446418651

The number of people who _want_ to visit San Francisco at any given price point hasn&#x27;t changed, it&#x27;s just the number of people _able_ to visit that&#x27;s changed.<p>Really, all that&#x27;s going on here is that Airbnb has lowered the barrier of entry to short-term rentals, allowing landlords to more easily address market inefficiencies created by rent control.<p>Not that rent control is wrong, but it does work against market forces, and markets tend to route around regulations that work against market forces, in the form of black markets, or scalpers, or whatever. Your enemy really isn&#x27;t individuals or companies so much as market forces themselves, and while sometimes it&#x27;s necessary to fight them, honestly, it&#x27;d be easier just to legalize building denser housing.

So if you want history, you need to shell out $8/user/mo, which is <i>ridiculously</i> expensive for chat. And not something a FOSS project should be spending it&#x27;s limited funds on.<p>Slack has been successful because it&#x27;s onboarding process is buttery-smooth. They&#x27;ve put a lot of work into making everything easy, from signing up to installing integrations. Unfortunately those integrations also waste a ton of space in the chat window. I use Slack at a couple of companies, and each of them got excited, installed a couple of integrations... and then abandoned the channels with integrations, because they waste so much screen space and you can&#x27;t follow the flow of a conversation. It&#x27;s a pity Hipchat got caught napping - they did displaying integrations well.<p>Another FOSS-specific problem with Slack is that they don&#x27;t have a linux client, so you have to use the web app, which is terrible when you have to track more than one Slack team - you have to manually switch teams to check for updates, which takes a non-trivial amount of time (and the &#x27;switch&#x27; control is right next to the &#x27;sign out&#x27; control, which I&#x27;ve accidentally hit a couple of times)",1446416579

The end goal of the GNU project on the <i>macro</i> level is to replace all proprietary operating systems (not just proprietary Unixes) with GNU. But then an explicit goal of the Hurd specifically was freedom from tyrannical sysadmin policy, which necessarily included freedom to host one&#x27;s own private namespace in a multi-user system that doesn&#x27;t affect the global namespace.<p><i>Currently</i>, the goal is indeed exploration. RMS and GNU have given up on it and morale is low. Can you blame them?<p>In fact, RMS&#x27; decision to go with Unix was a pragmatic one. He himself was always more a fan of ITS and Lisp Machines (see his October 1986 speech at KTH), but rightfully sensed no one would end up using such a solution, and thus decided a clone of Unix with non-breaking semantic improvements where possible and a Lisp-y userspace was the best way to bridge adoption with wanting to push forward. Hurd satisfied the first, the second unfortunately stagnated as Guile never broke the chasm until very recently now with GuixSD.<p>QNX was proprietary and didn&#x27;t have its architectural unveiling until work on Hurd was started. It again did not have the translator concept, but like MINIX 3 had static servers. KeyKOS&#x27; main selling point was the single store and the orthogonal persistence, which nominally could be done on Hurd e.g. by integrating Mach VMM policy into a libdiskfs. It was not a priority then. L4 was too spartan for the experiments on object-capability systems that the Hurd devs embarked: <a href=""https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412-s05/projects/HurdL4/hurd-on-l4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~412-s05/projects/HurdL4/hurd-on-l4.p...</a><p>It&#x27;s true that security was never a primary orientation of the Hurd, but its security is still better than monolithic Unixes. And do keep in mind QNX and MINIX 3 are not nominally security-oriented, either. It&#x27;s the communication boundary structure (and in Hurd&#x27;s case, port rights and auth server) that intrinsically create superior cases.<p>Walfield and Brinkmann&#x27;s 2007 critique was done from the perspective of developers themselves. It wasn&#x27;t a <i>general</i> criticism of the Hurd, but one of specific problems related to resource accounting that other u-kernel and most monolithic kernel designs suffer from. Relative to the state of the industry, it is still a leap forward. Relative to the state of the art, it is not, but then so do QNX and MINIX 3 make sacrifices.<p>Implementing the POSIX API has nothing to do with the Hurd&#x27;s problems. And, indeed, Hurd <i>does</i> break the POSIX model in several aspects (e.g. allowing multiple uids per process). But then we must disqualify QNX and MINIX 3 by this token, too.<p>The fundamental issues with the Hurd then have little to do with the 2007 critique. More pressing is its incompleteness, which hopefully rump integration will finally break its samsara. If all else fails, using rump drivers on a heavily stripped Linux with Mach module emulation to create a true hybrid kernel, coupled with functional package management and system state management via Guix with added on orthogonal persistence and network transparency could be another future direction for the Hurd I might end up exploring. Perhaps tripling both as a multi-user OS, a unikernel and a container OS via subhurds.<p>The Mach improvements have mostly been surface, but again, I would not see it as a huge bottleneck (only an inelegance) and in the hybrid case it becomes irrelevant beyond as a programming API, which it isn&#x27;t that bad of one.",1446416084

How old is the universe? I don&#x27;t know. We have these three models, however, which give us some idea... And so on. A little humility can go a long ways here. Guess what? Average Joe Citizen knows you don&#x27;t know. Trying to oversell the science is not the way to go.<p>Second, and more important, this horrible public debate is being framed in the most disingenuous terms possible. I am consistently being told that people either believe in imminent danger requiring bold political action -- or they are science deniers. Pardon me, but that&#x27;s just bullshit. As the GP pointed out, there are an infinite number of intermediate positions; and no amount of hand-waving about the possible dangers is going to change that.<p>There are a bunch of logical steps a person must take in order to support political action. Is there a change coming? Are we the cause? Is the change going to cause more harm than good? Can we control the outcome? What is the &quot;proper&quot; outcome? How much action is warranted by the change indicated? And so on. I could list these exhaustively, but it would be pedantic.<p>This list is not just a bunch of rhetorical obstacles to make sure nothing happens. These are logical and discrete steps that must be looked at and evaluated. Many of them are yes/no questions, but some involve qualitative opinions or numerical differences. If any of these steps come up short, i.e., if there&#x27;s going to be massive change but the change has more of a positive impact than negative? The whole shebang falls apart. That&#x27;s not moving the goalposts, that&#x27;s not trying to throw up a bunch of obstacles. That&#x27;s just how the reasoning works out.<p>&quot;The climate is changing&quot; is a trivial statement. Of course it is. &quot;What&#x27;s left today is a proper scientific theory&quot; looks like a pretty big stretch to this layman. Even granting that somehow we have a falsifiable, reproducible (and how would that work, anyway? Got another Earth nearby?) theory, still looks like a bunch of political types at the IPCC voting on what the change will be. Voting. On the numerical result of a supposedly proper scientific theory. Show me the corresponding physics body that is voting on the mass of the proton and maybe we could get somewhere.<p>And even then, even if there wasn&#x27;t so much BS -- even assuming something as rock solid as a huge asteroid heading towards Earth -- a democracy still makes decisions by the persuasion of the voters. I&#x27;ve heard many a climate catastrophist talk as if the average voter is too stupid to make life or death decisions for themselves and the society they live in. If that&#x27;s what they believe, then we need to start talking about the wisdom of setting up a select group of scientists as the new priestly class, able to understand the mysterious ways of the universe and make decisions about what is just and good for the rest of us.<p>I&#x27;ve said it before: this is a terrible debate, full of scientists who shouldn&#x27;t be advocates, politicians who are looking for the latest bandwagon to jump on, the vast morass of uniformed folks who want to look knowledgeable and the poor voter stuck in the middle of all of it.</rant><p>As an aside, I would really love to see some discussion about the fact that models based on Cellular Automata always tend towards runaway conditions.

Which is exactly what has been happening for close to two decades now.<p>Furthermore, the level of CO2 has not just increased--it has increased by close to the &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario in the models--i.e., the worst case scenario, which the models predicted would show significant temperature rise that has not happened.

Falsifying GR or QM within their established domains of validity would be extremely hard, yes--but that&#x27;s because their established domains of validity are nailed down by mountains of evidence from controlled experiments that matches the theoretical predictions to ten or more decimal places. Climate science is not even close--not even within orders of magnitude--to that kind of accuracy.<p>In fact, we should not expect climate science to be anywhere close to GR and QM in accuracy, because it&#x27;s still a fairly new science, its domain is very complex, and it&#x27;s not possible to do controlled experiments in most of the domain. We can&#x27;t re-start the Earth&#x27;s climate of fifty years ago with slightly different initial conditions and see how it performs.<p>None of this, in itself, disqualifies climate science as a science, or means that climate scientists are not doing important work. But it does mean that climate science simply cannot make the kinds of claims that GR or QM make about what is going to happen if we do or don&#x27;t do particular things.
