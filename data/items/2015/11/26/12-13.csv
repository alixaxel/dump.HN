10632738,comment,10626638,10626638,0,0,ryanmonroe,,,"One reason people might not follow this method for inference is that it depends heavily on the experimenter&#x27;s personal beliefs about the world. The &quot;improvements&quot; here only lead to more accurate inference if the author&#x27;s assumptions about the world are true. In business applications you often just want to get to a conclusion and make a decision, so this method makes sense. In scientific publication you want to verify results with a larger community with minimal assumptions. When you calculate a p-value and print it in publication, you might not be giving much information, but at least that information is objective and invariant to readers&#x27; personal beliefs. Making inference based on p-values you can at least say &quot;In the long run I will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis 5% of the time with this method&quot;, while there is no such similar statement for a method that depends on the experimenter&#x27;s personal beliefs.<p>In addition, the probability being calculated here is a little misleading in that it doesn&#x27;t fit with the traditional definition of &quot;probability of X&quot;. Despite the same s notation, P(H|D) is not the same type of probability as P(D|H). The coin is either biased or not, so there isn&#x27;t actually any random process there and the statement &quot;the probability this coin is fair is 50%&quot; makes little sense under the traditional definition.",1448542415

Good luck with that.<p>There are three elements to OS choice: standardization,  marketing and openness. Looking at the desktop market, you can see how Microsoft dominated standardization, Apple managed to dominate marketing, and Linux used its unrivaled openness to sneak in between the two.<p>In the mobile world, Android already occupies two of those slots, basically pre-empting any linux-like effort from ever gaining significant traction. That means the only ways you can break in the mobile OS market (assuming you&#x27;re not producing breakthrough tech creating its own market) are 1) flooding the market with such a massive amount of units that standardization stops being a factor, or 2) flooding the airwaves with such a massive amount of excellent advertising that your devices become more desirable than Apple ones. Good luck with that.<p>(Note how price is not a factor. Mobile devices are inherently aspirational, as Nokia found out.)<p>The hard truth is that the land grab is over: if your mobile OS has not made it yet, chances are that it never will -- at least as long as devices stay in this particular form factor and nobody comes up with groundbreaking tech.<p>Mozilla should concentrate on standards, including a kick-ass Android browser; everything else is a waste of time.",1448539969

(See: <a href=""http://xlwings.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xlwings.org/</a> and say goodbye to VBA).

That might change if apartments started coming with <i>far</i> more soundproofing than they currently do.<p>However, I wouldn&#x27;t say that US major cities have good public transit; rather, they have awful automobile infrastructure such that transit looks good by comparison.  And as you said, &quot;the core of&quot; those cities have transit options, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the whole city does.  I&#x27;ve certainly encountered much better public transit when traveling in Europe, though not sufficiently so that I&#x27;d be inclined to use it in preference.<p>In any case, that then leads back to the point that started this discussion: given a set of existing cities that don&#x27;t have (or want) the kind of layout and design you mentioned, how do you build a transportation infrastructure?  Public transit doesn&#x27;t fit the current layout very well, and you can&#x27;t redesign those cities from scratch even if people would prefer the new design.
