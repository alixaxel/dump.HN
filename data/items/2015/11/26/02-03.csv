For one, congress and the president cannot ever seem to work together to get anything meaningful done. But secondly, every single time we think we make an exception or a rule in the tax code, we learn that crafty investment bankers figure out how to exploit the rule. As Plato said, &quot;know thyself.&quot; And we suck at playing nicely.<p>Completely hypothetically, say we could kill tax inversions. The whole thing has felt like a game of cat and mouse game for a century now. Inversions are the tax-avoidance scheme du jouer. For example, for years, Pfizer has already been paying virtually no taxes in the US by storing all of its IP in an offshore subsidiary. The &quot;double Irish&quot; trick is being done by companies who have never done an inversion. There are all sorts of holes in the tax code that other nations use to fuck the US. And there&#x27;s no way we can compete on the rate, since we&#x27;d be competing with countries that have a 0% rate. Many companies pay a zero percent corporate tax rate on all of their offshore profits (which, IIRC, is attributed to a subsidiary in Bermuda), and mostly claim to have nothing but losses to write off in the US.<p>We need to finally say, &quot;fuck this nonsense.&quot; Companies don&#x27;t need laws to inform them when they&#x27;re acting morally. It is immoral to act the way they are, and instead of playing cat and mouse like we have been doing, we need to put our foot down and MAKE every company obey the spirit of the tax laws, and not the letter. And the only way I know of to make that happen is to use extreme threats like invalidating their IP if they pull these tricks, or threatening the countries that aid them.",1448506076

I&#x27;ve learned as a scientist a bit more about giving presentations than I thought I ever would, and something I&#x27;ve been told time and time again is that you act with confidence; the smallest hint you might doubt what you&#x27;re presenting can be damaging to how people will receive your message in the first place. This is a bit general in society, people often equate confidence with truth and accuracy, which is not necessarily a good correlation.<p>Because of that, scientists are under pressure when presenting to the public to downplay their doubts or not mention particular points they are unsure of. That&#x27;s why issues in science don&#x27;t get airplay even though most scientists are aware of issues in their own field.<p>The reality is that reality is complicated, and people&#x27;s perception of reality is even more complicated, so it&#x27;s no surprise that science is a very hairy thing with a tinge of uncertainty at times.

But it is clear after reading the books that almost all technology for Sony, Sega, and Nintendo was done in Japan.  This meant that any story about what happened here in the U.S. can&#x27;t be about the tech, but is much more about the marketing.  Perhaps there is a wonderful book in Japan filled with interviews and stories that just needs to be translated, but I don&#x27;t know of it.<p>2) Your right, the primary sources for the book were from Sega America.  In the  talk linked here the author makes it clear that he wasn&#x27;t allowed much of any interview time with people from Nintendo, but maybe this isn&#x27;t a bad thing.  Nintendo was honestly a boring <i>story</i>.  They do the same thing year after year, putting out good games for decent value.

Everyone has had that time everything went right or everything went wrong and everyone likes to talk about what they should have done and how they could have been great etc.  It is a polarizing book, but if you don&#x27;t expect it to be all the tech it is a decent story.",1448503529

PSU like this are very noisy and without (a.o.) this shield it may not be possible to get it approbated. The shield has transparent plastic foil beneath it to act as an insulator (barely visible on the first photo, but on the picture with the shield removed it&#x27;s clearly visible). The usage of yellow tape is perfectly normal.",1448503327

To me, the two go hand in hand. It&#x27;s not about &quot;should,&quot; it&#x27;s not about right and wrong, it&#x27;s simply about expressing the sentiment that you regret what happened as a result of your actions.<p>Even if you said something totally innocent like &quot;I like apples&quot; and somebody got offended at that because they&#x27;re crazy, you can still <i>sincerely</i> apologize for that if you actually care that they feel bad.<p>And of course you don&#x27;t have to care that they feel bad. In many cases not caring would be a perfectly reasonable response. In which case, don&#x27;t lie by saying sorry.",1448503306
