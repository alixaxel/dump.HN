The short and sweet of it is, sometime ago I proposed to a friend that I&#x27;d help him do some things really cheaply ... (because the R-pi is cheap!) and we eventually couldn&#x27;t because we couldn&#x27;t use things like Labview and so on. I shouldn&#x27;t have extended this issue to terminology, whether R-pi is a computer or not, sorry about that.<p>Basically the source of my complaint is being sliiightly bothered by the fact that when people call R-pi a computer, the everyday joe-shmoe takes from it that they can run x86 windows on it. They can&#x27;t. They can maybe run Windows embedded on it (I think?) but certainly not proper Windows. I know and understand that R-pi is a computer by any reasonable definition, I&#x27;m just lamenting the reality of things in this one small respect.",1448769543

10643646,comment,10643611,10643611,0,0,hardwaresofton,,,"tldr; I use a nosql db because you don&#x27;t need to worry about schema which should give you an initial iteration speed boost, but the database type should be decided based on the data. In the SQL case, you should decide on a migration technology sooner rather than later. Either way, keep good schema documentation (if it&#x27;s not already in code).<p>DISCLAIMER: I&#x27;m highly partial to rethinkdb (<a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/</a>), though I think I have good reasons<p>- Since I find document stores a little easier to setup/work with (especially when they have nice convenient web UIs built in) I&#x27;ve often started with those. The obvious benefit is letting your schema change while you prototype the application. You could easily do this also with JSON in Postgres obviously, but I find the web interface/ease of use that databases like rethinkdb (<a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/</a>) offer to be refreshing.<p>- When you decide what database you should use in production, it should be based on the data. Note that most document stores are not actually &quot;schema-less&quot;, it&#x27;s just up to you to properly interact with the tens of schemas that are true at any one point in time. A sane set up will often have the schema documented somewhere.<p>I find myself writing documentation in files like SCHEMA.md (sometimes in it&#x27;s own folder with a file for each actual model/collection), if I use a NoSQL database.<p>If you find that a relational model fits your data best (if your data is highly relational, and very inter-connected --  a lot can be said about when you should use a relational db vs a non-relational one), then I would still suggest documenting your schema, and picking a migration strategy BEFORE you start. Find what technology you&#x27;re going to use to migrate your database, and start using it from day 1.<p>- If you you are rapidly prototyping, it might slow you down to add a BaaS. At least I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s really easy for me to download the binary for a database I want to use, run the binary, connect to it in code.<p>- Many frameworks start you out with using an on-disk SQLite database (django, rails). If you mean like an actual flat text file, it really depends on the guarantees you want out of your database. If you are writing a highly functionally-minded app, and know that you are going to essentially keep a append-only log of what&#x27;s happening, a flat file might be all you need (and of course, you&#x27;ll need some locking if you want to do more than one thing at a time to the file)",1448769382

10643637,comment,10638640,10642755,0,0,deelowe,,,"This is a very strange comment for HN. I get the gist of what you&#x27;re trying to say here, but your terminology is completely off base. You really should look up the definitions for &quot;computer,&quot; &quot;touring complete,&quot; and well, actually learn a bit about the R-pi and arm computers in general.<p>The R-PI is very much a full fledged computer or &quot;PC&quot; even. Microsoft&#x27;s reluctance to fully port a desktop operating system to the device has nothing to do with it&#x27;s technical merits. It&#x27;s perfectly capable of running a full windows OS, if Microsoft were to choose to do so. BTW, their IoT platform is rumored to eventually offer desktop variants, so this argument will probably be null sooner than later as well.<p>Otherwise, it&#x27;s capabilities are damn near identical (functionally) to an X86 machine running Linux, BSD, Android, and a few other operating systems. There are limitations with IO and that sort of thing, which one has to take into consideration for any PC, but otherwise they are 100% functionally equivalent.",1448768933

It will give you a chance to learn quite a lot of fundamentals at a quick pace, and if you spend your time well, you&#x27;ll get quite a lot out of it. It won&#x27;t turn you into a good dev, but it will give you lots of pieces that you&#x27;ll start to connect later in your career.<p>You can also pick up lots of good stuff from working, but you need to be very careful about what habits and practices you keep. You&#x27;re going to be in an environment where people are motivated to just get things done. Some people will focus on improving, others will not. You will have your own project deadlines to meet. You might get mentored by smart people, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed, and politics can play a large role here. Nobody is obligated to make you great.<p>Working will inevitably be the thing that crystallizes your developer abilities, and I don&#x27;t think anyone gets good without it, but going to a university helps you learn things that people will often just take for granted in the workplace (unless they don&#x27;t know them- those unknown unknowns can be tricky)",1448768933

In all that time, no one has found a final resting place for it. Only one serious DGR has even begun construction— and that&#x27;s Onkalo (Finland), set to begin receiving waste in 2020, should things go to plan.<p>All that spent fuel is just sitting on the surface at hundreds of sites worldwide, in pools, dependent on a power supply and ongoing maintenance to the pumps which circulate cooling waters. If those pumps malfunction, or the power supply ceases, the water will boil off, and the wastes will be released into the biosphere. If the US electrical grid ever fails, fossil fuels will have to be trucked to these sites, forever. As long as the grid never fails in the next, oh, few ten to hundred thousand years, we should be all good. How confident are we in the political and economic stability of the US, for millennia to come?<p>Is it not immensely immoral to be generating power this way, and handing the problem to our distant descendants to deal with? How are they supposed to pay these costs, when we were apparently unable to, despite enjoying the front end benefits of cheap power? Can you imagine if instead of building pyramids in the desert, the ancient Egyptians had left behind a monster that required ongoing babysitting even today, to prevent unleashing catastrophe on the planet?",1448768930
