They&#x27;re just supplemented with ton of hacks that produce meaningful result in acceptably high number of cases (like regex-based highlighters) but still don&#x27;t have &quot;real&quot; intelligence towards the content of their buffers.<p>And with ever-growing number of hacks the thing&#x27;s unlikely to be small or low on dependencies. You&#x27;ll end up with another emacs/vim/etc - a fairly small cores, and then a scripting or external tool execution support to do highlighting, parsing, context-aware searching, refactoring etc etc to make them useful for code editing.

Meaning, either you do it while using vectorial operations mostly everywhere, or it&#x27;s just too slow to work.<p>The only real advantage I see in Julia, is that it doesn&#x27;t constrain you to a specific way to think about calculations. You can think about them in a vectorial way (which is not always possible) or you can just use an iterative approach. Both work fine.<p>This is what I mainly expect to get from Julia, but we must admit that the inertia behind python and it&#x27;s excellent libraries for numerical computation, make it hard to change to Julia.",1447599243

There are about 50-80 other conditions like this I would like to discover through an application, but what&#x27;s tricky is that companies can use different language to describe these things.<p>I have absolutely no idea where to start with a project like this, but am excited to learn some new tricks. Am wondering about how to best extract unstructured data I want, best ways to populate and organize a DB (presumably NoSQL), etc. I realize this might sound comically general and naive, but figured there might be some folks out there with good experience working with unstructured data and document-oriented databases.

You&#x27;ll need a good execution of your idea and traction with paying customers. Can you get to that point with your own money?  Or better yet, should you even try?<p>And here&#x27;s the problem with being non-technical.  How do you know if the money you&#x27;re spending on the programmers is going to yield you something useable. For instance, I could build you a basic Twitter clone in a day and you would be impressed when I showed it to you.  What you wouldn&#x27;t know is that the whole thing will fall apart soon as more than a few thousand people start using it. Worse, at the point it falls apart you&#x27;ll have to build an entirely new and costly replacement. All while the thousands of users you worked hard to acquire bolt for the door.<p>IMO, this is the biggest issue with not having a technical co-founder.  It&#x27;s not insurmountable, but the risk of technological failure is much higher.<p>If I were you, I&#x27;d spend all my time vetting the idea. Talking to customers and getting them to buy a product that&#x27;s not built yet.  One problem I already see is that you seem hesitant to explain your idea here.  That&#x27;s a red flag to me and mostly everyone else here.<p>For instance, here two ideas I&#x27;m thinking about right now:<p>1) A business making all natural wooden toys, finished with an all organic wax, and build from locally sourced, already felled trees.  It would be branded Cape Cod Toy Factory and would sell initially to local toy shops where I live.  People on vacation love stuff like this and it makes for a great vacation gift.  There is no one in this space now.<p>2) A blog platform for artistic types where everything is hand drawn, words, images, everything.  This would be for people with a MS Surface or like devices.  It would use handwriting recognition to underlay their handwritten words for search engines and render there drawings and text on html canvas.  Reading this blog would be like reading someone&#x27;s personal handwritten journal.<p>See that&#x27;s the thing about ideas.  Most people are going to hear your idea and say, &quot;that&#x27;s stupid&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s a good idea&quot;, but very few will say &quot;I&#x27;m going to rip that off&quot;.  Ultimately no one will have the fortitude to follow through with your vision but you.<p>Best of luck!",1447598730

It is purely an economic arbitrage game, not infrastructure development.<p>It&#x27;s worse than that. Creating a substandard product and giving it away for free <i>destroys</i> infrastructure development. A large mass of customers are going to take the free offering and each one who does and would otherwise have paid comes out of the budget the provider has available for expansion and upgrades.<p>This doesn&#x27;t change whether Facebook is building their own infrastructure or leasing someone else&#x27;s. If they lease existing infrastructure then they&#x27;re large enough to pay wholesale rather than retail prices and the (large) difference comes out of the local provider&#x27;s capital budget. If they build their own and sell below cost then it&#x27;s even worse -- competitors will lose both subscribers and margins if not go out of business entirely.<p>Here&#x27;s how I expect Aquila to work: They&#x27;ll install it and drive all the local competitors out of business, and the incumbents&#x27; infrastructure will fall into disrepair or be sold for scrap. Then at some future date there will be an economic recession and Facebook accountants will wonder whether it makes sense to keep all these drones in the air to provide free access to a bunch of customers in developing countries with no money who are therefore highly undesirable to advertisers. The answer will be no.<p>So they&#x27;ll either discontinue the project or start charging money.

The search for scientific truth shouldn&#x27;t be a narrative for the people who pay for it.</i><p>So I guess you criticize every corporation who hires scientists to work on proprietary products? Elon Musk is such a fiend!<p>Look, a much better way to accomplish this is robust intellectual freedom. Rather than expecting <i>every individual scientist</i> to be able to say anything they want, regardless of employer, create a system where any scientist who hasn&#x27;t chosen to be muzzled can state controversial ideas and expect them to be received with only intellectual criticism. You need far more than just <i>legal</i> protection, you also need a culture where dissenters are tolerated and not socially shunned.<p>You also need a culture where replication and debunking are given equal respect to finding novel results. The unfortunate fact is that if someone publishes a new result, that gets vastly less prestige than if they replicate (or fail to) an existing study, or spot statistical flaws in someone else&#x27;s work.",1447596072

Some things were slower in urxvt and then some things didn&#x27;t work as correctly as in xterm, so I didn&#x27;t bother configuring urxvt for more speed. st, on the other hand, wasn&#x27;t faster and actually was heavier memory-wise when I tried it the last time.",1447596027
