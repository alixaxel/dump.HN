10606430,comment,10598065,10606326,0,0,pbsd,,,"The shuffle question ties in with the overlap question. Let&#x27;s stick with the AES in counter mode example. AES is a block cipher, or in other words a keyed permutation. What this means is that each key (resp. seed) determines a distinct permutation that we use to generate the blocks AES_K(0), AES_K(1), etc. In effect, each seed will result in an entirely distinct and independent 2^128-block sequence, instead of simply the same sequence starting at a different place, which is usually the case for non-cryptographic generators. So 2^128 possible keys (or 2^256, if you go AES-256) times 2^128 output blocks per key is probably enough to cover all possible card shuffles.<p>I do believe that. RC4 is a good example, actually; the unexpected properties that make RC4 be considered completely broken for cryptography are considered irrelevant for simulations (I won&#x27;t swear by this, but I&#x27;ll bet that RC4 passes all of TestU01&#x27;s tests). The standards are just so much higher for cryptographic primitives. I&#x27;m sure unsexy generators can be suitable to this or that application. But due to the ad hoc nature of the statistical tests used, you can&#x27;t be sure that your generator is not oddly correlated with a concrete application. I&#x27;ve written a comment a few days ago---on a thread very similar to this one---about a real-world case of this happening [1].<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10549024"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10549024</a>",1448102815

Asking for something impossible is a good way to set someone up to fail, especially when the you can tie it to various recent tragedies with the usual emotion-driven rhetoric.<p>Maybe the goal is just to scare people away from encryption by associating it with terrorists or the fear of arrest for aiding-and-abetting[1].<p>What about banking and other business uses of encryption? Nobody ever said the government was internally consistent; selective enforcement is a powerful tool. I&#x27;m sure those uses will continue to be ignored.<p>[1] the disgusting comments about hanging Snowden ( <a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/260817-ex-cia-director-snowden-should-be-hanged-for-paris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/260817-ex-cia-di...</a> ) could be interpreted as a veiled threat to anyone that uses encryption",1448100843

It&#x27;s a detailed history of Copernicus, Brahe and in particular Kepler, but is also about how new models of knowledge gain traction. So it goes way beyond simplistic &#x27;lone genius&#x27; analyses but still celebrates the great achievements of individuals. A wonderful read.",1448100796

Do you actually think these two astronomers and other scientists just came up with their results? That&#x27;s not how science works.<p>Unfortunately many Western historians casually ignore or at best minimize the impact the Islamic scientific movement had on many fields such as philosophy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and astronomy.
