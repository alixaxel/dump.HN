One important metric that many non-CS PRNGs have, but many CSPRNGs do not have, is a provable deterministic cycle length for all seeds.<p>These characteristics don&#x27;t just make Monte Carlo simulations converge quicker, they also do things like guarantee that your 52 deck shuffle will definitely produce the one shuffle that gives player two a royal flush on the flop in a round of texas hold &#x27;em. Or, more generally, they guarantee that your Array.shuffle() method is unbiased for a reasonable sized array. In general you need true randomness and/or a long cycle linear-transformation PRNG to make those sorts of guarantees. It&#x27;s also nice that they&#x27;re fast. That said, I do also agree that the scenarios in which these things matter are rather rare, and most people should probably just use a CSPRNG by default.<p>Do you really think a CSPRNG is fast enough for your standard library&#x27;s array shuffle though? Wouldn&#x27;t you rather have something like xorshift1024* that&#x27;s probably > an order of magnitude faster? Maybe a CSPRNG is fast enough... I don&#x27;t have all the numbers. So this is an honest question.",1448092792

They could pay for it with a part time job. But the cost of college has risen far faster than wages, helped by cheap student loans from the government.<p>>Which is why we have Social Security<p>Social Security will need to be vastly expanded to keep up with an aging population.

The basic labors need to get done, and someone is going to be doing them too.<p>Given that, it&#x27;s it realistic for very large fractions of us simply not having kids?<p>Does not seem that way to me.<p>Anecdotally, the janitor at my school as a kid was not a smart man.  Not dumb, just not intellectual.  But, he was a pretty great dad and his family did well.  They didn&#x27;t have much, but they turned out just fine.  Some of his kids ended up moving up and out on to better things too.  I&#x27;ve often thought about that dynamic.<p>We never know how this stuff turns out.  I, myself, grew up in relative poverty.

Honestly, didn&#x27;t do me any real harm, and I&#x27;m sure glad I&#x27;m here as are my peers and family.<p>To me, the problem is one of how we value people rather than their decision to start families.  People always start families.  This is primal.  Inherent feature.  We need families.  Most of us do anyway.  Some of us don&#x27;t.  But that doesn&#x27;t align with the job / value problem.<p>We need the janitor.  Somebody is going to do that work, and what basis is that for denying them basic human dignity?  Or, maybe we don&#x27;t really need the janitor?  Ok, that means we do a lot more ourselves.  Wouldn&#x27;t some people make the case they are wasting their time having to do that stuff?<p>Of course!  As they should, and that is precisely why we need to value the janitor.  The labor isn&#x27;t sexy, but it serves an important purpose, even if that purpose is to free some research scientists to cure cancer faster.<p>If somebody is working full time, maybe that needs to somehow be enough to live a modest life, and to me, that life includes a family.  Maybe both parents work.  That&#x27;s OK.<p>Should we actually put weight behind that idea of waiting to have kids in a time of relative financial security, quite frankly, way too many of us won&#x27;t be having kids!

Also you seem to misunderstand what I meant by equidistribution---uniformity is a different property, and of course crucial. I am puzzled, then, as to why you claim some generators are more &#x27;uniform&#x27; than cryptographic ones.<p>Any pseudorandom bit generator whose next bit cannot be predicted in under 2^n &quot;operations&quot; also passes _all_ statistical tests that require less than this computational effort. This is a well-known result by Yao. In other words, unpredictability and indistinguishability are equivalent. In the case of, e.g., AES-CTR, n = 64 (birthday-bound distinguishers force it to be 64 instead of 128).<p>Your philosophizing about what true randomness really is does not strike me as very useful for practical purposes.
