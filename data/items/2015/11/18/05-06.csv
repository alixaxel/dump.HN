(Taking the production costs into account.) Best tools save time and make everybody more productive, which should be in everybody&#x27;s interest.<p>Imagine you would say something like that in education - that some children do not deserve the best education, simply because they may never use it. How do you know they will not find some use for it?<p>Yet, when it comes to tools (and stuff in general), it is readily accepted as a principle (that it is OK to intentionally cripple someone else&#x27;s productivity). Neither the fact that there are business models around market segmentation doesn&#x27;t make it a good choice.<p>You will probably now follow with the standard argument about how they need to make profit and recoup their investments and so on. Guess what - the investment was already made, and it can&#x27;t be undone! And frankly, I am sick of this lazy ass market god which requires investors to get return on profit so they would do something at all. (It&#x27;s kinda like you&#x27;re probably not a very good human if you need threat of hell and promise of heaven to make you not bad!) Just like everybody else, an &quot;investor&quot; should get a good salary (for the work done in decision-making) and that&#x27;s it.<p>Also, the argument &quot;if they didn&#x27;t do it this way, they&#x27;d do it some other way&quot; is interesting. In this nebulous form, it&#x27;s often used to justify something morally fishy. Note that you can also use it other way around: Why should there be laws to protect DRM, if people who want to break will find some other way? The correct answer is, of course, the laws and regulations (legal system) are the correct resolution of this argument - we have them to steer people away from &quot;other ways&quot;.",1447826074

He actually was something of a pioneer in the 1700s in trying to tie his arguments to cited texts, which is admirable, but given how much ancient historians inherently carried a load of bias and often were offering third-hand accounts at best, they were deeply unreliable. Often histories were laden with propaganda and politics.<p>Modern historians still do look to those historians, but are much more critical about vetting their reliability on topics, have more texts to work with (largely in thanks to the Oxyrhynchus discoveries - Oxyrhynchus was basically an ancient garbage dump in Egypt which thanks to the arid climate preserved a huge trove of texts.)  Historians also have a lot of other material to work with - archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics that either weren&#x27;t available or weren&#x27;t really considered in Gibbon&#x27;s time.  Many of these offer more objective data about the goings on of the empire and can tell us a lot about things happening all over the empire and show how unreliable the texts discussing events can be.<p>Modern historiography tries to approach history from as objective and critical a stance as can be managed, rather than seeing history as a kind of tapestry to weave a preconceived narrative from.  Gibbon&#x27;s historiographical approach was to weave a history from the documents that while for the most part was roughly accurate in many details, was all about building a grand narrative of how the Late Empire fell due to Christianity effectively ruining everything it touched, miring the empire in &quot;superstition,&quot; and &quot;enthusiasms.&quot; Today historians recognize that we are better off focusing on building as reliable an account as we can while a historian should (at least attempt to) leave the moralizing and grand narratives out.",1447824306

By representing a design problem this way, it follows that &quot;solving&quot; it amounts to clustering requirements together to form sub-components that interact well together, or redefining the solution/context boundaries to re-frame the problem and minimize the overall tension.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how this TRIZ framework arrives at many similar insights about the design problem, and I wonder what you get by mixing the two approaches.

It could easily stop them in a matter of weeks or months if it chose to engage in total war without regard to resulting civilian casualties in the area. The reason the US does not engage in such actions is because it has deemed them to be morally dubious and also not politically palatable domestically or internationally.",1447823257
