It reads like an advertisement.<p>Listen, every uniquely engineered reverb has a distinctive sound. Some are more distinctive than others. Most 80s reverbs are terrible <i>except</i> if you are looking for the quirky characteristics that result from their limits. I am one of those people that does not have nostalgia for the limits of those units; their sound is perfectly replicated in modern software units.<p>The 90s reverb units sounded really good. Lexicon, Roland, Sony, Eventide, TC, etc. But in 2015 the available Logic Audio plugins, while they may be a bit different, are essentially indistinguishable quality-wise from the original hardware units. I owned and loved a lot of those units. So what do I use today for reverb? The native Logic Audio plugins and the ArtsAcoustic plugin. These are so good and flexible that they cover almost every use case for the sophisticated hardware units of the past. They sound <i>really</i> good. It is almost embarrassing that you can get audio that sounds that good for that cheap.<p>A reverb plugin on your laptop today is capable of a great many things that were not even possible for reverb hardware in the 1980s. That is worth keeping in mind.",1448690293

The common denominator is people doing what they want to, when no one <i>intervenes</i> in their activities.<p>So if there&#x27;s nothing to deter people from pirating movies, or to punish them for it, then they&#x27;ll go ahead and pirate movies. The risk is <i>really</i> small, and the reward is (practically) instant gratification. Very few would pass that up.<p>On the one hand, I think IP laws shouldn&#x27;t exist. They&#x27;re not meant to benefit the creators anyway, but the entertainment industry BigCorps instead.<p>On the other hand, I think it&#x27;s wrong, to a small extent, to pirate movies or music or anything else someone has created and put up for sale.<p>There&#x27;s a deal available to you, and it&#x27;s up to you whether you&#x27;ll take it. You get something, the creator gets money, and both are more or less happy. But if you <i>circumvent the deal</i> by downloading the product instead, that&#x27;s comparable to stealing without the creator actually <i>losing</i> the product.<p>Of course, the entertainment industry equates pirating with actual stealing, because it&#x27;s more impactful that way. That&#x27;s dishonest too.<p>But all in all, people will act according to incentives, and they <i>will</i> pursue their personal gain and the satisfaction of their wants and needs. Nothing&#x27;s going to change that, so it&#x27;s pointless to even try.<p>Ultimately IP laws do <i>way</i> more harm than good, and they&#x27;re not meant to benefit us little guys anyway.<p>Think of all the patent lawsuits flying around in the US, or that piece of shit Martin Shkreli charging outrageous prices for drugs people <i>need</i> to survive, etc.<p>All of that follows from IP laws existing too. So it&#x27;s not just about &quot;creators&quot; getting what they deserve, it&#x27;s all the scummy other stuff too.<p>Besides, what anyone <i>deserves</i> for his creation, is whatever he can get people to <i>voluntarily</i> pay for it. Nothing more, nothing less. That&#x27;s something to keep in mind too. If there&#x27;s no market for someone&#x27;s creation, that doesn&#x27;t mean there should be legislation that <i>makes</i> people pay for it.<p>Alright, I guess that&#x27;s enough rambling now.",1448688163
10640131,comment,10638795,10640104,0,0,FussyZeus,,,"Your metaphor isn&#x27;t quite right, a better one would be &quot;should a distributor of a given product be held responsible for determining if the goods they&#x27;re given are stolen?&quot; To that I would say:<p>1. A distributor would only use vetted manufacturers, or at least not buy from one again when the products purchased turn out to be stolen<p>2. When the products are digital, it&#x27;s much easier to check if they are stolen than physical ones.<p>3. If it&#x27;s been determined that a product is stolen, the distributor (generally) isn&#x27;t held responsible but also isn&#x27;t allowed to continue selling from the same stock.<p>Also, I would argue that while it&#x27;s impossible to detect everything (which is what I said initially too) there should be some legal requirement that the given distributor should show a reasonable attempt to enforce copyright law. The Content ID system, discounting all the ways its abused by a few big companies, is an excellent system for detecting copyright material, and would definitely show that YouTube is at least <i>trying</i> to prevent the spread of material that isn&#x27;t legal. At the same time, it&#x27;s clear by this post at least that Udemy is not only NOT vetting their content whatsoever but, similar to Facebook, makes the process to report said content intentionally difficult which I&#x27;m sure is not at all related to the fact that as long as said content is live, they&#x27;re making money.<p>In short, there&#x27;s a difference between being a store owner who mistakenly bought stolen products one time, or being a distributor who makes regular business off of stolen product. One shouldn&#x27;t be held to the fire, one really should.",1448688106

It&#x27;s advantageous for a family to get more land. Also, it needs people to take care of/improve the land.
