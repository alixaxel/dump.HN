It was a bad precedent. How would you feel about pro-lifers hounding a CEO out because of a donation?<p>2. His opinion is/was not extreme or unusual. About half of the American population share his views.<p>3. Is it reasonable to expect the full-range personal of views (and voting patterns) of a CEO to be agreeable to every employee?<p>My personal take is that the episode showed that no one has spine at Mozilla. Around the same time, people were raising concerns about Condoleezza Rice being on Dropbox&#x27;s board; Dropbox&#x27;s response was &quot;we value her, she&#x27;s not going anywhere&quot; - and that was the end of it.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have to say this, since what I said should stand on it&#x27;s own merit: but I disagree with Eich&#x27;s politics.

An authority that could dictate spelling would soon start dictating pronunciation.  It&#x27;s bad enough that the pernicious influence of Estuary English is levelling pronunciation over the whole country but at least people, theoretically at least, have a choice.  The only influence such an authority has is to artificially slow the development of the language and to try to shoe horn regional variations into a single formula.<p>People often complain that written English doesn&#x27;t correspond with pronunciation.  But no one ever says whose pronunciation that the spelling is supposed to reflect.<p>I&#x27;m from the south west of England and my pronunciation of words like house, boat, castle, book, etc. is quite different from that of, say the North East.  So how would you like us to spell house?  Should it be /&#x27;haʊs/ which is probably about what I would say and is also regarded as RP.  Or should it be /&#x27;hu:s/ which is the best I can do for the pronunciation that at least used to be common in the North East and in parts of Scotland.<p>Would the spelling authority also specify which syllables to stress?

That gives it amazing possibilities.  You can prototype on a laptop (running Linux) and just move your code, AS-IS, over to a 1 GHz Linux Desktop with 512 MB of RAM: the Raspberry Pi Zero that is pictured.<p>Now you are correct that it&#x27;s not capable of running Windows.  Even the Linux that it runs is a version that doesn&#x27;t support everything that a desktop version supports.  (Like Photoshop etc.)  It&#x27;s extremely underpowered for a desktop, and not every Linux package supports its architecutre, though most do.<p>So it&#x27;s a complete PC in the sense that it can run desktop Linux applications - you can surf the web on it - write emails, do whatever you want, and you won&#x27;t be using special embedded versions of applications.  But for that usage it is also radically underpowered.<p>Hard to understand what else someone might expect from a $5 computer on a chip, though, when a typical desktop costs $250-$500.  The specs I listed are absolutely remarkable, but in a real desktop you use on your desk you would want 8 times as much RAM (4 GB) at a minimum, or even 64 times as much ram (16 GB).  I mean if you&#x27;re advising your friends.<p>This is more about experimentation for applications where you embed a small PC.  If your friend doesn&#x27;t have much of a budget, I suggest they get a used PC.  This PC is about as powerful as a desktop PC from over fifteen years ago.  (Which they could also get, and still run some desktop applications on.)",1448750755

I contributed code to most of the teams I managed. I was not the one primarily responsible. I learned a lot as I went, I was very inexperienced for what was required. I learned a lot of ways NOT to do things. If I had to sum things up, I would say before I was helping &quot;connect the dots&quot;, now I am connecting all the dots.<p>This time around I am purely a leader and the one primarily in charge of tech. My almost exclusive focus from the start is the people. I have to start over on most things that I evolved through previously.\n- I&#x27;ve taken on the responsibility to create and define our culture. My last job I assisted in this area.\n- Make sure developers have the tools to be productive. This includes reliable wifi, internet, good coffee, software, furniture, TVs for monitoring, AV system for presenting, conference rooms.\n- I&#x27;ve had to earn the trust of the existing people. Previously almost everyone was new on my teams and I hired them, so there was largely trust from the beginning.\n- there is churn, like you are going through. I had almost no churn on my teams previously that was not purposeful. I have to explain why the churn is ok and expected.\n- I have to teach developers to focus first on &quot;why&quot; they are building a feature, rather than &quot;what&quot; they are building and &quot;how&quot;. This helps dev and product see eye to eye.\n- I have to teach how to interview, run meetings, do agile right, communicate. Focus on building the right things over building things right. Teach people when to be tactical and when to be strategic.<p>Ultimately, I have to step up and fill the gaps until I can hire and/or train people to assist in that area. Before I had help all along. For example, I&#x27;ve interviewed about 200 candidates in 6 months for many different roles (developer, DBA, sysadmin, product, data). Mainly because interviewing was probably the most important thing I could be doing for the company and the developers.\nI&#x27;d be happy to go into more detail offline.",1448750316

I&#x27;ve traveled numerous times without ID and have never had any significant issues or delays and don&#x27;t expect any in the future either.  There are obviously those who insist it is a requirement or will soon be a requirement, but that&#x27;s very silly.  Imagine traveling from Oregon to Maine, loosing your wallet, having no ID and then being effectively stuck in Maine until you can prove to the local DMV you are who you say you are so they can issue you an ID.  Absolutely ridiculous.<p>Yes, the TSA obviously wants everyone to think they need ID because having thousands more people going through checkpoints everyday without proper ID will tax the system.

For example, although the specs have evolved, the basic rules for rendering simple HTML and CSS haven&#x27;t really changed that much for a long time. Some of the changes are still substantial. For example, introducing tools like flexbox has significant implications for your layout algorithms that simply weren&#x27;t there before. Some of the changes are qualitative, like introducing entire new areas of functionality to support off-line use or real-time client-server communications, or providing production quality support for graphical presentation via canvas/SVG/WebGL and multimedia audio/video players, which is essential if you are trying to kill off any external plug-ins that would have been used for such things before.",1448749733

Pick some other language you&#x27;ve never worked with, that has some potential market (i.e., you could make money with it), and just start learning. Do online courses, cookbooks, make demo projects, and once you have some competency - join an open source project in it. The point isnt just to get a new job, thats a side effect. The point is to regain a fondness for programming by seeing it from a totally new angle. If youre into Python, have you ever worked in a compiled language like C? How about Java? Functional programming w Haskell? Metaprogramming with Ruby? What about learning a whole new concept, like 3D graphics with an API/framework like OpenGL? Or game engine architecture with Unity3D? Just do something different, and rediscover a love of being a maker in the process. Even if it doesnt become a new trade, you certainly will be a better Python programmer due to your experience in a completely different technology stack.<p>3. Find local meetup groups that are involved in programming. Meetup.com is a good resource. Keep up to date with technology happenings in your area (conventions, talks, expos, etc), and attend them.

The table purports to be apples to apples, but while the HDMI adapter added in for the pi zero, the $13 HDMI add-on board is not included in the cost section of the CHIP.<p>An honest comparison would be $23 vs $24 with HDMI, or $10 vs. some lower cost for the pi zero subtracting out the HDMI cable. I&#x27;m also skeptical of including the OTG adapter. Maybe it&#x27;s needed for some purposes, but it&#x27;s not a generally needed component.<p>The CHIP appears to be better for IOT experimentation, but the PI is intended to be a general purpose computer, which also includes some hardware integration tinkering capability.",1448748265

If the dependencies are complicated enough, or you need fast scaling/reconfiguration on the fly, then containers can certainly be a net positive. But if you&#x27;re adding Docker, Compose, DCHQ, and whatever else to your stack just so you can put Nginx and some Ruby code in a container, I&#x27;m questioning whether that ends up being a net benefit over Puppet/Chef + rsync.",1448748108
