If you can&#x27;t unify a theory in 100 years, you most likely made some mistakes and a rewrite makes much more sense. Start from scratch with newest measurements and the simplest assumptions build it from ground up. Of course you must describe the different constants/forces of the standard model, but as long as you derive them logically, its absolutely valid.<p>Sorry, but we run out of time to wait 100 years for general physics to catch up.

Wood is one building material among many. Extinct species and overfished oceans don&#x27;t impede our ability to raise animals for consumption (which is where a vast majority of the meat we consume comes from). Ditto farming. Pollution can be (is) filtered from water sources at miniscule cost. Energy production is cheap and diversified, even beyond fossil fuels (nuclear and increasingly practical wind&solar). Water can be desalinated and pumped long distances for a pittance (I&#x27;m speaking in absolute terms here.)<p>Costs might fluctuate a bit, we might take the usual tragedies of the commons to horrible extremes that significantly mess with the planet and make it significantly less nice to live on, but I have yet to see an argument for unsustainability that didn&#x27;t rely on either silly extrapolations or silly assumptions about our inability to adapt.

USSR did a lot on that path; I&#x27;d say roughly 80% of the road to success.<p>That includes N-1 rocket, which in fourth flight almost completed successfully the first stage burn. Upper stages were better tested on Earth and had higher chances of working right in early flights. Also from the way first N-1 flew one can see that engineers were systematically eliminating problems. The Achilles&#x27; heel of the N-1 rocket was engines of the first stage - NK-15, which were due to be replaced in the next flight with much better NK-33. The next flight N-1 could already be significantly more successful; but the program was cancelled.<p>That also includes hardware like Soyuz spacecraft, which with a lot of modifications still flies today, and D stage, which is used on Protons and Zenits to boost satellites to the geostationary orbit. NK-33 engines flew on Antares rocket and on Soyuz 2-1v Russian rocket.<p>That also includes lunar landing ship, which was successfully tested on Earth orbit in three flights.<p>Additionally USSR had a good program for exploring the Moon with robots, including Lunokhods, lunar orbital spacecrafts and automatic sample return vehicles - Luna-16, Luna-20 and Luna-24. And also Zond program - with first circumlunar flights by a spacecraft which later returned to Earth with living animals onboard.<p>USSR had rather good lunar program - and that was way less expensive than American one - but lost the race to send a human to the Moon itself.<p>However, from Russian point of view, that was just a - big, but not final - episode in space. 1970-s were the decade of first space stations, and USSR achieved a number of impressive firsts there. Losing to America with reusable spacecraft - Buran flew only once, later than Shuttle, and that was still better than no landing at all in the Moon race - Russia kept perfecting orbital space stations, and Mir was the world class orbital laboratory - some features of which were surpassed by ISS only many years later.<p>At the end, Russia still has a unique combination of abilities to do things in space - even though it can&#x27;t match USSR&#x27;s pace.",1447392187

People, I used to find interesting, edgy, true individuals seemed to turn into just boring, conformists.  Nothing wrong with boring, and conformity? I think it just all  reminds me of my own mortality?<p>I also learned--I&#x27;m not the person I thought I was when on FB. Meaning--I&#x27;m more critical when I&#x27;m on that site, than in real life.  Example--I go to someone&#x27;s site I used to know, and see the physical age in their pictures, and it&#x27;s just depressing.  I see how some have given into being their parents, and it&#x27;s just depressing.  I see the see the car I was suspose to inherit being trashed by my nephew, I get depressed on a lot of levels.  I also see that people aren&#x27;t breaking down my doors looking for me--as a friend, I get depressed.  I look at the news feed, and what FB thinks I&#x27;m interested in, I get depressed.  I see that that the one person I thought would not have over 1000 friends, is actively trying to friend my pseudonym profile, I get depressed.  She doesn&#x27;t even know the most depressed civil war soldier&#x27;s name, and she wants to friend him.  (In the civil war, a soldier was showing signs of melancholy.  A doctor decided to call his condition depression.  I use that soldier&#x27;s name on a FB account.)<p>I see my pictures have been stolen, and I get depressed.  I see my stolen pictures, with a new copyright, and I get depressed.  I always deactivate my account when leaving FB.\nWhen FB, monkeys around with the deactivation process, I get depressed.<p>So FB does make me depressed some days.  Maybe, it&#x27;s just too much reality?  Are we suspose to know exactly what almost everyone is doing, or not doing?  What age has done?  What lack of opportunities/money did to some peoples lives?<p>I don&#x27;t hate FB, but think it needs some real competition.  Right now, it&#x27;s just too big.  Its tentacles are integrated in too many websites.  It&#x27;s become its own internet?  It&#x27;s just to much posing, trout mouth, Kardashian, narcissism for some days.
