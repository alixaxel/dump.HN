And perhaps frustratingly, it&#x27;s made up of all of those who participate, and not by diktat.<p>I think what maddens some is that masses of people sometimes make decisions we don&#x27;t necessarily agree with, and often with information we don&#x27;t think they have. We want change /now/, and that&#x27;s just not possible with massive systems of people.<p>So we may look at issues of inequality today and issues of budgets and austerity and whatnot, and assume that we&#x27;re all heading for the end. But as you insinuate in your earlier comment, man has steadily increased their economic output for centuries. The quality and longevity of life, over time, has increased inexorably. We can&#x27;t confuse the turbulence of a decade with a scope over centuries.<p>But all of this I feel is somewhat moot. Because for as many calls as there had been for greater control over market forces, be it mercantilism of the 18th and 19th centuries, or socialism and communism in the 20th, we find that we&#x27;re still, wherever freely possible, conducting business by barter and exchange, gathering wealth, and acting in our own interests. We do this because it&#x27;s natural, because it requires no direction from elsewhere, or guidelines to follow that someone else sets. Place a person in whatever place and she or he will try to make themselves a profit.<p>We can only be frustrated to a point with the way things are, because to go further is to refute who we are. Freedom is desired naturally, be it in rule or economics. Best to help things remain open and fair, and not try and set a direction. People will find the best one for themselves.",1448278556

Especially well battle-tested distributions like Debian and derivatives.<p>For example, if you want to deploy a Rails application, you can find working ‘init’ files for Debian & Co. easily. If you use FreeBSD, you have to write your own init files. It’s not hard but might be one or two hours of work for someone familiar with *BSD before you get them to work correctly.<p>Then you have docker on linux. FreeBSD added docker support in June 2015 and according to their website is not production ready. OpenBSD doesn’t support docker. For small dev teams supporting their products or for bigger teams which work with micro-services docker is heaven-sent. It allows you to run the exact same configuration on the server, out of the box by just mapping a few ports.<p>Likewise, there are many tutorials, howto’s, etc. which make it trivial to setup a HA-Proxy under Linux. But if you need to setup CARP+HAST under FreeBSD you have to go through the official documentation - which is top quality material - and find your way from there. It’s not a 10-minute copy/paste thing.<p>Add to that a rather elitist culture e.g. BSD is designed, Linux is grown - roughly translated as ‘we are engineers, you are hackers’ which in many cases is not far from the truth and you have an explosive mixture which renders BSDs obsolete.<p>That said, I find strange the fact that so many corporations choose to support GNU/Linux over BSD in terms of driver development or funding, given that the BSD license is way more permissive. This was the reason Linux picked-up early on and became way more popular than BSD among hacker, but when corporations jumped-in, they didn’t choose BSD, they went with linux. I am not sure if this was a data-driven decision or it was just a matter of technical people in decision-making positions have a lot more sympathy for Linux than BSD.<p>At this point in time, GNU/Linux has clearly won the race. However, if someone would ask me to setup a ‘secure’ mail-server, file-server, whatever without specific requirements (e.g. docker, LVM, etc.) I’d probably go with BSD.",1448278430

The company inherited local market monopoly and a lot of employees had shares after privatization from communist era - which kept the communist hiring/work policy for almost 15 years after the fall of the regime.<p>Very few people actually disliked the fact that they accomplished little to nothing in their 8 hours at work, a lot of them were involved in stealing (drivers using company gas for their cars, reselling raw materials, stealing product labeled as &quot;defective&quot;, etc.)<p>I would say 95% of the people were not only happy but probably proud that they were getting decent salaries for below reasonable amount of work (by any standard).  There were people who didn&#x27;t like that kind of environment and incentives (myself included) but we were in minority. I would say that what separated us from the others was ambition - we actually wanted to accomplish something in our career and majority of people working there were perfectly happy where they were.<p>Eventually the financial crisis hit, the market shifted, company profits went to shit, employees dumped their shares in panic and all of those incompetent people found themselves on the street with no career prospects after 20+ years of doing practically no work. The guys who were semi competent were long gone by then.<p>My point is - this sentiment of needing to accomplish something at work is not shared by everyone (some may pay lip service to it but in practice won&#x27;t behave accordingly) it&#x27;s not something I would generalize.",1448277586

One consequence can be that you rely on others to make you do them. For example if you have an anxiety disorder and you get anxious over planning a trip, you might tell a friend to help you do it. Now the anxiety could take another form, which makes you get anxious if you have not had your plan, as in this example, reviewed by a friend.<p>This could make it worse; You have task X that makes you anxious (planning trips, in the example), you invent task Y (seeking help from a friend, in the example) to relieve your anxiety for that task, but now when you try to perform task X, you get anxious if you have not done Y. Meaning to solve the underlying problem of breaking your behavioural pattern, you have to not only solve the behavioural pattern that makes you anxious over X, but also stop using Y, which was not there from the beginning (or might have been enhanced from applying this new behavioural pattern).<p>This is how I have come to understand a part of cognitive behavioural therapy, and I could definitely see how, if I were to use an app like this, I would start using it to relieve my anxiety by inventing a new behavioural pattern (i.e. using the app) that does not solve the problem, but instead induces anxiety over not using the app.<p>This article makes me then wonder, could a similar thing happen to someone with depression? (EDIT: Perhaps like p4wnc6 mentions in a comment below.)<p>It was pointed out to me that there might be a form of an app however that might be good in the realm of cognitive behavioural therapy in application to anxiety. One method of facing your problem is to get a realistic view of your expectations and realise your behavioural patterns to be able to break them. For example, one method is to have a thought-diary, where you record your thoughts on a regular basis so that, even without reviewing past entries, you at least start consciously thinking about what thoughts are, for example, inducing anxiety. So perhaps a tool that would help you recognize thought/behavioural patterns would be more safe (in the sense of the philosophy of cognitive behavioural therapy) to use.",1448277525

Convincing them that there is a better alternative for <this particular project> requires them to grasp technical concepts that they simply don&#x27;t grasp.<p>And then you have a lot of programmers who know that <this operating they used> is Good (TM). Convincing them that there is a better alternative for <this particular project> requires them to have some broader, often theoretical understanding understanding of things, so that they can compare approaches and judge which one is better for a particular task. A lot of them don&#x27;t have it; it goes against their belief that there is an operating system that is Good (TM). In fact, they&#x27;ll go to incredible lengths to ensure that any operating system is like their Good (TM) operating system.<p>As far as IoT goes, though, hardware and software compatibility <i>is</i> always a problem. Most of them are built on tightly-closed SoCs. You&#x27;re stuck with whatever the manufacturer wants to support, and that&#x27;s usually Linux. I guess that partly boils down to the fact that, back when manufacturers started looking into this free operating systems niche, fitting Linux in 4 MB was a lot easier than fitting any BSD.

I would not at all characterize the modern internet as heading toward less freedom, not at all. My impression is that far more people are far more aware of issues of injustice and oppression today than was previously the case. It used to be that only a tiny sliver of &quot;radicals&quot; were really clued into those issues, and many of them also adhered to one or another nonsensical conspiracy theory to boot, which weakened their cases when it came to appealing to the modern world. Today I see growing kernels of increasingly less marginalized and increasingly more powerful people who have been educating themselves, participating in the conversation, and speaking out.<p>No it&#x27;s not perfect, and it&#x27;s not happening absent a lot of the revelation of lots of repugnant behavior. And it&#x27;s also happening seemingly very, very slowly. But my perception is that the trend is for the most part in the right direction and strong. Giving up is the only sure way to lose at this point.<p>The bulk of this article seems to be completely out of touch with the way people have been using the internet, especially younger people. It&#x27;s not becoming more TV-like, it&#x27;s becoming more interactive and participatory. It&#x27;s not retaining existing power structures. That only appears to be the case when you look at bullshit measurements based on bogus statistics like paper valuations and user counts. The reality is that the real power is in the people. In the content creators, in the groups, in the social networks themselves. The value layered on top of that or spread in-between to facilitate it is fragile and small by comparison. It&#x27;s the same as in Silicon Valley. Having a billion dollar valuation doesn&#x27;t mean your company is powerful or secure any more than having a billion users does. And it doesn&#x27;t.<p>I predict that within the next 5 or perhaps 10 years there will be another great shift and &quot;implosion&quot; of one of the current major &quot;internet powers&quot;. Perhaps facebook, or youtube, perhaps even google or amazon. I don&#x27;t think people understand the mobility of the modern technological market. You do not own users or customers, you retain them through superior service. It will probably shock people who vulnerable these mega-corps are to disruption, and once one of these big shifts happens once you are going to see a crapton of bloviation from the chattering classes about how absolutely unpredictable and ground-breaking the whole thing is, but it means nothing more than that they haven&#x27;t been paying attention.",1448276580

There has been lots of attacks on the protocol, that no one person could&#x27;ve think of.<p>You&#x27;d hope so, but contrary to popular belief, actual cryptographers relatively rarely manage to prevent errors in the standards. For instance, Phil Rogaway warned against MAC-then-Encrypt used in TLS which led to the Padding Oracle attacks many many years before they were exploited, but the suggestions were ignored by the &quot;practitioners&quot; designing the protocols. In fact, the TLS example was one that is relatively easy to get right if the designers wouldn&#x27;t have gone crazy and listened to actual cryptographers.
