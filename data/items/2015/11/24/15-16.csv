10621435,comment,10620457,10621354,0,0,cryoshon,,,"The chart is ultra-deceptive because it isolates one variable and ignores all the other attendant charts which indicate massive generational loss of wealth. If real income per hour has actually increased, the marginal lifestyle gain from that increase is beyond a doubt, zero.<p>Millenials own far fewer cars and homes than their parents ever did, in addition to having less (typically negative, due to debt) net worth. To reiterate, if millenials were to liquidate all of their assets (of which they have none anyway), they would still be in the hole for huge sums. I am fairly certain that my parents never had negative net worth; I know for a fact that they also had much more substantial savings and spending ability in their 20s despite coming from humble backgrounds and working menial jobs.<p>This isn&#x27;t about keeping up with the Joneses, it&#x27;s about reaching zero rather than being in the negative.<p>EDIT: And, as the other replier so far mentioned, millenials consume very little healthcare while being forced by law to spend vast sums to merely have the ability to spend more money (via high deductible plans) to get shitty quality care. For a time in the previous generation&#x27;s course, it was normal to have mental health care as part of the standard of care, which has slipped away from us-- now, mental healthcare is barely consumed, and is ludicrously expensive when it is covered under the paltry plans at all.",1448380799

Once you have ships going back and forth across the Atlantic, everything changes. Europeans introduced cows, sheep, pigs, chickens. The New World&#x27;s only domesticable native animal is the llama, which is the main reason why civilizations sprung up in Central and the northern parts of South America, that&#x27;s where llamas were.<p>Now, to the Europeans, with vastly superior farming technology, the Caribbean and North America were veritable cornucopias of geopolitical possibility. Islands sheltered plantations. Europe could project real power only very closely to the shore, where the big naval guns could reach. The reason was supply. To maintain a group of soldiers requires not just food but adequate clothing, weapons, ammunition, and horses to carry all of that.<p>It took over a century of growth for a colony to get to the point to where it could maintain and supply an army for deeper treks inland. By that time the colonies would have been deeply entrenched in native political systems. Because the warships protecting your colony could only hang around for so long, colonies were quite vulnerable to native military action, or even just having them hang around outside the settlement and killing whoever goes outside, say, to chop wood. It made sense for settlers to be nice to the locals, at least at first.<p>CGPGrey just put out a fantastic video comparing the Old and New Worlds that neatly explains why Europe won and the Western Hemisphere lost. The actual mechanism was disease, which does not require a supply train, but there&#x27;s a lot more to the story.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk</a>",1448380209

I think that automated unit testing is a useful method of reducing errors and regressions, however not alone but as part of a series of quality control strategies such as integration and higher level and manual testing, static and dynamic analysis, using higher level programming concepts, etc.<p>I am afraid I do not consider TDD to be a legitimate design method. There&#x27;s an inherent tension between well designed OO code and testable code.<p>Well designed code is properly encapsulated, does one thing, has a minimal interface and few dependencies. Testable code is often less encapsulated, contains extra complexity for the test machinery, among which we can count extra methods (with potentially non-private visibility) and dependencies between classes (such as strategies, policies, factories, etc).<p>When I design I always start from the closest-to-ideal incarnation of the objects, based on OO principles and the way clients of my components will want to use them. Then I compromise on that design just enough to be able to test it to an acceptable level (which varies per component). It could be that I will write no unit test at all, and instead test several interacting components. \nSomeone following TDD will immediately compromise in favor of testing and automatically add maintenance overhead.<p>Furthermore, while designing at the class level is important, it is much more important to architect at higher levels: component, subsystem, application, system/platform. \nAll of these aren&#x27;t considered when writing unit tests and what makes perfect sense in a &quot;unit&quot; might only be a local optimum.<p>Designing at the test level is to me as architecting a house at the brick level...",1448379104

Methods (and callbacks) are listed by name with some thrifty description of argument. But none of the important stuff is ever there: is it reentrant? stateless? Who owns each non-scalar argument? Can it be invoked from user space? installable driver? kernel driver? Signal handler? Does it have latency constraints? Can I use it from a different thread than it was constructed under? Is it protected during thread death? Is it atomic vs what other methods? What other apis are allowed/forbidden when writing a callback?<p>As an embedded programmer, I end up reading library source most of the time trying to find these answers.

If we just wait a couple weeks (for any given person), the times will progress enough so that they&#x27;ll no longer be affected.<p>But when you throw DST into the equation, it resets progression of sunrise and sunset times.

Employees used to be able to stay their entire career with one company and amass a pretty decent retirement pension with said company.<p>Then Wall Street got corrupt. They demanded ever more from companies. Each quarter had to show more profit from the last otherwise they punished the company. Wall Street found ways of funneling any profits directly to investors instead of investing in the company (and, more importantly, it&#x27;s employees). Pensions took a hit. Companies stopped offering them. Some companies &#x27;borrowed&#x27; from pensions and lost it all. The employees did suffer. Employee loyalty dropped. Companies took that as an opportunity to treat employees as temporary; replacing them regularly with cheaper ones.<p>You&#x27;ll have to wait until tomorrow night to hear the rest of the story.

That adds up to a <i>lot</i> of books over 5 years, especially when you consider that some of these books only take 5-10 minutes to read.<p>The truth is most children&#x27;s books are &quot;bad&quot; from an adult perspective (not that the kids care).

Even autocrats need the blessing of the general population to successfully prosecute such a war, otherwise he runs the risk of the people rebelling and shutting down vital infrastructure just when they need it most. You can&#x27;t have your army in two places at once, quelling the populace and fighting the enemy. Full-scale war intensely taxes everyone&#x27;s resources. Also soldiers won&#x27;t fight with the zeal they need to be effective against soldiers defending their homeland unless they really believe in what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Hence the general move before and after the two world wars towards more limited war. With a limited war, you have to rely on professional, volunteer soldiers to conduct operations. Many nations conscript, but largely to keep readiness up. It&#x27;s difficult to conduct the sorts of operations you see in the small-scale military operations of today with a conscript army. These are people with jobs and lives, they just won&#x27;t be able to give their all.<p>Big wars only happen after long-term feedback loops of media coverage rousing national anger against other nations make it politically feasible to actually declare war.

Some have even advocated calling it Test-Driven Design, not Test-Driven Development, because the end result is a design, not a series of tests.<p>This is important to know, because the key factor in the red-green-blue cycle is the blue step: refactoring. The example given by the author is of a system that kept getting tests -- but was never refactored. Instead, more junk kept got thrown in. In this case, they were not doing the most important thing in TDD, refactoring. Not really sure you can even call this TDD. Looks more like a CF created by a bunch of folks under time pressure who thought it would be easier to add stuff than refactor.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand what it is, probably not a good idea to criticize it. TDD is a way at looking at constructing OO programs. It&#x27;s main competitor is probably more along the lines of Model-Driven Development.<p>TDD is a response to the large amount of commercial code being written in complex object-oriented environments. The goal is to ensure that changes to the code maintain the economic value of the code. In my opinion it is not appropriate where there is little or no economic value, like personal, academic, and start-up code. In cases where there are not complex object graphs full of dependencies, such as small pure FP projects, it&#x27;s also not indicated -- there&#x27;s no OO system for TDD to help you design. And if you&#x27;re not designing stuff, you&#x27;re not doing TDD.<p>People get religious about TDD, yep, and it drives me nuts. But like I said, that&#x27;s no reason not to understand what the hell is going on before criticizing it. Unfortunately, people getting excited and over-selling things is just the way it is in tech, whether it&#x27;s TDD or the latest cool programming language.",1448377433

I remember hearing an interview with Greg Wilson regarding his book <i>Making Software,</i> [1] the premise of which is to apply a more rigorous methodology to understanding what makes software work.<p>If I remember correctly from the interview (I think it is here[2]), one conclusion was that TDD doesn&#x27;t have a clear benefit when you add it to a project. On the other hand, in a survey, TDD projects are more likely to succeed because it is a habit common to good developers. I hope I am capturing the subtlety there. Essentially, TDD is not a silver bullet, but rather a good habit shared by many good developers. That was enough to convince me of the merits.<p>It&#x27;s another problem altogether to try to institute TDD for a project, especially for a team. Like so many things in programming, TDD could be used and abused. The same could be said for JavaScript or [insert proper noun here]. If misunderstood or used incorrectly, TDD could be a drain on the project. A benefit--and this ties back into the idea of TDD as a habit--is that it forces the code you write to have at least one other client. This requirement would alter the way you write code and arguably for the better.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596808303.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596808303.do</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/se-podcast-09/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/se-podcast-09/</a>",1448377208
