Starting with a similar config as his (using iperf), the OpenVPN guys went from ~125Mbps to ~500 mbps.<p>That was without kernel tuning, just parameter changing.<p>2) I haven&#x27;t tested this, but if you read the comments within the thread (especially from those made by kasperd his networking device is misconfigured at the kernel level (for his purposes), leading to tons of fragmentation that can be rectified [see: the MTU/MSS discussion in the OP&#x27;s &quot;Read more comments&quot;]. edit: Yep I was right.
