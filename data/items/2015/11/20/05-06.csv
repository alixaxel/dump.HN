That buffer is for data the kernel has received but has <i>not yet been read() by userspace</i>. Seriously, 5MB of RAM dedicated to each socket in the kernel?<p>Assuming these are Nginx proxy connections, why did you choose to tweak a kernel tunable rather than increasing the corresponding userspace application buffer sizes instead?<p>edit: so the answer seems to be that Nginx is wholly reliant on the kernel to handle buffering, which is completely asinine to me, but perhaps there is good rationale here I&#x27;ve somehow missed. The take home becomes &quot;our app stack is so broken we managed to break additional extreme-battle-tested components in a bid to to get it to function sensibly&quot;",1447999107

10599856,comment,10599780,10599780,0,0,joshmlewis,,,"It depends on if these are paying users or not. I&#x27;m assuming yes so the answer is simple, the ones that will pay for it.<p>I heard a great analogy recently that a startup is basically like consulting for a very specific use case of customers in the early days. One of the trickiest thing in building a product users love is figuring out what feedback is fluff and what is real. The best way to determine this is to first see if there are common patterns in the feedback your are getting. If yes, that&#x27;s a good sign. Next is to see if you can get a few of these users to pay for it.<p>If they&#x27;ll pay for it before it&#x27;s even built, you know it&#x27;s a real problem. If it&#x27;s something they will commit to pay for (on paper) once it&#x27;s built, that&#x27;s still good but be more cautious. If you get excuses or any other non-comital response, then it&#x27;s more than likely not something worth building right now.<p>One cautionary note here is to be careful not to go down a rabbit hole for one customer. You don&#x27;t want to start building features that are just applicable to one specific customer early on unless they are paying you a significant amount of money. The ideal scenario for building a software product is to leverage feature requests that multiple users/customer have toward the long-term objectives of the product.",1447998981
10599855,comment,10588704,10599563,0,0,davnicwil,,,"> our current factory style of education is a relatively recent development... Newer is not necessarily better.<p>That may well be, but the breadth and depth of what there is to learn, the sheer number of people being educated, and the communities, societies and professional lives that education is intended to prepare people for, have grown and evolved so much over the past few hundred years, particularly so as we look ever more recently, that I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s much meaning in comparing older styles with new and saying what&#x27;s a better or worse method, without taking it in context.<p>The current system may not seem better but perhaps it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;ve had to adjust things for the worse in order to scale, so that now children are learning 10x less effectively, but have access to let&#x27;s call it a &#x27;potential&#x27; education which is 1000x greater than what existed 100 years ago. I.e they&#x27;re getting a smaller slice of the potential pie, but the potential pie is massively bigger and growing all the time, so they&#x27;re all actually doing better on an absolute scale, even though it seems on the surface like the educational experience is worse.",1447998978

Anyone who is oppressed by living in a Calhoun building, should have first thought about how they&#x27;d feel about spending years on a campus named after a slave trader, putting his name on their résumés and personal history for the rest of their lives, giving money to such an institution (either now, or later as alumni donations), building a career on the name of a man who enslaved their people. Yale has also been funded by slavery[1]. To be honest I had no idea this was the case, but I had a feeling if you dig deep enough, pretty much everything has a past that is looked down upon from the modern view.<p>Bottom line is that if you&#x27;re looking for offense, you&#x27;ll find it everywhere. You can decide to either reboot the entire society because it&#x27;s all irrevocably tainted by people with some negative elements of their legacies, you can choose not to go to Yale because it&#x27;s named after a slaver, or you can accept that it&#x27;s just a name after all and doesn&#x27;t have any actual oppressive effects on your life.<p>[0] <a href=""http://digitalhistories.yctl.org/2014/11/01/elihu-yale-was-a-slave-trader/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalhistories.yctl.org/2014/11/01/elihu-yale-was-a...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.yaleslavery.org/Endowments/e2schol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yaleslavery.org/Endowments/e2schol.html</a>",1447998762

10599838,comment,10599247,10599643,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t clear, I put $1000/month into a savings tagged as &quot;maintenance&quot;, and as maintenance tasks have come up I&#x27;ve deducted from that account to pay for them. Yes, you&#x27;ll go months where you put money in, and then you have to re-roof and it costs you $7,500. And then a lull and then maybe you need to paint the house or replace the rain gutters, etc. In my budget I put the &quot;expected&quot; cost of maintenance to be about $5/square foot per year. And then divided that number by the number of pay periods to get a contribution into that account per paycheck. Since actual maintenance costs turned out to be less than that my maintenance account was running a surplus and growing so I reduced the amount I was contributing.<p>This is a very common way to annualize a very volatile cost, but what it means in practice is you find yourself putting money into the maintenance account when no maintenance needs to be done that month, with the understanding that <i>eventually</i> in the future you&#x27;re going to have a cost which you can then pay out of that account. You don&#x27;t go into debt that way to cover random maintenance expenses, because if you did it right there is always enough money in the account to cover your costs.<p>Granted a string of costs all at once will bite you, but statistically that is not likely to happen.<p>The goal though is to never use credit card debt to finance anything because you pay so much interest on that debt if you can&#x27;t pay it off at the end of the month. And in practice it means putting what seems like all your money into weird &quot;future&quot; accounts (maintenance, food, insurance, taxes, etc) but it also means than when you pay to those expected bills you already have the money to pay them and don&#x27;t have to borrow. You are mailing yourself the funds in the future to cover that cost.",1447998538

If someone calls you names in context of you doing something stupid, then it&#x27;s not abuse, it&#x27;s just being abrasive. Abuse would be had he done it without you giving a reason. And I think we should save the word abuse for the latter (and also perhaps for something where is a profit motive).<p>I mean, every post from Linus where he uses harsh words has some context like that. He just doesn&#x27;t randomly throws insults to his colleagues. You can read the insults as an abuse or you can read them as a big yellow warning signs - your choice.<p>> When those complaints let fly to other ears, they should be phrased a little better.<p>Here the &quot;should&quot; is a cultural choice. It&#x27;s a universal, safe option. It&#x27;s like being polite to people you don&#x27;t know, or being diplomatic in diplomacy.<p>But in the cultural context of kernel development, you&#x27;re already part of the in-group. And in that particular in-group, being called names is normal and accepted by the insiders. That it happens on the Internet, for the outsiders to see, doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the cultural choice was made <i>freely</i> by insiders.<p>And people who prefer the former to the latter (as per my previous post) probably don&#x27;t care to much about being called names when they do stupid thing (being abused, as you call it, but they actually don&#x27;t want to be really abused or tolerate it either) - because with that mentality, it&#x27;s results or your own improvement that matters, not so much who is polite.

You and ~500 of your neighbors are all on one local node that shares bandwidth between everyone. The way it works for upload is that your cable modem sends a request for an upload timeslot on a shared upload channel, then the CMTS which serves thousands upon thousands of people sends back your time slot when your modem is clear to use the upload channel. If anything goes screwy on your node such as significant interference or if your cable modem somehow hung up and was constantly  sending on the upload channel outside of its time slot this means that absolutely everyone on the same node looses service. Not only can it affect a ton of customers all at once, your ISP doesn&#x27;t have a good way of tracking down interference at a finer granularity than the node level which isn&#x27;t a lot to go off of. They literally have to do a binary search by disconnecting sections of the local node and seeing what segment the interference is coming from. I&#x27;ve heard horror stories about interference coming from things like washing machines, treadmills, etc and being very intermittent and nearly impossible to find because of it. For the treadmill story, a whole node of customers would loose service for 15 minutes every couple of nights and whenever the ISP would get a technician out to start trying to isolate it, they&#x27;d already be off the treadmill and the problem would be over. Supposedly it took a while of having a tech in the area around when it normally started to track down which house it was coming from.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s your modem, but they won&#x27;t let you use their network unless you&#x27;re using one of their approved modems that they know are reliable and that they can manage updates on because just one person can unknowingly screw it over for a large chunk of people.",1447997161

10599697,comment,10583884,10592093,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"What I was getting at is that the original comment under which we are discussing was suggesting that &quot;having tests&quot; was a reason to not use the project ... and that&#x27;s poor reasoning. To your points specifically, I&#x27;m saying the existence of tests does nothing to provide any meaningful, dependable, worthwhile benefits.<p>Regarding a couple of your points ...<p>- How can tests at all help a developer remember anything about their code in the future? That&#x27;s what documentation is for.<p>- Sure, tests can help quickly identify bugs. Tests are supposed to identify when a problem has been introduced, or verify that code meets expectations. But that itself depends on the tests being correct.<p>- To depend on tests, you need meaningful, accurate tests that were properly thought out and implemented. If a project has tests, but those tests were poorly thought out, don&#x27;t adequately cover complicated, critical parts of code, what good are they?<p>- Sure, peace of mind <i>can</i> come from proper testing. However, that requires the tests to actually be <i>proper</i>. What does that mean? How does that get defined and implemented? Designing and implementing tests is, in my opinion, quite different from writing some code that does a thing--especially as the complexity of the code increases.<p>- That tests exist for a project, or that tests are absent from a project, is to me a poor reasoning for using or not using a given project. This was the original commenter&#x27;s point--that the project would not be used <i>because it did not have tests</i>. That tells absolutely zilch about the quality and dependability of the project. Moreover, if tests did exist, and one wanted to judge whether or not to use a project, one would need to actually read the tests, and the code they test, and then determine if the tests properly cover what matters. At least then, the original commenter may have been adding something helpful to the discussion. Identifying that a project&#x27;s tests do not actually provide any meaningful proofs is an important thing to do. I don&#x27;t think too many people actually do that when they judge a project on the <i>existence</i> of tests.<p><i>Full disclosure of my own related weakness:</i><p>For me, the existence of documentation is a much more important metric for decisions on whether to use a project or not. But if I were to say, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t have (or does have) docs; will therefore use/not use&quot;, I&#x27;m not really making much of a quality decision here. That&#x27;s why I actually check out the docs. I read them and see whether they actually cover enough material to use a project, or if they are hastily written and not a reliable help. However, sometimes there aren&#x27;t formal docs at all. So, I might take a look at the code, and find incredibly well-documented code in comments throughout the project. If I just make a decision to reject a project based on the maxim &quot;doesn&#x27;t have docs&quot;, I wind up missing that there actually is extensive documentation ... just not where I may have been looking.<p>The same should be done for tests, I think.",1447996135

(but all the MBAs in eh 1990s would say &quot;macs don&#x27;t have enough market share&quot; and kill mac versions, even though in cases where companies did do cross platform they often made all their profits on the mac, and had the larger sales of the PC washed away by the much larger support costs for PC customers.)",1447995696

Since all the supermarkets price match these days, they&#x27;ve settled on £2.25. Oraganic will set you back over £3.50. It seem the eggs I buy now from Morrisons are &quot;Very Large&quot; which have a slight premium for the size. If you shop at Waitrose then you&#x27;re looking at £3-4.50.<p>When I can, I buy from farms which sell by the roadside and you can normally get a half-dozen for £1.30 or so.",1447995621
