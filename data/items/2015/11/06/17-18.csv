A ton of things can only be done by resorting to NSString functions and that, I think, requires the String being copied into a UTF-16 representation underneath. Or does it? I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s exactly the problem.<p>The idea of putting grapheme clusters at the center of the string universe is great when it comes to text that users see and manipulate. It&#x27;s excellent for writing word processors.<p>But it is not convenient for analysing large amounts of text data or for parsing semi structured text formats where we have a lot of fixed length stuff that could be conveniently accessed using numeric slice indexes.<p>I think Swift&#x27;s String class would work very well as a view on top of a UTF-8 buffer.",1446832752

Government <i>can</i> operate without the same currency as is used in the non-government markets.  Government <i>can</i> fund most of its core functions by creation of fiat currency.  Government <i>can</i> be run on sources of revenue other than taxation.<p>(Some of these implicitly assume a certain definition of &quot;government&quot;.  Some people might say that an organization that does not tax is not a government.  Others may define the &quot;governmentness&quot; of an organization by different criteria.  My definition allows for governments that cannot or do not tax.)<p>That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that any system that demonstrates such possibilities would be subjectively better than anything already seen in practice.  So far, I am aware of no controlled experiment that has tested any those hypotheses.  It might not even be possible to run one.  Sometimes the answer to a yes-no question is &quot;I don&#x27;t know [yet].&quot;<p>I have no knowledge of the truth of the hypotheses.  I don&#x27;t know whether a taxing government is objectively necessary or not.  The anecdotal historical evidence suggests that it is not, but also that any society that lacks a government tax is eventually undermined and overwhelmed by a society that has a tax.  The tax funds warfare, either as military, economic, or both.  If you don&#x27;t contribute to professional soldiers or financiers voluntarily, your people get conquered, assimilated, indebted, or enslaved, and have to do it anyway.<p>Aside from that, in most cases, it is reasonable to reason from a point where you assume one or more untested or untestable statements to be true, but you should be aware that you are not covering the entire problem space.<p>Assuming that taxation is necessary, it should be possible to say that there exists a system of taxation that is most fair among all systems of taxation.  But you cannot then say that is the fairest possible system, because you have not even investigated any system that does not employ taxation.<p>So if you cannot imagine any such system for the purposes of comparison, your lack of imagination may indirectly be making the world less fair than it could be.",1446832693

I received most of my math education in the US (I was a math major in college as well), and my high school calculus textbook (this was in the US) was very open about how some of the problems were there to be <i>tackled</i> rather than solved.  There were almost always a few problems at the end of the chapter that weren&#x27;t easily solvable without the principles and techniques that would be introduced in the next chapter.  You might be able to estimate it, brute force it, various other things… who knows, maybe you&#x27;d discover the next chapter for yourself.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s an excellent approach.  It does sound like Singapore is doing this much earlier in math education than I encountered it in the US.<p>In spite of all this, I don&#x27;t see the technique as being especially promising in the US.  Not because I think it&#x27;s a bad approach - I think it is an excellent one.

(They all have excuses.) I dislike giving homework assignments, and while a lot of people advocate the contract side project (like this guy), I dislike those as well because they take a lot of time and effort. If I wanted to be a contractor, I&#x27;d be a contractor, and if I wanted to hire a contractor, I&#x27;d hire a contractor. The paperwork and commitment involved is pretty great, and if we assume that Hansson accepts 150 applications, rejects 80% of candidates out of hand, and the remaining 20% send in code samples (or are required to write code samples), then that&#x27;s still 30 candidates that I have to spend time talking to and reviewing code and potentially doing contract paperwork, only to reject 29 of them in the end.

Numbers are randomly chosen from 1 of 2 ranges.  One range is from 0-10, the other is 0-100.  The numbers are:<p>4 3 1 8 5 2 7<p>Which range were the numbers chosen from?  It could be either, but statistically the answer would be from 0-10, since if they were chosen from 0-100 the chances of all of the numbers being lower than 10 is very low.<p>Now, say you didn&#x27;t know the ranges ahead of time, and the numbers were:<p>117, 232, 122, 173, 167, 12, 168, 204, 4, 229<p>Now, the upper bound can&#x27;t be 100 or 200, since there is a 232. So it is at LEAST 232.<p>Which is more likely, that the upper bound is 256, 500 or 1000 ?<p>Intuitively you can assume that if it was 500+, you would expect at least one number in the 300-500 range.<p>The highest number should be 232 + some amount that is inline with all the other numbers.  It could be exactly 232, but the chances that you happened to pick the highest number itself is also low.<p>Basically you are solving this problem:<p>If you were going to select 10 numbers at random from a range of 0 to N, how high should N be so that there is a high probability that the highest number you select is only 232.<p>Since a uniform distribution is assumed, you are basically just adding one more uniformly distributed data point.",1446832244

Human-readable text, file paths, SQL statements, and others are all conceptually different, and this should be represented as different types at the language level. I think that having different conceptual kinds of strings be distinct types would eliminate a lot of bugs. I&#x27;m not aware of any language or standard library that does this, though.)<p>There are many sub types which can be constructed from strings.  Most languages treat at least following as special types that can be constructed from/to strings:<p>* numeric types (integer, float, etc)\n* regular expressions\n* file paths\n* dates\n* XML\n* JSON<p>The real absence is SQL.

As the sample size goes up, the sample statistic will converge to the population statistic, due to the Law of Large Numbers. Because serial numbers are natural numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) they are uniformly distributed from 1 through N-hat (the population maximum), and the convergence of the sample statistic to the population statistic will scale inversely to the sample size.<p>Let&#x27;s take the example in the order it was given in the article: 117, 232, 122, 173, 167, 12, 168, 204, 4, 229<p>First step we would project the maximum to be 117 + 117 / 1 - 1 = 233. Or, if we drew 1 sample from the population, we would expect the &quot;maximum&quot; to be the average case -- the population mean. We take a minus 1 because there&#x27;s a degree of freedom lost in using the maximum twice in the same formula (handwaving a bit, but that&#x27;s a straightforward enough answer for now).<p>With the second case, we have 232 + 232 / 2 - 1, or 347. We would intuitively expect two cases to effectively be distributed evenly across the population, or at 1/3 and 2/3. (The statistics is a bit different due to the MAX operator here, but I won&#x27;t go into that).<p>With the third case, we have 232 + 232 / 3 -1 = 309. Note that while this statistic is still higher than the actual population statistic, it is still converging due to the additional case that helps us counterbalance the weight of the previous unusually-high sample case we observed.<p>Does that help?",1446831819

Can&#x27;t always say the same with Android.<p>- It does notifications the right way in that it has updates on the app tiles in addition to the drop down. So if you dismiss it from the drop down the number will still be present in the app (I constantly dismissed all notifications in Android and it would take some time to figure out what app had a notification I accidentally dismissed).<p>- The development environment is second to none. It&#x27;s so easy to get started, build, deploy and your app can work on a mobile phone, tablet, computer and even a freaking gaming console. Single software project!<p>- Live tiles are awesome; basically a nice and easy way to do widgets that iOS sorely lacks but forces them to be more uniform so you don&#x27;t have oddly styled widgets like you run into on occasion in Android<p>- Cortana is more open than Google Now and Siri and was the first assistant that could help you with things regarding contacts and locations (&quot;Remind me to tell my wife I love her the next time I talk to her&quot; works)<p>I&#x27;m not disillusioned though; I&#x27;m pretty sure it lacks stuff that some of the other OSes have I just don&#x27;t really remember off hand as it&#x27;s been a year since I&#x27;ve used it. But it&#x27;s an incredible little OS that, with the newest phones, you can plugin in a monitor and keyboard and bam, you&#x27;re using the same applications in a desktop view (so it&#x27;s not enlarging the mobile app; you get the same menus that you get on the desktop).<p>If it had most of the apps I use every day I would move to it.",1446831798

And yes in practice marginal demand of the dollar would skew this percentage somewhat, but it would still be insignificant.<p>You did not answer if you were convinced by my thought experiment, are you?<p>About your thought experiment: what you describe has actually happened many times in history, and many of these currencies had a floating exchange rate and could not be used to pay taxes, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency</a> Turns out they had value, like Bitcoin.",1446830040

But from their point of view it was the absolute right thing to do. High end consumer laptops are dominated by Apple (heck IBM is buying Apple and giving them to all their workers, something like 300K Mac Book Pro&#x27;s). Everything else is racing to the bottom with thinner and thinner margins. Windows running laptops have to compete with Asus and friends and the money just wasn&#x27;t there.<p>Not sure about OS/2 much, don&#x27;t remember the history. But with POWER, IBM has kind of started to turn around in the last few years.<p>At some point in the past they have made an explicit choice to not play in the consumer market. Heck, there used to be IBM stores, you&#x27;d walk in and buy IBM products like you go to an Apple store now. But they decided they don&#x27;t want to play in that market (or better or for worse). We&#x27;ll still see how it ends up working out.<p>So far it still stays in business after hundreds of years, maybe it just luck or there is something to its business approach. (Fun fact, it used to sell cheese slicers and time tracking devices as well at some point).",1446829301
