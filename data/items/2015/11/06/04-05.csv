Monopolistic competition like e.g. Uber vs. Lyft is an exceptional case for technology; the expectation is that if you succeed at all you will probably be in complete control until the technology ecosystem itself shifts.<p>There is a second half to this, of course, which is that the type of people who found a fast-moving VC-backed startup are so deeply enmeshed in their plans for the company that they will put themselves into an unsustainable overdrive and expect everyone around them to do the same. Their enthusiasm can be entirely real and still be basically toxic and lacking in conservative sensibility. There are a lot of commonalities among founder personalities, IME.",1446784157

He believes that many of our ancestors not directly tied to his grandfather were partially Cherokee, and consistently under-reported. There were penalizations for various degrees of Indian blood, not just a binary thing, so this was quite common.<p>There were also apparently a lot of mixed-blood Cherokee/Scot or Irish ca. 1800 in southern Appalachia before Removal, and some of them were very successful. One of our ancestors, Chief Vann [1], became very wealthy though he was allegedly quite the drunken terror. He lead a sort of clan or tribe of Cherokees, mixed-bloods and some slaves that were associated with a Moravian mission/school (who took civil records that my dad has found on ancestry.com). Apparently there was a fair amount of mixing, as well as a lot if first-cousin marriages and possibly closer interbreeding that may have been a bloodline-perpetuation thing or may have been due to geographical or cultural isolation. I think the setup might actually be similar to modern small chiefdoms in Afghanistan. Vann was incidentally killed because of his bad behavior, in a way that reminds me of the fate of western Florida&#x27;s Edgar J Watson [2] that Peter Matthiessen wrote so masterfully about[3].<p>But that&#x27;s digressing a little bit...<p>By now, though, there has been enough dilution in my family that I don&#x27;t think I would be any more than 1/8th; I think I&#x27;m probably more around 1.5/16ths. My mother&#x27;s family, though having been in the Ozarks since the 1840s or so, has no indication of non-European blood.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vann"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vann</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chokoloskee,_Florida"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chokoloskee,_Florida</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/home/matthiessen-watson.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/home/matthiessen-wats...</a>",1446782726

Most of it is adhoc, and people usually tend to stick to `curl | bash` (I&#x27;m guilty of this as well with dokku and other OS projects).",1446782696

It has very little to do with being an &quot;artist&quot;, it has to do with a broad and humanistic--opposing mechanistic--education. Such an education, in my experience, tends to make one interested in creation, and perhaps thus art, but isn&#x27;t directly related. I have a CS degree and was fortunate to luck into a liberal education--one with grounding in literature, history, economics, sociology, and political science. Not only does it make me better at my day job, because much of it is easily applicable, but it makes me able to meaningfully parse the world around me. Most engineers I know are not particularly good at this--they do not have a liberal education and it shows when one gets outside of a narrow band of small, usually very self-focused interests. (It shows, in the aggressive disregard of history and the corpus of human experience needed to think that the Austrian school, or even your garden-variety libertarian fantasy, has bearing on the real world.)<p>Your &quot;merely utilitarian&quot; person is not equipped to understand (much less solve) the causes of the problems that she describes. <i>That&#x27;s her point entirely.</i>",1446782583
