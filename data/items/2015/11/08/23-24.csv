My grandparents lived on the country-side, working the land and during the communists Romania did not have much access to the vast quantities of pesticides and fertilizer that the US was left with after WWII, due to a large surplus of ammonium nitrate and of various poison gases. Our animals were not fed and grown on cheap, subsidized corn and kept alive with antibiotics. Our diary products were not low fat. Our white flour was given for export. Etc, etc.. And guess what, after 1990, after the revolution, when we started importing food and adopting the &quot;western diet&quot;, we ended up with the same shock like everybody else ... people getting fatter, increased rates of type II diabetes, increased rates of coronary artery disease, etc. And most importantly I think - our food is losing its taste, because vegetables grown with pesticides and artificial fertilizers have shallower root systems, grow faster and thus are unable to gather the same amount of nutrients as vegetables grown normally and in season. Same goes for animals, like cattle or pigs or chicken, raised on corn and kept alive with antibiotics.<p>In regards to your statement, organic food is the <i>conventional</i> way to produce food, and note that I&#x27;m not talking about any standard, but about how people have been growing food before we discovered what fossil fuels are good for.<p>There&#x27;s actually plenty of evidence to go around, plenty of studies, showing links between the western diet and type II diabetes, heart disease, obesity, cancer, with my father&#x27;s PhD thesis being one, evidence that has been ignored because it flies in the face of the low-fat bullshit we&#x27;ve been fed, plus it goes against a multi-billion dollar industry. Artificial fertilizers are also known to be responsible for the destruction of our environment, leading to such effects as water pollution with nitrate or acidification of the soil.",1447027125

10530585,comment,10529422,10530370,0,0,lpolovets,,,"> Sure, but humans care more about the median value than the expected value. See also the St. Petersburg paradox. Expected value is infinite, but general consensus is that it&#x27;s irrational to pay more than a couple of dollars to play the game.<p>Not sure I agree with that. Simple thought experiment: would you prefer &quot;$100&quot; or &quot;51% chance at $0, 49% chance at $1000&quot;? I strongly suspect you&#x27;d prefer the latter, even though the median for that scenario is $0. My argument isn&#x27;t that every startup might be the next Uber and that as a result you should take whatever stock you can get; it&#x27;s that on average, startups increase in value (otherwise both startups and venture capital would quickly die), so stock has a positive EV. Not in the &quot;99.9% chance it&#x27;s $0, .1% chance it&#x27;s Uber&quot; sense, but in the 50% chance 0, 40% chance 2x, 10% chance 10x sense (which is pretty reasonable, especially if you work for 5 or 10 startups during your career).<p>> How should I judge the exit multiple? Especially for a late-stage company, isn&#x27;t it generally reasonable to estimate it as 1x?<p>VCs are generally looking for 3x-4x returns on average, and they&#x27;ll never invest in a startup if the expected value isn&#x27;t at least 3x-4x based on some estimated probability distribution. So the expected exit multiple is usually at least 3x or so.<p>The later stage you go, the more predictable and narrow the exit distribution becomes. For example, pre-product, a VC might be investing on the 2% chance that something will go up 200x. Post-launch but pre-revenue, a VC might be looking for a 5% chance of a 60x. Series A or B, it might be more like 40% chance that the VC at least gets their money back and 30% chance they&#x27;ll make 10x. Growth stage, it might be more like 60% chance the VC doesn&#x27;t lose any money, 30% chance it&#x27;s a 5x. In all of these cases, expected value might be 2x-4x, but variance drops off drastically as a company matures. (Seed VCs are usually aiming for more like 4x-5x for their funds, while a late stage VC is aiming for 3x, so the lower variance is compensated by lower expected returns.)",1447026453

The changes in the lede of this article --- no more artificial colors, no antibiotics in poultry, emulsifiers with friendlier names --- are marginal. Many of them, like the food colorings, are probably there to satisfy a market demand in the first place (not for the additives, but for the shelf-stable properties they impart on the food) --- if the market would rather have white cheese rather than radioactive orange, why spend the extra 0.5c per package to make them orange? By and large, these aren&#x27;t &quot;seismic&quot; changes. Marked changes in macronutrient content would be, but that mostly hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>Great example: shifts from high-fructose corn syrup to &quot;natural&quot; sweeteners (an almost entirely cosmetic change that puts minimal disruption on the supply chain), or to &quot;gluten free&quot; products.<p>2. One seemingly enduring and significant change in the food industry is the move away from &quot;liquid calories&quot;. Low-fat, Atkins, Paleo, juice cleanse, whatever: regardless of the fad, the conclusion that sweetened soft drinks are practically toxic has probably stuck. &quot;Americans are drinking less soda&quot; makes for a less sexy lede, though.<p>3. The major shift I see isn&#x27;t in how people eat, but rather in how the same stuff we&#x27;ve always eaten is marketed to us. Maybe it&#x27;s gotten easier to handle distribution logistics, or to bring new products to market, but there are a zillion more brands. Where in 1980 we might have had one or two category-killing brands for any given snack, frozen meal, or beverage, we now have 100 different brands --- most of them owned by one of a few major companies.<p>But again, that&#x27;s got less to do with &quot;how people eat&quot; and more to do with market segmentation: given a roughly stable COGS for, say, microwaveable frozen dinner entrees, customers today get to choose based on things like loyalty to childhood favorite brands, or &quot;organic&quot; labeling, or &quot;low-carb&quot;, or &quot;ancient grains&quot;.<p>Multiply serving size by calories/fats/carbs/proteins/fiber per serving, though, and my guess is that it mostly doesn&#x27;t matter which one you choose.<p>4. If that (3) is the case, it doesn&#x27;t really much matter that consumers are shunning iconic American food brands. They&#x27;re substituting them for niche brands that are now or soon will be owned by PepsiCo or Kraft.<p>Any discussion of how Americans buy food they prepare at home probably has to include a discussion of Whole Foods, which has in the last decade gone from a specialty store to one of the largest grocery store chains in the country. But look around at a WFM next time you visit, and notice what percentage of the store is allocated to produce, dairy, and meat, and what percentage is allocated to frozen meals, snacks, and prepared foods. The biggest difference between a WFM and a Safeway isn&#x27;t the size of the produce section (many &quot;conventional&quot; grocers have bigger produce sections), but rather the size of the prepared foods section, where you can stop in and buy a pizza, a pre-cooked chicken, or a deli of potato salad.",1447025686

Although with health benefits you may be able to negotiate a slightly better rate per employee at scale. But employment taxes, etc.. are always the same with one employee or 10,000.<p>If you start getting into exotic benefits (i.e. free meals, transportation, dry cleaning, etc...) the costs could be higher.

They are prescribed although not as often as in America by the sounds of things. I think Valium is the most prescribed but only for short term use in the cases of anxiety and related issues.",1447023919

You can ask for several but you&#x27;ll get weird looks from people. The end result is that anyone that votes in fringe options is effectively identified because no one else asks for those options.<p>The person that told me this was competely oblivious to any problem with it.

Given that corporations have capital, they&#x27;re the ones who matter. People, especially the disadvantaged ones who lack capital, are not important. Justice means the service of capital.
