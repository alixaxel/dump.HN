I would categorize the NSA spying as moderate-high risk (to you) due to their extremely high frequency. Yes, the severity to you will be relatively moderate (chilling effect, etc), but the cumulative, unrelenting effect it has is incredible.<p>As I&#x27;m thinking about this more, it&#x27;s not even a true &quot;risk,&quot; because risk always entails uncertainty. You are certainly being affected by it. The true <i>risk</i> of the spying program is that somehow you are hung by your own words, which has an extremely high severity (prison aka slavery). I hope that this rings true to you. Rereading what I&#x27;ve written, it seems like I could be projecting a lot of my own feelings and experiences onto you, but this stuff is just so universal in its effects.<p>Thanks for discussing this!

For example, at the 2 startups I&#x27;ve worked for, there was no traditional job application, so no questions about criminal history or background check. Early stage startups are typically so focused on finding product market fit, and not on HR policies. Getting in early will let you bypass even having to answer questions about your criminal record.<p>Freelancing is the other option, since working for yourself means you don&#x27;t have to answer to someone else about your criminal background.",1446943978

10526888,comment,10525846,10525846,0,0,dang,,,"From my perspective the startup world turned a corner on this a few years ago. Bragging or signalling about hours worked is no longer fashionable. That&#x27;s why an article like this one produces an instant rage-thread with literally zero favorable comments: we&#x27;re looking at light from a star that actually left several years ago, though the current article would probably have sounded tone-deaf even then.<p>It would be interesting to see accurate data on whether startup employees work fewer hours than they used to. I&#x27;d be surprised if they were by much; self-reported numbers were chronically inflated in the first place because it was fashionable to do so. What&#x27;s new is the cultural consensus that optimizing for raw hours is wrong and that raw hours don&#x27;t equate to productivity. Those were always truisms, but they&#x27;re truisms that the culture has now settled on, which seems good.<p>Edit: one trend that doesn&#x27;t get commented on as much is the fragmentation of the workday: i.e. working hours are less likely to be in a single contiguous block and more likely to be scattered through the day, evenings, and weekends, even if total hours worked are no higher. The problem in this case isn&#x27;t raw quantity, it&#x27;s not getting away from work for a long-enough stretch and so not getting any regenerative context switch. Hopefully this will get discussed more and studied.",1446943952

Medallions were artificially limited to 13,000 in this city of 8 million where many people do not own cars and use mass transit and taxis.

Probably because it&#x27;s interchangable with threatening to murder someone. Note that the provided law doesn&#x27;t mention the actual fighting OF a duel.",1446941475
