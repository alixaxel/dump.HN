Our newer apps tend to be written with containerization in mind, though we also wanted and are porting older/legacy apps to take advantage of containers.<p>1. I somewhat liked 12factor&#x27;s env-vars-as-config for its simplicity and ease of use but there are limits to its flat key-value string-only structure, not to mention the debatable security concerns that may arise when storing secrets in them.<p>2. Some apps, esp legacy ones, need files for their config, especially those that are costly/harder to rewrite/reintegrate. Config files benefit from being easily versioned, can be templated (Ansible&#x27;s jinja ftw!), not to mention the richness of syntax/structure in can give (xml/yml/json/bin/etc).<p>3. We sometimes do a hybrid approach of doing a &quot;source envfile.sh && exec binscript&quot; as entrypoint of our containers, with envfile living in a mounted volume, managed by a CM tool.<p>4. There are lots of innovation here in specialized tools such as confd/etcd/consul/skydns but completely agree that versioning is a real concern. I like the heroku/deis-style approach of creating a new release for each change in the config. Bonus points to easy rollback on a previously working config (whatever system you&#x27;re using, be it env files or config files).<p>5. As with projects/whole-stacks of multiple containers/hosts, I like the rancher/maestro-ng/docker-compose style of managing your system stack. Next wishlist for this would be a stack with support for pinned versioned docker images + smart rollback/rollfwd support for each config change anywhere in the stack.<p>Ansible filled this gap for us: we have a git repo per project, various playbooks for deployment/lifecycle-management of docker containers, with multiple environments supported (dev/qa/prod using same playbook), support for multiple maintainers and secrets management via ansible-vault.\nThis is workable for us on a few projects, with small scale/set of hosts/containers.",1448654191

10638614,comment,10636818,10637740,0,0,chongli,,,"Not true for pretty much all of that. A great deal of the advances made by the Romans were simply unworkable in Northern Europe. Roman concrete, for example, depended on volcanic pozzolanic ash which was not available further north. Roman agriculture was based on simple scratch ploughs that took advantage of the sandy soils around the Mediterranean. To work the hard, dense soils of the north required the invention of the heavy carruca, leading to a dramatic increase in food production and a population explosion through the middle ages.<p>You can keep on going down the list. Medieval poetry and literature developed extensively into forms we take for granted within our modern culture. The ideas of chivalry, nobility, and courtly love are so deeply ingrained within our society that we take them for granted.<p>As for architecture? Come on!

Well, that was always a bit fishy anyway for more than just a <i>differential</i>, i.e., partial derivative, view.<p>In some important applications, e.g., with some really complicated\nbiomedical data, \ninstead of so much emphasis on the coefficients, what is really needed\nis a <i>model</i> with some accurate predictions.  So to get such predictions, we can drop the emphasis on just traditional regression analysis and interpreting\nits coefficients and, instead,  use much more general means of <i>model building</i>.<p>Relevant old approaches have been Fourier methods for band limited smoothing and interpolation, multivariate least squares spline interpolation, and categorical data analysis, e.g., <i>logistic</i> regression with <i>log-linear</i> going way back in the math for the social sciences.<p>Then Breiman and others did <i>Classification and Regression Trees</i> -- a.k.a., CART for which there is software.  In  short, build a tree:  Start at the root node.  Take the input data and partition it into two collections, put each collection in a node that is a child of the root node, and fit each collection separately.  Then split those two nodes similarly.<p>Then maybe have a good fit\nto the data and good predicted\nvalues.  However, \nhave lost the considerable \nadvantages of traditional regression analysis, but also didn&#x27;t have or use the sometimes severe assumptions of that old analysis.<p>With traditional regression, had\na lot in statistical hypothesis\ntests, etc., to evaluate the\n<i>quality</i> of the work, but with\nthe tree, etc. don&#x27;t have such things.<p>So, for the tree, evaluate the\nquality by seeing how accurate\nthe model is on a second collection\nof data, <i>test data</i>, <i>statistically similar</i>\nto the first collection used\nto find the tree.  If \nthe model is accurate on\nthe test data, then maybe\nhave some good work.<p>Else try again and then\ndo some more statistical\nwork to avoid a case of\njust getting a <i>spurious</i> fit\nfrom just trying until got\n<i>lucky</i>.<p>Since \nI have a lot of respect for\nBreiman, I&#x27;m willing to\ntake seriously whatever he\nwrote.",1448654112

10638593,comment,10637980,10638296,0,0,mtgx,,,"No. It will <i>never</i> be effective. Here&#x27;s why:<p>> <i>Let&#x27;s look at some numbers. We&#x27;ll be optimistic -- we&#x27;ll assume the system has a one in 100 false-positive rate (99 percent accurate), and a one in 1,000 false-negative rate (99.9 percent accurate). Assume 1 trillion possible indicators to sift through: that&#x27;s about 10 events -- e-mails, phone calls, purchases, web destinations, whatever -- per person in the United States per day. Also assume that 10 of them are actually terrorists plotting.<p>This unrealistically accurate system will generate 1 billion false alarms for every real terrorist plot it uncovers. Every day of every year, the police will have to investigate 27 million potential plots in order to find the one real terrorist plot per month. Raise that false-positive accuracy to an absurd 99.9999 percent and you&#x27;re still chasing 2,750 false alarms per day -- but that will inevitably raise your false negatives, and you&#x27;re going to miss some of those 10 real plots.<p>This isn&#x27;t anything new. In statistics, it&#x27;s called the &quot;base rate fallacy,&quot; and it applies in other domains as well. For example, even highly accurate medical tests are useless as diagnostic tools if the incidence of the disease is rare in the general population. Terrorist attacks are also rare, any &quot;test&quot; is going to result in an endless stream of false alarms.<p>This is exactly the sort of thing we saw with the NSA&#x27;s eavesdropping program: the New York Times reported that the computers spat out thousands of tips per month. Every one of them turned out to be a false alarm.<p>And the cost was enormous -- not just for the FBI agents running around chasing dead-end leads instead of doing things that might actually make us safer, but also the cost in civil liberties. The fundamental freedoms that make our country the envy of the world are valuable, and not something that we should throw away lightly.</i><p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/03/why_data_mining_wont.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2005/03/why_data_mi...</a>",1448653732

Because they know when to listen to their subordinates, and don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be the loudest to command attention when they do speak.<p>They don&#x27;t need to be a jerk, or rely on bullying - for this is morale destroying counterproductive pettiness, and again unnecessary when it comes to commanding attention and respect.  It might not chase away all of your talent, but it will chase away some of it, who will leave for greener pastures where they&#x27;re respected.<p>In my experience, the &quot;Rock star dev who&#x27;s also a jerk&quot; was both the worst leader <i>and</i> the worst dev.  They wrote a bunch of short sighted hacks - making them &quot;productive&quot; &quot;rock stars&quot; - that constantly broke things that other people had to fix.  They were quick to assume their half baked ideas of how to proceed were the one true way - and that you were an idiot for thinking otherwise - and quick to dismiss any and all concerns about things they overlooked in their plans.  It was bad enough that the best way to get anything done ended up being to hide it from the &quot;rock star dev who&#x27;s also a jerk&quot;.  This is the antithesis of what good leadership should result in.  That they were too busy doing development to do any real leadership was perhaps a blessing.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the ideal leader can&#x27;t ever be loud, or stern, or a dev.  These can all be useful qualities at times.  But they&#x27;re not &quot;a jerk&quot;, and may find they have less time available to spend on development in response to the burdens of leadership.",1448651251

There&#x27;s just too much data to analyze and keyword based searches are a weak tool.<p>You also need to realize that people that were doing unpleasant surveillance in parked cars, at night, trying to figure out what a known arms dealer was up to, are now enjoying the comfort of a desk, looking at a database of intercepted SMSes that don&#x27;t make any sense, and waiting for the shift to end.",1448651177
10638429,comment,10634994,10634994,0,0,LukaAl,,,"This article is very interesting but fails to address one point. Why companies go for &quot;Flat&quot; or &quot;Holocracy&quot; organizations? I know three reasons:<p>- People tend to hate managers, they don&#x27;t trust them.<p>- Flat team are faster removing the management complexity.<p>- There&#x27;s more flexibility and more creativity around the problem tackled by the team.<p>The last reason is reasonable but is true applied for small unit inside the bigger organization, not the whole organization, as this article explains well. Nothing prevent to create a small unit with a specific task inside a bigger organization and to organize this unit (usually made by &quot;star&quot; employee) in a flat structure.<p>The second reason is disputable, it doesn&#x27;t scale has the article suggest.<p>But the first reason is not addressed. And it is the real issue. I think everyone had terrible bosses and great bosses. We usually remember terrible managers as an example of the average managers (Mental association: Dilbert&#x27;s Pointy Hair Boss) while we consider the great bosses we had as mentors, role models, guide. And we forget that they were also our manager. It is a form of selection bias.<p>There&#x27;s also another issue at play, changing organizational structure, trying Flat or Holocracy is easy (I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s easy to do it right, it&#x27;s easy to give it a try). Promoting the right person, with the right skills is difficult. And if you promote the wrong person (it happens) removing from a managerial position or moving him to a position that is a better fit is extremely difficult. So we all decide to do what is easy instead of what is difficult. Not sure I could blame someone, it is the people mindset, but doesn&#x27;t mean that what is easy is also correct while what is difficult, when done right, proved to be correct.",1448651176
