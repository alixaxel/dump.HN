Car sales are about to have one of their best years <i>ever</i>. We had such a bad downturn coupled with bad economic news from Europe then China.

You may have more luck finding these in the US than I had in the EU, but in any case I wasn&#x27;t able to find anything that hooks up to a computer in a non-proprietary way. As with home automation, all products seem to sync to the cloud, most of them in a one-way fashion.<p>I lost track of this idea a few years ago, so the situation may have changed. But if it hasn&#x27;t, I see the following options for you:<p>1) find a cloud-synced scale that offers an SDK or at least some way of retrieving the data from the cloud.<p>2) buy a low-cost digital scale, take it apart and see what you can do with a voltmeter and a soldering iron. At the very least, you should be able to hook into the raw analog weight data which you could feed to a Pi with an A/D board. The nicer solution would be to siphon off the digital value. Even in scales where one chip does everything you could still try to pick up data going to the LCD. However, that might require some epic cabling and soldering, not sure it&#x27;s worth it.<p>3) cheesing it: hook up a networked camera and point it to the scale&#x27;s display. You can do this with any old android phone and a remote webcam app. Have the software on the Pi (or some other computer) pull the image when you step on the scale, run OCR on it, write the value out to wherever you want.",1448592752

Although if you have any ideas they are all ears.<p>On siphoning - from experience, there&#x27;s much more of a continuum than you think. You don&#x27;t have a major actor supporting banks, you have a major actor supporting the economy by attempting to set a rate that does, in fact, have to be set (it&#x27;s mechanically how these things work), by somebody. All they&#x27;re doing is trying to follow the natural rate of interest, which is influenced by demand and demographics more than anything (see: Global Savings Glut; Secular Stagnation Hypothesis). So if that benefits the banks, it&#x27;s only a side effect of the economy not collapsing. The banks are how we, as a society, allocate resources to each other.

It&#x27;s fundamental power is that anybody can publish because the network doesn&#x27;t differentiate between &quot;publishing&quot; hosts and &quot;consumer&quot; hosts.

That alone is not terribly interesting - because I probably want to run it on my production cluster - not some standalone image.<p>I can edit the configuration - but this introduces dependencies on my particular environment (is it AWS, GCE, VMWare, bare metal, etc.)?<p>What I find compelling about Kubernetes (which to my mind is much more interesting than Docker alone) - is that it attempts to abstract at a much higher level.  In theory (yet to be proved in battle...) I can deploy a k8 configuration on any number of environments, and the &quot;description&quot; ( a bunch of k8 yaml files), is the same.<p>Is Docker being hyped beyond belief? Yes, but I do think there is something significant about containerization.",1448590008

In college the teachers have been really dismal at reaching any kind of usefulness.

The machine I mentioned sits inside a supermarket and is definitely cleaned every day, it&#x27;s always pristine. Most contamination comes from fruit  surfaces anyway, if they are properly washed there is no danger. Also if you look up incidents of food poisoning from juice, they all happened with the industrialised/pasteurised ones, as a result of the handling/storage/transport. Most humans eat fresh fruit during their entire lives, there is nothing to worry about :)",1448589935

Regardless of the content or how annoying it is, whenever someone&#x27;s phone alerts/buzzes with new content, they tend to look. Though this is anecdotal, I can recall friends even in the tech field who would pull out the phone mid conversation to get a notification from Facebook or from a shopping app offering a 10% discount; they&#x27;d look, complain about the annoyance, put it away, and then repeat as soon as the next notification popped up.<p>This is a bit of a tinfoil hat theory, but I suspect that the entire structure of notifications is just designed to feel good on a certain level - even though you don&#x27;t want the content, you&#x27;re important because you&#x27;re receiving so many notifications. No one else can see what it is you&#x27;re getting, no one else knows that it&#x27;s just some offer from a company, they just know that you get a lot of notifications on your phone.
