Work actually provides vmware fusion (and a license for vagrant), which also works pretty well. Fusion offers more networking options (like if you&#x27;re working on pxe boot images), but I found that it&#x27;s easier to track and support virtualbox images.<p>One thing that I&#x27;ve thought about trying though, is Boxen.

If you are simply using a bloom filter to avoid random disk access on the database, then no, you haven&#x27;t lost accuracy in your system-as-a-whole.<p>Also, and I guess this is more fuzzy, my perception is that set-membership algorithms, for very large sets, are largely used in search and recommendation. These problems have unique properties: if you get the top N right, the ordering of the rest hardly matters. Contrast this with regression or classification, where you are looking for a <i>global</i> result.<p>Also, I agree that it is generally a bad idea to use linear data structures in streaming algorithms, but they are not automatically out in practice (as opposed to the CS literature).

Being a serial entrepreneur I can attest that in multiple companies of mine raising the prices has been the best decision we&#x27;ve done, often taking us to profitability. It sounds scary at first, you worry about the value to customers. In reality what often happens is you are being started taken more seriously by customers. Often both deal size and number of deals per month increase - while we all worry that the deal number initially goes down. Most founders should try charging more than they currently do, especially if the initial prices have been taken from thin air.<p>In Europe I also see more and more teams who thanks to 3-5 times lower cost base than in Silicon Valley happily become profitable and growing from their own cost base. Reach $20k in monthly revenue and a team of 5-10 good people can enjoy their life as kings and queens. Grow $1-2k per month and hire one additional person each month. No investment needed if you don&#x27;t want to accelerate.<p>Have followed both rules with my current startup Weekdone (<a href=""https://weekdone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://weekdone.com/</a>) and we&#x27;re nicely profitable here in Estonia, growing month by month.

Interesting times.\nHaving worked with languages that target C, machine code and C, I will make a few predictions:<p>Compiling to C shouldn&#x27;t hurt reliability anymore than compiling to LLVM.  Performance will likely be somewhat less, particularly as &quot;readable C&quot; is the target, not arbitrary C.<p>> Basically he likes Nim compiled to C better than just Rust. Helps him because he knows and understands C, and reading between the lines he wants to target systems that already have C compilers, but not Rust ones.<p>Maybe someone else can confirm, but I think right now Rust can&#x27;t cross-compile; I would hope that this changes after 1.0, as LLVM makes it fairly easy to do.<p>I&#x27;m also wary of the mentioned productivity gains; I simply do not feel as confident in the correctness of Nim code I write as I do Rust code I write.  This actually isn&#x27;t solely due to the enforced move semantics of Rust, but due to a lot of the comments about Nim in the article linked in the issue; Nim and Rust surprise me about the same amount, but with Rust the surprise would yield (sometimes inscrutable) errors from the compiler; Nim was more likely to yield surprising runtime behavior.<p>The two languages I use most often are C and Common Lisp.<p>C has some surprising runtime corners, but the language (at least pre C11, which I haven&#x27;t used much yet, so can&#x27;t comment on) is small enough that I can keep it all in my own head.<p>Common Lisp also has some surprising behaviors, and it&#x27;s a big language, but this is mitigated by 2 things:<p>1) Common Lisp allows very concise code; this very often lets me keep all of the portion of the software I&#x27;m working on in my head (versus C, where I keep all the language in my head)<p>2) Superior tooling; SLIME lets you very quickly drill down and look at what&#x27;s happening.  Combined with #1 it is very fast to find where the model of the code in my head diverges from reality, so most bugs are short lived.",1423927612

Going over that budget is a no-no. For startups, it&#x27;s the investment dollars in the company. Startups tend to be over-capitalized for the products they tend to produce. Big-cos tend to under-fund in an attempt to capture as much of the money as profit (especially if your big-co is a contractor of some sort).<p>Estimates are intended to be converted into budget dollars (time * team-size * burn-rate) and are critically important signalling mechanisms. No money, no work.<p>For #2: Development is not the only piece of the puzzle. There might be a team just as large and much more expensive that relies on your estimate to get their work done so that the company runs in a reasonably coordinated fashion. &quot;It&#x27;ll get done when it gets done&quot; doesn&#x27;t allow anybody else in the universe to plan anything at all, and now the company has a bunch of expensive resources sitting around doing nothing until the primadona development team produces something. This is usually the source of adversarial and caustic inter-departmental relationships in a company.<p>For #3: Good development managers learn to invert the question of estimates. When asked &quot;how long will this take to get done?&quot; they answer with <i>&quot;how much time do we have? we can get this much done in that time&quot;</i> and then make that scope a commitment. This provides much more valuable information to corporate management, they get to set their schedule, but they also get to understand what the product they&#x27;re going to be delivering is going to look like, which informs the teams from #2.<p>It also defines a clear barrier of what will be delivered and when. Scope creep gets cleanly pushed into &quot;the next development phase&quot; because anything that wasn&#x27;t promised and agreed upon is outside of the current development phase. This approach lets the development manager set expectations, and also lets them never say &quot;no&quot;. &quot;Sure we can do that, I&#x27;ll put that in the next development phase&quot; becomes the answer. Phases should be scoped to deliver a completed working version of the product (as opposed to sprints which complete components of a product).<p>If the budget runs out, or a marketing campaign is underway and development is paused, the development manager now has a barrel full of things to scope out for the next development phase. Taking this time to work with corporate management and prioritize and scope out the next phase is usually a good idea. When the time comes to resume work, the development manager can again say &quot;I&#x27;ll deliver this much by this date&quot;.<p>Awesome development managers will underpromise on the scope and keep a reserve of features as a stretch goal. If they hit the major scope, they look like a competent and solid development team. If they hit the stretch goals they surprise and delight everybody else in the company.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy, but it&#x27;s better than a waterfall approach and what passes as Agile in most shops. It results in shipping products and allows development to be better determined into overall strategy. What corp management needs is predictability, not undetermined development cycles and feature creep.<p>(#4) - To be able to say <i>&quot;how much time do we have? we can get this much done in that time&quot;</i> the devmanager needs to actually know how to estimate. A good technique is to break the tasks down and ask the developer who&#x27;s likely to do the coding how long they&#x27;d take, add up those times and see if they fit by the due date. If not, start tossing things. It&#x27;s amazing how much you can cut from a product and still end up with an MVP or with another version phase.<p>(#5) - To do all this also requires the devmanager to understand what are the minimum tasks required to achieve a working product at the end of a phase. Those tasks are the core of the scope. Anything else is stretch. This usually means the devmanager needs to have a bit of domain expertise to figure this out. It should come as a surprise, just like soda execs shouldn&#x27;t run Apple, devmanagers who don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re building shouldn&#x27;t be building it.",1423927255

Some of them are even considered tech giants today.<p>It&#x27;s also telling that I consider every single one of these project to be of mediocre quality at best from an engineering point of view. Thing is, our customers usually bleed so much money they barely notice it could be done any better.<p>People in charge of these projects usually don&#x27;t know anything about software engineering and add more importance in pleasing investors in the short-term than producing value in the long-term.",1423926834

You say you have 4-5 months in which you have to cover 4 subjects.  That&#x27;s your list.  Four things.  Nothing else.<p>If the topics are roughly of the same difficulty, divide it up in to 5 weeks each, and that&#x27;s it.  When the time&#x27;s up, move on.  If you need to, you can move back and forth between the 4 topics for a little variety, but remember context switching does come with a cost.<p>It would probably be helpful to list all the other things you want to do, but can&#x27;t, as a way of reinforcing to yourself that for the next 5 months, you&#x27;re not doing those things.  You can pick up on that list afterward... but when you do, make sure you keep up the same discipline: pick a few topics, decide to do them and devote focused time to them, and decide to leave the others on the list and <i>not</i> do them until you&#x27;ve finished with your current working set.<p>It&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to let go of a lot of things that we want to do and learn.  I experience this pretty often, too, and I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not always good at following the above advice.  But you have to be realistic about the quantity of time you have.
