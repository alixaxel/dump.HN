We can see from here that factorization isn&#x27;t really the new paradigm that the author is looking for; it&#x27;s just a part of the exponentiation paradigm.<p>Furthermore, factorials don&#x27;t really scale or stack easily. What the author is getting at in the relevant location is stacking the same concept:\n1. Multiplying is just adding the same number several times.\n2. Exponentiation is just multiplying the same number several times.\n3. Tetration is just exponentiation several times.\n4. Etc.<p>This allows us to generate the infinite hierarchy easily expressible by the ackerman numbers (which is basically A(i) = f_i(i,i)), which doesn&#x27;t generate itself as easily with factorialization in place of exponentiation.",1424170743

I built my first mobile app when I was pregnant while still working full time as a software developer.<p>I just never had the motivation to do something besides the 9-to-5 job before I got pregnant and I do sometimes regret that, but it&#x27;s just the way it had to be for me. Working on your own business takes its toll on your social life so who knows, you might not have met your partner because of it... :)<p>Anyway, don&#x27;t think too much about regrets, now is the best time to start your business! It will be hard to find time once you have children, but I don&#x27;t resent my child for leaving me less time to work.

There are a small number of possible 111-state turing machines - well, ok, there&#x27;s actually a very large number, since it&#x27;s one of those things that grows exponentially, but still, it&#x27;s very much a finite number. For each of those possible turing machines, either it halts or it doesn&#x27;t, something a programmer should be able to grind out; if it halts then it necessarily does so after some finite number of steps. So in principle we could compute all of those and then take the max of them. In practice it&#x27;s a lot of steps - but we understand all the steps, so it would just be a matter of &quot;cranking it out&quot;.<p>Conversely if you want to insist on a &quot;constructible&quot; number then you kind of have to insist on unary notation. Maybe a computer can give you a numerical value for &quot;11^11^11^11&quot;, but can you really consider it well-defined if you can&#x27;t put that many pebbles in a row?

Not necessarily <i>having</i> a CompSci degree, but someone who&#x27;s made it to senior year or even postgrad is, in my limited experience, an infinitely better engineer than someone who dropped out in freshman year or never attempted.<p>No, CompSci will not teach you how to code.

Of course you also need experience on top of that, but it helps <i>a lot</i>.<p>Like, things that are completely obvious to somebody with a CompSci degree, might be wholly out of the range of somebody who is self-taught.<p>But as always, the question is: Is that something you need?

My degree in physics came after constant failures as I spent most of my time outside class struggling (and failing, horribly) to complete classes I couldn&#x27;t manage, and trying to learn to program in what little extra time there was. I tried to switch to CS and ME to no avail. However, by the time I realized it wasn&#x27;t for me (after all the first couple years were general ed requirements) I had sunk so much time in to it I thought it was better to stick it out.<p>It wasn&#x27;t. It took me an entire extra year just to get one class I needed to graduate (mind you they have plenty of money for a fancy gym and new buildings, but not for professors to teach classes). I only got out when I was 25 and a sad, bitter, angry shell of a person.<p>There&#x27;s a happy ending, though. I left San Luis Obispo, started going to night classes at Ohlone College in the bay  and later Santa Monica College, and finally built up enough of a skill set to work in ad operations, then support, then support engineering. I had thought I was too stupid to do anything, but I did well in my classes after Poly and professionally.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve tried to adopt a motto to enact change before life has the opportunity to do it for me. You are never secure, so don&#x27;t pretend you are. I thought I was in a decent position in SM when I left for Ireland on a working holiday (it had always been a dream of mine to live abroad). I was terrified to leave a good job for a country with a crappy economy. Lo and behold my whole department was shut down a month after I left, and after a bit of networking in Ireland I ended up with a position better than I had at home. How long this will last I don&#x27;t know, but I know that it won&#x27;t be forever (nothing is) and I am always looking out for what&#x27;s next, and trying to improve my skills (lately I&#x27;ve been in to brewing automation and getting better with Arduino).<p>That was long-winded, but I guess I also felt like I should point out the positive learning that came from it.<p>I still should have dropped out, though.",1424170256

If you catch yourself committing the FAE, you might instead determine &quot;the other person seems to want money for something&quot;, and inquire. Perhaps by making sure they get the thing they think they need (which may or may not require as much money as they thought), you can cause them to no longer be &quot;greedy&quot; in your eyes. It&#x27;s very rare that a person <i>actually</i> wants as much money as possible to be spent on nothing in particular (ie is actually greedy)<p>> Your character is determined by the totality of your actions, not by some imaginary inner version of yourself - although that&#x27;s a very common delusion we all use to avoid acknowledging our character flaws.<p>I think the point of FAE is that human action is context dependent, and not some enduring trait.

Often players will sacrifice pieces for counter-play and activity.<p>Chess engines also implement a heuristic called &#x27;contempt&#x27; where they may make a sacrifice in order to avoid a drawn position, when faced with an inferior opponent.",1424167544
