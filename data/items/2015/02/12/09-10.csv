It&#x27;s not like Ph.D. students bring money into a department, regardless of their level of &quot;desperation&quot; to get a terminal degree. That&#x27;s a big and unnecessary loss to take every single year.<p>Well, largely because the PhD students don&#x27;t <i>just</i> do the teaching work, they do the research, too!  Professors are often stuck as something more like a manager these days, which means that even the &quot;winners&quot; of the academic rat-race don&#x27;t really get what they actually wanted: to do research full-time with a secure salary.",1423735012

I make far more than this person does, and I can make the trade-off to do contract work for higher pay. His trade off is &quot;contract&quot; work for lower pay than the full timers with more than full time work load, and he doesn&#x27;t get to trade higher job security for lower pay like we do.<p>He&#x27;s being exploited and has the worst of all worlds, and he&#x27;s teaching the next generation of this world, and you&#x27;re sitting here saying he gets what he deserves?

9038147,comment,9034768,9034768,0,0,zaroth,,,"> &quot;This guarantees chronological ordering, since the ServerValue.TIMESTAMP will be resolved on the Firebase server to be an accurate timestamp.&quot;<p>To be sure, this can&#x27;t possibly guarantee chronological ordering. But it can get you fairly close and perhaps almost predictable chronological ordering...<p>If at any level there is a clock which can skew and is being adjusted with a stochastic process, there is jitter, and you can get out of order. The solution is simply to apply corrective factors in a continuous manor -- slow down or speed up time. That&#x27;s what the client adjustment should have been doing all along, and then you would never need the ServerValue.TIMESTAMP hack.<p>If Firebase is relying on a ntp utility, I&#x27;m not sure but I would assume that they are smart enough to slow or speedup time and not jerk to a new setting. Or at least they would have a flag to enable that functionality.<p>Edit: Distributed auto-incrementing counter is not that hard. A field for time, a field for ID. I don&#x27;t see a reason to conflate the two. I guess it makes object instantiating easier, since you don&#x27;t have to fetch an ID in any sense. 64 vs 128 bits is not a big difference. So in the end it&#x27;s a good design decision and is a net positive for them.",1423735005

Since the timestamp only offers millisecond precision, two IDs generated in the same millisecond could be out of order depending on the random value because the timestamps will be the same. In order to prevent that, if two IDs are generated in the same millisecond, instead of generating a new random value, they take the random value from last time and add 1.

Yes, there is empirical evidence!<p><a href=""http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/lang_study.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/lang_study.pdf</a><p>><i>Abstract:</i><p>>What is the effect of programming languages on software quality? This question has been a topic of much debate for a very long time. In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (729 projects, 80 Million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million commits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of language features such as static v.s. dynamic typing, strong v.s. weak typing on software quality. By triangulating findings from different methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a significant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that strong typing is modestly better than weak typing, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language design are overwhelmingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we hasten to caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possibly be due to other, intangible process factors, e.g., the preference of certain personality types for functional, static and strongly typed languages.",1423734093

Each interprets and constructs meaning from various gestures, actions, words, etc., through their own lens, especially retrospectively.<p>For example, guy and girl go out to dinner, have a great time, have a couple of glasses of wine. Girl goes back to guy&#x27;s apartment; they are both light-headed, and end up having sex. Months later, after a breakup, the girl legitimately believes she was taken advantage of (&#x27;The asshole was using me all along; he plied me with wine and raped me&#x27;), while the guy legitimately believes that what happened was 100% consensual. It is obvious why after a tough break-up the girl may (choose to?) think this way. Also, she IS on some level right: the guy DID want to have sex with her, and the dinner and wine weren&#x27;t a completely innocent gesture. But guess what: this is what relationships are like, and these situations are virtually impossible to avoid. Every relationship I&#x27;ve been in has had similar &#x27;open to interpretation&#x27; moments.<p>Anyway, this is one reason why relationships today are sometimes an absolute hell; we live in a culture that encourages us to treat everything as means rather than end, including people, and at the same time we are obsessed with ourselves--obsessed with protecting our beautiful, world-deserving self, and are terrified that we might be being used, or that we might be using or accused of using others.",1423732689

By busy I mean, I&#x27;m getting inbound leads, I&#x27;m having conversations via email or phone, I&#x27;m selling, I&#x27;m quoting, I&#x27;m fixing stuff on the product.<p>Then it goes from crazy busy to suddenly quiet.<p>I just don&#x27;t know what to do with the down time. I get super uneasy and anxious. I try to do some content marketing but I make so little progress, it&#x27;s hard to see any result very quickly, so I switch to optimizing the web or landing page and then get see how my PPC campaigns are doing and then reading HN or listening to podcast on bootstrapping etc. I feel inefficient and spread thin.<p>I feel terrible when things are quiet. I have an urge to start cranking out updates and new features on the product but I stop myself, as I only decided to create features that enough paying users request.<p>I have a terrible habit of playing counterstrike and checking HN and reddit obsessively until I get a phone call or an email and then I have to do some work. I&#x27;m on the computer almost 15 hours a day. Basically, I have no life except on weekends I go out with friends but I&#x27;m always ready to answer email or live chat on my phone. Some days I just wait around and end up playing games all day.<p>When I was developing the product it wasn&#x27;t like this. Nose down, cranking out code, testing, but I&#x27;m doing much much less of that now and trying to meet my personal sales target, marketing (based on what little I know), fixing websites, talking to people.<p>If you are boostrapping your biz full time what are you doing when you are not talking with leads or busy? Is there anything else I should be doing? Am I going about this the wrong way? Really would love your inputs, especially if you are unemployed and you rely on your bootstrap business.",1423732084

9038027,comment,9023254,9023254,0,0,rifung,,,"You&#x27;re obviously depressed, and as a result being ridiculous. I&#x27;ve met many SDEs who are pretty poor developers, and unless they are completely fresh, they usually just aren&#x27;t good because they don&#x27;t care.<p>You obviously do care, and realize (and exaggerate I imagine) your shortcomings. Better still, you are trying to improve by asking here. So, I&#x27;d like to begin by saying that while you may (feel as though you are) not good enough, you just need to be patient because I&#x27;m sure one day you&#x27;re going to be awesome.<p>Now for more practical advice, I would say the best thing to do would be to just code more. That sounds stupid, but it really is the best thing to do. Even better would be to code with someone else on a project together, so that you can see each other&#x27;s code. I definitely learned a lot from reading other people&#x27;s code, either from learning new things or also from finding ways to improve their code.<p>If you can&#x27;t find someone else to code with, that&#x27;s fine, but try to read some code. Finally, I would really recommend you try to do a relatively big project. The reason is that when you work on small projects you don&#x27;t really have to worry about maintenance and thus code structure, but when you work on bigger projects having your code be concise and clean is much more important. Even having good style is important.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine! Find something that interests you and keep doing stuff! If you can&#x27;t think of a cool project you can always go on HackerRank or Project Euler. Maybe you could even prepare for this year&#x27;s Google Code Jam! You could then start building your own little library for competition problems!",1423731815

Micah Elizabeth Scott&#x27;s work on the Nintendo DSi [1] is an excellent example: with a budget of just $500 and a month or two of work [2] she could read a video stream out of RAM as it was being DMAed to/from the camera [3].<p>I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how impressed I am with Micah&#x27;s work, but cloning her FPGA tool from GitHub [4] and repeating the feat for a relatively static segment of executable code on a system that&#x27;s less physically hardened against tampering, that seems trivial to me in comparison. Certainly doable with $500 and a couple of weeks time.<p>1. <a href=""http://scanlime.org/2009/09/dsi-ram-tracing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scanlime.org/2009/09/dsi-ram-tracing/</a><p>2. <a href=""https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/562925122106191873"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/562925122106191873</a><p>3. <a href=""http://hackmii.com/2009/09/dsi-ram-tracing-camera/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackmii.com/2009/09/dsi-ram-tracing-camera/</a><p>4. <a href=""https://github.com/scanlime/ram-tracer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scanlime/ram-tracer</a>",1423731673
