Asm.js is not an alternative for a hypothetical high-performance, human-readable language in the browser.  Ex: It&#x27;s not competing with the idea of a C#-in-HTML JIT compiler.  It is competing with Silverlight -where the browser is already downloading inscrutable binaries.<p>2. Emscripten has so far received the most man-years of effort, but the idea of other systems using asm.js as a compilation target is very attractive and it&#x27;s not so difficult as to be a huge barrier for competition.  For example <a href=""https://rfk.id.au/blog/entry/pypy-js-faster-than-cpython/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rfk.id.au/blog/entry/pypy-js-faster-than-cpython/</a> (for a specific benchmark, after jit warmup). Personally, I&#x27;m excited about the idea of hooking the emscripten backend into <a href=""http://terralang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terralang.org/</a>  Terralang is a system for building custom, high-performance languages on top of LLVM.<p>3. Asm.js runs on any standards-compliant JS interpreter with no special support required.  Even if the interpreter ignores the &quot;use asm&quot; directive, you can expect to see speed benefits simply from the fact that asm.js code is JS in a style that is easy to JIT very well.  In order for phones, consoles, smart TVs ect... to <i>fully</i> benefit, it will of course require the platform holders to put in the effort to respond to &quot;use asm&quot;.  &quot;Open Platform&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;Works perfectly before the platform holder even implements it&quot; ;)  Also, Asm.js is not targeted to compete with native, installed executables.
