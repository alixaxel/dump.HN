One thing about rare earth metals is that they can be a byproduct of metal production, but this process is often ignored because the cost of the additional step can be more expensive than the resulting output.<p>One thing people seem to not know is that helium is a common discarded byproduct of oil extraction.  Nuclear fission in the earth&#x27;s core produces it, and it gathers in porous underground oil reservoirs.

9100021,comment,9098856,9098856,0,0,SRasch,,,"To quote my own answer on that question:<p>No: we will never run out of helium, it&#x27;s just a question of price (which is likely to go up).<p>There is a method of actually producing helium: as a product of  nuclear decay, smaller quantities of helium (He) could be made in nuclear power plants.<p>Nevertheless, as @ghshepard says, in the short and medium-term supply will simply come from other natural gas fields if/when the price goes up.<p>The Helium-scarcity misunderstanding is the same as with almost every other historical feared resource depletion. At current prices and production methods, supply is finite, but at higher price points, new production methods become economically viable.<p>A  higher helium price means two things: reduced demand by shifting to  substitutes and increased production by using more expensive production  technologies (and of course, if the price goes up more people will try to innovate cheaper solutions).<p>Today helium is practically free. While we would never run out of Helium, it is not unlikely that at some point prices may go up for a while.

In order to save enough for a basic housing in London, my quality of life have to drop significantly for years to come. Yet I&#x27;m considered to be &#x27;rich&#x27; by HMRC. (Practically, this&#x27;d mean switching schools for one of my children, and waiting forever for free timeslots in nearby nurseries for another - while saving maybe extra £5-6k/y in rent, which is peanuts when counting towards possible mortgage).<p>Avg. house prices in my current ward are ~$750-900k for a 3bd terrace. That&#x27;s ten years of my net income - and you don&#x27;t have to work for that! Just sell a house you bought 15 years ago for a fraction of this cost - and here you go. Sure, you&#x27;d have to rent - just as I do. Yet, all those people are not considered to be wealthy (and they aren&#x27;t, with many of them struggling with today&#x27;s job market), and not taxed on the wealth they hold.<p>So, for me - it&#x27;s all about taxation and government imposed incentives. If they want to put a leash on a younger britons generation and then pass it to Chinese landlords - they&#x27;re on the right track.<p>Changing taxation alone can drastically shift the power balance between landlords and tenants to ease underlying supply-demand issue.",1424778549

I don&#x27;t think replacing reCAPTCHA is going to make Tor users magically happy. They will just complain about whatever alternative is used.<p>One thing you could look in to (email me if you&#x27;d like more info on this) is the notion of using Bitcoin-based &quot;anonymous passports&quot;. The idea here is that someone sacrifices some Bitcoins to miner fees in such a way that they effectively mint themselves a certificate over a public key, without paying a certificate authority. Seen one way, the block chain itself is the CA.<p>Once such a certificate/&quot;anonymous passport&quot; has been created the owner can sign challenges with it to prove ownership, and if the user is observed engaging in abusive activity it can be blacklisted - forcing another sacrifice of money if they want to keep going.<p>The downside of this is that of course it relies on Bitcoin. However, there&#x27;s a whole army of people working on the problem of obtaining bitcoins. There are local traders. There are Bitcoin ATM&#x27;s being deployed throughout the world. If you want a private way to demonstrate some sacrifice of effort or wealth I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better alternative.<p>Currently there&#x27;s no convenient GUI for making these certificates. If a major provider like CloudFlare were willing to get behind the concept, such a GUI could be easily built though. For instance I could add it to Lighthouse, which is a cross platform Bitcoin wallet app that specialises in smart contracts.",1424778360

On the other hand it is obvious that everywhere in the UK has serious restriction of supply, because house building has been less than half of what&#x27;s necessary for many decades, house prices are spiralling, and median house price to income ratios are double now what they were 15 years ago (again, that applies to all parts of the country, even unfashionable places far away from the capital [1]).<p>Obviously there&#x27;s the issue with green belts, but even beyond that there&#x27;s massive potential for increasing the housing density of outer London. Both because of its current low density, and because a lot of the existing housing stock is made up of grey suburban estates which would be more or less unmourned if redeveloped. Look up &#x27;densification&#x27; for more information.<p>Also, of course, it is important to try to reduce demand by making the Northern cities an alternative centre of gravity (HS2, HS3, new local powers for unified city mayors in Manchester and Birmingham, and so on).<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/321015/Chart_576.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachm...</a>",1424778318

Thus it&#x27;s several orders of magnitude more efficient. Heck quite likely it&#x27;s something like million times more efficient.<p>Moore&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t help bitcoin. Because if we produce a miner that has 10x the power efficiency of a current mining hardware it just results into everyone using that miner. Total hashrate would be 10x but the electricity consumption would remain the same. The difficulty adjustment in bitcoin guarantees that regardless of the HW the profit from mining goes close to the electricity cost of it. Thus we can simply ignore Moore&#x27;s law and focus on the fundamental point of bitcoin mining: Producing waste heat.<p>Having to continuously produce waste heat to secure the network is a fundamental flaw in bitcoin. An attack against the network (51% attack, using waste heat) must be sufficiently expensive compared to the gains of such an attack. The benefits of an attack scale with the amount of value transferred in bitcoin network. Thus the amount of waste heat constantly produced by honest people also must scale in order to keep it secure.<p>All of this because one person got the bright idea to solve Byzantine generals problem via unforgeable votes. What kind of vote is that? Waste heat. The guy just figured out how to verify that some other person has produced waste heat.

New, young professionals are happy to share a small bedsit in a bad area if it means a high salary, but at some point in life you have to rebalance your quality of living.<p>That&#x27;s a problem I have with London- the constant churn. Everyone is transient. Friends you make are leaving in a year or two, maybe to go abroad or to buy a house in the suburbs. Many, many of the people living here do not consider it a &#x27;home&#x27; but a stepping stone towards their goals, and I think this contributes to a lack of community spirit and feeling of belonging. I never felt like a &#x27;Londoner&#x27; because there never seemed to be such a thing. On the other hand, this vast diversity and anonymity is of course one of London&#x27;s great strengths.",1424775816
