9122126,comment,9121482,9121806,0,0,TheHydroImpulse,,,"I definitely like the approach of starting with ownership, that&#x27;s definitely a good thing. I feel the current draft places too much emphasis on implementation details of the stack/heap that I&#x27;m not sure will help users understand ownership better.<p>For example, going through line by line leads to a slew of text that doesn&#x27;t really provide that much value. I feel you could cut a few paragraphs with a simpler method of explanation with perhaps more code (and explain through comments), visuals (ascii diagrams of the scopes), or something.<p>I also feel the analogy towards lifetimes relating to segment of lines of code might confuse users.<p>> Rust knows how to connect the scopes of variables that are pointing to the same thing, as well as how to know the scope of things that are more than just stack-allocated memory.<p>Too many &#x27;things&#x27;, knowing Rust I obviously know what you&#x27;re trying to say but I could imagine it being hard to grok for new comers. However, I don&#x27;t really have a suggestion on how to explain it better.<p>After that, you show some code and try to explain it in paragraph form after that. I think it might be easier to just place those explanations inline with the code. That way you can skip the &quot;at line 7, it does this&quot; type of thing.<p>Referencing the implementation details of the stack and heap, it seems like too many details that are not really needed at that time. Perhaps a difference between the stack vs heap, but which memory address a variable is located doesn&#x27;t really convey anything useful.<p>Anyways, I like the where things are headed, but as you said, writing is hard. I&#x27;ve tried writing introductions to lifetimes and ownership and, well, I just gave up. Trying to convey that stuff after you&#x27;ve learned it to people who haven&#x27;t is hard.",1425081240
9122125,comment,9122003,9122067,0,0,mseebach,,,"Given the immense untapped shale resources in Europe and the US, it seems extraordinarily unlikely that these powers would risk <i>fucking nuclear war</i> over a bit of gas. If it&#x27;s about Chevron&#x27;s 10 billion, the Pentagon has suffered sneezes significantly more expensive than 10 billion. If the US administration should be so inclined, it would be so much simpler and cheaper just to reimburse Chevron for their loss.<p>However much we want to pretend that stuff ended in 1989, we need to wake up to the fact that it didn&#x27;t. Russia has invaded a sovereign country as it tried to exercise it&#x27;s sovereignty to align with the western values. However much we&#x27;re busy hating ourselves (legitimately) over Iraq, Guantanamo and NSA, our values are infinitely better than Putin&#x27;s.<p>EDIT: Oh, and as the linked articles explain, Europe is deeply dependent on Russian gas and the business and political interest is <i>squarely</i> towards appeasement. See former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder for reference. If there should be a rational gas/Russia conspiracy, it would be leveraging the conflict to squash opposition to fracking.

9122122,comment,9121482,9121482,0,0,mkishi,,,"I like the new structure much better!<p>Now, I&#x27;m in no way a writer. English isn&#x27;t even my main language.. So take this next point accordingly:<p>Unfortunately, I get an even more condescending vibe from this draft than I got from the book. Not as in &quot;I&#x27;m an expert and you&#x27;re treating me like a newbie,&quot; but as if I was a kid instead of an aspiring Rust programmer (beginner or otherwise). I wish I could point out -exactly why- I get this feeling, but I&#x27;d be lying.<p>I do think I&#x27;m starting to see a pattern, though, that perhaps contribute to this gut reaction. The pace between concept introductions is odd, somewhat erratic. At times, in one line you&#x27;re talking to a complete novice programmer, and the very next you assume they know other languages and general concepts [1]. Other times, you take some basic knowledge for granted and explains it right after [2]. I know it must be very hard to find the right balance for your target audience, but I found these jumps very jarring. For what it&#x27;s worth, once you get past the introductions you pick up a more to-the-point-explanations rhythm and that reaction goes away.<p>[1]: For example, after several paragraphs and two code snippets to introduce the concept of &#x27;variable bindings&#x27; in a novice-friendly way, even going as far as (somewhat) explaining what system and functional languages are, the text suddenly assumes I know about program execution and what a control flow structure is?<p>> As you know, a computer program is executed line by line. At least, until you hit a control flow structure, anyway.<p>This line was specially off-putting. After all that explanation, the assumption I&#x27;d know this made me feel like a kid. But I can only imagine how inaproppriate I&#x27;d feel if I didn&#x27;t know. Given the novice level of the text up to then, the &#x27;as you know&#x27; sounds very out of place.<p>[2]: The very next paragraph, we go over a program with one variable binding line by line. And then, it&#x27;s assumed I know about scopes. But after that they are explained anyway. I realize this is a way to go over every concept, even if one already knows them, but it feels odd! Both beginner and experts would understand a plain explanation. But this back-and-forth about how to present concepts doesn&#x27;t work -- for me. It&#x27;d make more sense to read straight-forward explanations of what I already know than these &quot;as a programmer, you know that x,&quot; mixed with even simpler concepts being introduced as new.<p>This sounds harsher than I planned -- I&#x27;m no writer afterall! But, really, despite these gut reactions, the Rust book is turning into one of my favorites. Thank you for all your work!",1425081093

An example—that we&#x27;ve seen more than once on HN—is people creating separate accounts to reply to themselves, object to their opponents, etc. That sort of thing undermines the community. And people should always email us when stuff going on in the threads doesn&#x27;t feel right, because we can&#x27;t read everything and we rely on you all to be the neighborhood watch.<p>But I don&#x27;t see how any of this applies to rayiner. He isn&#x27;t hiding or pretending. (Isn&#x27;t that the reason those details were findable in the first place?) He just disagrees with most of us. As long one does so civilly, that doesn&#x27;t undermine the community, it strengthens it.<p>Questions of astroturfing and abuse of the site are often matters of degree that depend on an account&#x27;s history. For example, an account that has commented on a wide range of topics is different from an account that always comments on the same one. A throwaway account created to discuss a sensitive personal issue is different from serial throwaways created to break the site guidelines with impunity. And so on.<p>I feel like you guys need to re-weigh your priorities. Personally accusing someone of abuse and bad faith is the nuclear option. Even when you&#x27;re right, it should never be used just to score an extra point or two in an argument. What you&#x27;re not taking into account (but we have to) is the bomb-like damage caused by such accusations themselves. We can&#x27;t allow that to become even a little bit of a precedent on HN. So except in extreme cases—which this is not—bringing out that artillery is a clear breach of the HN guidelines around civility. And I&#x27;m sorry for describing the &quot;nuclear option&quot; as &quot;artillery&quot;.<p>Edit: this reminds me a bit of the rule in parliamentary systems where members are not allowed to call one another liars. Obviously that isn&#x27;t because no one ever lies; it&#x27;s to protect the institution, which could easily fall apart under pressure. It&#x27;s a crossbeam, there for structural purposes.

9121940,comment,9121482,9121482,0,0,Animats,,,"It&#x27;s still too confusing. Try drawing actual pictures to illustrate the scope/lifetime issues.  Talking about addresses on the stack is an implementation\ndetail.<p>Things to cover:<p>Basic lifetime concepts in Rust:<p><pre><code>   1.  Scopes are nested.\n   2.  Variable lifetimes are tied to scopes.\n   3.  Unlike other languages, variables can be created\n       tied to a scope outer to the one where they are\n       created. The user can control this by indicating\n       that the lifetime of a variable is the same as that\n       of some variable from an outer scope. This is Rust&#x27;s \n       big innovation.\n   4.  A function can create a new object and return it by\n       reference if the function explicitly says that the \n       new object has the same lifetime as some parameter.\n</code></pre>\nBasic ownership concepts in Rust:<p><pre><code>   1.  There are three kinds of ownership - single ownership, \n       reference count multiple ownership, and thread-safe reference \n       count ownership.\n   2.  The reference count ones work like you&#x27;d expect.\n   3.  Single ownership interacts with the lifetime system in \n       to make it possible to create data structures such as\n       trees, with all components single ownership and having the\n       same lifetime.\n   4.  The &quot;=&quot; operator usually means &quot;move&quot;, and when it does,\n       the right hand side of the &quot;=&quot; becomes inaccessable.\n       (This is type-dependent; some types copy when &quot;=&quot; is used.)\n       This preserves single ownership.\n</code></pre>\nBasic data structure concepts in Rust:<p><pre><code>   1.  Rust has enums, which, unlike enums in other languages, can\n       have data objects associated with them. They&#x27;re really variant\n       records.\n   2.  You can declare an enum with a data object as a field in a \n       structure. This creates a structure that contains (really links \n       to) another data object.\n   3.  This can be done recursively, so you can create trees of\n       structures.  \n   4.  You can&#x27;t violate the rules of single-ownership.  Trees are OK;\n       directed acyclic graphs or backpointers are not allowed using\n       single ownership.\n   5.  There&#x27;s no &quot;Null&quot;. Instead you create enums which have one value\n       with an associated data item and one without. \n   6.  Everything has to be initialized to a valid value for its type.\n</code></pre>\nBasic borrowing concepts in Rust:<p><pre><code>   1.  You can create temporary references to something with an equal\n       or longer lifetime, because the temporary &quot;borrowed&quot; reference\n       cannot outlive the thing it is referencing. That&#x27;s safe.\n   2.  You can have one writer (a mutable reference) or N readers \n       (immutable references) at a time.\n</code></pre>\nBasic type concepts in Rust:<p><pre><code>   1.  It&#x27;s complicated.\n   2.  There&#x27;s automatic type inference.  Not just for &quot;let&quot;, either.\n   3.  Function parameters have to be declared, not inferred,\n       except for the special syntax for closures that lets you write\n       concise lambda expressions.  This limits how hard the\n       type inference system has to work.\n   4.  I don&#x27;t fully understand Rust&#x27;s type system yet.\n</code></pre>\nBasic safety concepts in Rust:<p><pre><code>   1.  All of the above is enforced at compile time.\n   2.  The result is memory safety.\n</code></pre>\nMisc. notes:<p><pre><code>  - Lifetimes are novel, but not that complex.\n  - The type system really is complex.\n  - There are generics and you&#x27;ll need them more often than in C++.\n  - The compiler first checks syntax, then types, then borrowing. It does not report\n  borrow errors until everything else is correct.\n  - There are no exceptions, and proper error handling requires rather verbose code.\n  - Have a plan for your variable lifetimes before you start coding, or you end up\n  fighting with the borrow checker and losing. \n  - If you think you need &quot;unsafe&quot; in pure Rust code, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</code></pre>",1425078291
