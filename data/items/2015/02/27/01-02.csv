At least in English, the most significant digit is on the left, just like any other base (e.g. base 10, base 8, or base 89432890432).<p>Also, for your leading 0, I would write: Bob has 23 apples, and I have 5.  I wouldn&#x27;t write: Bob has 23 apples, and I have 05.  Base 2 is not special, so I wouldn&#x27;t write 01.<p>You can also turn your order argument on its head: since the order of digits in base 10 is exactly the same as base 2 (most significant on the left), you could say that &quot;As easy as 1, 2, 3&quot; should actually be read as &quot;As easy as 3, 2, 1&quot;, which matches your binary reading &quot;As easy as 3, 2, 1&quot;.",1425002368

We are about to start generating revenue, and are launching with our first game publisher client in the next few days. We&#x27;ve raised over £50k to date, and I am going to raise more funds soon via crowdfunding.<p>I enjoy building things, hacking, product development and I also love pitching, doing sales and meeting clients at conferences. We have 2 loyal in-house advisors who help with the business development side, and we are attached to an accelerator in Cambridge.<p>Right now, I am at a bit of a loss as to what kind of role I need to hire for (but I know a need a team). I&#x27;ve gone through a few team members coming and going during the last 15 months.<p>Advice I have received so far (all of which I&#x27;m sure have an element of truth):<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a technical person. Don&#x27;t hire someone who is like you. Don&#x27;t make your team full of technical people. The best teams have a mix of personalities and skills.&quot;<p>&quot;You need to hire more engineers as you are a <i>tech</i> company.&quot;<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t need to hire a salesperson! Founders like you are the <i>best</i> people to do customer development and selling.&quot;<p>&quot;You need a cofounder, not a subcontracted-out person. You cannot do this alone, and a cofounder would be more committed if they had an equity stake in the company.&quot;<p>&quot;The company is <i>already founded</i>; you can&#x27;t really get a cofounder now! Plus giving shares to them now would incur a tax liability for them, because the shares have value. Hire people instead.&quot;<p>Like a lot of advice I receive, this above is clearly contradictory, and everyone seems to have their own idea as to how my team should grow.<p>So, I would love to hear what HN has to say on my situation, and what type of role I should be looking for.",1425002274

This gets you most of the way there without running into the <i>really nasty</i> bugs you see in native code.<p>Adding a shared buffer object as proposed (presumably giving an interleaved set of views onto the same underlyling backing array, much as we do with typed buffers) could be acceptable, because you can guarantee isolated access to elements.<p>However, adding the more general threading support you see in, for example, C++ would be a nightmare.

9116704,comment,9113976,9116587,0,0,saraid216,,,"> I think at least part of it is because the people on HN enjoy solving problems so much.<p>Possibly, but there are a couple more factors.<p>1) In the general population, criticism is still the norm. The default reaction to <i>any</i> change is neutral to negative. If any response is made, chances are it will be negative.<p>2) On HN, vacuous responses are discouraged. And since substantive positive responses are hard to make (most of the positive spin usually ends up <i>in</i> the article, not in responses), positive responses in general are uncommon. Comparatively, substantive negative responses are easier to make, not least because it&#x27;s almost always easier to see a problem than to see a solution.<p>Either one of those would push the responses towards negative criticism. Combined with yours, you now have three not-insignificant forces. There are probably more.

The process essentially repurposes beer fermentation. The usual benefits of biological production: carbon-negative, and not using any toxic catalysts or producing waste products hold as well. Consider the molecule, paracetamol/acetaminophen/Tylenol [1], that we created a microbe for: The US alone produces 35000+ tonnes of it, all currently coming from petro-routes. It would be nicer to get it the same way we get beer, if we could.<p>There might be additional market forces that make a microbial fermentation attractive: e.g., in the case of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin, fluctuation in supply of the plant Artemisia annua, the price of the drug varied between $120-$1200/kg, and Amyris and Sanofi moved it to yeast based production for creating a steady supply [2]. That route was critical for the supply of the drug to African countries.<p>For many of the requests we get, chemical synthesis is not economically feasible to take the chemical to market, and bioproduction might be the only route. The fact that we suggest routes that work well for the planet is a good side-effect. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Synthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Synthesis</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin#Synthesis_in_engineered_organisms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin#Synthesis_in_engine...</a>",1425000954

It does far more GL commands than a perfectly optimized engine would, which means much more overhead in terms of sending messages to the main thread.<p>Despite that extra overhead, it does very well. 2 bots, a realistic workload, is fast in Firefox, and the slowdown in Chrome (where message-passing overhead is higher) is almost negligible. 10 bots, as mentioned in the blogpost, is a stress test, not a realistic workload. As expected, things start to get slower there. (Game is still playable though!)<p>And large amounts of GL commands, as tested there, are much more than what a typical UI application would need. So for UI applications, that just want to not stall the main thread, I think a single worker proxying operations to the main thread could be enough. Copying is fine.<p>The proposal in the blogpost here is for other cases. Workers + copying already solve quite a lot, very well. What this new proposal focuses on are computation-intensive applications, that can multiply their performance by using multiple threads. For example, an online photo-editing application needs this. This might be just a small fraction of websites, but they are important too.",1425000918

If you&#x27;re lucky, the library will have a changelog, but that&#x27;s sorely lacking in most projects.

I still remember wondering how I should cook a steak; how would I know when it was cooked? How do I know what to heat the pan to? Etc....<p>To go a bit philosophical, you have to lose the fear of engaging with your food and the cooking process.  Don&#x27;t be scared to play with your food while it&#x27;s cooking.  Smell it often, listen to the noises it makes, don&#x27;t be worried about moving it around the pan and even take notice of how it moves - is it sticking to the pan? Does it seem a little dry? Does it smell good? Start doing this with the simplest of things - some oil in a pan and a steak or sausages, for example.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about following recipes to the exact letter all the time, unless you&#x27;re doing something like baking where the chemistry is more important to get accurate.  If your time isn&#x27;t exact or the temperature is a little off or you use more than a tablespoon of oil, see what happens.  See what happens if you add salt, or if you don&#x27;t.  Observe it while it&#x27;s happening.  Don&#x27;t be scared to taste something off the pan.  If it doesn&#x27;t taste good, ask yourself why? Then ask yourself how you might fix it.<p>Once you&#x27;re not afraid to do that, cooking becomes a lot more fun and intuitive.  Then you can follow recipes while engaging with them and the food.<p>I feel like this is something that many people who hate cooking or who are scared of cooking miss.  Cooking shouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;follow the instructions to the letter otherwise one wrong step and boom!&quot; process.  Instead it&#x27;s a highly interactive, very sensory thing.",1424999618

A good driver can let the car attempt it itself, but slap it into manual when it is failing, then provide some sort of additional feedback -- not so different than a driving instructor teaching a kid to drive.<p>As robots do more and more things, there will be more and more opportunities for people to train them.<p>The only scenario where the economics of that doesn&#x27;t work out is if everyone is employed so they can&#x27;t afford to pay the trainers enough....but the rest of the article doesn&#x27;t support that.",1424999467
