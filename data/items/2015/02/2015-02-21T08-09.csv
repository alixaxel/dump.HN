It&#x27;s true his authority was fading fast - these things are not mutually exclusive. The Feb 21 deal was struck to resolve the standoff discussed in your linked NYT article - can you point to where it says that annexation began before Feb 21st (the earliest I can find it mention is March)?<p>Similarly with covert armaments - the discussion of &#x27;too much to ask&#x27; or &#x27;right or wrong&#x27; is orthagonal to whether the West takes covert action in the Baltic to achieve policy objectives. My claim is merely that it is done - not that it is wrong.<p>And similarly wrt the association agreement - it has to do with the context of EU and NATO encroachment and Western action in the Baltic (I would have to admit that it was EU membership, not NATO, in this case).<p>The grandparent may have anti-European or -NATO sentiments. I don&#x27;t. But I will defend the idea that the West, having heavily polled Ukraine and called for its own elections, and having discussed options for replacing the leadership, and training and funding groups in the Ukraine, and having controlled the election process in Kiev (calling afoul when Russia performed the same in the Crimea) absolutely is not above influencing its own support.

Recruitment in SF sounds like a nightmare for everyone involved. Agency fees are relatively low (10%ish, compared with 15-20% in the UK), but the service the candidate gets (incessant LinkedIn spam for inappropriate roles) is poor, the service the employer gets (scatter-gun approach, loads of shitty CVs, very little value-add from the recruiter, other than they&#x27;ll spam LinkedIn for you) ...<p>I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a combination of the generally slightly immature state of the US agency recruitment market (compared to Europe; not meant as a judgement, just a fact), insane competition for candidates, very small take-up of and limited competition in job-boards/channels, and the big competition with corporate recruiters against FB, Google, and so on.<p>Every so often I wonder about trying to break in to the SF market (rather than London, which is where I put 90% of my time), but I wonder if the effort would be worth it, given what feels like the dire state of the market.<p>All the recruitment startups I can see are trying to build a better ATS to remove the agency recruiter (Lever.co, Greenhouse.io, SmartRecruiters.com, TheResumator.com, and even ZipRecruiter (an ATS disguised as a multi-poster)), yet no-one seems to be trying to fix agency recruitment.<p>Sorry for the slightly rambling post - happy to give free advice to anyone trying to recruit (see my profile), but it sounds like a real uphill battle in the Bay Area...",1424507451

9085069,comment,9080896,9084211,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Someone on HN suggested this guide to Haskell a few days ago: <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell</a><p>I&#x27;m finding it the first useful introduction to the language I&#x27;ve encountered. Like you, my experiences have been less than exemplary, and I&#x27;m way too arrogant to accept that I&#x27;m either stupid or brain damaged. Every year or so I take a run at Haskell, and this time I think I&#x27;m going to get it. I know a dozen-odd languages, including a fairly expert grasp of APL and Mathematica, both of which are a bit odd in their approach to life. Haskell is genuinely weirder than most, and the entire Haskell community&#x27;s apparent total ignorance of the of the most rudimentary principles of pedagogy make the learning curve unreasonably steep.<p>The fact that most Haskell tutorials start out with contradictions is an example of this. Pedagogy 101: don&#x27;t make false claims about the subject <i>in terms of the concepts you can reasonably expect the student to have</i>.<p>For example, electrical engineers should never introduce the concept of &quot;negative resistance&quot; by starting off talking about &quot;negative resistance&quot;. They should first introduce the concept of <i>generalized resistance</i> (dV/dI rather than V/I) and then show how <i>generalized resistance</i> can be negative. To tell a student that there is such a thing as &quot;negative resistance&quot; when you know full well that &quot;resistance&quot; in the student&#x27;s mind is not generalized but defined by a relation such that it cannot possibly be negative is simply incompetence on the part of the teacher.<p>By the same token, it doesn&#x27;t matter one whit that &quot;the language&quot; is side-effect free when &quot;the runtime&quot; implements side effects when the student can reasonably expected to understand &quot;language&quot; to mean &quot;language plus runtime&quot; as it is in every other case. Actually: it does matter, and it should be explained in those terms. Otherwise students will rightly reject the language as some kind of snake-oil gibberish promoted by arrogant hucksters.<p>No Haskell tutorial should ever make the false claim that &quot;the language&quot; (as understood by any reasonable student) is &quot;purely functional&quot;. Students aren&#x27;t stupid and haven&#x27;t been brain-damaged by imperative languages. They know that &quot;the language&quot; covers the whole package in ordinary parlance, including the runtime. When we talk about Perl or Python or C++ or FORTRAN that&#x27;s what we mean. There is absolutely no basis for anyone to ever assume any other understanding on the part of the student.<p>So tell people &quot;Haskell is implemented in such a way that it can be treated as a purely functional language for the purpose of static analysis even though at runtime there are various clever tricks that still allow it to implement side-effects like IO&quot;. That is a truthful statement. &quot;Haskell is a pure functional language and for every function call the return value depends only on its arguments&quot; is false, outside of a tortured and bizarre interpretation of the terminology that has no apparent purpose but to misrepresent reality to outsiders.<p>There are some pretty cool things about Haskell. The type inference system is powerful, useful and interesting. It&#x27;s remarkable to see how far a nominally (but not actually) purely functional language can be pushed, and the way various hacks are used to overcome the limitations of purely functional languages is incredibly clever. The creators of Haskell should be celebrating those feats, not hiding behind false claims that the language+runtime is &quot;truly&quot; purely functional when it manifestly is not.<p>Edit: Concrete example: to be a purely functional language function values must depend only on their arguments. Here is an example of a Haskell function whose value does not depend only on its arguments:<p><pre><code>    notPurelyFunctional :: Double -> IO Double  
    notPurelyFunctional x = do  
        z <- putStrLn &quot;Please enter a number: &quot;  
        name <- getLine  
        let y = read name ::Double  
        return (x+y)  
</code></pre>
If we do something like:<p><pre><code>    value1 <- notPurelyFunctional 5.0  
    value2 <- notPurelyFunctional 5.0  
    value1 == value2  
</code></pre>
we have no idea what &quot;value1 == value2&quot; will evaluate to, so either:<p>a) The above code is <i>not part of the Haskell language</i> (which would be weird as it all runs just fine under GHC, and &quot;stuff that runs under GHC&quot; is what any ordinary person means by &quot;Haskell&quot;)<p>or<p>b) Haskell is not a &quot;pure functional language&quot; the way that term is ordinarily understood, which is: &quot;calling the same function multiple times with the same arguments will always produce the same results&quot; (in which case &quot;value1 == value2&quot; must evaluate to &quot;True&quot;, which it does not in general when running the above code).",1424506796

All hope has been dashed by the Five-Eyes oppression designed to reign in their own citizens - not find terrorists, but rather give these heinous organs of repression the ability to interfere in any industry they choose, with any person they sight, for any reason whatsoever.  What was once a dream of hope is now an incredible nightmare, and America - loudest of all the arrogant Western nations claiming moral high ground, proud proclaimer of its own exceptionalism, can no longer do so.  The fact is: there <i>IS</i> no difference, any more, between the oppression felt by the Chinese, or that now enacted on any member of the Five-Eyes state.<p>The door has been slammed shut on freedom, equality, liberty.",1424506320

In the case of technology being used peacefully, its those who profit from war machines - military-industrial producers of hate and violence - who we must stand up to.
