8979297,comment,8977198,8979176,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"I think you can make an argument that spoofing should be legal (if for no other reason than for how hard it is to enforce).  But if you are going to do that, you need to also require uniquely identifying information on the orders in the book as well.  This way the market itself can accurately assign a value to the likelihood of being able to actually trade with a counterparty.<p>If an order comes from an entity with a reputation and history of yanking the order before anyone is able to trade with it, then the other participants in the market can accurately price based on that information.<p>But the current status quo of letting orders be anonymous and not punishing spoofing regularly provides a real moral hazard for traders that would otherwise prefer to actually trade the volumes they say they want to.",1422769762

8979284,comment,8978186,8978536,0,0,Falkon1313,,,"The point is that people are told that the risk of death is the same in both cases, and either way, they&#x27;re deciding between the same chance of loss of life, or certain loss of money, but they respond differently depending on how it is phrased - whether they would be losing or gaining the money in exchange for taking (or not taking) the risk.<p>What I see as the inequivalence is that in the first case, they&#x27;re gaining a cure either way (if it doesn&#x27;t kill them). (Although it doesn&#x27;t say what would be cured - I wonder whether most people assumed a terminal illness vs. some minor ailment?)  But in the second scenario, they&#x27;re not gaining anything but the money.  So it becomes a 99.9% chance of curing something that you want to cure (possibly terminal) vs a 0.1% chance of dying for nothing but money when you weren&#x27;t even sick.<p>I wonder if death isn&#x27;t the biggest skew though.  When pharmaceuticals are mentioned, I think of weight loss, impotence, and cosmetics industries.  It would be interesting to see the outcome of replicating the experiment for each of those compared to actual industry profits of each.  If a group of people pay more to try to be attractive than they do to delay death, would their experimental responses to risk match the observed facts of their actual behavior?  Are most people acting irrationally (in the Economics sense)?  And if so, what would that tell us about the risk studies?",1422769364

By contrast, he had to sell the mug for about $3 and change to get them to buy when they did not already own it. Kahneman’s conclusion was that people put a higher price on loss than they do gain.<p>That&#x27;s a weird conclusion. Let&#x27;s say I value the mug at $5. Obviously I&#x27;m not going to sell it for $5, because the transaction itself is an effort, so I would lose! The opposite for buying, obviously I&#x27;m not going to buy a mug for $5 if I think it&#x27;s worth exactly $5.<p>The price a rational person is willing to accept for a thing he owns must always be higher than what he values it at.<p>In a general case, probability of gain is obviously worth less than the same probability of loss, because you need bigger relative return to make up for the loss.",1422769346

Separate indexes combine memory with batch-updated storage.&quot;\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/richhickey/status/420910382538948608"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/richhickey/status/420910382538948608</a><p>Restating in my own words:<p>The transaction log is essentially just a stream of asserts and retracts with metadata. That&#x27;s used for durability first and echoed to clients/peers and the indexing engine. The indexing engine asynchronously batch updates indexes (which probably are b-trees, but have no need to be streaming append-only style in this context). The peers query a joined dataset of the latest consistent indexes plus the set of unindexed transactions.<p>> As append-only B tree is persistent.<p>You&#x27;re right, it can be. However, the popular append-only b-tree systems (such as CouchDB) are actually append-only B+-tree systems. That &quot;+&quot; means the leaves of the tree are intrusively linked together, and so are not persistent. You can not &quot;fork&quot; such trees cheaply.<p>> losing information is a specific feature that was added to git<p><a href=""http://blog.datomic.com/2013/05/excision.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.datomic.com/2013/05/excision.html</a>",1422768921

8979253,comment,8977440,8977928,0,0,Zancarius,,,"> 1. Touchscreen computers are in the minority now, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll remain in the minority.<p>I&#x27;m not <i>completely</i> sure I agree. But as with most things in technology, reflecting on past design changes or evolution isn&#x27;t always a good marker for what&#x27;s in store for the future. For one thing, I can foresee typical desk positions as a contributing factor to shoulder strain when using a touch-style monitor for prolonged periods being a problem. Would it be useful for some things? Sure, but I don&#x27;t see it as completely practical when the user essentially has to reach up and press the monitor all day for various tasks (industrial use cases might be worth researching here since so many of them rely on touch interfaces or similar, particularly in high tech factories, but most of these workers are not only standing but the buttons are quite large).<p>Remember, the same kids you mentioned who are growing up with touch devices have also been exposed, generally, to pointing devices in parallel for much of their lives. The mouse, as a pointing device, is going to take a ground breaking technological leap to kill--touch alone isn&#x27;t going to accomplish this because the precision simply isn&#x27;t there.<p>Realistically, I don&#x27;t see it as backwards: I see it as practical.<p>> 2. Removing charms, for example, did nothing for desktop PCs.<p>(Disclaimer: I never used Windows 8 precisely because of these decisions. Likewise, I&#x27;m a Linux user. That probably tells you everything you need to know.)<p>Charms <i>annoyed the hell out of me</i>; rather, the fullscreen application of them annoyed the hell out of me. For one, defaulting to a fullscreen UI on a desktop absolutely breaks workflow for most people (myself included), it&#x27;s visually jarring, and making something scroll horizontally in a desktop environment is not only inconsistent with the default behavior of most applications (also designed for a desktop environment) but it&#x27;s almost painfully awkward to use with a mouse. I commend Microsoft for trying something new, but their current decisions to make Windows 10 more like a 7-8 hybrid are suggestive of a deeper truth: There&#x27;s no business sense in alienating a substantial majority of your install base by imposing a UI that&#x27;s both painful and intrusive to use for most desktop users.<p>To say nothing of the various hotspots enabled by default that were clearly intended to be used with swipe gestures. You could argue it&#x27;s annoyance bred by lack of interest in learning a new UI (it&#x27;s not), but when that same UI is intended for something that primarily uses touch interaction, shoehorning it into an environment where the primary interaction is through a pointing device, you&#x27;re left with a disaster. Hence Windows 10, which I don&#x27;t find all that bad.<p>Also, I should note that while tablet mode in Windows 10 still retains some of the smaller, more difficult-to-activate-via-touch items in the start screen, we&#x27;re still discussing a preview version of an OS that isn&#x27;t expected to be released until October. I expect that they&#x27;ll further improve tablet mode for touch users.",1422768298

Apple didn&#x27;t use their technology, they saw ideas and created their own unique implementation that went far beyond the Star interface (and they hired some PARC employees).  Xerox wasn&#x27;t given what amounted to $16 million to visit the cafeteria, they knew what they were doing.  After Xerox got a new CEO they filed their suit as a followup to exploit Apple&#x27;s suit against MS in case they won.<p>>Microsoft did pay Apple for the rights to use Macintosh-style interfaces<p>MS paid Apple for some rights (with the license really tied to giving MS early access to develop apps for the Mac), and Apple filed suit over the MS implementation since they interpreted the license as limited, while MS exploited it as unlimited and Apple screwed up the dating in the agreement expecting an earlier ship date.  MS completely screwed Apple in that deal.  The eventual suit Apple filed was what triggered Xerox to file suit.<p>>Those claims would have been terrible for the software industry if upheld, not just in this particular case, but many others.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s a good thing those claims weren&#x27;t upheld.  Though, had MS not pulled their Machiavellian stunt the suit wouldn&#x27;t have been filed in the first place.",1422767712

Gradually, he came to notice that the modern Republican party was doing lots of bad things.<p>Certainly, this puts him nowhere near writers like Daniel Davies and James Fallows, who clearly saw the war was going to be a disaster, <i>before</i> it happened.<p>But at least Sullivan was able to change his mind. Though maybe he didn&#x27;t fully recant Iraq. I can&#x27;t recall the details now. I just recall my impression of the time that, whatever he was, he wasn&#x27;t a zealot. He genuinely seemed to be thinking through and considering his opinions.<p>But yeah, far more a fan of Greenwald.

That doesn&#x27;t make it a smart thing to have been written, but simply quoting that gives an inaccurate view of Sullivan.
