The implied reason is that because that people who stay longer do more, feel better, etc. However, in many-many cases people who go home earlier are pushed out by others who stay later -- not based on productivity, etc. At [insert big company here] I knew teams where everybody stayed until 10 pm every day, because that was the team culture.

It started a minor s### storm and a couple of local IBM guys went down to talk to Joyent, which eventually led to the whole advisory board / foundation initiative. Mostly it was all back-room discussions between companies taking place in private from the wider community. They&#x27;re great people, but that isn&#x27;t really what I had in mind.<p>IBM&#x27;s cloud offering runs on the PowerPC architecture, and older versions of V8 won&#x27;t run on it, so they can&#x27;t offer Node hosting. They ported a private build of Node to run on PowerPC using a new version of V8, but Joyent has so far refused to upgrade V8 despite having a pull request with all the work done.  It looks a lot like Joyent has been dragging their heels on V8 updates just to fend off an IBM cloud service for node.<p>The first five words of the announcement are: &quot;Joyent, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Fidelity&quot;. That says a lot right there. StrongLoop, NPM and a bunch of others are excluded, the whole thing seems to have been baked up in private by people who aren&#x27;t core contributors, and then sprung on the community like it&#x27;s some great thing.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a step in the right direction, but as it stands I&#x27;d expect this foundation to be about as useful as another hole in the head.

9028967,comment,9027180,9028188,0,0,zanny,,,"I disagree with both premises, because software is not a free market. It exists in the framing context of IP and copyright, unnatural societal constructs with varying reasons for existing. But they do exist.<p>It is not a universal truth whether or not proprietary or free software makes sense. In a world without copyright, the mechanisms of software profiteering and the utility of open or closed source radically change, since anything and everything is effectively permissively licensed.<p>On one side, it would take the profit motive out of proprietary software. Without copyright you can not prosecute users who redistribute your binaries, and thus it is &quot;hard&quot; to get people to buy them from you. I would not say impossible because I would not fathom considering all the possibilities in such a foreign context. But in the general case, without copyright, it becomes impossible to profiteer off false scarcity of information in the form of copies of software.<p>I say that because its important to contextualize why people strive to close off and lock down their software by depriving users of software freedoms - because copyright control, control of distribution, and the right to a monopoly over the idea means profit. If you take that away suddenly there is little incentive not to develop the software you want communally with others who want the same software, because your options are either do all the work yourself closed and have everyone else use it anyway, or open it up and have others contribute and lessen your burden. The mechanism though does not change - if you are distributing your software, which is the only way the GPL even takes effect to compel source release, in a copyright free world it makes more sense to at least release the source as an act of security. Because you cannot even sell visibility - ie, if someone wants to derive from you, you cannot extort them to see the source because if you do take money from them to see it once, you cannot legally compel them not to then release it once you have willfully given them a copy.<p>In that political paradigm - not a universe, not a fundamental rule of reality - software freedom just makes sense almost all the time. And the edge cases where it does not are much easier to overcome, because today free software is an uphill battle against corporate interests who use their power over software to extort their users of revenue to then fund the enhancement of their product. It is why photoshop and office are so hard to contend with, because they get so much money by using this framework of information monopolies to entrench themselves perpetually.<p>There are a lot of ways to frame a society that could in theory bias it towards free or proprietary software. which is in part why I don&#x27;t always agree with RMS - I love the GPL and what it means in our political environment today, but I also claim it is a highly flawed economic model due to the existence of state sponsored IP in the first place. But there are <i>many</i> other ways to do things, and in any of those permutations free software may or may not be economically optimal, and that means it is absolutely simplifying things to claim &quot;universes where free software make sense&quot; exist. That is literally not seeing outside the box at all.",1423593379

One-star [1] or two-star or three-star ratings are usually there because there is some glaring flaw that everyone is upset about, and it&#x27;s usually worth reading the reviews to see if it&#x27;s a problem I&#x27;ll also encounter.<p>Fifty percent of the time, that &quot;flaw&quot; is a bunch of complaints about price or IAP [2]. The other 50% is crashing on certain devices. Vanishingly few people with thoughtful, in-depth grievances about an app will actually take the time to review it. They&#x27;ll just delete the app and move on. So there is a bit of a selection bias at play in the ratings set.<p>[1] I do feel there&#x27;s a big gulf between one star and two stars. At least in my anecdotal experience, a one-star rating often means the app is so buggy as to be borderline unusable, or else fundamentally flawed in some way. A two-star rating is a very different animal; it often means the app itself shows promise, but it is priced poorly, or else it has stability issues on certain OS versions or devices. Three stars is where you start to enter the territory of legitimately mixed opinion about an app&#x27;s quality in and of itself. (Assuming, of course, that the number of reviews is large enough.)<p>[2] Incidentally, these complaints are often valid, albeit expressed in very peremptory ways. I&#x27;m not dismissing them, especially when they concern pay-to-play IAP mechanisms. But I do take them with a grain of salt.",1423592613

It&#x27;s not that libre software isn&#x27;t important, or hasn&#x27;t had a huge impact on the software world.  But the very idea that it should be perceived as the <i>ultimate priority</i> in the existence of software is wrong. That viewpoint fails to understand or acknowledge how people use software and what <i>other</i> important risks they perceive and face related to software.  As such, our libre utopia falls apart because we didn&#x27;t understand that it had to be inhabited by real humans.<p><i>he probably could be &quot;connected with the present technology&quot; if he wanted to.</i><p>Case in point.  Understanding how people use and are affected by &quot;present technology&quot; is key to follow-on innovations after copyleft.

For a time, that was fine because we had the heyday of free software&#x27;s expansion to worry about.

Most of the time was spent integrating OAuth and repeatedly overhauling the UI. It is powered by Backbone, Rivets, Node, Memcache, and Mongo. All social media and email accounts are connected via OAuth.<p>I learned quite a bit during this process.

This kind of problem is usually typical of people (of any native language) with high levels of literacy - it happens when a substantial part of their vocabulary comes from reading books rather than oral communication (be it person to person or tv/ cinema).
To me, the problem of native English speakers seems to be that they are often unable to <i>write</i> their native language well enough not to come across as uneducated people.<p>I am an Italian living in an English speaking country. I never had any problem in remembering the correct spelling of English words, and I believe it&#x27;s because I can read them with the Italian pronunciation (in which spelling and sound are perfectly matching). It&#x27;s probably much easier for the brain to remember a sequence of sounds rather than a sequence of symbols. So I wonder if anybody has ever tried, as a teaching tool, to teach children to read English with an &quot;alphabetic&quot; pronunciation that associates exactly one sound to each letter. Assigning to every word a &quot;written&quot; sound on top of the &quot;spoken&quot; sound could help in remembering the correct spelling.",1423591532
