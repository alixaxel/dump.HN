9099654,comment,9096321,9096910,0,0,vidarh,,,"As with asm.js it wouldn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be universally accepted: It can &quot;sneak in the back door&quot; by continuing to work fine in browers that &quot;just&quot; supports standard javascript.<p>If code using this method clearly labels the bytecode and interpreter and the part that background loads the &quot;real thing&quot;, then implementations can opt to add whatever optimisations they like to speed it up as it stabilises . Doesn&#x27;t matter if the bytecode changes, as long as it&#x27;s labelled properly so the optimised versions falls back to just interpreting the JS if it comes across a version (of the interpreter/bytecode as a whole, or just a single opcode) it doesn&#x27;t understand (or that the implementer hasn&#x27;t seen a need to optimise).<p>If the interpreter is guaranteed to retain a certain structure, it could be very easy to just &quot;unroll&quot; the interpreter loop and selectively JIT portions of the bytecode based on hotspots. You can optimise that a lot in a non-bytecode specific way by annotating the interpreter loop with assertions that grants extra guarantees (immutable bytecode; markers to indicate which code is only interpreter scaffolding; decoding hints; if  you also tack on &quot;labels&quot; for each instructions, implementations can special case on individual instructions that &quot;settle&quot; while still handling new instructions/changes by inlining the interpreter code.<p>> What does a specific bytecode buy you beyond slightly shorter load times (which the emterpreter already gives a way to greatly reduce)<p>The full speed from the start; note the substantially lower speed for the first little part. And the example codebase is small compared to some of the things people want to run.<p>I think we sort-of agree. I don&#x27;t necessarily think there&#x27;s a reason to specify a standard bytecode, exactly because this approach could conceivably be extended to effectively give us a &quot;mostly standard&quot; bytecode with the freedom to continue to change the format without a lengthy committee approach, because there&#x27;s a demonstrably viable fallback.",1424771829

9099647,comment,9098761,9098761,0,0,xianshou,,,"The author&#x27;s thesis is that, since &quot;airplanes don&#x27;t fly like birds fly,&quot; defining AI by human imitation or servitude is really a provincial kind of speciesism. There&#x27;s a very important distinction, however, between &quot;acts human,&quot; &quot;obeys humans,&quot; and &quot;acts in the interest of humans,&quot; which the article glosses over.<p>While a strong AI wouldn&#x27;t need to be designed expressly to mimic humans or slave at their bidding (what the author argues against), it would absolutely need to be programmed to <i>respect, support, and further human needs</i>. Almost any other way of designing a true AI, if it succeeds, results in instant extinction for humans. This is simply because if we are irrelevant, then we and our environment represent a useful source of raw material.<p>The simplest and most commonly cited example is the paper clip maximizer, which is seeded with making paper clips as its primary goal at some early stage of its development. Even after achieving superintelligence, it keeps that fundamental goal, and thus converts the solar system and whatever else it can access into a giant paper clip factory. (See <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Unfriendly_artificial_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Unfriendly_artificial_intelli...</a> for more.)<p>Many have in fact argued that the only moral way to design a superintelligence is to imbue it with the desires of our more perfect selves. This theory is called Coherent Extrapolated Volition (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligenc...</a>), and the core idea is that the final goal of superintelligence should be whatever we ourselves would think of, if we were allowed to keep iteratively perfecting ourselves according to our current values until we reached a local maximum.<p>So while the article is interesting from an egalitarian perspective, the final issue comes down to this: any superintelligence had better be interested in us, because due to its immeasurably greater power, either it likes us or we&#x27;re dead.",1424771654

Needless say the downvotes came pretty quick. I think the chance that Bitcoin simply changes to match any competitors is ludicrous. Only consensus changes are possible whilst preserving the Blockchain. Any controversial change that has enough merit will split the market between Bitcoin and an altcoin and divide supporters along those lines.

Its definitely not clear that scenario ends in a change to Bitcoin early enough to defeat the altcoin.<p>I also think the OPs point about the highlander effect isn&#x27;t well made - a coins mining pool only needs to be strong enough to protect itself from attacks that it&#x27;s value incentivises.",1424771254

Some of his coworkers stopped by. The conversation switched to the car one of them had bought. A Lexus SC430 convertible. He was complaining about how he never got to get out of The City and drive it enough. They were all super-sharp CS graduates working for one of the most successful hedge funds in the world.<p>My point with this story is that if you are making way above the median salary in NYC ($200k+ range at the time, this was 10 years ago) - the world is just different. You are making enough money to enjoy one of the top cities in the world. With the $125k-$140k salaries some software developers report making, they are barely getting to &quot;enjoy&quot; living in NYC. Finance has distorted the baseline of what it means to be successful in NYC. I mean, my school friends&#x27; coworkers were 2-3 yrs out of Harvard and talking about the travails of $80k car ownership like it was an Accord.<p>Software salaries outside of Fintech and top-tier companies like Google and Facebook and a handful of others in globally attractive cities are the equivalent of middle class in the burbs. You&#x27;re doing OK but you&#x27;re not going to be relatively &#x27;really doing well&#x27;. In a city like NYC, there are more than enough free events to overwhelm anyone.

I urge to watch it if you haven&#x27;t a clear idea of what life can be like for a drug addict. On a number of occasions one could see he sincerely hated the drug but couldn&#x27;t control his addiction. He jumped out the window of his house during one attempt at going cold turkey and broke his foot since he was locked in the house and wanted to get some heroin. His veins collapsed due to all the injections of heroin over the years. He ultimately died of brain haemorrhage due to withdrawal symptoms in a detox facility.<p>I don&#x27;t use drugs either and when I hear people&#x27;s arguments about legalizing marijuana, it makes sense in the context of a society that legalized alcoholic drinks and cigarettes. But meth and heroin are in a league of their own and I don&#x27;t believe your argument makes any sense whatsoever. Lowering the bar from &quot;the worst of all drugs&quot; to &quot;not as bad but you&#x27;ll probably get addicted to it, may lose control of your life and possibly end up with a series of medical conditions and including death&quot; is not acceptable.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7thZbHTvZIQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7thZbHTvZIQ</a>",1424769769

9099516,comment,9084000,9098365,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> I apologize in advance since I&#x27;m a bit short for time at the moment and I&#x27;ll just post a short(-ish) reply to the questions I can answer from the top of my head (more or less).<p>That&#x27;s okay. Totally get that. Same boat. Thanks for status.<p>> The medal forged by the Russian Govt. itself is the most damning evidence<p>Couple thoughts.<p>The article you link to concludes that the 2/20 date makes sense for being dates that snipers became active.<p>It&#x27;s also easy to explain the 2/20 date as a day that contingency planning and deployment started, and the reason the medal exists is because the contigency plan needed to be executed.<p>Finally I checked the source of the Crimean medal story. I am not able to find (although it has been very difficult to search because I do not speak Russian) any statement made by Russia regarding the medal or it being a mistake, as claimed by Radio Free Europe. Also, provided that RFE is a propaganda outlet, and we&#x27;re trying to exclude them as sources, how do you feel about this? In particular there&#x27;s this interesting blog post about how the British propaganda effort made up a fake German medal in analogous circumstances [1].<p>Finally, I do believe that the medal is real and the 2/20 date is real. But I&#x27;m not sure how to interpret the 2/20 day other than as the beginning of contingency planning. It&#x27;s 100% true that Russia wanted to annex Crimea and designed plans to do it. There&#x27;s no debate from me there.<p>> Many of its statements are effectively regurgitated Russian state media news pieces, many of which are lies, while others are twisted to further a propagandistic agenda.<p>It does sound quite a lot like the State Department. Of course Russia&#x27;s propaganda has always been a bit more crass. So are we at a point where no official statements can be trusted? If so we&#x27;re really limiting our sources. Is there a department of Russia that you trust? It&#x27;s sort of hard to cite material if anything from any source in Russia is knocked out of consideration.<p>Anyway, there are non-Russian sources that were presented. It would still be difficult to explain the Der Speigel numbers matching the RT numbers so closely, etc. I don&#x27;t mind if you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t have time to pursue this line any more - Academi/Greystone/Blackwater presence is a side conversation to the main discussion.<p>> Sure, but first: most of the well-known media outlets in Russia are state-owned or controlled/censored. Because of this there&#x27;s practically no difference between them with respect to the journalistic integrity (or lack thereof) in their reporting.<p>Yes.<p>I meant a source for the drinking the blood of babies thing. But the crucifixion one is pretty good. That&#x27;s pretty silly, Russia...<p>I do not know what to make of the stopfake website (it&#x27;s the first time I have run into it.) Here&#x27;s a neat one for the US news, in case it is useful to you [2]. Regarding fake news in the United States, there has been similar coverage. Of course first comes the reports of WMDs in Iraq, the DoD Analyst Program and then media blackout [3], and plenty of other examples of media manipulation from the US government [4]. I totally get that Russia and RT are more crass.<p>Anyway, there are other sources listed. If you don&#x27;t want to use RT that&#x27;s fine with me, but we should probably avoid a bunch of different news outlets in that case and be sure to reply to the non-RT ones.<p>[[Back to what was mentioned before...]]<p>We should consider consolidating the conversation. There are lots of interesting things to be said, but there&#x27;s a lot that hasn&#x27;t been addressed and there is significant danger of too much rat-holing. I think you agree with the thesis that the US has been pushing politics, activists, demonstrators and interest groups in the Ukraine toward Europe through the use of CSOs and their funding of NGOs, and organizing a replacement to Yan evidenced by the leaked tapes on DemocracyNow and by the USAID documents that clearly state US Foreign Policy objectives and procedures. (Interesting aside: Secretary of State Kerry&#x27;s son is has recently become a major stakeholder in Ukraine oil)...<p>I think we differ about how okay that is - you&#x27;ll say that it&#x27;s legal or acceptable. Can you correct me if I&#x27;m wrong about your agreeing that both covert and overt action have been and are taken in Ukraine and other states by the US to pursue policy objectives?<p>[1] <a href=""https://ersjdamoo.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/mystery-of-the-crimean-medal/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ersjdamoo.wordpress.com/2014/05/01/mystery-of-the-cr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.emergent.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emergent.info/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_program"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_military_analyst_prog...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8933443"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8933443</a>",1424768998

When signing up for a new broadband connection, the box enabling this &#x27;adult content&#x27; filter is ticked by default, meaning you have to actively untick it. 
ISPs are also required to contact all existing customers somehow and ask them whether or not they want the filter enabled.<p>No laws have been passed yet to enforce ISPs to do this, just pressure from David Cameron and campaigns by the Daily Mail and &#x27;parent&#x27; groups and stuff, although David Cameron did say if the recently implemented system was not effective enough they would have to legislate (the problem now, is whether the 4-8% takeup on all but one isp is &#x27;effective&#x27;.)",1424768654

The sources don&#x27;t indicate the age of the data, but even if it&#x27;s only a couple of years old, it&#x27;s going to be wrong by enough to be a factor.<p>I have lived in Austin for a couple of years, and also lived here (and owned a house here) about 8 years ago. The cost of homes here has gone up <i>tremendously</i> since then. I was shopping for a house a few months ago, and was simply unable to buy one; those in my price range wouldn&#x27;t accept my offer because it wasn&#x27;t an all-cash offer (despite being $5000 or more over the asking price). Investors paying cash are buying aggressively here, driving up prices. Rental rates have risen at an even faster pace.<p>Certainly, it&#x27;s cheaper here than in Silicon Valley. Five years ago, I was paying $2145 a month in rent for a house a couple of blocks from downtown Mountain View. Today I&#x27;m paying $1690 a month for a house quite far outside of downtown Austin and on the east side; renting in downtown is not an option, even at $2000+ a month. Apartments are somewhat cheaper, and buying a house is still notably cheaper than Silicon Valley, but the gap has been closing rapidly.<p>In short, Austin has grown incredibly fast in recent years, and the real estate market hasn&#x27;t been able to absorb that growth in anything like a reasonable manner. So much so that I&#x27;d be shocked if the graphs in this article still reflect reality for Austin.",1424768578
