8989827,comment,8988819,8988819,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;m upvoting this because the issue deserves more attention and discussion. I am somewhat leery of implementation details, having tons of experience working for both large governmental and private organizations. Large organizations are notoriously difficult to deal with -- large government organizations are an order of magnitude (or two) worse. Them&#x27;s just the facts.<p>I am completely supportive of any effort to cut through the BS and make the government more transparent and accessible. So easy-to-use portals, apps for accessing benefits, publish-subscribe services to find opportunities? Dang, there&#x27;s a lot of cool stuff folks could do. Great idea. Let&#x27;s go do it.<p>I am completely concerned about the idea of both automating enforcement and the collection/cross-indexing of data. I have a choice whether or not I let Facebook rape my privacy and anonymity online. I do not have a choice about what I report to the IRS. I&#x27;m extremely unhappy with the Facebook situation, and the government is a completely different animal.<p>Laws and regulations -- centuries of them by now -- were made to be enforced by humans, not computers. That&#x27;s why we have so many of them and they overlap so much. Anything that takes us closer to automatically fining me when I drive 5 mph over the speed limit, schedules an audit if I make a math mistake on my taxes, or tells me what I can do or not do based on data processing that was impossible ten years ago? Screw that. I want no part of it. In fact, I would make a strong case that such activity is antithetical to a free and just society.<p>I&#x27;m also concerned over the difference between a PR move and something tangible. Show me the next idiot in the White House of a different party that&#x27;s doing this, and I&#x27;ll be much happier. Otherwise, not only do I have the reservations that I currently have, I&#x27;ve now added a new one: that all of this automation and assistance is only happening by supporters of one political party. Not good.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I like the idea. I want to see some clear ethical guidelines and permanence across political parties before I could support this, however.

8989822,comment,8986183,8988778,0,0,sqrt17,,,"You&#x27;re arguing from a frame where there is a demand for a constant set of things (&quot;jobs&quot;) and people capture the money that can be exchanged for that set of things. This assumes that a number of parameters in the market are fixed, and that you can &quot;create&quot; or &quot;destroy&quot; jobs with economic actions that are partly independent of the non-economic world.<p>Looking at historical economics, another way of looking at this is to see an economy as things going in (sunshine, non-renewable resources consumed, loot acquired in wars) and things going out (people eating, garbage produced, etc.), and the ways of distributing the flow between these.<p>It turns out that you can have a &quot;surplus&quot;, when you suddenly have more money/resources than you had before. There are different means of getting rid of surplusses, including wars, social programs, or simply population growth (consider how New York&#x27;s area used to sustain\nabout a hundred people).<p>Looking back at the demise of weaving and spinning as jobs, you see that the immediate effect of that was a higher concentration of wealth in the hands of some individuals, which (in Europe) led to counter-movements involving democratization and social issues.<p>The real problem is not that it&#x27;s possible to find more effective ways to do some jobs than employing people for it, the real problem consists in the readjustment of power relationships that becomes necessary when you remove resposibilities from lots of people and put them in the hands of relatively few people.<p>Maybe some governments institute a robot tax, which augments the cost of robots by a percentage not high enough to consider other alternatives (e.g. moving off-shore, which has been possible with production jobs but not with manufacturing jobs), and use these funds towards things that society as a whole regards as beneficial (such as building nice parks, everyone getting a university degree, or every city having an opera and a theater, or war or terrorism or spying on your citizens, if those are what a society thinks it wants).<p>Standard &quot;capitalist&quot; economic doctrine wants us to believe that surplusses always belong to the innovators or those taking associated risks, and both historically and currently this has only been partly true. Maybe those surplusses will just be destroyed in the next &quot;AI&quot; bubble, maybe they will be used to create a post-democratic oppressive state, maybe they will be used to create a modern-day utopia. We don&#x27;t know yet what will happen, but we sure should not let others reframe the issue as technocrats-vs-luddites, because that is not what it is.",1422964009

My brother was learning programming by himself. They both thought it would be a great idea to teach me how to program too.<p>I. Hated. It. (pun intended). All those if else conditions and bla bla bla for loops were booooring. Suffice to say, I never touched programming till much later.<p>This was when I was around 10-12 years old. Fast forward to the point at which I was supposed to pick a degree to do. One thing led to another and through the most random thought process ever, I picked a degree in applied IT. That&#x27;s where you learn how to analyse a business and design the system spec and suggest re-engineering of processes for an IT solution to be brought in (and a lot of really great stuff that&#x27;s essential to form a great backbone/foundation to any IT project).<p>For the first year, students from software engineering and applied IT all take the same modules. One of those modules, was introduction to programming via C (Applied IT students need this since their final year will see them partially/fully implementing solutions that they come up with for real world problems).<p>The first lecture, the lecturer walks up, ties his hair back, and tells us to forget about the language C before we start. &quot;Huh? But we are going to learn C right?&quot;. But no. He continues. &quot;Programming ISN&#x27;T about the language. It&#x27;s about solving problems. If you can solve problems and if you can write down the solution to the problems in a step by step way, then you can program. Everything else is just syntax&quot;<p>That lit a light bulb in my head. Suddenly programming wasn&#x27;t about memorising how to use an if condition. It was about just googling what the language uses for conditions. It wasn&#x27;t about memorising &#x27;array()&#x27;. It was about finding out what the language uses to store a set of elements in a grouped or ordered way.<p>It wasn&#x27;t about the language. It was about first figuring out what steps I need to take to solve the problem before going back to the language to find out how their syntax supported my solution. I started programming then. I switched streams to Software Engineering. And now I look forward to programming every single day.<p>That, is my suggestion. Don&#x27;t take the path of simply learning the language. Approach everything from the path of how to solve a problem.<p>&#x27;When building you can use a nail or a screw. Learning how to move your hand to hit the nail when using a hammer, or learning how to twist a screw driver won&#x27;t teach you how to choose between the nail or screw.&#x27;<p>Cheers.

A tiny function which loads textures. I was fooling around with optimising load speeds. The actual speedup I got was insignificant and I really should revert it to safe code.<p>2. A silly getter on the transformation matrix---another misguided attempt at a speedup; no reason to use UnsafeCell instead of RefCell. Should revert.<p>3. Casting buffers from files as structs. This is safe for any buffer the same size as a Copy struct, std offers no such function, so I do. Unsafety is isolated in two small functions (one for T and one for Vec<T>), all its callers are safe.<p>4. Interacting with OpenGL. Fair enough, this happens all over the place, but it&#x27;s not actually unsafe. The OpenGL bindings library didn&#x27;t take much care to only mark unsafe operations as such, and all GL calls are marekd unsafe---which is why I wrap them up in a macro which peforms the operation in an unsafe block and panics on any error.

You can buy cute little quads for as little as USD16, but the firmware for these things is always closed. Same with the DJI Phantoms and their Chinese clones.<p>What you&#x27;re looking for is a flight controller with open source firmware. You have several options for this, but Arducopter and MultiWii are the most common. I prefer arducopters, but it&#x27;s more of a &#x27;PC versus Mac&#x27; debate: there are upsides and downsides to both, and in the end, both do a pretty good job. They&#x27;re basically Arduino sketches loaded on an ATMEGA, so customizing it is pretty straightforward.<p>I would highly recommend building it yourself, not buying a ready-made quad. It&#x27;s cheaper in the long run, (search &#x27;DJI phantom replacement parts&#x27; for instance), more fun and you&#x27;ll learn more. I don&#x27;t think you can write a decent stability algorithm without knowing exactly what your hardware does. One word of &#x27;warning&#x27; though: the people behind Arducopter/MultiWii really know what they&#x27;re doing. If you&#x27;re expecting to write a better stability algorithm than the current ones, well, you&#x27;re in for quite a challenge. Having said that, if you choose to contribute to the open source projects: power to you!<p>For about USD250 you can assemble a decent quad that&#x27;s:\n- Fun to fly\n- Has replaceable parts (a necessity, you WILL crash)\n- Is upgradeable (GPS for instance, or better ESC&#x27;s, better motors, etc.)\n- Has an open source flight controller<p>You should be able to make one yourself for this amount. Take for instance a nice 250 size FPV quad:\n- ARF-kit: USD 100,- (Frame, motors, escs, wires, etc.)\n- HKPilot (APM based) flight controller: USD 71,-\n- Transmitter/Receiver: USD 54,-\n- Keychain camera\n- Ass. propellers (buy spares.

With gopro attached it weighs in about 1150 grams, and I get about 6-7 minutes of flying time with a 3-cell 2200mah lipo. I&#x27;m always experimenting on improving flight times, and I think I can squeeze a couple of minutes more out of it with a little tweaking. OTOH, 3-cell lipos are less than 15 bucks so I always bring 3 or 4 of them with me.<p>A couple of extra words if you&#x27;re new to flying quads: \n- Start off with a light, cheap microquad. For instance the Cheerson CX-10. At 20 bucks it&#x27;ll cost less than a wrecked frame and 2 props, and it will teach you how to fly these things. Plus, they&#x27;re light so there&#x27;s no damage when you crash them.<p>- Please, please be careful with the larger quads. Don&#x27;t fly over people, don&#x27;t fly over buildings, roads, etc. Not only is this dangerous, (+2 lbs travelling at 40mph with spinning blades...) you&#x27;re ruining the hobby for everybody else when things go wrong. Same goes for cameras strapped to your quad: respect privacy.<p>- I&#x27;ve said it before but here it goes again: You. Will. Crash. Don&#x27;t think &#x27;I&#x27;ll be extra careful&#x27; or (in my case) &#x27;I&#x27;m a seasoned RC pilot, I think I&#x27;m able to fly this thing without crashing&#x27;: you&#x27;re wrong. I promise. You will crash, and you will break stuff. Not the end of the world, but get some spare props and a frame if you can.<p>- I&#x27;ve had nothing but excellent experiences with Chinese webshops like dx.com, banggood.com or miniinthebox.com. Sure, quality is less than European brands like Graupner, but it&#x27;ll work. Your first car probably wasn&#x27;t a brand new Audi, but a banged up &#x27;89 civic, right? It&#x27;ll get the job done just fine.<p>One last thing: I don&#x27;t know if you have a wife/husband, but be prepared to spend a lot of time tinkering.

During subduction of plates (mostly oceanic crust full of water under continental plates of lower density) the volatiles (mostly water) exits the subducting plate and lowers the viscosity and density of the overlying mantle material (viscosity describing the &#x27;fluidness&#x27; of the material, higher viscosity = less fluid). The material will then rise up and there will be volcanism, recycling the material back to the surface. This is what you see in most major volcanic arcs, such as the Andes or Japan.<p>The idea that plate tectonics and water are intrinsically linked (at given circumstances) is pretty solidified. The theory of why not such much; the idea above fits our current data best, but data from the planet&#x27;s interiour is hard to come by and I expect some updates to the theory within a few decades.

Why is that not scalable to a future where most labour is not done by machines; what&#x27;s qualitatively different between 70% of the population working with 30% on welfare, and 10% of the population working with 90% on welfare?<p>>Which means automation will give rise to an increasing number of people who cannot undertake non-automatable knowledge-work, and thus become doomed to be unemployed, and leads to a self-reinforcing cycle out of which they cannot escape. This is a problem that the civilization has to confront, and our current way of thinking about economics will not work there.<p>How is it a problem? If they&#x27;re less productive than robots in every way, why not just put them on welfare? Current economics handles this perfectly.<p>>If we consider that each of us is beholden to the collective past of entire humanity, the idea of ownership and &#x27;fruits of labour&#x27; becomes just a social construct. This construct nevertheless is required today and for the foreseeable future as the only practical way to divide resources. However it is a complicated and probably intractable idea, and is not at all axiomatic as you seem to make it out to be.<p>&#x27;Fruits of labour&#x27; is axiomatic in the sense that rejecting it necessarily entails violence. Eg, if Joe picks an apple, but is not allowed to keep the fruits of his labour, this necessarily entails violence or the threat thereof to take the apple away from Joe. If Aaron sings a song and Camelia offers him a pumpkin in exchange for this, but they&#x27;re not allowed to trade freely, this necessarily implies some violence or threat thereof against them to prevent them from making the exchange. If Martha builds a car for Fred and Fred offers Martha a house in exchange, but then it&#x27;s decided Fred shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to keep the car, violence or the threat thereof is necessarily required to take the car from Fred. Unless Fred wanted to give it away freely, for instance charity, but he&#x27;s perfectly capable of doing this anyway under a &#x27;fruits of one&#x27;s labour&#x27; system.",1422961824
