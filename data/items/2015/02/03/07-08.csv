The point of the comparison was more about a quick and dirty quick example with the compression implementation and settings used by GyfCat, which was a quick way to convert the GIF. There are obvious flaws in this approach. Many flaws, in fact. However, even with those flaws, it demonstrated my point (that the GIF sucks) as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  More optimal settings and all sorts of possibilities for alternatives should be explored. But, I will leave that to someone else because that is outside of the intended scope of my intent for this comment.",1422950376

I looked two days ago at Wikipedia [0], but primary source should actually be Eurostat [1].<p>And you are of course right in that different countries have different systems, and numbers are not always directly comparable. A small difference is not necessarily significant, or there may be quite some difference in practice even if numbers are the same.<p>But if we look at those Eurostat numbers, what the paper says is <i>Total revenue from taxes and compulsory social contributions - % of GDP</i> so also for Portugal and Greece, those mandatory social security contributions of employer and employee are included as tax revenues in this comparison, like they are for Sweden.<p>What is significant is that the employment rate of people varies a lot in different countries; it is 73-74 % in Sweden, Netherlands and Germany, while it is below 50 % in Croatia and Greece.<p>It should also be noted that tax revenue to GDP is just a ratio, a number. It does not mean that taxes are a certain proportion of GDP, because a sum of all tax revenues is not a component of GDP.<p>Interestingly, in Portugal this ratio actually dropped from 33.2 % to 32.4 % between 2011-2012. Most countries were tightening taxes at that time. But since this number is ratio to GDP, if GDP increases and tax revenue stays the same, the ratio drops.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP&oldid=645214116"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_countries_...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/gen_info/economic_analysis/tax_structures/2014/pr_92-2014_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/tax...</a>",1422949765

8989260,comment,8988819,8988819,0,0,karmacondon,,,"I just find the name &quot;U.S. Digital Service&quot; to be god damn inspirational. It reminds me of Kennedy creating the Peace Corps. &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you&quot; and all that. I understand that in reality this is essentially a rebranding of the traditional government job, but it seems like it could be so much more.<p>I know that during the Healthcare.gov debacle, many people with software experience legitimately wanted to help. We look around at our communities, cities and states and see problems that could be fixed and software that&#x27;s dying to use common sense modern best practices. But government bureaucracy is an impermeable wall, sometimes for the right reasons but often due to turf protection, intransigence and lack of funding. I would be happy to volunteer my time and experience, to work collaboratively with others and to work within strict standards and specifications in order to improve the quality of government technology for everyone. But the information about how to do so is hard to find and the process isn&#x27;t very encouraging. I understand that this is a bit off topic, but when I hear &quot;US Digital Service&quot; I think &quot;Peace Corps&quot; for technology.<p>From wikipedia: &quot;The stated mission of the Peace Corps includes providing technical assistance, helping people outside the United States to understand American culture, and helping Americans to understand the cultures of other countries.&quot;<p>WTF aren&#x27;t we doing this for technology? Provide assistance, help the government to understand tech culture and help tech people understand government culture. If we train volunteers then we don&#x27;t need to give high priority projects like Healthcare.gov to the contracting firm with the lowest bid and the snazziest powerpoint presentation. Government agencies would have their pick of people who&#x27;d proven their technical skills and reliability on projects at the local, state and federal levels. Citizen programmers could feel like they were making a difference for their country, even just a small one, which is something you can&#x27;t put a price on. Government at all levels would reap huge benefits and improve services for a fraction of the cost, which would increase the general satisfaction of millions of non-technically inclined citizens.<p>The obvious problem with volunteer labor is that it&#x27;s hard to hold someone accountable if things go wrong, and the speed and quality of ongoing maintenance and support can vary. But my thought is, the current system isn&#x27;t exactly working out great either. We have catastrophic disasters at the national level and outdated and incomplete software at the local level. There are millions of people who could help, and working together they can do more good than harm. The greatest asset of the United States has always been the ingenuity and dedication of its human resources. If technology isn&#x27;t the greatest opportunity and threat of the 21st century then I don&#x27;t know what is, and it seems like a good time to marshall those resources to make the most of it.",1422947556

However, you&#x27;re not going to get that far, because you&#x27;re talking about an area that is substantially underlaid by permafrost. When that melts, it subsides and usually fills with water, which is why there are millions of boggy lakes on the North Slope of Alaska. Fertile topsoil is not just dirt, it&#x27;s a complex ecosystem of its own, and it takes a great deal of time to produce. It&#x27;s probably slightly easier to start farming in the melted Arctic than in your average desert, but it&#x27;s a pretty near thing, and your 5C difference is going to wreak havoc on current farming areas. The odds of success on this one are not good.<p>I think there&#x27;s probably some limit to how much Earth-resources should be used to terraform other planets, but with what we spend on bombs I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be a big deal.
