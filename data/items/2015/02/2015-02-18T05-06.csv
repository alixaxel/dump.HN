9067217,comment,9066544,9067049,0,0,flowlikeh2o,,,"This is very interesting. As a med student with a programming and CS background, these efforts are particularly appealing to me. It seems that (polling healthcare workers, mainly docs) technology (EMR) is more of a hindrance than a benefit, which to me has always seemed like poor design, gamblers fallacy + overwhelming costs associated with changing software in a large hospital. I don&#x27;t see how this can change unless there are standard protocols that allow for flexible data entry and analysis. The problem I see with this new system is that it doesn&#x27;t (at the surface) appear to offer anything new, whereas asthamMD is creating objective data and a unique pipeline between healthcare teams and patient. It seems like we are just waiting for some software revolution that actually saves doctor time and improves patient outcomes - rather than generate data for administrators and bureaucrats at the cost of inefficiency.",1424239070

If you want 100 grams of a tungsten-platinum mix to match the weight/volume of 100 grams of gold, this is how many grams you get to use of tungsten:<p>19.3 * 100 = 19.25 * x + 21.4(100-x)<p>gold is left, mix is right (a sum of the tungsten and platinum parts).

All three are still, technically, militarily occupied territory.<p>The wars were total wars, won at the cost of millions of lives and financial and industrial commitments that reshaped the culture of both nations, at enormous civilian costs especially on the losing side (Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima...) and the territory kept at peace via millions of boots on the ground, enormous military effort (how much does Okinawa cost per annum?) and enormous financial spending, justified by Pax Americana being presumably worth more than its bill. In the case of WWI, not invading the losing power after breaking its will to fight resulted in a worse war a couple decades later.<p>Another unpalatable and often glossed over fact is that in both Germany and Japan, middle management was kept in power because the invading authority (such as MacArthur) realised that chaos would follow otherwise, and that in a statist, single-party state, all the talent would converge to the ruling party anyway.<p>Today&#x27;s taxpayer does not want to pay for another Japan or Germany, and some people in Washington have sold him the unicorn of &quot;instant happiness once the bad guy is removed with a few skilled operators and cool tech&quot; (aka COIN), ignoring decades of history.<p>Either the American taxpayer needs to push for colonialism (call a spade a spade), or it needs to accept that furthering US interests will create side effects for locals.

It&#x27;s really, really simple compared to the &quot;good&quot; old days of cvsup and &quot;make world&quot; and roughly equivalent to &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot; or even &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; (or their YUM analogues).<p>The FreeBSD equivalent of &quot;main&quot; would be FreeBSD itself, with source/binary updates via freebsd-update or source updates via Subversion.  The FreeBSD Ports infrastructure handles package building for _all_ third-party software (Xorg, GNOME, KDE, Emacs, Perl, etc.), which would be the equivalent of &quot;universe&quot; and &quot;multiverse&quot;.  The Ports infrastructure has integrated license auditing (see <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/master/Mk/bsd.licenses.mk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/mast...</a> and <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/master/Mk/bsd.licenses.db.mk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/mast...</a>), which allows you to accept or reject licenses at package build time.<p>There is no equivalent to &quot;restricted&quot;.  The binary package repository maintained by the FreeBSD Foundation itself only contains free software, meaning that it includes only software whose licenses allow (a) redistribution of the original sources (like an FTP mirror), (b) selling copies of the original sources (like on CD-ROM), (c) free redistribution of the binary package (e.g., via FTP), (d) selling of the binary package (e.g., via CD-ROM), and (e) automatic license acceptance (which would exclude software like dccd that have EULAs which must be accepted prior to compilation/installation).<p>There is no equivalent to &quot;backports&quot; or &quot;security&quot;.  Supported FreeBSD releases get regular bugfixes and security updates as described above.  As FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, there just aren&#x27;t enough people involved to make maintaining alternate ports trees feasible.  The ports tree does get frozen and tagged at each FreeBSD release to facilitate package building, CD-ROM manufacturing, and FTP distribution, but those tags aren&#x27;t maintained except as historical markers.  If you want security updates, you need to stay abreast of the latest commits the ports tree (whether via portsnap [source], subversion [source], or pkgng [binary]).",1424237625

Instead of having paragraphs go one after another as required by print, have maps <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map</a> of the argument, wikis etc. If we focused on this more, we might have reached a new level of communication efficiency by now.<p>Here we are arguing if we should let authors stylize text. Does this restyling of text help communicate more efficiently? Typically no, a long wall of text just needs to be set in a readable style.<p>Even this choice of presentation was supposed to be the reader&#x27;s, not the author&#x27;s. I do not care one bit about links appearing in a ♢ weird new way. Links should appear the same way, everywhere on the web. <a href=""http://motherfuckingwebsite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherfuckingwebsite.com</a> just needed some padding, nice font rendering, line spacing and you&#x27;d get Medium.<p>To the reader, Medium promises consistency of presentation that the rest of the web does not. That problem should really have been solved on the browser&#x27;s end, by a style that applied to all articles, chosen by the user from existing templates.<p>The style should serve a functional purpose to the reader, be slower or faster to read, reduce eyestrain, etc.<p>The web was supposed to be more extreme than frozen pizza, more like astronaut&#x27;s food paste. Skeuomorphic pizza in any form distracts users from the real purpose.<p>As far as Medium controlling your content, if the web was smarter you could put it somewhere else and the links would magically work. Centralization is a technically simple way to exploit a dumb network and the network should be fixed.",1424237536

So it will not be possible to build your own branded consumer bank on SEED.<p>We expect our API will be used by companies that see value in automating their payments and receivables process, have a desire to integrate banking into their internal backend systems, have a desire to easily do analysis on their banking data, and so on. In the long run, we expect that most of our customers will use our mobile and web clients rather than using the API directly.<p>To answer your other questions:<p>1. Properly managing fraud is critical to our business. As you mentioned, the potential risks are scary both for us and our customers. Some of what we do will remain private, but over time we&#x27;ll share more of our approach to ensuring the safety and security of our customer funds. While we intend to protect ourselves against loss as well as or better than traditional banks, we believe there are many ways to do so without the inconveniences that most banks impose on their customers. Our first hire is an expert in cryptography, mathematics, and infosec, so that should give you some idea of where our priorities are.<p>2. We have thought a lot about how to best serve the bitcoin community. In fact, that used to be our pitch -- a bank for the bitcoin economy. As we spent many months talking to bitcoin merchants and the community at large, what we found is that the problems they face are the same problems many businesses face -- existing banks are serving business customers poorly. Until bitcoin stabilizes as a store of value or derivative strategies are baked into the exchanges, we don&#x27;t believe that bitcoin transaction volume will grow meaningfully, so we&#x27;re not focused on serving bitcoin merchants right now. Since our platform is flexible, we&#x27;ll be able to integrate bitcoin support if and when it becomes a need for our customer base, so we&#x27;ll see what happens. Personally, I own bitcoin and would love to see it or other cryptocurrencies thrive, and I&#x27;m a believer in the blockchain as an enabling technology.<p>As to banking the exchanges, we&#x27;re really limited by our regulators. We believe that properly operated exchanges that have MSB licenses and are running compliant KYC/AML programs deserve access to banking, and we believe that we can provide banking services to exchanges in a safe and lawful manner. However, the risk tolerance of our regulators does not always match our own. This is something we&#x27;ll have to work towards. In the meantime, it&#x27;s heartening to see that some exchanges appear to have found stable onshore banking relationships, such as Coinbase + SVB.",1424236812

It generates some keys that will be distributed into the pool of machines running -STABLE so that in the future, when this new variant comes into the market, there will be &quot;pre-seeded&quot; keys for compatability (ie. older versions of systems will be able to interact via signed certs with the new system)<p>Since FreeBSD <i>is</i> BSD licensed, there can be any number of things people are doing with it without anyone else knowing - so maybe to give the benefit of the doubt, I can envision a workflow that needs -CURRENT as a workstation / dev platform.<p>I think one weakness to my thinking is that VARIANTS/WITNESS/kdb/ddb can be enabled on -RELEASE and -STABLE distributions as well! Why not just do everything on -STABLE even if you need kernel debugging?<p>If they need -CURRENT for new hardware support, it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to figure out from the svn log and the rolling release notes. It&#x27;s kinda fun trying to reverse engineer the job of the thread parent&#x27;s acquaintance!",1424236323

9067084,comment,9065149,9066970,0,0,e12e,,,"To be perfectly honest, as I understand what userify does (I&#x27;m not a user) -- the whole platform would benefit [ed:from] transition[ing] to ssh certificates[1]. While key synchronization is better than doing... nothing (which a lot of people do, including me, from time to time :-). I think key management for public key authentication is pretty much a solved problem: run your own CA (or delegate to someone, like Userify).<p>There are still real issues with managing root keys etc -- but with cert support in openssh (client and server) that provides a sane basis for trust management.<p>For Userify, the service (as opposed to keys, auth, servers and users: the problem) -- I think spending some time on a UI to manage certs/ca for ssh, documenting how to use it for user-keys/certs -- and offering to run a CA per Userify-account (ie: generate/manage the root CA-cert, allowing &quot;instant security&quot; by deploying the Userify-user&#x27;s CA root cert on servers, and having a service to sign public-keys with that key) could be one very sensible approach.<p>There might be some added benefit with an &quot;always on&quot;-service, by issuing short-lived user certs (valid for, say 8 hours a la kerberos tickets) -- but for that to be useful, perhaps some work would be needed with forking putty for windows users and/or patching ssh-agent/ssh for <i>nix/OS X users. The basic functionality is there, but the UI/UX is lacking. Note that a user can keep the </i>secret key* for as long as he/she is comfortable -- it&#x27;s only the signed public cert that needs to be updated (as the previous one expires).<p>Not sure if that answers your question, but those are some of my thoughts on the matter :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/ssh-keygen.1?query=ssh-keygen&sec=1#x434552544946494341544553"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/...</a>",1424236299
