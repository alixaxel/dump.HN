Installing retail/OEM from one disk has never been the case in my experience<p>No, Home/Pro/Ultimate are separate disks -- but OEM/Retail are <i>exactly</i> the same thing. You have to phone in your activation however, since OEM keys usually do not automatically activate over the internet.<p>Vista and up, there is no such thing as an OEM ISO image. XP had that and it was a great pain for support...<p>If you mean OEM in the sense of the pre-installed image on your recovery partition... that&#x27;s not an &quot;OEM&quot; install in the same sense as the XP disks were... that&#x27;s a customized image either made by something like nLite or installed on a generic factory laptop, pre-loaded with garbage, ran sysprep (to genericsize it) and imaged to a file.<p>The recovery image/factory image does not use the license on the bottom of your laptop usually -- it uses a factory volume license key that is pre-activated on the image. However if you try to recover that key with some key extractor, and use it to activate another installation from an official ISO, it will not work -- ie. that license will only activate at the factory. If you use the license from the bottom of your laptop, you need a genuine microsoft iso.<p>So long as you have a Windows 7 Pro license key on the bottom of your laptop, and use a Windows 7 Pro ISO, it will work.. or Home and Home, etc...",1424447878

9080880,comment,9071965,9072634,0,0,RMarcus,,,"That&#x27;s a pretty common feeling, and one that I certainly had as I entered college. What finally changed my mind was four years of gender studies classes.<p>So let me do my best to provide something of an explanation. It isn&#x27;t really a problem that there&#x27;s one tutorial or one website that pokes fun at weight issues or assumes it is serving a primarily male audience. The problem comes when those tropes become universal, or at least fairly wide-spread.<p>Sexual harassment might be a good place to look for examples. A single sexual comment or a single locker-room butt-tap, in most cases, is not that big a deal. But these small acts don&#x27;t happen in isolation! They happen in a context that has <i>structurally disadvantaged</i>[1] entire classes of individuals (predominately women, in this case). And no, these acts are not the only thing that created such a structure, but they work to make individuals in those classes feel uncomfortable, threatened, and generally unsafe. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll often hear such acts called &quot;micro-oppressions.&quot; And they don&#x27;t just make their victims feel bad. They also teach the privileged class that the victims belong to a class that it is OK to denigrate. No, not on their own, not in isolation, but in combination and spread over enough time.<p>As an upper-middle class, cis white male who dates women, I didn&#x27;t really buy this argument until I had a very particular experience. I was at my university&#x27;s gym using a cardio machine, and some very muscular athletes were lifting weights behind me. I had forgotten my earbuds that day, so I could hear what they were saying. Mostly, they talked about women and parties. But eventually, they started talking about how all the &quot;non-athletes&quot; on campus really hurt the aesthetics of the place. &quot;Especially those CS majors with their screen-tans,&quot; I recall one saying. This turned into a myriad of jokes that I felt were absolutely directed at me personally. They commented how &quot;tech types&quot; only show up to the gym to do cardio and always wear &quot;ridiculous T-shirts with company logos on them,&quot; which, at the time, I was. I tried to ignore it, to just have &quot;tough skin,&quot; but as they kept talking it slowly wore me down. I left, took a shower, and headed to the computer lab and had a great conversation about Golang.<p>Now imagine you didn&#x27;t have a computer lab to go to. That no matter where you went, you had to hear those comments and those jokes. Every time you went to work, you&#x27;d hear it from your boss. Every time you turned on the TV, you&#x27;d see it in ads and in sitcoms. On billboards, on the street, in movies, and even in programming language tutorials.<p>Further, imagine that if you were to ever speak up and talked about what was making you uncomfortable, you&#x27;d be told to &quot;grow tougher skin&quot; or &quot;just learn to take a joke&quot;. Personally, I can&#x27;t even imagine what it must be like to live life as one of the classes that America structurally oppresses. But I feel like it must suck. A lot.<p>So what can we do? Well, we start shifting the culture. We start creating safe spaces. We hold people accountable for their comments and jokes while understanding that they didn&#x27;t mean any harm. We educate and explain.<p>But <i></i>most importantly<i></i>, and I cannot stress this enough, we need to <i>listen</i>. We need to <i>listen</i> to people when they tell us that we are doing something that bothers them. We need to understand how our actions transform spaces that we love -- like functional programming -- into hostile areas for so many people. Because honestly, if we don&#x27;t listen, we won&#x27;t know. The author of LYAH isn&#x27;t a bad person. Those athletes weren&#x27;t bad people. No one does this sort of thing intentionally.<p>Yet we have to take responsibility. We have to learn, we have to get better. And the only way to start doing that is to make everyone&#x27;s sensitivities our problem.<p>edit -- \nPerhaps I&#x27;m wrong. I&#x27;m open to that possibility. I&#x27;m the product of a very liberal gender studies education from a university in Arizona, where there were plenty of examples of undeniable xenophobia and homophobia. After all, if the sum of our experiences doesn&#x27;t fully constitute us, it certainly plays a big role.<p>[1] It is very difficult to argue that this isn&#x27;t the case, considering the wealth disparity amongst men and women, especially in the tech industry. If you&#x27;ve got yourself deeply rooted in some sort of MRA thing, then just think about race instead. Wealth disparity between white and black men is pretty wide.",1424447477

9080826,comment,9075542,9075542,0,0,davismwfl,,,"Honestly, my suggestion is to find a reasonably simple use case and to create a quick sketched architecture.<p>For example, draw out an architecture where you take input data (emails or whatever), queue it up, and have workers operate on it outputting analytics concurrently.  It is a fairly common and reasonably simple (at least initially) use case to help you work through the types of issues, like communication drops/lag, caching, queue contention, processing concurrency etc.  From there you can either write up some code to implement it in a simple form or start asking more specific questions on specific forums.  e.g. if you select Rabbit MQ as the queue and have questions around it ask on their forum, if you use Ruby or Node or .NET etc, ask on those forums for specific issues or ideas.<p>My 2 cents is nothing makes you learn how/why better than trying to do it and having success and failures teach you where to go.  And of course, researching and asking questions to avoid repeating preventable issues/mistakes is always smart.  There are a number of reference architectures you can find online as well.  Study them to find the weaknesses and strengths (see what others said too), the more you do that the more you will learn what to look for.<p>EDIT: below<p>I suggest my example or one similar over your initial idea simply to remove some complexity so you learn the concepts first.  As someone else pointed out, once you add in the http component, possibly web sockets etc you are adding another layer of complexity on top of a basic distributed system itself.

I just wanted to add a point on &quot;dangerous&quot;.<p>> (From your linked article) If an important security fix happens in a version that also contains a breaking change for your app — you still need to adjust your app to get the fix, right?<p>Automatically upgrading to the latest minor revision is also a type of security risk.<p>Take the example of the package manager npm, where most modules (via package.json) don&#x27;t mention an exact dependency. They tend to allow minor version upgrades, via semver compatibility notation (<a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver</a>). This is dangerous, since at any point, a module, sub-module (or sub-sub-module..) can release a malicious minor update which has full access to the user&#x27;s data. An attacker breaking into a module author&#x27;s computer simply has to release a minor version upgrade to infect dependency chains en masse.

This usually means I either buy from fewer merchants, or pay with bitcoin if allowed. Obviously, if the merchant is going to require my info anyway then it&#x27;s pointless, so it depends.&quot;<p>This is the entire value of bitcoin in my opinion for the average CC holder in the US.  I simply don&#x27;t trust people with my details.  It seems like I get a new CC every few months because of some data breach, which entails me having to change any subscription services  etc.  Anon transactions may be a big point for some, but you are entirely correct when I will more than likely be providing my address to people who I pay with bitcoin.  However, they won&#x27;t have my CC details.  I think it will be a better &quot;payment buffer&quot; than paypal.  Hopefully cheaper also.",1424444624
