For windows, one must go to a dozen websites, download packages, and click next 10 times in each idiosyncratic install &quot;wizard&quot;.<p>I had a similar experience with my mother, as well – I was constantly having to intervene with tech-support before I installed Ubuntu on her machine.",1424422792
9079601,comment,9075635,9075635,0,0,jokoon,,,"Looks like an advertisement for C/C++.<p>I agree that some language features are nice to have, but you won&#x27;t convince me that C/C++ is bad because it&#x27;s old, or because it&#x27;s too down to earth. In short: you can&#x27;t replace simple tools like a simple hammer and screwdriver. You don&#x27;t always need them, but they&#x27;re not replaceable, so to me I&#x27;ll prefer learning a down to earth language and suffer the right consequences of that. Having to manage memory is the bread and butter of any programmer. I hate going around avoiding gimmicks of new languages and API just because the language pretend that it&#x27;s doing something magically, there&#x27;s always something that will come back and bite you.<p>And for the minecraft argument: minecraft is a huge PITA when it comes to memory and I&#x27;ve seen servers just burn because of memory management. Notch buying large house won&#x27;t convince me to use java or any other managed memory language. The argument &quot;that guy got rich, so it&#x27;s an okay language&quot; is not okay with me...<p>I&#x27;m very conservative when it comes to technology and programming languages.

First, there is an important difference between considering a random event on it&#x27;s own and several random events together: in essence, when your friend says they have a boy, he is telling you a little something about <i>two</i> ordered events.

Somehow that extra information makes you drop a case! I can&#x27;t help but think that the ordering is the critical factor, and that it&#x27;s not a coincidence that the &quot;extra information&quot; has to do with time.

The problem is, the generic install media has basically no drivers on it, so you have to go fetch it all manually, from all the respective manufacturers&#x27; web sites. It is, of course, fairly hard to download your network driver without a network driver, so you&#x27;d better have another computer and some USB storage around. Also, many of the drivers come only in the form of installer bundles that are themselves hundreds of megabytes and full of crapware.<p>In comparison, installing Ubuntu is a breeze, almost all the drivers you need are included with the install media and installed automatically, etc. Unless you have brand new, just-released hardware, it &quot;just works&quot;, and even with brand new hardware there tend to be guides on the internet that are still easier than getting drivers installed on Windows.<p>Actual thing that happened: My mom said she needed to reformat an old laptop but didn&#x27;t have the Windows media and wondered what to do.

Bootup, start doing stuff, and progressively comes a yellow tinge. I call Apple Care, which places a replacement order. To minimise downtime, they send the replacement ASAP and order a return to be completed later. This means you get the new computer <i>before</i> you return the broken one. Nice, especially if you didn&#x27;t use Time Machine (it was all new and shiny) and wanted to do a Mac to Mac transfer via Firewire.<p>The new one arrives, power on, and straight from the boot screen here&#x27;s a yellow tinge, even worse than the first one. Round trip with Apple Care, order a new replacement, arrange pickup, go. Same tinge again, but more subdued, and it <i>seems</i> to be slowly going away, but how to be sure?<p>Not willing to take risks, I call Apple Care again, which orders a new replacement and arranges a pickup. Replacement arrives and now I have <i>three</i> iMacs on my desktop (of which two are due for return). Seriously. And that one, too has a yellow tinge. I call Apple Care again, and this time they say to me that while we could continue with this little game endlessly, that may not be the wisest thing to play what is essentially lottery. So they offer me to get my money back, plus a coupon if I were to order a computer again.<p>Forum searches learned me that there seems to be much less 27&quot; affected than 21&quot;, and with that coupon I could now afford one. So after pondering the situation, I choose to go for it. The thing arrives and hurray, it&#x27;s tinge free!<p>For the record, a few years later, the thing is out of warranty and I receive an email that the hard disk is eligible for a preventive replacement, for free, even if out of warranty.

And the answer is: by a three-person arbitration panel.<p>That is, key aspects of everyday life - the social, environmental and safety protections that have been laid down over decades or more - can be thrown out purely on the say of those three people if it is decided that they clash with TTIP. And remember: &quot;The ruling of the arbitration panel shall be unconditionally accepted by the Parties.&quot;<p>So if, for whatever reason, the arbitration panel says a well-established regulation protecting health and safety, or the environment, has to go, well, it has to go, even if the vast majority of the public that it will effect disagrees.</i>&quot;",1424420077
