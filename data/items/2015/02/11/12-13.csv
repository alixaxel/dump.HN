The extra team developed the &quot;componentized&quot; version where the browser was built from re-usable objects, where Netscape&#x27;s code was still a rambling mess. (This helped Microsoft win the AOL business: it used IE even after it bought Netscape.)<p>The US DoJ&#x27;s Janet Reno was a major factor. She forced Microsoft to sign a Consent Decree (1995?) that prevented Microsoft from tying separate products to Windows but allowed it to provide integrated improvements. The DoJ followed up with an anti-trust suit (on Netscape&#x27;s behalf) over browser tying.<p>Microsoft won the browser case by 2-1 on appeal. However, all this bloodletting may have been a factor in Microsoft putting off the next browser, which eventually appeared in Vista. Which was late, following the Longhorn debacle, which prolonged XP&#x27;s life, which enabled IE6 to get entrenched, which caused web designers so much pain.<p>The world might be a better place if the DoJ hadn&#x27;t interfered, but we&#x27;ll never know....",1423659051

9032516,comment,9028963,9032449,0,0,dietrichepp,,,"No, the ISO setting adjusts the analog gain before conversion to digital.  As you would expect, this raises the noise floor.  It is natural and expected to be able to adjust speed on a digital camera, because the dynamic range of a ADC is limited, and you want to be able to use that range optimally.<p>For example, suppose your camera has a dynamic range of 10 stops.  If you are shooting a scene with a dynamic range of 8 stops, then you get +/-1 stop of latitude where mistakes in exposure can be corrected digitally.  Overexpose, and the signal will sometimes be above the range of the ADC.  Underexpose, and the signal will sometimes be below the range of the ADC.  You can adjust either the exposure (aperture, shutter speed) or the signal gain (ISO) to get the signal into the right range.<p>You do the same exact thing when you&#x27;re recording digital audio: you adjust the gain so that you use most of the range of the DAC.  As in photography, you can try increasing the gain afterwards, but you might get problems with noise.",1423658938

I can choose not to upgrade the entire platform, but that&#x27;s it, unlike in Linux land where I can upgrade piecemeal.<p>You underestimate the customisability of Windows. Its ecosystem is mostly proprietary and closed-source, but that didn&#x27;t stop people from modding what they could - just look at all the &quot;post your desktop&quot; threads that appear in various forums and you&#x27;ll see lots of examples that are barely recognisable as Windows anymore. A lot of these involve little more than copying/replacing a few files, or some registry editing, so it&#x27;s actually not so difficult at all.<p>In fact I&#x27;d say that &quot;upgrade piecemeal&quot; with Linux is made more complex because of all the dependencies that often arise with various apps all wanting very specific versions of libraries, multiple competing standards that do not interoperate (count all the GUI toolkits...), and emphasis on portability that tends to reduce the availability of binaries.<p>Some people go as far as replacing the shell:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_shells_for_Windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_alternative_shells_for_...</a><p>...or even removing/replacing more fundamental components:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_remastering#Microsoft_Windows"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_remastering#Microsoft_...</a><p>As for OS X... I agree there&#x27;s not much customisation going on there, but I&#x27;d attribute that more to the demographic of Apple users.

There are pretty much zero cases where I, in my ops role, can allow production deployments to have access to the official Docker repository, because it opens the door to pulling in all kinds of stuff that has not been vetted (e.g. referencing the &quot;latest&quot; images, and having that change between dev signing something off and deployment), and it creates all kinds of obnoxious failure scenarios.<p>At the same time, I don&#x27;t want devs to have the hassle of having to repackage all the images to point them to our internal registries, when we could easily mirror the images that have been tested.<p>So if there&#x27;s no easy way to point the default somewhere else, what we&#x27;ll resort to instead is increasingly adding firewall rules to block the official registry, coupled with DNS tweaks to make *.docker.io point where we want it, or patching the code.<p>Or switch to Rocket once it gets more mature, if Docker continues to make custom image management more troublesome than necessary.",1423656675

You can <i>also</i> decide to do it this way, if you want to have more explicit error messages.  Or you can simply forgo all this and return errors explicitly.<p>I&#x27;m frankly not sure why you think this is boilerplate, though: what, indeed, is wrong with this picture?  Maybe I&#x27;m simply missing the obvious, but this doesn&#x27;t even seem like that much code to me, especially given that each of your error types would have to be classes in other languages. (BTW, you don&#x27;t need to prefix all the errors with Feed because they are already namespaced).  Once you&#x27;ve written the above, you can simply try! everywhere and get automatic conversions--and you use try! a lot more often than you define new result types.<p>Your example also looks very much like what I would write in a language like Java, where exceptions are actually part of the signature (which is the approach Rust takes).  Perhaps you are talking to the wrong person here, but I have never had an issue with Java&#x27;s approach to checked exceptions, only the many ways the language provides to undermine them and the difficulty of creating new error types without ADTs.<p>In any case, you still haven&#x27;t addressed my remaining questions re: exceptions.  We may disagree on whether the above is boilerplate, but given that exceptions have other problems they are still not a drop-in replacement.  I think if you consider boilerplate to be the biggest issue in error handling, you and I likely fundamentally disagree.",1423656293
9032393,comment,9029301,9031755,0,0,ddoolin,,,"> Drugs are like gambling. They hardly bring any good and potentially bring lots of bad. Do you think it would be good to push opiates on the Chinese, or push MJ on Mexicans and blacks? Would that be justice? While we may agree that punishment is disproportionate, or unjust, ridding society of substances that incapacitate people to varying degrees, is not too bad a thing. Would we rather have an intoxicated population, one less capable of making everyday decisions even-headed?<p>I&#x27;m a regular marijuana smoker with the occasional mushroom and LSD trips and I can say at least the latter is extremely common among my friends and even coworkers! None of us are physically dependent on these drugs and all function completely level-headed in our everyday lives as software engineers, lawyers, analysts, and more. Trust me when I say there is more than &quot;hardly any good.&quot; There is always the potential for bad, with this and just about anything, and acknowledgment of this requires us to educate each other on the proper time, place, reason, and so on surrounding their use.<p>To _push_ those things on _anyone_ would be bad, sure. You should stop to consider that the associations you made with ethnicity and certain drugs is a result of the entire issue at hand! It&#x27;s not simply that the punishment is disproportionate. It&#x27;s that people are being criminalized for doing what others do every day, albeit in a different form that happens to be legal and socially accepted. The type of environment this creates is one where people are not educated on use and the production of these drugs is not supervised and not regulated, which is bad for everybody.",1423656282
