8995225,comment,8994943,8994943,0,0,FroshKiller,,,"I was charged with a felony (unauthorized access of a government computer) back in 2004. I had just graduated from college and was looking for steady work. I faced some pressure from friends and family to plea bargain even though I was innocent simply because they feared I&#x27;d be found guilty at trial by a jury that couldn&#x27;t understand the case. Happily, the DA wised up and dismissed the charges eventually, but it took years and caused me a lot of personal difficulty. It&#x27;s a damn shame on the criminal justice system that innocent people should so fear wrongful conviction that they&#x27;d meet it halfway. I was prepared to fight, but I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone who would choose differently for themselves and their loved ones.",1423022334

If the weight gets misplaced, a simple straight bar can be rolled back up to a more &quot;comfortable&quot; position. A curved (C shaped) bar under load finds an equillibrium point and you can&#x27;t really move it out of that point without deloading.<p>2.) You can take a really wide hand stance for extra balance if needed. Really nice if the weight is uneven.<p>3.) Damage control. There are much worse things than bruising across the shoulders.

I think he is arguing that U3 is not the most useful figure for Americans to hear the most about, from supposedly trustworthy sources.<p>> Here&#x27;s something that many Americans -- including some of the smartest and most educated among us -- don&#x27;t know: The official unemployment rate, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor, is extremely misleading.<p>U3 is not referred to as the &quot;headline rate&quot;, it&#x27;s called &quot;official unemployment&quot;. While it&#x27;s unfortunate that most Americans would not inform their voting--or other decisions--by researching the alternate measurements of unemployment, it is indeed the reality.<p>One would like to assume that when the president or a news organization cite an &quot;official unemployment rate&quot;, they are offering us the best information about what might concern the average citizen. The number of people who have totally given up on finding a job is definitely one such piece of information. This, I think, is Clifton&#x27;s main point.<p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at the amount of coverage alternate measurements get in the media. I&#x27;ve seen several segments that highlight this. It seems to me that the meaning of the &quot;official&quot; definition is becoming more commonly known. I think Clifton would disagree with me here.<p>Although, you might try explaining about U6 to a group of people who don&#x27;t know about it.

This way, the only way prisoners could use a radio would be to communicate with someone standing right outside the prison fence, or with someone in another cell, which is a lot less convenient than the situation right now.

8995145,comment,8991239,8992533,0,0,JohnMunsch,,,"- The answer to why you have to use $timeout, $interval, etc. is simple. If you do it that way then AngularJS knows when you might have made a change in the scope and can look to see if there are updates to be made in the UI or watches to fire. It is a convenience system to avoid you having to tell the system that new data arrived from an earlier call to the web server and that you assigned it to a variable that also happens to appear in multiple spots on the page. React does not &quot;embrace&quot; that issue either. It does not magically know when to update itself on timer events or AJAX responses without some help.<p>P.S. You can absolutely use anything you like other than the provided wrappers. If you do, just call $apply() afterward. That&#x27;s the signal to AngularJS that you changed something that might require it to do updates elsewhere.<p>- In two years of doing AngularJS work as a full time job (plus weekend projects) I have never ended up digging through the source code. Nor have any of the people working for me on my team at work. So the idea that you have to do that is patently false.<p>- I&#x27;m not sure how much is there is to understand about the cycle. It happens whenever events fire which indicate changes might have occurred. Later, when browsers directly support watching variables for change, I&#x27;m guessing there will be no need for it anymore.<p>- Hmm. The templating thing is an interesting way of thinking about it. Yes, it is crippled in one sense because it doesn&#x27;t have the full expressiveness of JavaScript. I can see that. On the other hand it&#x27;s elegant because you don&#x27;t have to drop out of your HTML to do your templating work somewhere else using a completely different syntax or location. I think there are really good arguments to be made on both sides of this argument.<p>- Fascinating. Almost all of my AngularJS code is JavaScript. The portions of the code devoted to keeping AngularJS happy are a very small portion of the total. Based on what I&#x27;ve seen of 2.0 controllers, services, etc. are simply standard JavaScript objects so it seems a hard argument to make that they aren&#x27;t fully embracing JS.<p>- And the final argument is one of my favorites. I&#x27;ve seen it over and over again, &quot;Don&#x27;t use a framework at all! Cobble together your own thing out of best-of-breed pieces to make a system.&quot; That may work well for an individual (though I think it will not) but for a team?!? No way.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-React or anti-Ember, but I am anti-throw something together based on intuition and try to use it to build something real.",1423020070

They need to be attached to some other process in order to derive any value from them. Sometimes it&#x27;s a network, somethings it&#x27;s a factory, sometimes it&#x27;s just process run by humans.<p>In most domains that you attach computers to, it&#x27;s possible for one person to understand both the computer side of it and the other side of it. Web development is like this, you can easily understand both the web and computer systems, as one is really just another version of the other.<p>If you&#x27;re attaching the computer system to another very hard-to-understand system, like, say, a surgical robot, then the person that understands both domains well enough to avoid problems like this is a unicorn, there might well be only one person in the world that&#x27;s built up expertise in both fields.<p>To get around this you need careful, effective management of the two pools of labor, and robust dialogue between the two teams. The second this starts breaking down, is the second you start marching down the road to disaster.<p>In the aforementioned example, everyone would be well-aware of the failure modes. So it&#x27;s a bit easier to manage. In finance, failure modes can be so subtle, particularly as the system grows more complex, that they can escape detection by both teams unless they&#x27;re both checking each other&#x27;s work and keeping each other honest.<p>Institutional knowledge transfer has to constantly be happening, areas of ignorance on both sides have to constantly be appraised and plans undertaken to reduce said ignorance. The more everyone knows about the entire system, the more likely it will be that critical defects like this can be discovered before they strike.<p>This kind of effective interaction of those at the bottom can only be organized and directed at the top.

Certainly Yemen and the US could have cooperated and presented their case in an attempt to obtain the authorization from the Security Council.<p>Oddly the US legal justification is not that their action complies with International Law, rather that International Law does not apply...instead the US&#x27; position is that &quot;a conflict between a transnational non-state actor and a nation, occurring outside that nation&#x27;s territory, is an armed conflict <i>not of an international character</i>.&quot;  However, the US&#x27; legal position is rather short sighted, and just imagine how quickly such a legal paradigm would break down if any foreign nation ever attempted to bomb one of their own citizens residing in the US and then claimed such use of force was not of an international character; therefore, International Law is not applicable.",1423019017

They&#x27;ve done so in the past when automated trading systems went off the rails.  I am glad they didn&#x27;t do so, as such favoritism is completely unfair and sends a terrible message to HFT companies, but it was still surprising.",1423019008

In this day and age, i&#x27;d rather sink some cheap memory and keep the daemon running.<p>If atom has a daemon feature that I never found, or one upcoming, I&#x27;d consider it again. Until then my workflow involves too many client closes for me to <i>not</i> notice the significant delay that atom has when opening a new file.",1423018821
