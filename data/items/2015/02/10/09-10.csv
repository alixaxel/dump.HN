Why does &quot;being a programmer&quot; mean that I should want to hack my desktop environment?

Maybe I <i>hate</i> the whole concept of tiling window managers because I like to have overlapping windows?<p>You are making a lot of assumptions about what other people should want to spend their time on. I don&#x27;t want to waste time or brainpower coding xmonad or dwm to behave in a way that doesn&#x27;t annoy me, and manually setting up a bunch of basic infra like automounting USB keys, when I can just use KDE which doesn&#x27;t annoy me by default.",1423562354

If you want to install e.g. django-rest-framework, you have to install it locally and then manually copy the installed files to Azure (with FTP, if I remember correctly).<p>Secondly, they both run Python on a Windows Server running behind the IIS web server. Besides the fact that you will walk along the road less travelled (Django is overwhelmingly deployed on Linux), there is a very concrete limitation: if you want to install binary packages (e.g. PIL or Pillow), you have to manually compile them for Windows (and of course copy them manually to your Azure server).

MS had a paid developer per unique app program, which was called desparate by some. Comments here state that license to develop for the WP is a $100??? Jeez, I wonder what their growth team is thinking.<p>Developers are highly sought after, experimenting is fun, but a lot of people are looking for stable jobs either from the beginning or they want to try a start up / own their own business first. This is also a common problem with trying new programming languages, why choose a new one when established languages have large user base, jobs are plentiful, and not much worry it&#x27;s going to be abandoned 2 years down the line?<p>There has to be incentives to overcome these barriers to gain large spread adoption. At the end of the day a lot of it comes down to livelyhood. Will a person risk time devoting on something new? If a person starts a company on this new OS, will other developers take that risk to join? Will the clients/customers be willing to make that switch?",1423561986

Shame on us.&quot;<p>Currently death is inevitable and a law of nature. Perhaps technology will change this in the future. As it is, it&#x27;s one of the those things one must accept and come to terms with.<p>Perhaps you are a bit too depressed about aging. There are documented cases of peoples in their 70:s being quite keen and healthy.<p>I think one the keys here is exercise. People who do daily walks are much more healthy than people who don&#x27;t. If one is in their 70:s and has been sedentary for most of his life and the other one has kept even a routine of daily walks, the other one has decades of exercise behind him.<p>There has been studies that moderate exercise helps to revert supposedly age related cognitive discrepancies. Sorry, can&#x27;t find the reference right now.<p>My belief (anecdotal and completely unfound) is that people who live healthy lives are much more healthier when old. Thus part of the incapacity attached to old age is not biological predestination but also affected through the current and past lifestyle of the old person.<p>Sure, one CAN be in a really bad shape in their 70:s. Just sit decades on a sofa watching TV. Or perform work that is physically exhausting.<p>I think you are overthinking and fearing too much a thing you do not know thoroughly. That you refer to a scientific paper is an indication of trying to rationally cope with this. However, there is one problem - Most bleeding edge scientific studies are flawed and incorrect. I would not consult a single paper to form an opinion on anything. I would consult a gerontologist.

It&#x27;s the main reason why there&#x27;s no proper answer to &quot;what&#x27;s the meaning of life&quot; - whatever you do during your 50/70/120/.. years of life you&#x27;ll eventually end up just as dead as the guy right next to you. Congratulations!<p>Being immortal would allow us to get rid of crutches like religion and allow us to implement proper moral systems, since there would be tangible rewards to being &quot;good&quot; simply for &quot;goodness&#x27; sake&quot;, since being good and being selfish would be identical - if you&#x27;ll (eventually but reiably) suffer overpoputlation, pollution and even unemployment just as much as the next guy, you&#x27;ll (eventually but, again, reiably) think twice about elbow tactics.<p>> Oh yeah, I really doubt this - I know a lot of older people and most of them would not want this trade in.<p>20?

The results were rather mixed with the shorter life being more popular choice.<p>And, by the end of the day, a chance at higher-quality life in exchange for possibly less total life is also why things like armed robberies exist (even if not every robber things of it like that beforehand). I&#x27;d also argue the same is true of people opting for high-risk jobs, but there&#x27;s also a sense-of-duty aspect to them, so it&#x27;s not quite as clear-cut there.",1423561757

9026191,comment,9025248,9025952,0,0,dqdo,,,"So I by no means am talking about following the Southwest model religiously. There is always a tradeoff between over using a tool and having too many different tools in place. Ultimately you have to choose the right tool for the job. But more often than not, people tend to choose the trendy tools because they sound cool. Leave the experimentation to side projects where there is less risk involved and the codebase does not need to be maintained for years.<p>My general philosophy about software development is to keep things as clean and simple as possible -- and no simpler because then you wouldn&#x27;t be solving the problem in the first place. So I am not suggestion that you over use (for example Jquery) to do everything in the web. What I am suggesting is to think about building software the same way that we build houses. You want to choose carefully the tools that will stand the test of time and not just the fad language or tools. For this I usually check out the community behind the software.<p>When I architect a software solution one of the parameters that I think about is how long will it take to get someone totally new to my technology stack up and running (and hopefully productive). Most people don&#x27;t think about this deliberately and so a project might have legacy code that takes months for a new person to come to grip with. Imagine trying to recruit for this type of role. My general rule of thumb is to have the choice of tools/modules as standard as possible and aim for a 2 week preparation period for anyone to get acquainted with the code. For this reason when I use ExpressJS I stick with EJS rather than Jade. I still use CSS rather than Less or Sass (these are my personal opinion).<p>I also take this philosophy a step further by creating certain software patterns and try as many of the well tested patterns as possible. Thing brings consistency to the codebase.",1423561461

I&#x27;ve dealt with some bugs since switching to the developer preview, but that&#x27;s to be expected, and my experience running production code was always rock solid.<p>But the app situation is abominable, and getting worse. The Xbox program seems to have been all but abandoned. Microsoft seems to have largely given up even monitoring the app store; half the top/new games on the lists for the last several months have been blatantly pirated material, either blatant copies of whatever iOS/Android fad is running at the moment, or actual emulator ROMs of old console games running in a buggy, half-broken wrapper. They don&#x27;t even have an actual category for reporting copyright infringement on the report form.<p>They&#x27;ve also made some missteps on a fair few occasions regarding their own apps, especially with the move to 8.1; replacing or breaking the existing functionality like the Xbox Games portal and the Music app.<p>On the technical side, there&#x27;s also some issues regarding app support and limitations on both hardware and software. Manufacturers have to agree to very strict tech specifications in order to license WP, so very few other than Nokia have ever bothered to take them up on it. WP apps are heavily sandboxed and limited in a way reminiscent of pre-multitasking iOS, and the official line from MS seems to be that the only acceptable way to build WP apps is in C# with .NET on Visual Studio. Period. Very grudgingly, HTML5 apps are supported. Other options are possible, but largely only through workarounds, which often are grossly undocumented or hacky. Even MS&#x27; own other languages, like VB.net and F# are not officially supported, save as libraries in the latter case. (though again in the latter case, MS seems to not believe anyone should want to build full apps in pure F# <i>at all</i>.)<p>The OS and the interface themselves are great, and some of those limitations are no doubt part of why by forcing a more predictable environment. But a lot of it just seems to be MS repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot, and I dread to think how much worse it would get if MS had any actual leverage on the market.",1423560410

An element like x, would be interpreted as a morphism x : I -> A  (in general the objects A in a monoidal category, or any category for that matter have no notion of elements). The expression f(x) is interpreted as the composition f . x, so no you are not free to use x a second time, once you formed that composition. This is swept under the rug in most cases because monoidal categories like Set are <i>cartesian</i> and allow you to freely copy morphisms like x : I -> A, via the Delta map  Delta : A -> A * A. Explicitly you have Delta(x) = Delta . x = x * x. In general it might not be possible to even determine if two morphisms x : I -> A and y : I -> A are the same.<p>In some cases you might be able to assume from the start that you have a certain number of equal morphisms x : I -> A &quot;in reserve&quot;, for example in linear logic you have the operator ! (&quot;of course&quot;) which gives you an arbitrary number of identical morphisms to play with.<p>In any case this distinction is quite subtle and I understand, why you might assume that I&#x27;m simply misunderstanding things. In particular I should emphasize that almost no programming languages work this way, although with some effort you would be able to recast typical cryptographic / numerical code in this language.<p>It is also really easy that to see for example in the case of addition that indeed information is destroyed, clearly the map<p>(a,b) -> (a+b,a-b)<p>has an inverse if the characteristic isn&#x27;t 2, the subsequent projection to the first factor destroys information. Categories in which that is possible have maps d_A : A -> I.<p>What tel is pointing out above, is that Delta and d together form a comonoid.<p>While psi \otimes psi certainly makes sense, the map psi \to psi \otimes psi is not linear and therefore not a morphism (Physicists call this the no cloning theorem for some reason).",1423559643
