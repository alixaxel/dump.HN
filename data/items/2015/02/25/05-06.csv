9105500,comment,9104818,9104818,0,0,brooksbp,,,"I&#x27;ve had 9 on-sites in the past 4 months at both large companies and start-ups. A few reflections:<p>- Sometimes, a &quot;No&quot; means &quot;we like your career trajectory; we&#x27;ve identified you as a candidate that we want to follow up with in ~6 months&quot;.<p>- Sometimes, a &quot;No&quot; means &quot;we really like you; we think you&#x27;d be a fit here, we&#x27;ll be constructing this team in ~6 months&quot;.<p>- Sometimes, a &quot;No&quot; means &quot;we wont relocate; we wont fly you out here; we&#x27;re only considering local (e.g. Bay Area) candidates&quot;.<p>- Sometimes, a &quot;No&quot; means that it&#x27;s up to you to reflect on the situation.  Take as many notes as you can during the process.  Analyze what you said, wrote, acted, etc.  It&#x27;s up to you to determine how you could be better.<p>- When you get to the on-site and have the opportunity to learn a lot more, things might not be all ponies and rainbows like you&#x27;d imagine. Be open to what you didn&#x27;t want to see, hear, or learn about. You might learn that you actually don&#x27;t want to work here.<p>- You&#x27;re racing against the clock. Balance is key. You hear advice about asking clarification questions, discussing trade-offs, etc. but at the end of the hour one of the most important things is the code you put up on that board.  The interviewer will likely whip out their phone, take a pic, and that&#x27;s that.<p>- Coding on a whiteboard, with a stranger, in an unfamiliar environment, after traveling many miles... is... challenging. Without much practice, you&#x27;re at risk to fall flat on your face--I&#x27;ve face-planted my fair share, and it&#x27;s always fuel to get back at it again.<p>- Interview as much as you possibly can. You learn about companies, people, technology, industry, challenges, etc. Practice, practice, practice.<p>- Sometimes, recruiters reach out to you for an initial call (you&#x27;re excited), and then you learn that members of the hiring team haven&#x27;t even seen your resume (orly? u think i haz de skillz dear rekrooter?). You then never hear back from the recruiter, or receive an email stating that they&#x27;re not moving forward.  I&#x27;ve only had a couple of these, but it&#x27;s enough for me to strongly dislike contact before any member of the hiring team has reviewed my qualifications.",1424843912

It calculated stress on the shuttles frame based on winds aloft data collected by balloon on launch day.<p>The code passed in a jump parameter and the assembly jumped back to the appropriate fortran label.  Over the years, all the exits except one had been coded out.  I asked my boss if we could just make the fortran code jump directly from point A to point B since that&#x27;s all the assembly did.  He answered my 6 months contract would be done before the change made it through committee.<p>The thing about process is people rarely lessen or remove it once it&#x27;s in place.  But it&#x27;s possible to do a classic waterfall project on time and on budget, look at any bank release of ATM software.  Of course losing an orbiter or losing a plane isn&#x27;t the same class of problem as losing a transaction, but it is possible to do the projects properly.<p>The fact the Obama administration had to bring in outside help to rescue their most recent major rollout (Obamacare insurance info websites) tells you there&#x27;s no incentive to get it right or on time in these contracts.

The rest is a summary of the public feedback and the reasoning for Wheeler&#x27;s decisions. [1]<p>I think 8 pages counts as much shorter than 332.<p>> Once new FCC powers are in place, do you actually think we have a chance at getting rid of them? History says no.<p>There are no new powers. The FCC has always had the power to decide if ISPs should be regulated under Title I or Title II. Hence, the current FCC deciding to regulate under Title II with forbearance does not make it easier for a future FCC to regulate under Title II without forbearance.<p>> There is a reason the FCC doesn&#x27;t want the public to go through the proposal..and it is most likely not good.<p>They will go public with the proposal, as soon as they HAVE a proposal. Right now, the FCC does not have a proposal. Tom Wheeler has a proposal. It doesn&#x27;t become the FCC&#x27;s proposal until the full Commission votes.<p>Then it gets published, and we have at least 30 days to comment. If 30 days is not enough, it can be extended. That&#x27;s what happened last year, when Wheeler&#x27;s first proposal (which didn&#x27;t use Title II) was passed by the Commission and made public. They received so many comments they greatly extended the comment period.<p>After the comment period is when the FCC makes the decision to accept the proposal as law or not. Last year, the did not, and went back to the drawing board to come up with something that addressed the concerns of the overwhelming majority of the commenters.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/republican-fcc-commissioner-public-is-being-misled-about-net-neutrality-plan-20150210"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/republican-fcc-commissio...</a>",1424843730

9105492,comment,9100107,9100107,0,0,Animats,,,"Nice.  As usual, entry and exit conditions aren&#x27;t that hard to write; it&#x27;s loop invariants that are hard.<p><pre><code>  /*@ loop_invariant\n    @  (\forall int i; 0<=i && i<stackSize-4; \n    @             runLen[i] > runLen[i+1] + runLen[i+2])\n    @  && runLen[stackSize-4] > runLen[stackSize-3])\n    @*/\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s surprising how close their notation is to our Pascal-F verifier from 30 years ago.[1]  Formal verification went away in the 1980s because of the dominance of C, where the language doesn&#x27;t know how big anything is.  There were also a lot of diversions into exotic logic systems (I used to refer to this as the &quot;logic of the month club&quot;). The Key system is back to plain old first-order predicate calculus, which is where program verification started in the 1970s.<p>For the invariant, you have to prove three theorems: 1) that the invariant is true the first time the loop is executed, given the entry conditions, 2) that the invariant is true for each iteration after the first if it was true on the previous iteration, and 3) that the exit condition is true given that the invariant is true on the last iteration.  You also have to prove loop termination, which you do by showing that a nonnegative integer gets smaller on each iteration.  (That, by the way, is how the halting problem is dealt with in practice.) #2 is usually the hardest, because it requires an inductive proof.  The others can usually be handled by a simple prover. There&#x27;s a complete decision procedure by Oppen and Nelson for theorems which contain only integer (really rational) addition, subtraction, multiplication by constants, inequalities, subscripts, and structures.  For those, you&#x27;re guaranteed a proof or a counterexample. But when you have an internal quantifier (the &quot;forall int i&quot;) above, proof gets harder.  Provers are better now, though.<p>A big practical problem with verification systems is that they usually require a lot of annotation.\nSomebody has to write all those entry and exit conditions, and it&#x27;s usually not the original programmer. A practical system has to automate as much of that as possible.  In the example shown, someone had to tell the system that a function was &quot;pure&quot; (no side effects, no inputs other than the function arguments).  That could be detected automatically.  The tools have to make the process much, much easier.  Most verification is done by people into theory, not shipping products.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.animats.com/papers/verifier/verifiermanual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.animats.com/papers/verifier/verifiermanual.pdf</a>",1424843637

It reminds me of the Bauhaus style of Nomos and later on Stowa, both held in extremely high regard by the watch community.<p>$450 is high for a smartwatch, but low for a watch in general. Nomos watches cost thousands. Granted, that&#x27;s in large part to their in-house mechanical movements. But $450 is certainly not unreasonable for a high quality quartz watch -- see Seiko and Citizen. And this has the aesthetics to compete with the best of them in my humble opinion.<p>I have a Moto 360 and I stopped wearing it a bit over a month in. The extra features it has aren&#x27;t very useful to be completely honest, and it&#x27;s a bit bulky, having to charge it daily was really a drain, and it just felt flat-out fragile.

You don&#x27;t just look it up.  That&#x27;s not how the law works.  There is a whole host of federal and state minimum wage legislation as well as precedent case law that would come into play.  You cannot point to an &quot;exact part&quot; that requires &quot;active Founders&quot; (a term that the law doesn&#x27;t recognise) to be paid minimum wage.  Dig through [1], [2] and do a precedent search on LexisNexis or Findlaw if you&#x27;re really interested.<p>Look, paying minimum wage is a legal requirement in the US.  There is a small set of exemptions that allow companies to pay below minimum wage.  The executive exemption [3] is one such exemption.  These exemptions usually come with tests that you have to satisfy in order to qualify for the exemption.  For example, according to the DOL [3] there are 4 tests, ALL of which must be satisfied to qualify for the executive exemption:<p>1) salary based comp > $455/week\n2) primary duty is management \n3) directing work of >2 FTEs\n4) hiring/firing authority<p>An &quot;active founder&quot; in your situation who is not responsible >2 FTE would fail this test & therefore fail this exemption.  There are probably other exemptions you could look to use instead.  Your founders might or might not qualify for those as well, depending on your exact situation.  Not paying her/him might or might not therefore be illegal.<p>The main problem is that you&#x27;re completely missing the point.<p>Firstly Carolynn&#x27;s advice is largely talking to startups that are YC-funded (& beyond).  Secondly her advice is a reflection of the consequences & the risks involved, not some legal sub-clause.  Do you want to risk falling foul of state & federal minimum wage law?  Do you want to fall foul of payroll taxes?  The answer is no.  You do not.  In the event you and your founder fall out (as Carolynn goes on to discuss) your life will be so much worse.  Delinquent employers, minimum wage abusers do not fare well in a judge & jury court let alone the court of public opinion.<p>This is a complete non-topic.  You are focused on a technicality & some overblown/imagined idealogical conflict, when instead you should just take Carolynn&#x27;s very good advice and pay yourselves minimum wage if you can.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_Stat...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/history/flsa1938.htm</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/fairpay/fs17b_executive.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/fairpay/fs17b_executi...</a><p>Again IANAL.",1424841599

There will be an update tomorrow, which will automatically update all 57,568 users of these specific PrivDog versions.&quot;<p>PrivDog - a tool designed to block ads and replace them with ones from &quot;trusted sources&quot; - joins a growing list of software affected by related security flaws.<p>Experts say they have uncovered a further dozen examples since Superfish was brought to the public&#x27;s attention last week.<p>Superfish was designed to help users find products by visually analysing images on the web to find the cheapest ones.<p>But it compromises security by intercepting connections and issuing fake certificates - the ID&#x27;s used to identify websites - to trick sites into handing over data. This a practice commonly known as a man-in-the-middle attack.<p>Lenovo has since issued a tool to allow users to remove the hidden software. It now faces legal action from a group of users who say that it acted unlawfully in pre-loading it.<p>Shocking\nPrivDog, has been described by several experts as being &quot;worse than Superfish&quot;.<p>A particular concern is its links to the security firm Comodo, which issues a third of the secure certificates used on the web.<p>PrivDog was developed by the founder of Comodo, Melih Abdulhayogulu, and some versions of it are packaged with Comodo&#x27;s own software.<p>But Comodo told the BBC that the affected versions &quot;had never been distributed&quot; by it.<p>A discussion begun on the Hacker News forum first uncovered that in the process of swapping adverts, PrivDog also appeared to leave machines vulnerable to attack.<p>In a blogpost freelance technology journalist Hanno Boeck explained: &quot;A quick analysis shows that it doesn&#x27;t have the same flaw as Superfish, but it has another one which arguably is even bigger.&quot;<p>&quot;PrivDog is in every sense as malicious as Superfish,&quot; added Simon Crosby, co-founder of security firm Bromium.<p>&quot;It intercepts and decrypts supposedly secure communication between the browser and a remote site - such as the user&#x27;s bank - ostensibly to insert its own advertising into pages in the browser.<p>&quot;It is substantially more scary, though, because PrivDog effectively turns your browser into one that just accepts every https certificate out there without checking its validity, increasing vulnerability to phishing attacks, for example.&quot;<p>User privacy\nLast week Comodo announced that it had become the number one digital certificate authority in the world, with its products used by nearly 35% of all websites ending in .com.<p>&quot;They are one of the leading certificate authorities, and the fact that PrivDog is issuing fake certificates is shocking,&quot; said Marc Rogers, principal researcher at security firm CloudFlare.<p>In a blogpost written at the beginning of 2014, Mr Abdulhayogulu said that he had developed PrivDog &quot;with the privacy of the user in mind&quot;.<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it great that the company whose DNA is about your security makes more money so that they can continue to innovate and invest in products that make you safer,&quot; he wrote at the time.<p>Parental controls\nSecurity experts have identified a growing list of software that appears to interfere with SSL.<p>Most of the products were developed by security firms, said Mr Rogers.<p>They include anti-malware software and tools designed to offer parents more control over their children&#x27;s web browsing.<p>All can be traced back to Komodia - technology developed by an Israeli firm, which describes itself as a &quot;SSL hijacker&quot;.<p>At the time of writing, Komodia&#x27;s website was offline.

However, recovery and maintenance of water and sodium balance with oral or intravenous salt solutions is the proven effective strategy for resolving and averting exercise-associated muscle cramps that are prompted by extensive sweating and a sodium deficit. [1]<p>So whilst there might be a multitude of causes of EAMCs, there seems to be a singular treatment for it. The main hypothesised causes are dehydration, electrolyte depletion or altered neuromuscular control - which is likely caused by electrolyte imbalances.<p>The article authors claim &quot;Science: There is no scientific evidence that shows sodium (or other electrolyte) deficits in those with muscle cramping.&quot; is patently false. There is evidence that sodium deficits increase EAMCs, but so does dehydration (meaning increased serum sodium concentrations), and the main risk indicator is over-exertion.<p>Yes there&#x27;s contradictory evidence. However, if you did a generalized study trying to find out why hydraulic pistons seize you would find that there&#x27;s contradictory evidence because too much and too little hydraulic fluid can seize it, and overworking it can too.

My mother looked at me funny when I tried to explain GPG to her after the Snowden revelations started. But ever since I installed Signal on my mother&#x27;s iPhone, I have been able to have private phone conversations <i>with my mother.</i> The significance of these types of distinctions between gpg and Signal are hard to underestimate when you extrapolate them to a societal level. My partner uses TextSecure/RedPhone with ease, and most of my friends use WhatsApp. I&#x27;ve only been able to convert a few of my non-technical friends, in contrast, into gpg users. Another way to think about this in terms of strategy: the means actually <i>are</i> the ends.<p>Almost as important as his crypto expertise, moxie&#x27;s deep understanding of UX and especially barriers to entry and the network effect have concretely made the world a better place, and not just for people like us...but also (and especially) for people like my mom, my partner, and my (mostly non-programmer) friends. Thank you for understanding that <i>their</i> privacy is important and that <i>their</i> human dignity matters--and especially for meeting them where they are.<p>As a result, now it&#x27;s not just my colleagues &quot;in tech&quot;--but also essentially all of my friends and family--who are with you!",1424840739

The book&#x27;s central thesis is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: &quot;System 1&quot; is fast, instinctive and emotional; &quot;System 2&quot; is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking, starting with Kahneman&#x27;s own research on loss aversion. From framing choices to substitution, the book highlights several decades of academic research to suggest that people place too much confidence in human judgment.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow</a>",1424840710

There is no substitute for volume. You&#x27;re paid to be heard. You <i>will</i> use the full capabilities of your instrument. And deep down we&#x27;re not all that different from rockers. Loud is fun.<p>Now, other qualities matter too, of course. For a fine violin, I would say that volume is not the point, but the starting point. On top of that, you also need to have good tone quality and whatever else. And the volume that you can achieve in a musical fashion depends on your physical approach to the instrument, along with your bow. I own two bows, and one is noticeably louder than the other.<p>The historical evolution of instruments has involved a steady increase in volume, not just within families such as the violin, but in the size of ensembles and the choice of instrumentation.",1424840621
