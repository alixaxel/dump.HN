9008317,comment,9003279,9005805,0,0,Houshalter,,,">The notion of &quot;local optima&quot; for biological species is ill conceived. The world is complex and extremely dynamic; &quot;local optima&quot; isn&#x27;t a very meaningful concept in the context of evolution.<p>Changing environments can help organisms break out of local optima, but that doesn&#x27;t imply they don&#x27;t exist. There are countless examples of organisms getting stuck in local optima. E.g. horseshoe crabs haven&#x27;t changed in hundreds of millions of years.<p>Most traits in general are stuck in local optima. Theoretically large changes could improve them, but it&#x27;s unlikely to happen by random chance.<p>>&quot;Most mutations are harmful&quot; -> this is patently false. A lot of mutations are inconsequential, some are harmful, some are beneficial.<p>Who are you quoting? I never said that. I said most <i>non-neutral</i> mutations are harmful. Neutral mutations don&#x27;t do anything and so don&#x27;t matter.<p>>Mutation rate is variable over species and over time.<p>>DNA duplication is a complex biological process with many moving parts. There isn&#x27;t such a straightforward thing as a &quot;gene that decreases mutation&quot;<p>There are many mechanisms that control mutations, like DNA repair and copying mechanisms, or shielding from radiation and mutagens, etc. Of course it&#x27;s probably very difficult to reach perfection, which is why organisms still evolve. I just said theoretically, evolution is always pushing towards less evolution.",1423216639

9008257,comment,9007996,9007996,0,0,boyaka,,,"There was a post on HN just today by an anonymous guy for his book &#x27;Hacking Sex&#x27; [1]. I actually went ahead and checked it out, since it had a lot of positive comments from women on Amazon. I was intrigued that the author stated that luck with women has nothing to do with genetics, but my surprise/interest diminished when I skipped through the pages and found all sorts of sections on buying clothes and being in good shape. I was really turned off when he gave advice about actually making love, really starting to think this guy is full of himself. I&#x27;m a little bit disgusted by his attitude about needing to have sex with as many women as possible, but I also understand how it could be beneficial. I&#x27;m sure that his advice does indeed vibe with what women desire, and it would probably do me some good to be open to it (when I have the time/money to do so).<p>More on my opinion and less on this book (which as I said I have only skimmed for now so can&#x27;t really judge), I believe in the LAMPS theory: girls tend to be interested in Looks, Athleticism, Money, Power, and Status. I think you can gain a lot of the last 3 just by working hard on improving your own life. That book says you can be yourself and that girls will like you even more for that, but maybe that&#x27;s just signaling Power/Status, or maybe LAMPS is just not a good theory. Ultimately though, in today&#x27;s society you really just need to look good/healthy, have a fulfilling well paid occupation, and give the ladies (or other people) exactly what THEY want; you can&#x27;t be selfish. It&#x27;s not about YOU becoming less lonely, it&#x27;s about being interesting to other people.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9005096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9005096</a>",1423215262

Machines in the sub .0001 precision class are so sensitive to being moved around that it can take weeks of careful calibration to get them to operate within spec. That &#x27;gps-lockdown&#x27; is to make sure the machine doesn&#x27;t get moved around just for the heck of it taking it out of spec and then having the manufacturer turn up after a bunch of complaining.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that that isn&#x27;t being abused in this particular case but there actually can be good reasons for this. Ostensibly another reason is that some guy in Iran could set up a shop in the US as a front, buy a bunch of these machines and then ship them to evade an embargo so that&#x27;s why they are locked to location.<p>In the case of high precision milling machines sometimes they have the machine make it&#x27;s own calibrated clamp down area to compensate for any deformation suffered during a move. With lathes the situation is even more complex.<p>The calibration gear costs a multiple of what the machine itself costs, usually works on the laser-interferometry principle and is removed off-site after the initial calibration (it takes a totally different set of knowledge to operate than the knowledge required to operate the machine).

I didn&#x27;t click with people, and it always felt like too much effort to socialize.  Then I moved to the Bay Area and my life changed over the course of two months.  I finally met people with interests and goals I could relate to.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, if I were doing it again now, I&#x27;d move to a great city and exploit things like Meetup.com, get out, and take up every class and activity that so much as caught my eye.<p>Remember:  to be interesting, you have to be interested.",1423213874

9008206,comment,9007996,9007996,0,0,bsdpython,,,"As you get into your late 20s and early 30s most people are looking to get married if they haven&#x27;t already. At that point social life is going to mostly turn into family, wife, kids and work related friends. I&#x27;m 32 and recently married and I find it very hard to justify spending much of my time socializing outside of those above contexts. It&#x27;s often nothing personal and from my own perspective I would actually like to have more friends but after going through a lot of friends over the years it&#x27;s proven to be rarely worth the long term investment. I&#x27;m not going to chase down others to get together and they likewise. There probably isn&#x27;t a whole lot wrong with you and judging by the desperation at which people try to gain attention on social networks it seems like far more people are lonely then they openly admit - in other words you aren&#x27;t alone. If you really want to give it a go to gain more friends I would suggest looking for social groups with shared interests, such as recreational sports teams, programming meetups, or whatever you personally like. Attend events that you have interests in, travel by yourself (I used to all the time in my early 20s) and in general just try to make yourself a bit more interesting. Learn to pick up on social cues better, focus on listening rather than talking and go out of your way to help people that you aren&#x27;t even that close with in simple ways. Online dating is also a good way to meet new people and practice social skills without much risk (you can cut off contact at any point).",1423213797

You need to deconstruct yourself and your life. Your personality, your habits, where you live and how you live. What you want out of life.<p>Consider NLP, consider getting involved in things that you find uncomfortable (e.g. amateur dramatics). Join meetup.com and locate groups in your area doing stuff and pop along. Talking to people is hard.<p>Smarten yourself up. Make yourself look great ALWAYS. Change the way you get to work. Consider cycling/walking. Exercise. Run a half marathon. Follow a passion. Get into local campaigning. Be involved in society. Join a debating society. Avoid MMORPGs as a social outlet ;)<p>Love yourself (but not in an arrogant way).<p>AND when you are ready, do something crazy.<p>You&#x27;re almost 30. It&#x27;s time you circumvented the world by train and boat. Consider backpacking around India. Go climb a mountain. Tour across America on a bicycle.<p>You&#x27;re single. You have no dependents. You can go anywhere and be anyone. Telecommute from Vietnam.<p>I would say your statement about going to clubs indicates a way of thinking about getting &#x27;hooked up&#x27; that probably does not suit you.<p>Also hanging out with work colleagues is not good. Going for a drink is fine. People have their own social lives and doing drunk stuff in front of work colleagues can be a very bad thing. People connect with people at work because of the interests they have outside of work, not because they share the same workplace.<p>Maybe suggest moving into a house with a group of people.<p>I would also say that from the way you state people don&#x27;t talk to you is that you have a personality trait some people find uncomfortable.",1423213613

Will a sales rep contact me?<p>+ Listing partners and &quot;featured in&quot; makes you feel more important. But is Oracle really your partner somehow?

The brief summary right under it should be bigger than the standard-sized text in benefits descriptions, etc.<p>- &quot;Learn more&quot; link is below the fold on my 15&quot; laptop screen, and the page looks quite complete without it. Some people might not get the idea to scroll down depending on your audience.<p>- Instead of &quot;Submit&quot; and &quot;Send&quot; buttons, use descriptive labels like &quot;Request invite&quot; (bonus points: A/B test a few variations)<p>- Benefits are impossible to skim. The sections should be titled in a useful way, e.g. &quot;Deep Analytics&quot;, &quot;Low, predictable cost&quot; etc.<p>- I&#x27;ve just noticed you have a dedicated &quot;features&quot; page with more content. And &quot;prices&quot; and some other stuff. But they&#x27;re buried in the footer in tiny gray text. No one will see them. Also – they open in a new tab? Boo...

I&#x27;m not sure because there are no screenshots, not even a teaser. That alone would be a dealbreaker for me personally, and I feel that unless you&#x27;re selling something for $1000/month and do high-touch sales, you do need to at least show me your product, let alone let me register for it without invites or contacting sales.<p>- Please, please don&#x27;t use puzzle (or humanoid) clip art.

I&#x27;m not saying any of these apply to you specifically as obviously I don&#x27;t know, but the basics would include proper hygiene, good breath/dental care, dress in neat, clean clothes, etc.<p>Finally, you also might want to try reading some books on the subject of interpersonal skills.
