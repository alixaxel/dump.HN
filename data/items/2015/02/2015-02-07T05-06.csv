Specifically, the v8 team moved from what I would term, 2nd Generation VM Primitives to 3rd Generation VM Primitives, including 2nd Gen Isolates, GC changes, UTF8/ASCII changes, and other siginificant API changes, in December 2013).  Details can be found here [0] in the v8 team&#x27;s &quot;Design Doc Tracker&quot;.  Up until late 0.11.x series, nodejs was based on v8 3.14.x, whose last commit by the v8 team was in May 2013, nearly two years ago.  Needless to say, there were many changes/optimizations it was lacking.  And even if they were to base nodejs on the latest 3.28.x (3.28.73), its last commit was August 2014, 6 months old.  It seems odd to me, that they made the effort to get to 3.28.x but didn&#x27;t go past 3.29.x because of the i18n changes v8 introduced.  It&#x27;s really easy to exclude that stuff if you don&#x27;t want to deal with it.  Bonehead move in my opinion.<p>[0] <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8JFi8T_oAE_7uAri7Njtig7fKaPDfotU6huOa1alds/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8JFi8T_oAE_7uAri7Njtig7...</a>",1423286310

I think they found product-market fit and subsequently decided that they didn&#x27;t like that market.<p>As a flash deals site, they were generating substantial revenue. With some operational rigor, this could have been turned into a sustainable and growable business which was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>Unfortunately, it seems like both the founders and investors weren&#x27;t satisfied with the market they had found a fit for: they wanted to instead build a product which fit a truly mass market. If they were successful in that, it would have been a billion dollar business, but they weren&#x27;t.<p>Lesson learned: once you find product-market fit, be very careful about changing your product to reach a bigger market.",1423286289
9013160,comment,9009379,9012574,0,0,Meekro,,,"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a misconception that workers get paid what they are worth. In a capitalist system, something is only &quot;worth&quot; as much as someone is willing to pay for it. Few people question this notion when we&#x27;re talking about the price of gold or stock market shares, but it&#x27;s true of labor as well.<p>From what I understand, Marx&#x27;s definition of exploitation involves companies paying some workers less than what the fruits of their labor are worth. For example, McDonalds might pay an employee $9 an hour while getting $12 an hour in revenue from that employee&#x27;s work. But, it sounds to me like your coop would be guilty of the same thing.<p>To take an extreme example, suppose your coop includes a janitor and a heart surgeon. Both used to work as independent contractors and bill for their time to whoever needed work done, and now your coop sends the bills and takes in the money. Before joining your coop, the janitor was making $8.50 an hour and the surgeon, $500 an hour.  The coop now pulls in $508.50 an hour and gets to decide how to distribute it. I gather from your comments that you find income inequality and starvation wages to be undesirable things. Therefore, you equalize things somewhat and give the janitor $20 an hour and the surgeon $488.50.<p>Now, haven&#x27;t you committed the same sin as the exploitative companies, namely paying an individual less than the fruits of their labor have produced?",1423286282

Buy a nice house in a new neighborhood and just wait to see what pops up nearby! It could be anything, like a drill pipe manufacturing plant! But if you don&#x27;t like your neighborhood, just wait for the next dip in oil prices, you&#x27;ll have all new neighbors when the price goes back up and people buy up the foreclosed homes in your neighborhood and turn them into rental homes.
