Yes, I am biased toward determinism in this case. But that&#x27;s largely because of the methodology used by proponents of indeterminism (I don&#x27;t believe their conclusion necessarily follows from their data. In fact, I think it&#x27;s an entirely unnecessary conclusion). Determinism is my default, unless a more convincing argument prevents itself.<p>That being said, if indeterminism is true, I&#x27;m fine with that - so long as &quot;superposition&quot; doesn&#x27;t include mutually exclusive states. If the theory can avoid logical contradiction, then it&#x27;s possible.<p>2. I&#x27;m fine with the MWI. However, I think it&#x27;s unnecessary and have difficulty getting around Occam&#x27;s razor in this situation. If the choice is between a) believing a practically-infinite set of real-universes exist (all requiring explanations) or b) remain skeptical for a more compelling theory preserving the simplicity of one universe, I&#x27;ll take the latter. (Given enough time, the highest levels of abstraction about reality seem to be universally simple, so I&#x27;ll hold out a bit longer)<p>3. I also have a difficult time accepting that there&#x27;s logical proof that hidden variables don&#x27;t exist. Mathematical proof (satisfying a particular, non-necessary set of mathematical theories) does not sufficiently qualify as logical proof. And, indeed, Bell&#x27;s theorem has likely already been proven invalid.",1424044706

9054684,comment,9052727,9052727,0,0,crdb,,,"(Bearing in mind this is not from the Valley POV, but I recognize a lot of the same dynamics here in Singapore)<p>Psychologically:<p>The founder is stuck between a rock and a hard place. With limited cash to work with (seed rounds are tiny here), that extra 10-20% could translate into 10x that in revenue if used on say, Google ads instead of your salary. On the other hand, equity is also scarce; the founder has just given up 6+ months of his life and career and taken enormous risks to start the business, it&#x27;s starting to take off at last (hence the hiring ads), he got some funding closed after months of negotiation, so he considers that his equity stake was &quot;earned&quot; and a newcomer &quot;series A/B employee&quot;, even at early stage, should go earn theirs as well. There&#x27;s often not much equity left anyway, not enough for control even after a seed round, so founders often don&#x27;t have that much to give up.<p>More cynically, this often leads amongst less technical founders and management to the &quot;let&#x27;s hire young, cheap guys, they work harder too, these experienced guys have ridiculous expectations&quot;. I&#x27;ve stopped counting the number of times I heard that (sitting on the management side, advising other companies, etc.). Just last quarter, it was a major angel investor who told my client in his advisory meeting &quot;you should get some unpaid interns from universities to do QA, and offer the best ones a paid internship&quot;. Just last week, a colleague who wants to start his own thing refused my offer to introduce him to experienced engineers I&#x27;ve enjoyed working with, because he&#x27;d rather &quot;go for cheap people who&#x27;ll work for free initially&quot;.<p>(As an aside, this fear is misplaced. I know of at least two CTOs who worked for &quot;free&quot; for 3-6 months until either revenue or funding happened; the second was in his 40s and had 3 kids...)<p>The investors are a significant source of pressure. Not to say they all do this, but a lot of the more &quot;MBA&quot; types consider headcount a KPI to be optimized, so they push you subtly or overtly to reduce salary, hire cheaper people, negotiate harder, and so on. Think of it as reducing the cost of buying out of the money options (from their point of view). One HNWI who I once considered a friend stopped talking to me after I pitched him an idea, he offered me seed funding on the condition I take no salary until revenue, and I declined (having better options). For some reason, that made him very angry... It&#x27;s considered a key business skill amongst those people to get &quot;cheap&quot; talent and a failure of your management skills if you do not. This is even more the case when your choice of tech stack and management style encourages wild growth in the engineering department (think Rocket Internet companies with dev teams in the hundreds) and where that 25-50% discount on market rate translates in quite substantial savings.<p>Finally, both from investors and founders, comes the idea of &quot;hedging&quot;. Why don&#x27;t a lot of startups use Haskell or Lisps? Not because they can&#x27;t find talent (there&#x27;s plenty) but because it&#x27;s a lot harder negotiating with a Haskeller with 10 years experience and a PhD, even with the &quot;Haskell discount&quot; priced in (they will take less money to work in a more interesting stack) than with a fresh grad from a local university with some basic understanding of RoR or Django and hopes they will become the next Zuckerberg. This makes the latter a lot more replaceable, and investors don&#x27;t want their companies hostage to the tech talent.<p>The rest is really stuff that is somewhat right. It IS nicer psychologically for certain personalities (mine included) to have more responsibility, less bureaucracy, a friendly and slightly hipster work environment, a younger set of colleagues full of hope and energy, and a fast feedback loop (it&#x27;s easy to become indispensable and add a lot of value everywhere in a startup). It IS somewhat true that you will gain experience - if only seeing what not to do - that will be very valuable once you start your own thing, and that spending a couple years on a reduced salary hopping a couple of 10-100 employee startup jobs can be a better use of your time as a future founder than doing AI research at Google.",1424044506

It&#x27;s your baby, so feel free to ignore any and all of this you don&#x27;t agree with.<p>First off, you did two things right that a lot of hobbyists (including myself, multiple times) do wrong right out of the gate:<p>1. You wrote some nice, readable introductory docs.<p>2. You didn&#x27;t make the language syntactically weird for no good reasons. I can instantly read your code samples and understand them. Yay!<p>---<p>There&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll end up regretting making strings mutable. It means APIs that receive and store a string have to either copy the parameter (slow, easy to forget) or run the risk of having something that they would be unchanging change under them.<p>This is a problem with mutability in general, but I think strings hit the pain point most strongly since they&#x27;re immutable in other languages.<p>---<p>You have lots of methods that don&#x27;t take arguments (size(), start(), end(), etc.). Some kind of getter syntax would be nice to lose the pointless &quot;()&quot;.<p>---<p>I like your range syntax. I&#x27;m using &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; (like Ruby) in a hobby language of mine[1], and it&#x27;s definitely not intuitive to many users.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/munificent/wren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent/wren</a><p>---<p>Your mixture of &quot;:&quot; for functions and control flow but &quot;do ... end&quot; for blocks hurts my soul in some hard to define way. There&#x27;s nothing intrinsically wrong with it, but I see &quot;:&quot; and expect Python-style indentation then see &quot;end&quot; and get all confused.<p>It might be nice to try to pick one or the other -- use indentation for blocks, or &quot;end&quot; for functions and control flow.<p>---<p>I think you may eventually find the way &quot;self&quot; is dynamically bound to be an annoying frustration. What you have is semantically simple and follows JS and Lua.<p>But it trips people up when people want to do things like store a reference to a method in a callback and invoke it later. When that helps, you&#x27;ll have forgotten the old &quot;self&quot; reference.<p>Of course, solving this is also fairly complex. It usually requires some kind of explicit function/method distinction (makes the language more complex) or an explicit way to close over &quot;self&quot; (easy for the user to forget).<p>---<p>&quot;All variables must be declared before use:&quot;<p>Damn straight. Implicitly declaration gives me hives. :)<p>---<p>I like your cond statement, though I&#x27;ve never personally dug the name &quot;cond&quot;. The semantics are neat, though.<p>---<p>You could get rid of &quot;try&quot; and just allow any block to have a catch clause.

9054668,comment,9053286,9053286,0,0,lmm,,,"> In practice, you&#x27;ll end up with so many &quot;yield from&quot; lines in your code that you&#x27;re right back to &quot;well, I guess I could context switch just about anywhere&quot;, which is the problem you were trying to avoid in the first place.<p>This is backwards, like when my Java colleague complained I was putting &quot;final&quot; in too many places. The point isn&#x27;t the lines that contain &quot;yield from&quot;. It&#x27;s the lines that <i>don&#x27;t</i> contain &quot;yield from&quot;. You can make an explicit choice that you don&#x27;t want context switches to happen on particular lines. In traditional multithreading you can kinda-sorta do this with mutexes - but it&#x27;s less efficient and, more importantly, more error-prone.<p>> Database Code Handles Concurrency through ACID, Not In-Process Synchronization<p>Maybe. The problem is, not everything is (or should be) in the database. Even for CRUD webapps, we tend to end up needing a general-purpose programming language (otherwise you&#x27;d just write them in MS Access, no?) And so we need general-purpose language mechanisms for dealing with concurrency.",1424044133

This is the mentality that the food industry hangs its hat on to continue producing the worst possible products that still somehow meet FDA and public approval.  It&#x27;s dangerous because these foods are engineered primarily to appeal to convenience and taste sensibilities which give people an emotional connection to these substandard foods so that they will be more willing accept any evidence that said foods are acceptable.<p>The idea that eating whole foods which have traditionally been cultivated or gathered by humans is generally preferable to a manufactured alternative is not a bad or fallacious principle. It isn&#x27;t &quot;because nature&quot;, it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve been eating those things a long time with a good deal of success, and conversely, in the last 70-80 years of explosion of heavily processed convenience foods we&#x27;ve seen an explosion in diet related health problems.

9054569,comment,9053693,9053693,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I&#x27;m surprised that roasting isn&#x27;t more popular in the programming community. Supposedly, we like having devices do the work for us, and we&#x27;re known for getting jazzed about emergence. Why don&#x27;t more of us apply this to cooking? (As an aside, my inclination is to cite a decline in education and a distancing of knowledge from the real world, as in: <a href=""http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education</a>)<p>Instead of doing a lot of fussing over our cooking, most of the time, for everyday meals, we should be sticking things into the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then letting the magic of roasting magically create wonderful flavors for us. (Garlic? If you feel like changing it up, go for it! I&#x27;ve solved the &quot;garlic peeling problem&quot; so it&#x27;s a good way to change things up. It&#x27;s a mistake to be too consistent with flavoring, so garlic every time isn&#x27;t necessary, needed, or wise, IMO.) Also keep in mind, that unless you are one of them, you aren&#x27;t cooking to impress your &quot;foodie&quot; friends. You have a different set of priorities. So a helpful thing to do, in your own mind (NOT out loud) tell all your &quot;foodie&quot; friends to &quot;smeg-off!&quot; Go ahead and do things &quot;wrong.&quot; So long as you&#x27;re okay with it. It&#x27;s <i>your</i> relationship with food, not theirs!<p>Steak, cauliflower, fish, asparagus...so many wonderful things to have as everyday meals, and if you approach the task with efficiency in mind, the overall wait is usually 30 to 45 minutes, but active preparation/labor time is very slight. Do very minimal prep, stick something in the oven, go and play a game or write some code, then take really yummy complexly flavored food out of the oven.<p>Truth be told, some of us who aren&#x27;t very focused on food thoughtlessly imitate people we shouldn&#x27;t imitate when we cook. One example: How often do you get out a cutting board and use a full sized chef&#x27;s knife? I haven&#x27;t used a full sized chef&#x27;s knife in over a year and get out a cutting board most often when I just need a place to set ingredients. Let&#x27;s face it, we aren&#x27;t chefs! We aren&#x27;t pulling amazing feats of  multitasking rapid culinary excellence. We don&#x27;t need such a highly specialized and versatile tool to rapidly accomplish a dozen different operations and exercise well honed skills as we zip around in a restaurant kitchen. Basically, it&#x27;s the inversion of the &quot;teaching&quot; segment in Ratatouille: You <i>are</i> your mother! Cut your broccoli in the air over your bowl or pot. Use a <i>really</i> sharp knife. (Look up the Victorinox Fibrox knife <a href=""http://amzn.com/B0000CFDD5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.com/B0000CFDD5</a> then look at this video by America&#x27;s Test Kitchen. That $24 knife has the same grain size and performs as well as the top-rated $300 knife in the video, and it&#x27;s cheap enough for you to simply donate and buy a new one every year.)<p>I now cook all my own food, I roast and steam everything, and the effect is that I eat better than I ever have while doing just a fraction of the work I used to do. &quot;Change your relationship to food&quot; with Soylent? Nah. (Tried it.) An oven, judicious use of aluminum foil, a baking pan, a pot with a steamer insert, and olive oil. Use your brain and observe what you do and adjust it to your priorities.
