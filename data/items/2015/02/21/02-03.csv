It&#x27;s ultimately a law of nature: ownership of capital yields exponential growth. The more you start with, the faster you grow. Most other sorts of vocations yield linear growth.<p>Anything with revenues in excess of expenses has the potential for exponential growth if you use the profits to expand the business. A successful landscaping business can have exponential growth, that doesn&#x27;t mean each of the guys mowing lawns will be making exponentially more money.<p>But it has been <i>set up</i> that way in finance. It isn&#x27;t a law of nature that mutual fund managers make a percentage of the fund as their compensation. The profitability of arbitrage is strongly influenced by the regulatory environment and the amount, timeliness and accuracy of information available to traders without privileged access.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. I propose that we make insider trading entirely legal. According to all of the arguments used to justify HFT and the like this is the right choice because it will increase liquidity and more quickly and accurately reflect the true value of securities in their market price. Somebody please tell me why this argument is wrong in a way that doesn&#x27;t apply equally to HFT.",1424486833

That may be so, they may be more engaged than you ever were, but that&#x27;s only half the equation. They don&#x27;t have the authority and power that you did. It&#x27;s not their baby, they&#x27;re just baby sitters. They can&#x27;t make sweeping changes because they think it&#x27;s a good idea. They can&#x27;t easily change the featureset of the system to support something they want. They have to go through a long process of getting buy off from folks for features, and then waiting until they&#x27;re implemented.<p>When was the last time a major feature change happened with the software? It&#x27;s unrealistic to imagine that there hasn&#x27;t been a need for change and that the tools that were necessary for managing the community, say, 4 years ago are precisely identical to the ones that are needed today. That implies the community hasn&#x27;t changed or that the tools were somehow perfect. Both are very unlikely.<p>Discipline is completely beside the point here. Of course good Q&A sites need discipline, and that loops back to authority figures exercising their powers (mods, admins, etc.) And sure there are people who will complain that SO is a harsh place and they just want to have fun. But that fails to address the many very well founded criticisms of the mod community on SO that numerous people have made, especially concerning abuse of power and twisting the site toward a different vision than it launched with. Imagine a sheriff making a statement that police brutality is justified because criminals exist.<p>Spammers exist, and low quality questions are a menace, but that doesn&#x27;t stop the problems with stack overflow from being real.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s all too easy to fall into the complacency trap of saying that SO still has significant value to a lot of people, is still hugely popular, etc. That doesn&#x27;t indicate that SO is fine, it merely shows that it might not be too late to fix the serious systemic and endemic problems it has. If you were to look at some magical graph of the &quot;successfulness&quot; or &quot;popularity&quot; of stack overflow over time, the point where things &quot;went wrong&quot; would not be at the peak.
