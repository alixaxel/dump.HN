It&#x27;s basically a log of all modifications on any certificate chain that can be monitored by anyone who is interested so that misissuance can be detected.<p>There&#x27;s also the old Perspectives project which idea was forked into Convergence (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_%28SSL%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_%28SSL%29</a>) by good ol&#x27; moxie. The idea: any number of independent entities run notary servers, and when you get the certificate for a domain you also ask the certificate for the same domain to those notaries; if they have the same certificate, it means you all have the same &quot;view&quot; of the domain, so everything is probably ok.

And the problems you described stem mostly from the fact that maps also serve informative function (to learn the route in advance), and apparently Google didn&#x27;t decide yet to compute routes in their navapp based on other active users of said navapp in the neighbourhood. But the data, infrastructure and algorithms are there.<p>> <i>And if it did, and it controlled a significant portion of the cars, it would no longer be the best route.</i><p>Of course it would, because it would be able to run a global route optimization on all the cars simultaneously, thus outperforming even the most experienced human drivers by orders of magnitude.

9123496,comment,9117028,9119369,0,0,devonkim,,,"I think there may be a possibility of the terminal itself being slow. Years ago when I used semi transparent terminals in something like enlightenment it was seriously noticeable when you were trying to scroll through text and it&#x27;d take a while to appear. Then I switched to using a simple terminal like rxvt and no transparency effects under ion2 and wow was it fast.<p>So, perhaps the answer is that it&#x27;s not the editor nor plugins that&#x27;s slow in the scenario. I think the line numbering even causes some slight slowdown. Anything that actually parses text will obviously cause a performance hit too. I notice slowdowns when I use visual selection modes combined with tricky combos of commands. Even without any of that, it might be possible that the version of vim is doing something stupid like what happens when you open up a 1GB log file in less and hit G.

I see in your comment a great deal of ten-dollar words and not a single citation or even a verifiable claim of any sort.<p>The existence of a democratic government does not begin to mean that &quot;more than half the population wants it to be like this&quot;, whatever &quot;this&quot; is. The failings of formal democracy in representing the desires and interests of the population are well-known, and most democratic systems are openly designed to prevent a bare majority from getting everything they want (including ours -- see the Federalist Papers).<p>Your definition of &quot;fascist&quot; would apply to any sufficiently powerful central government, from Hammurabi to the tsars to the UK parliament. There are numerous working definitions of fascism but all of them recognize that fascism is a reaction to liberal democracy and thus inherently modern. There is also no fascism without militancy, or without nationalism. You also don&#x27;t seem to see the contradiction to your &quot;heuristic... to pick the one that is more grounded on logic&quot; inherent in your proposed strategy of &quot;accusing [&#x27;collectivists&#x27;] of fascism&quot;.<p>And your flight of fancy about a &quot;numinous person... pure and incorruptible&quot; wielding &quot;the exalibur of power&quot; (which looks a lot like an argument from pathos to me) has nothing to do with any standard definition of &quot;collectivist&quot;. Nor does it have anything to do with &quot;making goods and services cheaper&quot;. You yourself admit it&#x27;s just a slur (&quot;used disdainfully by those that reject the idea&quot;). Mises, Hayek, Marx, none of them used the term this way. Collectivism is a sociological concept, not a political position.<p>A rationalist should start with observations of reality and proceed from there, not from the axioms which one presumes to be self-evident.",1425126369

That is, do the minimum to say employed but put the real focus into getting to a saner, smarter company. I say appropriate because to me the whole point of modern devops is about having the entire organization work smarter, not harder, and together on the right things to be able to stay sane.<p>Where I am, I know that the wider organization is completely not capable of actually fixing itself (when your network team is still manually running ping and tcproute instead of having monitoring galore from every link to another either with vendor tools or something crude like Nagios, you&#x27;re too far behind to ever catch up). So, even if my corner of the devops world is completely flawless, I will be basically handing off tickets to another team 100% of the time while my applications that depend upon them suffer the consequences.<p>According to my boss I already am changing how others do things by showing the power of solid, modern tooling and instrumentation but it&#x27;s awful hard to tell that any of it makes a difference when you&#x27;re doing 20-hour days 3 days in a row all for issues you only diagnosed, none that you are directly responsible for.",1425125091
