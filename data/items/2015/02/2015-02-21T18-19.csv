I suspect that over time people will generally value access to the global stage, but they won&#x27;t want to live on it. What we see now is in many ways just different facets of the impulsive desire for attention and that fleeting Warholian moment of specialness. I believe people will learn reticence again, and many of them will learn it the hard way.",1424545184

Coding has converged to an artistic medium in itself. One of the prevailing characteristics of an artistic medium is boundless permutations to express oneself. Think about letters and words on a page for a poem or paint colors and strokes on canvas. I wrote about this at length in this post awhile ago, which has a deliberately tongue-in-cheek title: <a href=""https://medium.com/@eastbeast/i-am-an-artist-and-tech-is-my-medium-ba02b6d2da4c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@eastbeast/i-am-an-artist-and-tech-is-my-...</a>",1424545112

Just get to the waiting room early, sit in the back, then start striking up conversations as people who fit your demographic file in.<p>I&#x27;ve found people are more willing to chat at jury duty than the DMV.

9086431,comment,9084617,9086249,0,0,skuhn,,,"Sure. The newest subway line runs down Third Street right to Candlestick Point (about 5 miles away from downtown). It would take over an hour and requires walking a mile.<p>Or you could take the single bus line, which cuts your walk down to half a mile or so. You&#x27;ll have to transfer to another bus that goes on the highway to downtown (so it will be absolutely awful during rush hour). Expected transit time is again 1 hour.<p>Muni&#x27;s on-time rate is 60%, so these are pretty optimistic numbers. Bus&#x27;s don&#x27;t keep to their schedule at all -- if they get to a stop early, they take off. The supposed 15 minute interval is laughable given the city&#x27;s traffic patterns, it&#x27;s just as likely for three buses to arrive simultaneously because they were all stuck in traffic for an hour.<p>The city&#x27;s infrastructure is simply not built for outlying neighborhoods to be viable living destinations for people who commute into the city for work. The highways are clogged and poorly designed (and don&#x27;t connect through the city). The surface road stoplight system is one of the worst synchronized I have seen in the US. The bus and subway system is poorly run and starved for money on basic necessities. The subway system itself is terribly designed: all the lines run through the same underground portion, on the same rails, so the slightest hiccup blocks up every line.<p>It&#x27;s all solvable if you throw a lot of money and political will at it, but neither seems to be there. At least all of the buses are supposed to be replaced within a few years: they SORELY need it.",1424544902

9086429,comment,9084841,9084841,0,0,Animats,,,"That&#x27;s a nice little MITM box. Note that he didn&#x27;t have to do any coding at all.  He just loaded off the shelf open source software onto a Raspberry Pi.  That&#x27;s how easy this is to exploit. You could also take an existing router that runs Linux and put it on that, so it would look just like an commercial router.<p>This Raspberry Pi version isn&#x27;t doing all it could to conceal its attack. The screenshots of the the Bank of America connection show a connection to a site with an Extended Validation certificate, but the MITM software hasn&#x27;t bothered to create a fake EV cert for Bank of America.  So the browser UI hasn&#x27;t turned the address bar green.<p>If the fake cert generator were a little better, it could hide this from even experienced users. The fake certs signed by the Superfish cert display as &quot;Verified by Superfish&quot;.  But if the attacker created a certificate chain with a fake intermediate certificate authority, they could have the &quot;Verified by&quot; be anything they want.  (Look at the certificate for &quot;news.ycombinator.com&quot;.  Firefox says &quot;Verified by COMODO CA Limited&quot;. That name is not from the root certificate installed on the machine; it&#x27;s from the <i>previous</i> certificate on the chain.  The root cert is 3 steps down, and is from &quot;UTN Datacorp SGC&quot;, which is UserTrust.) An attacker could copy all the information from the correct certificate for the site, so everything would look completely normal in the user interface.  The software on the Raspberry Pi isn&#x27;t doing this, but it certainly could.<p>This is such an easy attack, and applicable to so many laptops, that there&#x27;s probably a real attacker out there who&#x27;s been using it for a while.  If you have a Lenovo machine, change your passwords on everything and check all your accounts for fraud.",1424544885

Many processes in software development resemble those used in arts (building cathedrals as an often mentioned example comes to mind), so in the end software can end up being art by itself. However it can be much more, it can be all of inspiring art, pragmatic tool, scientific instrument, fun making gadget, transcending and grouping all of this, and it can devalue everything as well, depending on what mental imprint it obtained from its creators.<p>Ernest Hemingway to Irving Penn:

With that come new guidelines in regards to (search engine) accessibility. Google also is battling spammers. Spammers can saturate a single technique (such as guest blogging) to the point where Google says: &quot;We are actively making sure that this technique does not benefit you in the rankings&quot;.<p>It is not the site structure that is entirely at fault here. It would not make sense to aggregate phone numbers and discussions about these numbers on a single page. A &quot;thin content&quot; penalty is speculative and Google even gave an &quot;unnatural links&quot; warning, telling us where to look first.<p>I think Google understands the power of linking pages together and weighing these links in ranking :). Reverse SEO is murky though, and in principle I could agree that other webmasters devaluing your property is a problem with Google. On the other hand: The fact that spammers complained a lot (and still complain) and were being re-purposed by Google to help clean up the web, tells me that Google is winning this battle. But we also know that collateral damage is possible in war.<p>Finally: Google <i>does</i> make mistakes. And a mistake is between algorithmic superiority and malicious intent by Google.<p>> In the previous posting he indicated that Google asked him to contact the various site authors and ask them to remove their links. Why should he have to do this?<p>Because else he will be slapped with an unnatural links penalty, and he clearly doesn&#x27;t want that. Again, he is free to ignore these warnings and see his site removed from Google&#x27;s index. Google can not force him to do this. They can however enforce quality on their own turf.<p>Question: Could you clarify some of the currrently spammy practices which are encouraged by the standards which define how the Web operates?",1424544658

Some steps I&#x27;ve personally taken include things like canceling television service and canceling subscriptions to infotainment publications, whether in print or online.  I&#x27;ve taken steps to minimize the number of distractions I&#x27;m forced to deal with, and don&#x27;t participate in _most_ social media.  For me, these distractions  amount to enough mental noise that I have a hard time thinking critically about anything beyond my job.  Without them, I&#x27;ve found numerous benefits, not the least of which is the ability to think more clearly and decide for myself whether a news item passes the smell test.  I would advocate everyone at least try this.  I suspect you&#x27;ll find you have way more free time than you think, and the mental quiet will do most people some amount of good.<p>These personal steps don&#x27;t really do anything to curb the actions of others.  Frankly, I just don&#x27;t have any solid solutions to offer.  You can&#x27;t legislate this sort of thing.  It might be possible to break up some large media conglomerates under anti-trust laws, but given the amount of control the current media have to control the conversation, that seems like a non-starter to me.  Ending the 24-hour news cycle would help too -- but again, there&#x27;s a market, it exists, and we can&#x27;t just wave a magic wand to get rid of it.<p>I think it&#x27;s possible that the infotainment industry could atrophy and die off given enough lack of interest or enough obvious outright lying that their credibility becomes laughable.

Therefore, prostate cancer screening is not recommended. The statement emphasizes the importance of the randomized trials and specifically cites the ERSPC in this respect.<p>This position is consistent with the recommendations of an expert panel organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Cancer Union, which stated that sufficient evidence showing the benefits of prostate cancer screening in terms of mortality reduction is still to emerge. Therefore, offering screening as part of health care policy can not be recommended without further evidence.<p>Similar conclusions about withholding screening due to lack of evidence have also been reached in assessments of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Group and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.<p>Nevertheless, screening does take place even if it is not part of the policy. This is done on the basis of judgment and the responsibility of individual physicians and their patients, who may in some circumstances, regard the possibility of benefit as more important than lack of demonstrated effectiveness.<p><a href=""http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/prostate/prostate-patient-info-sheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/prostate/prostate-patient-...</a><p>The PSA test, which can give an early indication of prostate cancer, is available to you

Men sometimes do this out of the best of intentions -- not wanting a woman to think he is hitting on her or not wanting anyone to think there is an affair because he is &quot;friendly&quot; with her -- but it is a very serious obstacle to women being able to network and actually have meaty discussions of business. It&#x27;s also generally helpful for minorities to see examples of someone &quot;like them&quot; in some important way who has done the thing they inspire to. One of the benefits of that is to see an example of what works, even if you don&#x27;t know the right questions to ask about &quot;what do I need to do differently to be successful at this, in spite of the fact that people like me are so seldom successful at this?&quot; It can be helpful to see those examples even in cases where you do not think too deeply about what they are doing differently from others &quot;like them.&quot; It can just give you a glimpse of a pattern you haven&#x27;t seen before that you can emulate without fully analyzing.<p>I do what I can to make it possible for women to participate more equally on HN. I am sort of appalled that Jessica Livingston, the sole female among the YC founders and a presenter at this conference, does not see fit to participate more in discussion here. I think her absence on the forum is one of the reasons it is such a boyzone. But I am glad to see YC doing something to try to support women founders, even though I tend to be much more interested in finding a means to be inclusive of women in the &quot;boys club&quot; rather than in trying to segregate them. Nonetheless, segregation for women to help them get started seems to have a track record of success. From what I gather, women-only colleges have a decent track record of producing female leadership and female coding groups appear to also help women break in. So unless I can offer something definitively more effective and also ideologically more palatable, I see no reason to tear it down with criticism.",1424542724

9086254,comment,9085695,9085695,0,0,tejohnso,,,"When you&#x27;re writing your procedures, you have to think about what you want them to do.  What small unit of work each procedure should perform.  That&#x27;s the best time to write the tests for the procedure, because it will help you to think of edge cases that you might otherwise miss, and it will confirm that the procedure does what you expect before you move onto the next.  It&#x27;s also the easiest time to write the test for the procedure, because you haven&#x27;t yet committed to any particular level of complexity or dependency structure.  If you write tests first, your code will always be testable. If you attempt to show up the next day and start writing tests, you may find that the person who wrote the code yesterday wrote some pretty untestable code.  Another benefit to having the tests is that they will continue to pay off as you modify the code weeks and months later, always confirming that you haven&#x27;t broken anything.<p>Like most other learning endeavours, I found that the best approach was to start small.  Try something simple like a fizz-buzz test.  You&#x27;ll probably have more trouble setting up and writing the tests than writing the code under test.  That&#x27;s okay.  Like any other learning process, it takes time to get used to the new language and behaviour that is required to become fluent in writing testable code.  Make sure that every time you save your working code, your tests run and you can see the result so that you get immediate feedback.  And make sure to always work in as small a unit of work as seems comfortable.<p>Here are some example test function names for fizzbuzz<p>1.  itPrintsFizzForMultiplesOfThree()
2.  itPrintsBuzzForMultiplesOfFive()<p>These tests might be too broad in scope.  Where is it getting the numbers that it&#x27;s checking for multiples?  What does &quot;print&quot; mean?  How are the tests going to confirm what was printed?<p>1.  itReturnsTrueForMultiplesOfThree()
2.  itReturnsTrueForMultiplesOfFive()
3.  itReturnsEitherFizzOrBuzzOrTheNumber()
4.  itSendsTheResultToOutput()<p>These tests are against simpler methods and are easier to write but the tradeoff is that they make the code under test too fine grained at times.  Can you have too many tests?  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s likely in practice, not if they&#x27;re true unit tests and extremely quick to execute.  But some would disagree when they see a five method fizzbuzz class rather than a class with one &quot;doTheWholeThing&quot; method.  You have to find what works for you.  When you return to your code a day or two later, do the tests immediately make sense?  If not, they&#x27;re probably too complicated.  Start small, get a feel for the shift in mindset, grow from there.",1424541991
