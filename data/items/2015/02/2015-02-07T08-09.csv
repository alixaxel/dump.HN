9013517,comment,9010815,9012226,0,0,cannam,,,"That is a good point. The motivation for casting the size to int, rather than the other way around, is to get it out of &quot;unsigned world&quot; (where people often reason badly about even simple arithmetic) and into &quot;signed world&quot; as simply as possible. Often where this is going on, the container is expected to be small, but of course that&#x27;s a hazardous intuition as well.<p>Maybe I need a little helper:<p><pre><code>  template<typename T, typename C>
  bool is_in_range(T i, const C &container)
  {
      if (i < 0) return false;
      if (sizeof(T) > sizeof(typename C::size_type)) {
          return i < static_cast<T>(container.size());
      } else {
          return static_cast<typename C::size_type>(i) < container.size();

9013503,comment,9013261,9013261,0,0,barsonme,,,"A better title: &quot;9 obvious political facts we hashed together to make a cool headline.&quot;<p>1) Of course. Everybody is short-sighted and the goal is to keep the constituents at bay for the next election cycle. Wait long enough, and you&#x27;re basically set depending on how deep of a shade your district is.<p>2) Well, yeah. Nobody donates except for old people (barely), rich people, and unions/corps. A house campaign in a &quot;safe&quot; district in my state costs over $8M, and very little of that comes from your &quot;average&quot; citizen. Thus, fundraisers with rich people. It&#x27;s an arms race, because you don&#x27;t want to be caught without money <i>unless</i> your opponent goes balls-to-the-wall -- then it can be used to your advantage. (&quot;Hey, look, he&#x27;s a corporate/union/out of state shill!&quot;) edit: also, sorting remits sucks. Super boring because most is pennies save for a few large checks.<p>3) This one is probably one of the worst depending where you come from. A state like mine doesn&#x27;t have <i>many</i> issues, whereas some of the states with a very black and white demographic makeup (I mean that in more ways than one) have a <i>lot</i> more issues.<p>4) Yeah. It&#x27;s frightening almost. Still, it depends on the data sets. Many state parties have POS data sets that still rely on a top-down method of data insertion that <i>sucks</i>. Also, the more rural you get the less accurate the data is. (Although, there are other methods of voter ID for rural voters.)<p>5) Part of this is due to the polarization of the U.S., but yeah. I mean, theoretically we&#x27;re supposed to have a slow-moving congress, and separation of powers (exec, leg, judicial) is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>6) Ooooh yeah. Get on the (depends if you&#x27;re talking about state or national congress) finance committee, ways and means, etc and all of  sudden you&#x27;re powerful. I should mention, though, that at the local level committee meetings are taken much more seriously.<p>7 and 8) Yeah. One of the best ways to make connections is through politics. I know people who are absolutely useless but make nearly six figures because they worked on a campaign, ran one, worked as an la, and finally got a position on a &quot;policy group&quot; or as a staffer. All of a sudden you have a bunch of people vouching for you, regardless of your competency. If other professions worked this way (e.g. doctors, lawyers) we&#x27;d all be dead or in jail.<p>9) Apathy is the killer. Nobody cares anymore, and it&#x27;s sad. If people would care, learn about the issues and people, show up to local hearings, actually <i>do</i> things then we&#x27;d see real change. If people wouldn&#x27;t be so polarized and view the world as black and white maybe we&#x27;d end up voting clowns out of office... although, that <i>does</i> require people to actually vote.",1423299065

Netflix makes it impossible to temporarily download a copy to view when you don&#x27;t have a (high-bandwidth) internet connection (e.g. those of us traveling a lot outside their country).<p>Also, if DRM was not supported by the technology companies, it would be more attractive to come up with a form of subscription that would offer both streaming and downloading.<p>&#x27;Pirating&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have all these downsides.<p>Of course, on the flip-side for many people DRM-ed 7.99 p/m streaming services are more price-effective than the previous 7.99 per album DRM-free purchases.

Sure, HBO has more more money than any of us would know what to do with. I, on the other hand, make my living working on films with budgets that only amount to a few hundreds of thousands of dollars, and believe me that does not go very far - the lower cost of digital vs. celluloid film is only one line item in the production process, whereas you still have to pay for locations, costumes, props, housing, transport, food, lighting, and a whole bunch of other things before you even get to handing out any wages.<p>It&#x27;s very, very hard to monetize a low-budget film. And there&#x27;s constant downward pressure on production budgets, because indie films don&#x27;t usually have fat box-office payoffs, and instead depend on small-scale releases in festivals and the art-house cinema circuit, followed by (you hope) some international box office and (you really hope) a long tail of DVD/streaming sales. And that long tail is highly vulnerable to piracy, and the existence of piracy is a big deterrent to investors.<p>So when you&#x27;re saying Big Studio makes enough money with their latest superhero franchise movie, or HBO makes enough money with their huge base of cable subscriptions, and so you don&#x27;t feel bad about pirating <i>Superhero 4</i> or <i>Game of Thrones</i> well sure, I understand that - none of the producers are in any danger of losing their shirts, everyone on the cast and crew got paid handsomely at the fairly generous rates their guilds/unions have negotiated over the years, and the shareholders still make plenty of money and get a nice dividend check every quarter.<p>On the other hand, lots of smaller content providers are getting fucked financially because it&#x27;s a lot harder to answer the question of &#x27;how will investors make their money back?&#x27; than it was a few years ago.
