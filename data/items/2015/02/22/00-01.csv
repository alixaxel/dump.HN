It&#x27;s the fast-food cashier of tech jobs.<p>Are you still doing that same job, or have you learned something in that time? If so, if you&#x27;ve aggregated experience and knowledge, you need to figure out how to tell that story and how to distill it down into your resume and interview.<p>A long time ago I did tech support also, but I know I learned <i>lots</i> of soft skills. It took me a while to figure out how to parlay those into better jobs, but now, many years later and mid-career, those same skills get exercised every single day.<p>I think your best bet is honestly figuring out how to rerepresent your job time as a career, start building a portfolio you can show off, and start networking.",1424566634

Can you point to something specific?<p>Certainly there is a big difference between NATO and the EU. The point stands that several former Warsaw nations HAVE joined NATO. The Ukraine was only set to join the EU under extremely hostile conditions to Russia (the deal with the EU would have precluded close economic ties with Russia).<p>Russia&#x27;s claim was that the threat was to national security - and this is true - especially if they were to lose the port accesses in the Crimea. Furthermore the Ukraine controls the pipelines that deliver gas and oil from Russia. This powers 70% of Europe and is the main export and national income of Russia. The EU deal would have severely undercut Russia&#x27;s ability to negotiate oil prices, which absolutely poses a national security problem. This is common among nations; for example The United States considers the Trans-Pacific Partnership key for national security concerns and interests in the Pacific region and into the future. The TPP is not a military deal.<p>Academi (Blackwater) was in Ukraine as early as January (this can be confirmed with Google image searches). The NGOs you mentioned made up large numbers of the Euromaiden protestors that occupied Central Square - it&#x27;s also important to name names: the support of these NGOs included the CIA&#x27;s USAID. Legality is questionably relevant - at least to this conversation where we are discussing whether or not it was done. Acceptable to us, yes. Not to Russia.<p>Russia definitely responded with direct military force. We aren&#x27;t talking about that though. We&#x27;re talking about installing juntas and influencing politics.

For me, the mental complexity of trying to hold a huge API in my head all at once greatly outweighs the cost associated with taking some time to find a well maintained, tested repo that does the exact thing I need really well :) Another great example came to me today: syntax highlighting. The readme on our solution [here](<a href=""https://github.com/segmentio/highlight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/segmentio/highlight</a>) hints at why the decision to break things apart made sense for us. As for both mental complexity and ease of use, I think this is a lot simpler than something more traditional like, for example, highlightjs.<p>Rather than go to highlightjs&#x27;s website to download a custom build of the script that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have 22 languages (20 of which you probably don&#x27;t need), adding it to your asset pipeline, then repeating whenever you need to add a new one, with highlight&#x27;s plugin approach + a simple package manager and build process like duo, you can easily add and remove each language from your build ad hoc.",1424563624

Millions of men were conscripted for WW2 and Korea in the US and for a great many of them their first experience with a self-loading firearm was with the M1 they were issued in  training. To many of them, no matter how many autoloaders they were exposed to aftward, that thing you shoved into the gun that held the cartridges was called a CLIP, because that&#x27;s what the drill sergeant in training called it.

It doesn&#x27;t quite support everything; I fairly often saw things like emacs crash when run with ssh -X. Furthermore, it provides only a single isolation boundary. <i>Every app</i> running with the security extension has access to each other. So, for this sort of use case, the best you could have is that all your Dockerized apps can mess with each other, but not with processes on the host, which isn&#x27;t quite what you&#x27;d hope.<p>There&#x27;s &quot;security-enhanced X&quot;, but basically imagine SELinux applied to each widget on your screen (which is what it is). If you think making SELinux usable and secure is hard, you won&#x27;t look forward to this.<p>I sketched a design a while ago for doing protocol-level filtering of X where each app effectively lived in its own namespace. Widgets, resources, etc. created by one app are inaccessible to another, because they&#x27;re not nameable. A middle layer translates each name into a name in a common global namespace, so the X server is unmodified. I think this is doable but a <i>lot</i> of work, especially given how many extensions are in the X protocol. It also doesn&#x27;t really help you if, say, your OpenGL stack isn&#x27;t good at isolating one app from another.<p>I think the other promising approach is to use a remote-desktop like solution (like Xpra, or x11vnc, or something) which spawns a separate X11 server, and screen-scrapes it and passes it to the host. You lose a few things like OpenGL, and the overhead might get prohibitive if you run one X server per app, but the isolation is pretty solid.",1424563475
