For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m not opposed to the idea of referendum at all, as long as it is done legally. I&#x27;m sure that if Moscow was so bent on having Crimea, they could have come to a political agreement with Kiev, and it would be legal and Crimea wouldn&#x27;t have all those problems it&#x27;s having now (e.g. lack of water, power, food price surges, crippled transport connections with the mainland, etc.). And Russia would have spent a lot less compared to what it&#x27;s spending now on the war, maintaining a semblance of normal life in Crimea, and the sanctions.<p>The problem is that was not the goal of the folks in Moscow. They wanted to create a political crisis so they seized Crimea by force. When it didn&#x27;t work, they inserted Girkin in Donbass. If Ukraine had given up Donbass just like it did Crimea, the next insertion would probably be Kharkov. And so on. It&#x27;s not Crimea or Donbass the Kremlin is after, it&#x27;s all of Ukraine - it&#x27;s practically written on the wall. The nazi scares and the rest of the Russian propaganda are just an effort to garner sympathy from abroad for the military invasion.",1424627860

Hackerspaces were still hidden underground things, and the technology was so new, a lot of pie-in-the-sky dreamers were here trying to make their way in the world.<p>This time around, there is an established norm for how the startup scene works, and that scene requires MBAs and business suits. The people who have come around to take advantage this time are not nerds, they&#x27;re not tech people, they&#x27;re people of all sorts. I think the best way to so describe them is to say that these are normal people. That&#x27;s fine anywhere else, but not in SF, home of the weirdos.<p>SF has NEVER been a town of normal people. This gentrification process is basically turning SF into the Valley. The old days where burning man types held parties in their warehouses are long gone now. The first dot com boom made millionaires out of some of these weirdos, like JWZ. But this boom is not doing that. The people getting rich now came to SF just to get rich, and they have no interest in being weird, burning man, or any of the SF-style weirdness.<p>Yes, in 1999 artists had to leave SF. But at that time, it was just some artists and weirdos leaving. This time, it&#x27;s ALL of them leaving. There are no more blue collar people in SF. No more weirdos in SF. No more poets in SF. It&#x27;s a real shame, and while it could have happened in 1999, it didn&#x27;t quite get going enough to really do the damage that&#x27;s being done this time around.",1424627594

Yet, many people overlook the amazing every day because we have expectations of how life should go.<p>In our anticipation of the future or recollections of the past we never quite nestle into the present unless we are fortunate enough to realize that true understanding and true contentment come from within.<p>We all have this amazing experience we are sharing.  Life is, indeed, tumultuous, it is not always easy or straightforward, but we all know there is a &quot;better&quot; someplace.  That is, generally, what keeps us all going, if we are not with the luxury to coast.<p>Know that no matter how much you agonize and suffer, the experiences you have are rich and valuable, because you can one day use this to help someone else.  We are each like a universe unto ourselves in a way -- we each have (for the most part) a visual field, a sound sphere, a taste, smell, and tactile sense field of sensory immersion.  Even if you are hurting a lot, know that things change.  This is the truth.<p>Know also, that to be able to prevent or relieve someone else&#x27;s suffering is not only valuable to them, but valuable to you, because we are all connected in deep ways, many of which are not apparent to our &quot;thinking&quot; minds.<p>Before you do anything rash, I would encourage you to try and learn as much as you can about life and its myriad expressions.  Go to a nursing home and volunteer for an afternoon.  Go to a hospital and hang out with some people with cancer, or even just with a simple boo-boo.  Your heart might open, and the truth and beauty of a life lived for others might dawn in your mind.<p>Really, our greatest purpose, if I may be so bold as to lay claim to one, is to help the brilliance of creativity, joy, compassion, and openness grow and illuminate our world.<p>Perhaps you have noticed that your attitude and willingness to open up to other people influences how you feel, and this is no coincidence.  Look at your own body -- cells pass nutrients and signals along to other cells, and in the end &quot;you&quot; (although where &quot;i&quot; or &quot;you&quot; truly dwell is a deep question) are able to walk around and get some coffee.  Something as simple as your afternoon tea takes a chorus of millions upon millions of cells coordinating selflessly in order to happen.<p>Life is not about monetary success or fame or gain.  These lumps come and go, they coagulate and they pass, it is not the truest our life aims can be.  Certainly, these can sometimes ease our burdens, and make service easier, but true satisfaction will come when your heart aligns, even in the slightest, with the heartbeat of the universe (multiverse)...<p>To spend your days contemplating the greatest and deepest impulse of the cosmos in its infinite and unbound expression would not be a waste of your time.  It would, in fact, be a great gain, for yourself and others.<p>Happiness is not a condition, it is a practice.  Since we are all connected, the more you aspire to helping others lift up their end of the &quot;net&quot; so-to-speak, the more you yourself will rise.  Your opportunity for the most sublime and wonderful unfolding is in this life.  Our potential as humans is unlimited.  Aspire to the greatest benefit for all, and your arrows of action shall not miss their mark.  For every little bit can grow and grow.<p>Knowing that we all suffer, that it in inherent to life, and that we all wish to be free of suffering is only the beginning.  &quot;It is better to travel well than to arrive.&quot;<p>Plant your seeds and help your garden grow.",1424626445

You could cleverly upconvert on the fly of course, but that&#x27;s basically the same thing as keeping groff around, except with the added friction of informing everyone that they should be using Markdown now, with new tooling and conventions. Don&#x27;t underestimate the marketing costs of successfully convincing the diverse Linux ecosystems they should jump onboard.<p>I only see this working if some big entity slams the gavel and decrees this as the new manpage standard, but I also don&#x27;t see any such entity having much incentive to do so.",1424624432

The problem is, as you said, that people don&#x27;t use dedicated csv parsers, and create utter crap.<p>The other problem is Microsoft Excel. It is installed on almost any Windows machine, and automatically mapped to *.csv file endings. The first I do on Windows machines is to map _any_ text based file format to notepad++.<p>Excel destroys any csv file upon saving. It can&#x27;t handle different decimal point formats. File separation characters are mappes to tabs. Multiline text is destroyed (not sure if true anymore, in Office 2007 it was). And don&#x27;t even get me started about dates.",1424624431
