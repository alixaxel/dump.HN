The purpose of having watchlists is so counterterrorist investigators can quietly monitor the movements of people they think will organize terrorist attacks. Notifying the people on the list defeats that purpose: it ensures that none of the people it&#x27;s watching will incriminate themselves, or lead counterterrorist investigations to the other members of the plot.<p>Fair enough.<p>> That doesn&#x27;t mean the lists aren&#x27;t fraught or regularly abused. For instance, you surely cross a line from &quot;legitimate investigative tool&quot; to &quot;tool of oppression&quot; when the watchlist ensures you get an extra hour of screening at the TSA checkpoint.<p>At this point, I want to say, &quot;What can be done about this abuse?!&quot; but I don&#x27;t really have any answers. The best we can hope for is some form of independent oversight from someone who can remain some degree of objectively neutral (which is to say, not buddy-buddy with law enforcement), but who also can be trusted not to leak stuff to the press.<p>I dunno, does anyone have better ideas?

8995251,comment,8994839,8994839,0,0,derefr,,,"A few little arguments <i>in favor of</i> this practice:<p>1. You plug a USB device into one Mac. It asks you if you want to use it for Time Machine. You say no. Now, no other Mac will ask you this question again—because the preference has been stored on the drive, instead of on the computer.<p>2. You create a folder with an app you&#x27;ve written in it, and customize it with a cute &quot;drag [this] onto [shortcut to Applications folder]&quot; background, centering the icons on the background positions and sizing the window to perfectly fit the representation. You then copy this folder to another Mac (or any equivalent process, such as converting it into a DMG disk image and having someone download it.) They see exactly what you saw.<p>3. You keep an external hard disk that you frequently move back-and-forth between two Macs. The first time you plugged it into one of the Macs, it was indexed. Each time you modify it on either Mac, that index gets updated. The most recently created files are the most likely to be the ones you&#x27;ll want to find through Spotlight when you plug the disk into the other Mac—but if the index was machine-local rather than disk-local, the new Mac wouldn&#x27;t know about the new files yet, and would have to finish re-indexing to find them. (This is, of course, what happens when you modify the disk on a Windows computer, and it sucks. We really need a &quot;metadata index API&quot; to start being an expected offering of a filesystem, such that all OSes interacting with the filesystem can read and update it!)<p>On the other hand, Windows&#x27; Thumbs.db is exactly the sort of thing you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want cached on the media. It&#x27;d be a great innovation if, say, cameras could pre-generate Thumbs.db files so Windows could immediately show the user what was on an SD card the first time it got plugged in... but cameras don&#x27;t, because Thumbs.db is a random proprietary format. So, instead, it&#x27;s only useful in the same situation that the Spotlight index is: moving a drive full of photos back and forth between two computers. Which might have separate screen DPI, and thus be set to show different thumbnails, meaning new thumbnails will get generated anyway.",1423023008

8995237,comment,8991239,8991239,0,0,JohnMunsch,,,"The level of FUD here is astounding. AngularJS is not perfect, nor certainly are the major competitors. React seems to be dribbling out a piece at a time to us and each piece gets its own name and arrives in its own time. That makes it a little bit difficult to use as a framework. Hopefully it will all eventually jell and provide a really different take on how to build the front-end. I&#x27;d love it if there was a third choice with the same level of support behind it out there to give both of them a run for their money.<p>But this is reality here: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=angularjs%2C%20ember.js%2C%20backbone.js%2C%20reactjs%2C%20durandal%20js&cmpt=q&tz="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=angularjs%2C%20ember....</a><p>See those lines hugging the bottom of the chart? They&#x27;re everything that isn&#x27;t AngularJS and React. React is clearly on the uptick and AngularJS on the downtick for the partial Feb data they&#x27;ve got, but everybody else is in the noise level.<p>Yet people here would have you think:<p>1: It&#x27;s old! - Really? 1.0 shipped in mid 2012. In three years we will have gone from 1.0 to 1.4 and some work done on 2.0.<p>2: It&#x27;s going to change tomorrow when 2.0 comes out. - Really? Have you spoken to the other guy just above? He seems to think it&#x27;s decrepit, you&#x27;re worried that anything you build with it will have to be thrown away tomorrow because of its astounding rate of change.<p>3: Using the Chinese menu system of putting together a front-end framework is perfectly viable. Just pick something from columns A/B/C/D and throw it together and start using it. You&#x27;ll find lots of people who can answer your questions, there are books written on that particular combo of tech, and there are developers out there by the hundreds you can hire who will have no problem diving right into your projects.<p>No. It doesn&#x27;t really work that way. Pick an arbitrary grab bag of stuff and maybe you&#x27;ll make some excellent choices. But you&#x27;ll have to live with that decision for quite a while. Even a less popular stack like Ember.js is going to get more third party support than whatever you decide upon for yourself.<p>Above all, please do a quick experiment for me. The next time somebody tells you that AngularJS is a dead end and you can&#x27;t rely on it for years to come, ask them what they would have recommended back in 2013? Just two years ago. What set of stuff would they have advocated then that would be doing so well today and have this long lived future into 2017+ that wasn&#x27;t AngularJS? Backbone.js? I don&#x27;t know of anything.<p>My point is this, the front-end and JavaScript tech is changing at a rate way too high for anyone&#x27;s predictions about two and three years down the road to have a lot of merit. AngularJS seems like a reasonable bet to have done well and have lots of info available about migration from 1.X to 2.0 so at the moment I&#x27;m still on that path. In the meantime I hope to learn more about Facebook&#x27;s stuff to see if it gives me useful ideas or to see if I can incorporate parts of it into AngularJS (Flux seems interesting for instance and would likely slide into most of the frameworks). But the people below who speak with such certainty about the future... Maybe they don&#x27;t see it as clearly as they think.",1423022642
