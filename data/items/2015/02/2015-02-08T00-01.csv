This forces all program execution to wait during slow operations like main memory reads, ...&quot;<p>This is of course nonsense.  Even an in-order implementation with non-blocking caches will let execution proceed in parallel with a load until the result is demanded.  An actual out-of-order implementation will rename the (implicit) registers and proceed as normal.<p>The _only_ issue with stack architectures is that they are awkward (but not impossible) for compilers to generate optimized code for.<p>EDIT: I agree with basic motivation for pushing all the way to hardware (just not for Lisp).

They might have broken their bodies, minds, and hearts over the kind of work they do.<p>The human evaluation of what constitutes as value added to society is not perfect. The human evaluation of what to do is not perfect. Sometimes people just don&#x27;t know what to do.<p>Also, social pressure shouldn&#x27;t be the motivator.

I envy the lifestyle, but these positions are fairly niche and definitely not the norm.<p>I would be very happy to do 75% of my current work for 75% of the pay.  Unfortunately things don&#x27;t scale like that for a number of reasons.  E.g. a team of 8 people working at 75% will not be as effective as a team of 6 people working at 100%.

9015957,comment,9014795,9015810,0,0,vegabook,,,"Absolute nonsense indeed - in your own comment. Germany never had the euro &quot;forced&quot; upon it. If you recall it was called the &quot;écu&quot;, until Germany called it the euro. Germany has benefited by far the most from euro in the sense that it has erased the serial competitive devaluations which have been a feature of non-German monetary policy for the past 100 years. It was agreed bilaterally by Mitterand and Kohl and forced upon the rest of Europe.<p>By maintaining a strong currency for its customer countries, Germany has, in fully aware and calculated fashion, created purchasing power for its goods. By creating purchasing power for its goods, it has locked in its own competitive advantage, allowing more investment and consolidating its industries&#x27; lead over European competitors. The anecdotal evidence bears this out completely: witness Volkswagen&#x27;s completely domination compared with the healthy competition from PSA, Fiat Group, Renault, or indeed Rover 20 years ago.<p>&quot;Nobody forced Greece to take on the loans&quot;. Classic simplistic, moralising, yet false axiom, and is the entire theme of the article which you clearly have not read, or understood, properly. The point of the article is that thrusting large amounts of money in front of the nose of a potential debtor is bound to create a debt, but under such circumstances that debt, when it turns bad, does not lay blame 100% at the door of the borrower. The irresponsible creditor must also take a share of the pain. That is what is Syriza&#x27;s underlying point, and is mirrored across peripheral europe, and any idea that Germany (or French banks) must at all costs get 100c return on each euro of capital invested is completely erroneous. The periphery must take some pain, yes, but the usurious and/or opportunistic lender must also be punished.",1423356138

Confidence level is the probability of detecting a difference when one really does not exist, typically .05.  The 4th item is the expected difference of the test.

9015931,comment,9015613,9015829,0,0,jarcane,,,"What I mean is, JS in general is not a Lisp, nor is it a functional language.<p>But it does have a number of key basics in place. It has anonymous, first-class functions and objects. It has a very handy function composition syntax (chaining dot-notation feels almost like Haskell sometimes, if uglier). It has map(), filter(), and reduce(). You can, somewhat torturously, wrangle a Y-combinator in it even.<p>But in practice, it&#x27;s still missing some basic toys. The lack of TCO means that while yes you have handy function composition and a basic smattering of first-class functions, recursive solutions aren&#x27;t really viable, which makes many classic functional approaches impossible when it comes to implementing the stuff that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> there yet. You have to kludge around it with mutation and for loops and such. As well, you also run into issues with the object-oriented focus at times: first-class functions are all well and good, but not that useful when so many things aren&#x27;t functions but methods or operators, requiring even more heavy use of lambdas than I would in a Lisp.<p>ES6 goes further in the direction of supporting the functional style and making it more pleasant to write. Arrows offer neater lambda syntax, let and const offer better control of scope and enforced immutable variables, and of course offering proper TCO opens up a lot easier implementation of classic recursive functions. I&#x27;m even a little curious about the possibilities of iterators and generators; my experience implementing an RNG in Heresy using Racket&#x27;s generators suggested that they can prove a powerful tool in the functional programmer&#x27;s toolbox for solving certain kinds of problems traditionally thought to be quite non-trivial to write from a functional approach.<p>ES6 does come a little closer to actually living up to Crockford&#x27;s hype with these changes. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m very excited to keep learning and playing with, and it was something of a relief to find a niche for the happy little Schemer in me in an otherwise very mainstream, mostly-imperative language.",1423355602

9015878,comment,9015370,9015370,0,0,eigenvector,,,"I don&#x27;t work in the software industry. But I&#x27;m often frustrated by nitpicking over who is or isn&#x27;t A Real Engineer.<p>Implicit in these discussions is the concept that engineers are superior to mere technicians or operators. As an engineer I have worked with technicians who want to go back to school to become an engineer, because of the perceived prestige and earning power that would come along with it. Often, they don&#x27;t even realize that they make more money than I do [1].<p>In my industry the chief divide between engineers and technicians is that engineers design systems whereas technicians construct and operate them. These are fundamentally different jobs, each with its own challenges and benefits, although they often overlap. Pay is roughly the same, though engineers tend to have more generalized knowledge that can help them shift into a different sector more easily during a downturn. Both roles are essential, and I like to joke that if all the engineers disappeared, the technicians could keep things running for at least a decade, but if all the technicians disappeared, the lights would be out within 24 hours.<p>Good engineers can&#x27;t function without good technicians. Both have a good deal of specific knowledge that the other does not. And somebody who is good at one role is rarely good at the other.<p>Be an engineer because that&#x27;s what you want to do, because you genuinely feel that designing systems using the application of engineering theory is better situated to your skills and personality, not because you think it might be more prestigious or respectable that what you&#x27;re currently doing.<p>[1] I work in the power industry where a skilled technician commands a similar or higher hourly rate to an engineer, more overtime and usually does a hell of a lot more work, like fixing overhead power lines at 2am during a winter storm.",1423354200

9015861,comment,9015370,9015370,0,0,swatow,,,"First, I want to acknowledge that neither article was actually about who gets to call themselves a software engineer.  That said, clearly that&#x27;s all the HN comments are going to be about , so I&#x27;m diving in.<p>I call myself a software engineer because it makes me feel smart and important.  To me, that&#x27;s the only difference between an engineer and similar jobs.  I don&#x27;t want to heap scorn on people who make sandwiches at subway, like many will use this discussion as an excuse for.  Nonetheless, the reason the term engineer doesn&#x27;t apply to them is that their job is neither important, nor requires a lot of intelligence.<p>Things like following a specific process, taking ethics courses, or being certified, are just things that some engineers happen to do.  If you&#x27;re smart and capable, you will do what is necessary to do the job well.  Sometimes, this involves following a specific process, and sometimes regulation is necessary to ensure that everyone does this.  But other times, individual judgement is the only solution.  I believe this is the case for software engineering.<p>I don&#x27;t really care about the word that much (although I really like calling myself and engineer), but what I do care is the implication that our industry needs to be regulated like professional engineers are.  In fact, I&#x27;m opposed to all forms of organization, either unions or professional organizations, because they have nothing to offer the industry, and can do a lot of harm through rent seeking behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to regulation that forces businesses to protect user information better, or provide better privacy safeguards.  But these are regulations of the business practices.  I don&#x27;t want to have to get a certificate for something I can read online, even if someone else worked <i>really really hard</i> to get their certificate.",1423353909
