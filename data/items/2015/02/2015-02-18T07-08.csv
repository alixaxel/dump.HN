9067473,comment,9063216,9063216,0,0,cthalupa,,,"The article seems kind of odd on some of its logic:<p>>Its storage subsystem also has some surprising misses. Its rough version of LVM, LUKS, and md-raid is called GEOM. GEOM, however, supports only RAID0, RAID1, and RAID3. It does not support RAID5 or RAID6 in software RAID configurations!<p>Well, actually, it does support raid5, but also... With ZFS being a truly first class citizen, why not just use raid-z or zfs encryption instead of raid5 or luks?<p>>ZFS also does not support some common operations, like adding a single disk to an existing RAID5 group (which is possible with md-raid and many other implementations.) This is a ZFS limitation on all platforms.<p>No block pointer rewrite for ZFS, so no expanding of existing vdevs by adding disks, but you can still add more vdevs to increase the total pool size. You generally want specific numbers of disks based on raidz level for performance reasons anyway.<p>(In general) RAID isn&#x27;t really a &quot;consumer&quot; thing, outside of maybe a basic home NAS type environment. If you&#x27;re doing this for a server environment where RAID sees the majority of it&#x27;s use, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too onerous to have to add more vdevs instead of a single disk.<p>> Apparently this is because FreeBSD has nothing like Linux’s inotify.<p>Nothing like? kqueue/kevent. It&#x27;s not &#x27;exactly&#x27; like inotify, but it&#x27;s definitely something like it. (It&#x27;s also something like epoll, and others... kqueue is fairly big and replaces multiple linux equivalents)<p>I find it odd that the network stack isn&#x27;t mentioned either. It&#x27;s still significantly more performant than the linux network stack, and FreeBSD is pulling away even farther in this arena.<p>Things like <a href=""https://wiki.freebsd.org/NetworkRSS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.freebsd.org/NetworkRSS</a> , netmap being a first class citizen, etc (Netflix blogs on why they chose FreeBSD for their CDN devices are fascinating) are all pretty damn sweet.<p>Kind of nitpicky, I guess, especially since the author isn&#x27;t claiming to be intimately familiar with the state of every part of modern FreeBSD",1424246349

9067466,comment,9062733,9065296,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Your interpretation of &quot;behavioral&quot; is flawed. Uber drivers are not told &quot;when and where&quot; to go. They are offered the opportunity to go somewhere and pick someone up. It is completely at their convenience and option to do this; they will suffer no privation if they fail to pick up the offered lead. It&#x27;s not like a traditional employer-employee relationship, where the employer buys <i>time</i> from the employee and directs it as he sees fit. The employer is buying the execution of a discrete task, not a large chunk of the employee&#x27;s time.<p>Your analysis of &quot;Type of Relationship&quot; is also flawed. Uber does not supply any employee-style benefits, and they do <i>not</i> rely on specific drivers to carry out &quot;key aspects&quot; of the business beyond the discrete work units they&#x27;ve wilfully contracted to perform at their convenience. There is no ongoing expectation that any particular driver will drive at any point in the future.<p>There is no boss to call Uber drivers and say &quot;Please, you are killing us by not picking up your shift tonight&quot;.<p>I think the differences between traditional employment relationships and gig providers are pretty clear. I expect these lawsuits are just from people trying to get big settlements, since it&#x27;s pretty obvious opting to bring someone a Jamba Juice on TaskRabbit once every 2 months is a lot different than a 9-5.",1424246232

9067460,comment,9064257,9065440,0,0,ptaipale,,,"Actually, people can&#x27;t eat money. Money can buy things, but if you change the allocation of money, you change the price of things as well, so linear calculations like &quot;with this amount of money, and math&quot; do not necessarily work out very realistically.<p>On the other hand, there is already much more than enough food in the world - at least so far, despite huge population growth - so the problem is not that the world would need more food; the problem is allocation and distribution of food. Shortly, lack of market access.<p>And most big famines are not even about people not being able to afford food as such; they are political.<p>From your example, Apollo, I&#x27;ll jump to another example: the best-known modern famine in Ethiopia, 1983-1985. There was local drought in northern Ethiopia, but the government  was actually exporting food. The government extracted food from producers so that they themselves had to buy their own food, and at the same time the same government restricted the movement of people.<p>There was plenty of aid sent, but it was sent to the government that had partially caused the hunger in the first place.<p>In 1985, Ethiopia had a population of 41 million. Now it has a population of 88 million. And they are not  particularly hungry, and this does not even require a lot of money from the Apollo program. But it requires more stable political circumstances in Ethiopia (and things have looked somewhat better after the Soviet-backet government fell in 1991).",1424246012

9067439,comment,9062132,9065368,0,0,alexlarsson,,,"Raising the latency <i>is</i> what you want in many cases. For instance, the current discussion is about a video player. There is no need for a video player to submit new data every 10ms, because it knows exactly what it will be playing for the next N seconds (depending on the buffer size it uses). Waking up every 10ms just causes more cpu and power use and risks missing the deadline.<p>Of course, there are cases where you <i>do</i> need lower latencies, such as games where interactive feedback cause the sound to change, or when you pause a movie. In those cases you adjust the latency (possibly temporarily in the case of the pause).<p>That said, PulseAudio has a different set of requirements and thus design decisions from Jack.

The cost of doing this is less significant in two ways: the L3 access latency is already much much higher (as elaborated on above) and the hash calculation can be done in parallel with other required logic (e.g. in parallel with L2 access).",1424243207
