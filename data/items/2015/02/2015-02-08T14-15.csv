So many times does &quot;just use headphones&quot; get thrown at people who protest the open office reduction, but they don&#x27;t realize that wearing headphones all day is uncomfortable (and probably dangerous), even if we love music - and it&#x27;s also distracting.<p>When we have things like IRC/Hipchat/Slack, email, and video chat, having a door is no more a problem, because we can get a hold of anyone asynchronously.<p>Therefore, if anything, it should be EASIER to have doors now.<p>Sadly, the best office environment I&#x27;ve seen was at AT&T in 2000-ish.  Employees had HUGE cubes, with quite a lot of office space for managers.  Cube size reduced significantly over the last decade and a half until now cubes are viewed as somehow decadent.  We laughed at cubes relative to offices then, we would LOVE to have them back now.<p>I&#x27;m looking for the work-from-home revolution to take over or companies to at least realize what they are doing with the open plan stuff for development.   Technology makes doors not exist - so we should at least be able to have quiet.",1423407573
9017377,comment,9017027,9017341,0,0,thomaskcr,,,"But its not contrived -- its like your entire job. You&#x27;re literally saying &quot;I can&#x27;t perform my primary job function when there is any pressure whatsoever&quot;. That MIGHT be acceptable if you&#x27;re interviewing for an entry level job.<p>The only other reason I can think for being unwilling to do this is if you&#x27;re incapable of working with other people - because whiteboarding out solutions with other devs is super common. Even &quot;where do you think I should start, I&#x27;m a bit nervous and an idea to get me going would be great&quot; is a perfectly acceptable question. The best interviews are a conversation -- if you turn it into a conversation where we&#x27;re working together on the problem, it shows a lot about you still. If you take someone else&#x27;s idea and run with it I think that&#x27;s really cool, obviously if you need hand-holding it&#x27;s suboptimal, but there is still a very positive possible outcome from saying &quot;I have no idea where to start&quot; if you&#x27;re actually nervous.<p>The only ways I can think of to fail writing out code is people skills or being completely unable to program. It&#x27;s not like I expect a perfect solution in the 30-60 minutes we have, analysis paralysis is just as bad as no-knock raiding the problem. There is some type of middle ground that involves a good solution that had to be done quickly -- maybe you even mention some other avenues to explore.<p>What if you ever have to represent my department in any capacity and someone asks you what your ideas for a problem and you just say &quot;no, I don&#x27;t do that&quot; -- that doesn&#x27;t really represent me well. I would be very surprised if being uppity about a question being &quot;below you&quot; ever works, you might as well just walk out the door if you&#x27;re going to refuse to answer a question on &quot;philosophical principle&quot;.<p>The question is just a jumping off point -- its up to you to turn it into a conversation that shows me how great of a programmer you are. If your answer is telling me how dumb my interview is, then that doesn&#x27;t show me how great a programmer you are at all -- it shows me you have an attitude problem.",1423407573

9017361,comment,9015663,9016467,0,0,tomkinstinch,,,"The responsivity of silicon (and other semiconductors) by wavelength is pretty well characterized[1]. Any data sheet for a silicon photodiode will include a similar plot, and as photodiodes are just diodes (granted, operated in reverse bias), regular diodes will have a similar response if light can get past the part package. Photodiode junction doping and geometry are optimized to make them useful as optical devices, but they&#x27;re still VERY close to regular silicon diodes.<p>This property of diodes can be used in a fun way: LEDs emit light, but they can also be used as photodiodes[2]. It&#x27;s easy with a microcontroller pin that can act as both a digital output and analog input. LEDs are of course not optimized for this use (small sensor area, the package may absorb useful light particularly in the UV, phosphor if present may get in the way), but they can be used as photodetectors.

I wonder what the design requirements were -- it seems surprising to me that the only locking part of the waist tether is a button. It seems like that button could get accidentally hit, causing the tether to unlock and become unsafe; that is, unless the button has a spring forcing it to the &quot;lock&quot; position.<p>Interestingly, there is a new carabiner on the market whose locking mechanism is more like a button (<a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/840193/black-diamond-magnetron-rocklock-locking-carabiner"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rei.com/product/840193/black-diamond-magnetron-ro...</a>): the difference being that the mechanism must be activated from both sides (via pinching the purple parts in the image), and has magnets forcing the carabiner into the &quot;locked&quot; state when not being held unlocked.<p>Also interesting is that the waist tether is adjustable. That could be a point of failure -- imagine floating off the end of your tether.

A specific debugger is simple: patch the debugger&#x27;s source at compile time to hide the presence of the malware. Of course, that means you have to handle the case where the debugger is used to debug itself, too. That may pose a challenge, but given the existence of quines, I think it is possible. Doing that not for just _a_ debugger but every debugger in the world is left as an exercise.<p>Next, someone will look at timing and notice something strange. So, add stuff that tweaks the real-time clock to correct for this when your binary runs, when the OS gets built with your compiler. That way, running &#x27;time&#x27; on your binary will not show anything suspicious.<p>Next, someone may notice a discrepancy between real-time clocks and their OS. Solution? Make sure analog clocks aren&#x27;t that precise, hook all digital clocks up to a time signal, and tweak that signal if you hit slower code paths that the user shouldn&#x27;t see. Also, make sure that all other computers in the world slow down whenever one of them hits one of these paths.<p>Next, someone will notice a discrepancy between clock time and solar time.<p>For that, the NSA made up the leap second.",1423406958

I agree that programming well in language X and programming well in language Y are very similar (unless perhaps X and Y use radically different paradigms), because programming well is a skill. But there is language specific knowledge you need to pick up; it&#x27;s just relatively fast to learn and you can bridge the gap with references.",1423404807

9017265,comment,9014795,9017079,0,0,NotableAlamode,,,"OK, that is a more cogent explanation. However, it does not take into account (1) the exchange rates that the Euro countries used when they entered the Euro. I&#x27;d argue that Germany&#x27;s DM <-> Euro exchange rate was quite uncompetitive in 1 January 1999, making German products too expensive. (2) It does not take into account the symmetry of the situation: the Euro also made it impossible for Germany to use devaluation of its currency as a competitive advantage. (3) industries that need devaluation have a serious health problem anyway. (4) Germany and Greece have almost no competing industries, so the ability to do competitive devaluation does not play a role in the competition between Germany and Greece. (5) It does not take into account the distribution of power in the ECB where Germany has the same number of votes as Greece or Malta. The first two ECB presidents were French and Italian, consequently the ECB makes policies mostly in the interest of the southern members. The fact that several German ECB members and one head of state have already resigned over crazy ECB decisions speaks volumes.",1423404696

  WHen in power Germany&#x27;s chancellor Schroeder  tried to remove the current EU agricultural, only
  to be blocked by France.<p>- Russia sanctions are primarily driven by the US. Germany does brisk
  business with Russia and tried for a while to avoid sanctions. More
  imporantly Russia, via the Russian armed Ukrainian rebels is
  invading Ukraine, leading, among other things, to shooting down
  Malaysian airplanes. You are saying we should ignore this, and let
  Russia simply have its way?<p>- Sanctions against Russia are fairly recent, the structural problems
  of the Greek economy are much older.<p>Re 1) Substantially more Germans died in the last century in wars than Greeks<p>Re 2) The allies bombed German cities. As far as I&#x27;m aware Greece was
part of the Allies.<p>Re 3) You mean like the &quot;scortched earth policy&quot; of the Greek army
when they were forced out of Turkey?

As to infrastructure, Germany&#x27;s was way more destroyed. They rebuilt
it in a decade or so. Infrastructure needs continually to be
modernised anyway, as infrastructure is subject to wear and tear.
Note also that that other countries (e.g. Korea, Singapore, China)
have risen from extreme poverty to world leadership in a few decades.<p>Re 4 and 5) The war reparation have been covered by various treaties
over the decades (which were designed by the allies), and long been
settled. Speaking of war reparations, when will pay Greece reparations
for example to Turkey for the Greco-Turkish war that Greece started in
1919?<p>Re 6) German economic recovery, what you term &quot;German recovery
miracle&quot;, happened in the 1950s primarily. Guest workers started
arriving in the 1960s. Note that guest workers came voluntarily. A
more interesting question is: why do so many Greeks leave the
motherland and go to the US, the UK, Germany, Austrlia?<p>Re 7) I&#x27;m not sure what you are referring to here. Greece and Germany
hardly compete with each other.  The weakening of the Euro benefits
German and Greek exporters. But not that Germany has been trying to
avoid this weakening.<p>Re 8) I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you mean here. What does
Transparency International <a href=""http://www.transparency.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.transparency.org</a> say about
corruption in Greece?",1423404000
