I can tell you there is a very little interest in &quot;intelligent machines&quot;[1]. Rather, everyone I have ever met works on different types of problem solving techniques. What constitutes a &quot;problem&quot; and what makes a successful &quot;technique&quot; differ wildly. Taking a step back however and analysing the field as a whole you will find one commonality: almost all the research can be described as searching and sorting: i.e. stupid mathematical tricks.<p>The AI of today is not so drastically different from the AI of our academic grandfathers; what&#x27;s changed is our ability to scale up to larger and larger versions of the same searching and sorting problems. Certainly there are worrying implications in this; machines that are able to parse and sift through very large data sets present all kinds of headaches for privacy and safety but let&#x27;s not kid oursevles: there&#x27;s nothing intelligent here. Tomorrow&#x27;s AI is almost certainly going to be just a better version of today&#x27;s AI; i.e very fast and dumb as a bag of hammers.<p>[1] The exception is when researchers need to sell their wares to funding bodies and the media. It is much easier to impress upon the lay person an idea involving &quot;intelligent machines&quot; than it is to explain what we actually do.",1431060836

It&#x27;s when a  pattern of excess accumulates which builds resentment: candidates just gauging their market worth OR employers being too picky about the wrong things OR not following up to make things right.<p>How are accounting people supposed to know a reimbursement needs to happen if former candidates and/or hiring managers do not let them know?  They&#x27;re not mind readers.  Hiring managers should be clear about whom pays for what and how to recoup any out of pocket, or resentment will spread.  Also, it does show lack of professionalism on the company&#x27;s part if they do indeed seem to screw candidates, even if it were  an actual innocent oversight.  It would be titanically stupid to habitually, intentionally cheat unselected candidates in the modern world, for the ensuing exposure risks deterring good candidates at least and risks lawsuits at work.<p>Furthermore, on the candidate side of the table, it signals wisdom on behalf of a candidate if they socially-appropriately limit themselves to risks of screwed.  This is a hiring signal of value, whereas someone that hasn&#x27;t a clue is usually not respected as seriously.  (To be fair, many of the best employees in their fields can seem shy, humble and odd to most.

9509903,comment,9507085,9509607,0,0,LanceH,,,"One that helped some Java friends understand is passing blocks of code, but still having it look like just writing code.  Imagine instead of try/catch/finally, a transaction/commit/rollback in Java:<p>transaction {\n  // everything in here is in one transaction\n} commit {\n  // do stuff if the commit is successful\n} rollback {\n  // do stuff if we rollback\n}<p>All the try&#x27;s and catch&#x27;s can be stuff into the macro.  It can be made to nest transactions within transactions.<p>For all practical purposes, you can&#x27;t add that to Java.  You&#x27;ll always have to wrap up your transactions in boilerplate.<p>The Lisp equivalent of what I want, the resulting code would look like:<p>(transaction\n  (do-stuff)\n  (do-stuff-if-commit-successful)\n  (do-stuff-if-rollback))<p>There are languages where I could define three blocks of code and pass them:<p>transaction(stuff, commit-stuff, rollback-stuff)<p>But that separates their definitions from their implementations.<p>How could you write the Lisp transaction expression in another language so that it looks like it&#x27;s part of the language?  (serious question, CL is the only language I use capable of being that close)  Maybe I could torture Ruby to come close, but it would be far more difficult than the macro I had to write for Lisp.",1431057848

I&#x27;m going to wear my Pebble anyway, why would I add a Fitbit to my wrist? Cell phones didn&#x27;t put Canon and Nikon out of business, but they sure gutted their low end market. And I don&#x27;t see a Fitbit as offering a fitness tracker that&#x27;s equivalent to a DSLR. If they did, I&#x27;ll guess it would start to look a lot like a Garmin or Suunto product. Good luck going up against those folks.",1431057797

One of them was explicitly &quot;Google&#x27;s brand name will position you well for future moves in your career&quot;.  Others included &quot;You will get to work on hard technical problems&quot; and &quot;Your work will be used by millions of people.&quot;  They also explicitly said &quot;Most people do not choose to work at Google for financial gain.&quot;<p>I was very impressed by how forthright they were with both the benefits and drawbacks relative to other options.  I thought I&#x27;d stay at Google for maybe a year; I ended up there for 5+, because it was a company that worked very hard to make sure that it&#x27;s <i>actually</i> the best place to work for its employees and isn&#x27;t trying to hide better places.<p>It&#x27;s fine for a company to discriminate in who it hires and makes sure that everyone is a good culture fit.  But when you cull out people because they <i>might</i> end up leaving you for a better employer, it reeks of insecurity.  I don&#x27;t want to work with insecure people; I don&#x27;t want to work for insecure companies.  That&#x27;s fine; they don&#x27;t have to work with me, and we&#x27;re both better off.",1431057651
