And all the great stuff that was in DE:HR was already even a notch better in part 1.<p>The Detroit and Hengsha/Shanghai maps were each about 5 maps stitched together, similar to part 1 and 2. But gaming has changed since 2000, there are action roleplaying games that are huge like Elder Scrolls (Morrowind, Skyrim, etc), Gothic/Risen, Witcher, etc that have all huge maps with usually seamless worlds packed with a lot of hand placed quests and side plots. So yes, DX1 was dense and had big maps but DX 2 and later had tiny maps with even lower density plot and stuff placed in there. In DX:HR/3 there were just a handful of NPC persons wandering around each map in cities like Detroit and Shanghai. Come on in we know better with games like the above mentioned and Grand Theft Auto, Assassin Creed or Watch_Dogs. A new Deus Ex needs bigger seamless maps with more interactive items (DX3 felt very static in comparison to its predecessors).

The epoll will flag events on the signalfd based on the process where the signalfd was registered with epoll, not the process where the epoll is being used. One case where this can be surprising is if you set up a signalfd and an epoll and then fork() for the purpose of daemonizing -- now you will find that your epoll mysteriously doesn&#x27;t deliver any events for the signalfd despite the signalfd otherwise appearing to function as expected. That took me a day or two to debug.<p>Is this what libuv does? I&#x27;m pretty sure it reads signals using epoll on linux, so in theory - if it does it this way - this bug could be be underlying all of node.js.",1432010590

Of those, how many then expose low-level APIs to those languages instead of just an operating environment suitable only for scripting? At any point, do those games allow trivial fetching of new code from the network from an unspecified source, parsing and executing that code in or out of a sandbox?<p>As for &quot;goofy image formats&quot;--I&#x27;m going to be somewhat surprised if you aren&#x27;t doing a preprocessing step to normalize your textures and images into either an atlas or at least some standard format (with texture compression or whatnot). I know that across the entire space of game engines there are bajillions of formats, but again, when you&#x27;re building a custom engine for a game, I&#x27;m willing to bet that you can pick your battles in ways that browsers simply can&#x27;t.<p>The &quot;malformed XML&quot; isn&#x27;t a simple matter of just &quot;Oh, a missing closing tag!&quot;.

1) I&#x27;ve no idea if it&#x27;s appropriate to your current skill level.<p>2) Works much better with an ordinary desktop keyboard than a laptop or funky ergonomic thing.<p>3) Leave the F and J keys in their original position, so you can find home.<p>If you want to play around with this, it might be worth buying an extra external keyboard to mix up, so you have something to go back to when you need to get work done in a hurry while you&#x27;re still learning.",1432008963
