It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s a benign cyst caused by your pores not being able to do their job by being clogged with anti-persperants. If it&#x27;s a cyst and you switch to deodorant only, it could go away on it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;ve had this happen before, and it is exactly as you describe. Regardless of what deodorant you use though.. go get a second opinion.<p>Second: Don&#x27;t be scared if it is cancerous. If it is, it seems you&#x27;ve found it at such an early stage that a small surgery and some follow ups will ensure you&#x27;re fine.

You pay for those write barriers for a reason.<p>> Stack allocation (either explicit or deduced) is probably the fastest method of object allocation there is. Generational GC is on average going to be fast but can suffer horrendous worst case scenarios unless you GC is designed/engineered to switch between thread local allocation arenas.<p>I agree, but on large servers with lots of RAM, the total amount of memory that can possibly be managed on stacks is < 3% of total RAM. What do you do then? Most of the RAM will be filled with database data, with arbitrary lifetime and concurrent access for both reads or writes, because that&#x27;s precisely the kind of data that would most significantly help the program&#x27;s performance if it&#x27;s in RAM.<p>Now you can say that with all that data in RAM, the GC heap is a huge waste of RAM and the worst-case GC pause would be terrible, to which I say (I write in-memory databases in Java) that most of that data is user data and is kept off heap. Its lifetime is indeed arbitrary, but objects are deleted precisely when the user chooses to delete them, and that happens when they&#x27;re protected by a lock. The much more interesting data is the indices, for which a GC helps greatly by allowing optimistic locking and other forms of scalable concurrency, and only those are kept on the heap.",1432961923

It just hasn&#x27;t been convenient, and often only really free for the wealthy and/or those who have a lot of spare time to track it down.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s limited and controlled.<p>Want a book?  Go to your local library.  Want to see inspirational paintings/statues?  Head to your local museum!  Music?  It&#x27;s being broadcast on the radio 24/7!  Movies?  They&#x27;re also being broadcast for free on TV (you don&#x27;t even need cable!)<p>Oh, your local library/museum isn&#x27;t very local, you can&#x27;t afford a taxi and there&#x27;s insufficient public transport?  Too bad.  At least they&#x27;re free for wealthy people.<p>Saved up, spent a lot of time, went there, and they didn&#x27;t have what you were looking for?  Too bad, it&#x27;s free if you can travel to another location or wait (who knows how long) for it to arrive there.<p>That music you wanted?  It&#x27;s playing for free, but on a station that your receiver doesn&#x27;t pick up.  That movie?  It played last December.  If you wait 8 more months it&#x27;ll probably be on for free again.  But not right now, the station wants you to watch something different.<p>Free art is not new, nor is it a threat to artists.  Writers never got paid more because you had to pay cab fare to get to the library.  Actors never got paid more because you had to wait several months to see reruns of their movies.  Ancient Greek sculptors aren&#x27;t suffering just because you get to see their statue for free at the museum.<p>What&#x27;s new is that it&#x27;s much more ubiquitously and evenly accessible.  And that you are free to choose/explore anything, rather than just what someone allows you to watch/listen to/read/view.",1432961360

The 2001 Guidance explains that his or her first task would be to determine whether the OPs conduct denied a student&#x27;s ability to participate in or benefit from the program:<p><i>In assessing sexually harassing conduct, it is important for schools to recognize that two distinct issues are considered. The first issue is whether, considering the types of harassment discussed in the following section, the conduct denies or limits a student&#x27;s ability to participate in or benefit from the program based on sex.&#x27; If it does, the second issue is the nature of the school&#x27;s responsibility to address that conduct. As discussed in a following section, this issue depends in part on the identity of the harasser and the context in which the harassment occurred.</i><p>The complainant&#x27;s made a crafty argument for how the OpEd limited their educational experience, but their argument is also specifically excluded in the &quot;First Amendment&quot; section of the 2001 Guidance:<p><i>In cases of alleged harassment, the protections of the First Amendment must be considered if issues of speech or expression are involved. [112] Free speech rights apply in the classroom (e.g., classroom lectures and discussions) [113] and in all other education programs and activities of public schools (e.g., public meetings and speakers on campus; campus debates, school plays and other cultural events [114]; and student newspapers, journals, and other publications [115]). In addition, First Amendment rights apply to the speech of students and teachers. [116]<p>Title IX is intended to protect students from sex discrimination, not to regulate the content of speech. OCR recognizes that the offensiveness of a particular expression as perceived by some students, standing alone, is not a legally sufficient basis to establish a sexually hostile environment under Title IX. [117] In order to establish a violation of Title IX, the harassment must be sufficiently serious to deny or limit a student&#x27;s ability to participate in or benefit from the education program. [118]<p>Moreover, in regulating the conduct of its students and its faculty to prevent or redress discrimination prohibited by Title IX (e.g., in responding to harassment that is sufficiently serious as to create a hostile environment), a school must formulate, interpret, and apply its rules so as to protect academic freedom and free speech rights. For instance, while the First Amendment may prohibit a school from restricting the right of students to express opinions about one sex that may be considered derogatory, the school can take steps to denounce those opinions and ensure that competing views are heard. The age of the students involved and the location or forum may affect how the school can respond consistently with the First Amendment.</i><p>Unless there&#x27;s more to the complaint than the OP reveals, this should never have been investigated.<p>I would love to know if there&#x27;s been new precedent set since 2011 that would make the university&#x27;s response here seem more appropriate.

While I do think that traditional firewalling (L3/L4) has lost it&#x27;s overall efficacy there are solutions on the market that address application control, identity, A/V, IPS, spyware and malware solutions in a single solution (not UTM) and that are stream based (single pass - again not UTM).<p>Firewalls at the enterprise level are FULLY required for business to operate in a relatively secure manner today.  Controlling the applications ingress and egress is not an option - it&#x27;s a requirement.  Greg (Etherealmind) has been very well known to be, well, a bit opportunistic in his early assessments.  He mentions NSX in the East/West flows in the SDN environments, however what he fails to mention is that many customers implementing NSX have also been implementing purposebuilt firewalls in NSX via the exposed placement of security services tied to the NSX and NetX APIs (<a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/article/2169448/virtualization/vmware-spotlights-key-nsx--security-tool-for-deploying-security-software-and-services.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/article/2169448/virtualization/v...</a>).<p>Working for a security company in this space let&#x27;s refute the majority of his numbered components..<p>1) The majority of the customer verticals I deal with buying 10Gb+ firewalls buy A LOT of them.  These are environments doing millions to, literally, billions of dollars of revenue per hour.  A completely licensed, supported firewall rated at, say 20Gb can be had for under $300k and maintained annually for less.<p>2) 6.7 nanoseconds is a myth - unless you&#x27;re in financials and the HPC space.  There are so many conga line security products today, and ill conceived network architectures and a thousand other things where 6.7 nanosecond expectation is a unicorn.  We typically get to the microsecond levels and customers (even financials) are often fine with those numbers in critical environments.<p>3) Yes you can.  There are a lot of customers using NSX and OpenStack using fully supported, fully modern security solutions in production today.  I&#x27;ve been involved in said projects - the best part about those environments is it&#x27;s actually easier to deploy because it&#x27;s software and more and more platforms have fully exposed APIs and are built for automation and abstraction.<p>4) BS.  Application security?  For real?  Most of the Global 2000 are NOT software companies.  That means they&#x27;re software development is not their forte.  Which means that most will continue to have SQLi (and other trivial) problems well into the next decade.<p>5) Let&#x27;s just say for a minute that the perimeter is collapsed - which I hope that at this point it is for the majority of organizations who take network security seriously.  That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that overlays can&#x27;t have security insertion points and that there can&#x27;t be microsegmentation.  Because there already is today.<p>6, 7 and 8...  They make the least sense of any of the arguments because they are so pointed and least relevant to all scenarios.<p>Sure - fixing the endpoint and the software involved is an awesome approach to security.  But traditional firewalls never fixed that in the first place, all they controlled was access.  However today&#x27;s firewalls go well beyond that and provide much more granular application and user control as well as threat services on top to boot.<p>But I&#x27;m sorry - if firewalls provided no business value there would not be companies building and selling 10 & 100Gb firewalls for hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to protect, segment, identify and inspect - well beyond what this is lumping all &quot;firewalls&quot; into.",1432959962

Each component is isolated with restricted interactions subject to believable security arguments, static analysis, or formal verification.<p>4.

Every positive rational is essentially uniquely a product of finitely many of these values raised to integer powers.<p>That having been said, what is it that makes these particular values &quot;prime&quot;? It&#x27;s that they cannot be (nontrivially) decomposed into further factors. But in the rationals, they can be! 2 = 1.6 * 1.25, 3 = 1.6 * 1.875, etc. The inability to further factor 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., which causes us to single them out as &quot;prime&quot; in the first place, is only on an account of factorization into whole numbers excluding such rational factorizations.<p>So it&#x27;s in that context that my comment was to be understood: the fact that 6 specifically has the irreducible factorization 2 x 3 is not universally true, but only true in particular contexts, of which the most common would be the integers. In the mentioned context of the reals, or even just the rationals, we could instead note that 6 (or anything, really) could continue being divided indefinitely, thus having no particular &quot;prime factorization&quot; in the sense of a factorization which cannot be further refined.",1432959247

9628883,comment,9628682,9628682,0,0,essayist,,,"Six and a half years ago, my wife was diagnosed with cancer. I&#x27;m fairly level-headed, and there was initially all the project management of tests and doctors&#x27; visits and insurance company stuff and test results to deal with, which kept the feelings of &quot;poor her&quot;, &quot;poor us&quot; at bay. And then I remembered that her son (first marriage) had successfully dealt with HIV, other friends with cancers of various sorts, and so forth.<p>Now cancer is serious, and you&#x27;re still going through the diagnosis and test roller coaster (and it sucks), but there are lots of different ways that this can come out, and I&#x27;d agree the signs, so far, are ok to good.<p>You&#x27;re not an albatross. This is what insurance is for, precisely. And you&#x27;re not just a co-worker, you&#x27;re a friend, a human being, and you&#x27;ll give your friends and colleagues a chance to express their care and concern, to help.<p>Live a day at a time, take the diagnosis seriously, use all the skills you have to understand what you&#x27;re dealing with, and hang in there.<p>And it still sucks, and I&#x27;m so sorry.<p>PS. After a nasty but standard protocol of chemo (including a drug called -- I kid you not - 4FU, because 2FU just wouldn&#x27;t do) and radiation, she came out on the other side,  and we&#x27;ve been swing dancing, and skiing, and loving, and all that jazz, so nowadays people get lucky a lot.",1432958482
