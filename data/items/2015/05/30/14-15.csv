Not slow.   To smooth out the traffic waves, you don&#x27;t come to a halt, and neither do you rush forward.  &quot;Average speed:&quot; that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s not fast, and also it&#x27;s not slow.<p>---<p>Myth: if you have an empty gap, you must be a slow driver!!<p>Debunked:  yes, genuinely slow drivers have big gaps ahead, but those gaps are continuously growing.  If a clot of cars is going just 1/2MPH slower than average, then the gap increases rapidly: growing a half mile for each driving hour.  If that clot of cars was 5MPH slow, then in just ten minutes the gap would increase by over four thousand ft.<p>But on the other hand, a <i>constant-sized</i> gap does not decrease your speed.  Whether you&#x27;re 6&quot; from the car ahead, or 6ft, or 600ft, your gap has a constant size, and you&#x27;re moving at the same speed as traffic ahead.<p>Slow drivers do make empty gaps, but empty gaps aren&#x27;t any proof of slow driving.<p>Heh, so maniacal aggressive tailgating doesn&#x27;t actually get you to your destination any faster?  AMAZING!  Who&#x27;d have thought!",1432997996

A small company (Mandriva would be categorized as &quot;small&quot;) can cite profitability problems (not enough revenue to cover salary costs) and layoff how many employees they want.<p>There is a strict protocol to follow, such that those with the lowest seniority must be laid off first and then more senior personnel. The laid off employers unions must be notified two weeks (I think) in advance so that they can verify that the termination protocol is followed and protest if it isn&#x27;t.<p>This step is crucial, if the company makes formal errors they will be forced to pay several months extra in severance pay if the union is alerted. An example of a formal error is delivering the termination message orally and not in writing with a date and signatures.<p>Then there is a severance period of 1-3 months based on the age of the employee. I think 1 month for < 35 years of age, 2 months for 35 - 45 and 3 months for > 45.

They&#x27;re perhaps the single most heavily regulated financial company in existence. They operate in more countries [1] than almost any other, and each of those countries regulates them in some way. In some of those countries they are a licensed and regulated bank (including the European Union [2]). In the US, they are overseen by 54 separate governments, including every state and territory, all of which license and regulate money transmitters [3]. They <i>wanted</i> to be a bank in the US to get the FDIC insurance on deposits (they originally believed themselves to be eligible and advertised it as a feature), but a federal agency 13 years ago decided they don&#x27;t qualify as one.<p>On the flip side of the same coin, why do you think being regulated like a bank would change how any of these situations play out? Most banks offer merchant account services for accepting credit cards online. Every merchant account agreement I&#x27;ve read has allowed for termination without cause, freezing of funds for up to 180 days without recourse, and establishment of reserve accounts or holds at the bank&#x27;s whim. These real banks won&#x27;t hesitate to terminate your account and hold your funds if you try to use them as an unsecured loan against future promises you&#x27;ve made to thousands of people, either -- if you&#x27;re up-front about the fact that you&#x27;re taking credit cards for crowdfunding you&#x27;d not make it past underwriting and get an account in the first place. No regulator steps in and stops banks when they hold a merchant&#x27;s funds. PayPal operates no differently because it is, at its heart, a tech stack on top of those very same merchant accounts from actual banks with the same policies and same tolerance for risk.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide</a><p>2: <a href=""http://tamebay.com/2007/05/paypal-becomes-a-bank-no-longer-under-fsa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamebay.com/2007/05/paypal-becomes-a-bank-no-longer-u...</a><p>3: <a href=""https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/licenses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/licenses</a>",1432996118

It doesn&#x27;t make the code harder to read, IMHO.<p>Whitespace between a function name and the arguments <i>is</i> significant, however, because with a function-like macro, there must be <i>no</i> whitespace between the name and the opening parenthesis. I&#x27;ve seen the following code in production code, for example:<p><pre><code>  #include <stdlib.h>\n  #define free(x) free(x), x = NULL\n\n  free(ptr1); // Macro\n  free (ptr2); // Call free(3) directly\n</code></pre>\n(Whether or not such a macro is good idea is a different question entirely, the point is that you can prevent such macro-expansion by using whitespace. Aesthetically, I find it very disturbing, though.)",1432995537

Smoothing the waves can eliminate immense rush-hour delays, if this eliminates panic-braking that can cause minor daily accidents.  Or as they say, &quot;speed differentials are dangerous.&quot;   In I-70 Colorado they claim that police pace-cars used to smooth out the fluctuations have cut the accident rate in half.<p>In theory the waves can represent a bottleneck, since the close-packed regions are low-flow, but the wide empty regions are also low-flow.   If the smoothed wave results in traffic flowing at 35-40MPH, then smoothing will increase the flow, since the peak flow rate takes place at 35-40 MPH.   But the increase isn&#x27;t enormous.  I think they said ~15%.   That&#x27;s nothing, when compared to the effects of removing an accident scene from a rush-hour commute.<p>You can play with those online JAVA simulators:  set up unstable conditions on the ring-road, watch the initial flow, then after traffic-waves develop, watch the flow again.   If enormous waves appear, the flow drops by ~25%, but if a string of small waves appear, the decrease is less than 10%.",1432995219
