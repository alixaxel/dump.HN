In the past 40+ years there have been few if any major advances in the scientific process that have seen wide adoption, despite the innumerable problems that have come to light. And not only have there been no major improvements, but things have actually gotten significantly worse thanks to the corporatization and gamification of academia, the increasing use of proprietary technologies and source code, etc.",1432994232

A student has the power to complain about the professor to the dean/chair and give him/her a bad evaluation. If a student alleges sexual harassment or assault the professor&#x27;s career could be destroyed even if the charges are not proven.

9630056,comment,9627260,9628603,0,0,rwallace,,,"> prefer static typing<p>That&#x27;s all very well, until you look at a few Java programs in the million line range, and it turns out the source code for most of them also includes a million lines of XML, and the reason for that is Java&#x27;s type system doesn&#x27;t really match the problem domain, so people resort to XML basically as a way around the type system. And if you&#x27;re going to be effectively writing a large chunk of your program in XML, you&#x27;d be better off using something like JavaScript or Python that is actually designed to be a dynamic programming language.<p>Now you could make the counterargument that this is because Java&#x27;s type system isn&#x27;t very good and if you used a language like Haskell with a better type system you&#x27;d have better results. Maybe, but then the objective isn&#x27;t so much &#x27;use a static type system&#x27; as &#x27;make Haskell palatable to a decent percentage of programmers&#x27;. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible to do that, just that it&#x27;s a different challenge and needs to be understood for what it is.",1432991429

Nobody ever knew where it was and it had been installed 13 years before. The floor was on a UPS and generator so the power had never been disconnected.<p>It was happily chugging away, running our shitty phone system, and hadn&#x27;t been restarted in 10+ years.<p>Edit: This also happened to me at a utility company I worked at. We had a server that ran some critical calculations for us but nobody could recall where it was physically located. It&#x27;s way worse now that everything&#x27;s virtualized - the cruft just sits there for years until you suddenly run out of resources and start looking closely.",1432991036

And of course really good/big merchants (Amazon etc) have already great deals with banks/credit card networks directly and fraud detection systems in place.<p>So you endup in a situation where Paypal basically screws small merchants every single time. I had an account frozen before with business nearly going out of business thanks to Paypal, it is unnerving trying to get in contact with support technicians who speak English and are not robots reading from a sheet and having to PROVE THAT YOU ARE NOT GUILTY of whatever paypal thing you are guilty of, and of course they rarely tell you why money is being held ransom.<p>There are alternatives, here in Europe SEPA (and various either bank transfer methods such as Ideal) which makes Paypal redundant. Prepaid solutions such as paysafecard are good too (but high fees of circa 10%).
And of course there is Bitcoin buy I better not talk about that on HN out of fear of being instantly down-voted by people who do not realize that outside the US there are very little payment options online or who do not understand bitcoin (which is strange for a nerd site) as can be seen from various past threads regurgitating same cons (its almost as if there is a coordinated effort one would think...).",1432991018

Indexing and ranking algorithms can only do so much.<p>The interesting question is that does Google own the click through data or does the user? Does Google exclusively own the fact that you clicked on the 4th link in Google leading to php.net when you searched for &#x27;php&#x27;?<p>Or can the user or government get this data to alternate search engines for better competition just like they forced Microsoft to open up Office file formats and SMB protocol docs to their rivals?<p>If you remember the big deal about the optional Bing bar in IE uploading the search term and clicked URL in Google search results to Bing it looks like many people on here think Google exclusively owns the clickstream data, and it&#x27;s not the users&#x27; to do what it wants.<p>This is the reason that a paid search engine won&#x27;t  do very well, just like a paid social network wouldn&#x27;t, because both rely on a lot of people using it to seed it and a paywall will hurt.",1432991007
