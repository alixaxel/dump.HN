You can afford to stop the pipeline when you get an item whose format doesn&#x27;t match, and investigate, rather than having to tolerate a certain error percentage. You don&#x27;t need a scheduling framework because if you ever have too many jobs running you can kill a few, you&#x27;re not going to lose hours of work by doing so.

It&#x27;s clear that the NSA et al are above the law and unconcerned with your rights, so until that is fixed, it&#x27;s too easy to fall into a &quot;grey&quot; area where they have an excuse to monitor your traffic. Fundamentally this is an approach that tries to make it so the NSA <i>won&#x27;t</i> surveil your traffic, which places an unearned amount of trust in the NSA. I think a better approach makes it so that they <i>can&#x27;t</i> surveil your traffic--and for this there are only technical solutions.<p>Part of this is making sure that the NSA can&#x27;t spy on <i>who</i> you are talking to, and every solution I know of to that bouncing traffic across multiple servers.

Granted, evolutionary dead ends in technology can be very lucrative (look at Cobol, or Java). They aren&#x27;t exciting, but there&#x27;s money in them. That said, the aesthetic compromises made to appeal to the Java community, scaled out over years or decades, tend to make things bloated and hard to use. I don&#x27;t see people being excited to do Hadoop, or wanting to learn it on their own time. It&#x27;s much more interesting to learn the fundamentals of distributed systems than to learn a specific set of Java classes.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m finding myself increasingly burned out on &quot;frameworks&quot; that appeal to out-of-touch corporate decision-makers (who are attracted to the idea of a packaged &quot;product&quot; that solves everything) but tend to be overfeatured while under-delivering (especially if time to learn how to use the framework properly is included) when it counts.

9583436,comment,9580547,9582901,0,0,btilly,,,"You are thinking about traffic in terms of cars per foot.  The right way to think about it is in terms of cars passing a spot per second.<p>A lot of traffic problems stem from the fact that you get <i>more</i> cars per second from quickly moving smooth traffic than from slowly moving dense traffic.  Therefore if something bad happens to rapid smooth traffic, you quickly get a phase transition into horrible traffic.<p>Now what does the transition from horrible traffic back to good traffic look like?  The first step is that you have to get back to smooth traffic, and then that has to speed up.<p>If nobody smooths out traffic deliberately, then you don&#x27;t get this until the volume of people wanting to pass gets so light that all of the stop spots &quot;evaporate&quot; on their own because there is no pressure on them.  Then the road speeds up.  By contrast if traffic has been smoothed, the bottom speed steadily increases, and you get back to full speed much earlier.<p>Plus smoothing traffic will save on your own car&#x27;s wear and tear.<p>Oh, and on merging?

And they aren&#x27;t doing anything towards enhancing their understanding of debt.<p>For example, lots of people will go into debt to go on international trips. We structure our travel on our credit card and pay it off right away because it pays us to fly again! But most people don&#x27;t have that system in place, they run up the credit card debt and then take 6 months to pay it off. I just plain hate the idea of paying for something today that I used up yesterday.<p>And I don&#x27;t think the emotional impact can be overlooked. Even if you can make an argument to me that it would be &quot;smart&quot; to carry a transient purchase as debt (and I know you&#x27;re not going to try to, I&#x27;m just making a hypothetical), I&#x27;d still feel bad about it, and that bad feeling is going to have a real impact on my quality of life.<p>Before I was finally out of debt, I paid off my student loans before I paid off my car (when I had a car) because even though the APR was higher on the car, I could pay off the student loans sooner. It&#x27;s a snowballing effect. It felt like an accomplishment and it helped me maintain my frugality.<p>Telling someone with $30k in credit card debt (I know several people like this, it&#x27;s not that uncommon these days) that they shouldn&#x27;t run a balance on their credit cards isn&#x27;t helping them. You&#x27;ve not told them anything they don&#x27;t already know.<p>But maybe they don&#x27;t already know that they don&#x27;t have to have a big house. That&#x27;s the intention of my story, to try to jolt people out of their half-waking state. People aren&#x27;t perfectly rational beings and it&#x27;s probably stupid to expect them to be so. But there are simple rules of thumb that I think people can take to heart that will improve their overall outcome much better than telling them &quot;you need to consider and be careful with the debt&quot;. People work much better with all-or-nothing measures, rather than measures that rely on subtlety and restraint.<p>It&#x27;s probably why no-carb diets work out better than calorie counting. It&#x27;s not because carbs are particularly unhealthy, it&#x27;s that people can&#x27;t constrain themselves to the small portions necessary to count calories while eating complex carbohydrates. I know I can&#x27;t. So what makes more sense? To repeatedly fail at exercising restraint? Or to succeed at a slightly less efficient plan?<p>Even taking on a mortgage is most of the time a bad call for most people. They live in the house for 5 to 10 years, then move before they get even close to realizing the potential of the property. Then, instead of getting a similar-sized place, they get something larger, something that fits inside their paycheck. Even if they sold their previous house for a net profit, they just roll that over into the new house. The net effect is that they are constantly renting from the bank.<p>That only makes sense if the mortgage costs less than rent for a similar place. If it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s smarter to rent a place and sink the difference into a fund for buying a place when it does make sense to buy. But most people aren&#x27;t going to keep track of their finances like that.",1432222596

It&#x27;s obvious the author is referring to the &quot;mindfulness&quot; version though and is trying to do so in simple-as-possible guide form so as not to distract with all the depth and nuance you allude to. I think most people get that there are many different types of meditation. I appreciate the article&#x27;s simplicity because when I was a once a beginner all I seemed to be able to find was less than simple school-specific (Zen, Shambala, etc) instruction.  The problem with the school-specific teachings, IMHO, is that they are all mindfullness-oriented, yet each adds their own special ritual and ceremony which as a beginner you mistake as being essential. At least for me, I&#x27;ve converged on an intentionally Occam&#x27;s razor style approach aimed at stripping the non-essential. The coolest thing about Bhudda&#x27;s story to me is he just sort of figured it all out for himself and said each of us should do the same.  I&#x27;ve figured out for myself, for example, that it is not necessary at all to sit cross-legged.  It makes no difference for me yet standard teachings always strongly encourage it to the point that you feel like you are &quot;doing it wrong&quot; if you don&#x27;t.  Teachers will even say, &quot;if you can&#x27;t sit cross-legged it&#x27;s ok...&quot; but when everybody in the group is doing otherwise, the overwhelming signal is it is actually not ok.<p>I guess one thing I&#x27;m saying is the kind of folks drawn to try meditation are often the same kind of folks who will willingly dive down rabbit holes investigating the differences between the schools and entertaining themselves with koans, etc. all the while distracting themselves from actually getting started with the meditation itself. Can confirm; was one of these people.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d caution against trying to raise awareness of all this complexity to the beginners this guide is intended for.",1432222238

At a high level, one issue is that the capacitance and inductance present in copper limit the ability of discrete pulses to remain discrete voltage levels that still are distinguishable between logical high and logical low when modulated at a very high frequency due to the capacitance of the wire which effectively blurs the pulses together as they propagate. The other fundamental issue with electronic interconnects is the issue of shot noise, which for information theoretic reasons can further limit the theoretical maximum bandwidth logical high/low voltages in copper. Photonics does not have these limitations, but as you say, is still a very long way off from practical application.

There is a saying, you should be at least slightly embarrassed by your version 1.  Can&#x27;t remember who said it, but man it so works, it also is a great motivator to improve.<p>I personally don&#x27;t believe in stealth mode without some very special circumstances, and this wouldn&#x27;t be one of them.  The times I would say stealth is good is for serial founders that have credibility to raise money privately and keep the wraps on something until it launches.  And even then, they likely have some large clients committed already and are already on a solid path.<p>So my 2 cents, don&#x27;t quit your day job.  Launch the site, get some traction, get feedback, don&#x27;t hide it, promote promote promote.  Once you have some traction and have people talking a little about it, then you can start to think about a pitch deck and trying to raise money (if that is your goal).  Although there is &quot;easy&quot; money as some say, it isn&#x27;t that easy really, you still have to have fundamentals in place or have a track record proving you can do it.  If you get a little traction though, it isn&#x27;t unrealistic to have a small group or a high net worth person provide you some seed capital to try and accelerate the pace.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t go the raise money route initially, I&#x27;d first start off trying to make money with the platform.  Bootstrap it, see what happens.  The go big or go home attitude isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong, but the majority of businesses are not launched or founded that way.  They start small and build up.  Nothings stops those businesses from being as large as a VC backed business (though money does equal velocity), and you can always attract money at a later date, usually under more favorable terms.",1432220682
