Be able to say why it was interesting to you, and how you overcame challenges with it.<p>If you feel week in the areas you mention (api design, class design, etc), then pick up a book and start reading away.<p>The GoF design patterns also comes up in interviews a fair amount... not saying it should, but it does.",1430629194

On the other hand, you could also download the nightly branch of Rust to be able to use all of the unstable features.<p>I think the nature of the 1.0 release and the train model is not very easy to communicate: the Rust team hopes to commit strongly to semver, so &quot;stable Rust&quot; is only that which they are comfortable committing to providing backwards compatibility for indefinitely. It&#x27;s really pretty fine to be on the nightly track if you don&#x27;t mind occasionally having to change a method call or something when an unstable API you use change.<p>Not trying to dismiss what you&#x27;ve said - I just think that the strength with which you expressed it (&quot;Rust is still barely usable&quot;) was not accurate & that if you ask in the IRC channel or users.rust-lang.org, there is likely a no-or-little-hassle workaround for whatever feature you wanted.",1430629077

Yes, it would be better if there were at least something like 50/50 local to state funding for gov&#x27;t services.  However, the transient aspect of some of the residents don&#x27;t allow the community building which helps other neighborhoods with more stable residents.  however, we do have the example of poor immigrant communities (even African) which because of the tight cohesion, can overcome the funding issue.  It takes energy and cooperation and dedication.  To be sure, this exists in poor white areas too --again, they suffer from lack of &#x27;community&#x27; and cooperation. And I wish local government would step in and intervene instead of just having the police deal with the symptoms --it&#x27;s the quick fix, the bandage.  Teach people and support their efforts to build their neighborhoods, give them opportunities to advance and join in on the rest of society rather than keep them at the periphery.  Instill the importance of education.  Make education &quot;cool&quot;, not something to look down upon.<p>I grew up in a mixed neighborhood with UMC, middle class and poor kids.  Poor kids had a pernicious tendency to want to avoid learning and actually made fun and put down kids who attempted to get serious about studying.  It was a kind of bullying.

I routinely got kernel panics from three or four different causes, poor wifi connectivity, etc....<p>A number of commenters are saying good things about 10.8 - I&#x27;ve been on 10.8.5 for several months - and, for the first time in a couple years, I actually have to deliberately power cycle My MBAir to put in Security Patches; 10.8.5 is just that stable.

The random freezes (with the exception of the Notification Tray Bug, which Apple hasn&#x27;t bothered to fix, but they have somehow reduced) are almost completely gone.

Why can&#x27;t they slow down their tempo, and release a new operating system every other year, but actually release a quality operating system, the way they release quality hardware?<p>Marco is absolutely right in <a href=""http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-g...</a> - Apple is seemingly taking pride in releasing shoddy software on a rapid pace, which is the antithesis of what you would think they would want to do to maintain their &quot;quality&quot; brand.<p>Another problem with Apple - is that the operating system that I would like to put my friends and family on, 10.8.5, is hard to do.

But just because something happens in a university doesn&#x27;t make it the optimal way to conduct an interview.<p>I honestly think you&#x27;re sort of dodging the question here, maybe not intentionally.<p>> I&#x27;m at a loss as to why it&#x27;s not good enough for software.<p>Probably because you can say anything you want to impress people, which means that as an interviewer you can&#x27;t really trust anything they say and must probe them very deeply about any work they&#x27;ve claimed to have done. At that point it&#x27;s already a sort of technical interview.<p>We actually use a mix of this. We don&#x27;t require a formal presentation but one of the interviews involves having the candidate discuss past work in detail.<p>We definitely would not feel comfortable eliminating coding interviews on the basis of that one interview alone. In the past, we&#x27;ve hired some people on the basis of things like this, ignoring poor results on the technical screen, and those have been our worst hires.<p>> No one is going to take a surgeon with 10 years of experience and force him to do an operation for an interview.<p>Well, a surgeon&#x27;s literal every move is being observed during every single operation. And to get to that point, the surgeon was basically subjected to excruciatingly rigorous daily oral examinations for 5-7 years during residency.<p>> they&#x27;re predictive power is terrible.<p>Honestly, we haven&#x27;t had many issues with it, so I don&#x27;t know that I could agree it&#x27;s terrible.<p>Actually, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating here, every single one of our worst hires has come from giving somebody the benefit of the doubt when they didn&#x27;t do well in the technical interviews.<p>---<p>At the end of the day, I agree with you wholeheartedly that we need to find a way to improve the interview process. I just don&#x27;t think the current process is that terrible, especially when you get away from large, lumbering places like Google and look at smaller, more forward-thinking companies. Google has absolutely zero ability to adjust to specific candidates.<p>I understand your frustration with being experienced and still being subjected to technical interviews on BFS or whatever. It&#x27;s annoying and sometimes even insulting, and in the worst case it demands that you go spend an inordinate amount of free time brushing up on interview material that never actually shows up in the real world. So I&#x27;m very much with you on the inadequacies of the current procedure; I just don&#x27;t think it needs a drastic alteration.<p>I think replacing whiteboards with actual computers, algorithmic brainteasers with real-world problems, and extreme timeboxes with more open-ended formats are the main changes that are needed. Just let someone sit at a computer and write a program to do something fairly common. And don&#x27;t stare them down while they do it. I really, honestly do not think this is that unfair or crazy.<p>It seems a lot simpler than and just as effective as doing a pair programming event where you have to make sure that both people have not seen the particular task before, which basically means the interview will have to be completely customized for each candidate. And that&#x27;s not necessarily a good thing -- it means it&#x27;s pretty hard now to compare two different candidates.",1430626149

For example: if you&#x27;re from the US, you still know the name of the first president of the United States.<p>You probably have even more information from childhood stored in implicit memory. If you&#x27;re like most people, you learned how to ride a bike, tie your shoes, understand language, and play catch. The memories of learning these things are separate from the memories needed to actually do them.<p>Erasing <i>all</i> of a person&#x27;s memories would truly destroy them. Once they formed new memories, they would be as different from their original self as an identical twin separated at birth.",1430625729

English has no declension (a simplification of a grammar).

The word order is very flexible and it is always clear who bites whom. This is a major difference in a language.",1430625711

9479822,comment,9479513,9479513,0,0,wsxcde,,,"What are the other assumptions in this hypothetical scenario? Does C# exist? Does Scala exist? Does F# exist? You could argue that none of these would exist if Java didn&#x27;t.<p>What might we have instead? C/C++ of course, Python/Perl/Ruby and friends too. QBASIC is older than Java and Visual Basic was just a cleaned up QBASIC, so we&#x27;d have that. Borland&#x27;s Pascal-derivative Delphi was a decent language; maybe that would&#x27;ve done better without Java.<p>Would Haskell and the MLs have done better? Perhaps, because at the time it came around Java was quite a productive language. Or maybe I should say, it <i>was</i> a nice language before everybody and their uncle discovered the design patterns book and started implementing AbstractFactoryInterpreterEventLists willy-nilly. Without Java, I think it&#x27;s plausible that the design pattern craze - a lot of which is just attempting to shoehorn functional programming into an OO language - would never have happened. And people might&#x27;ve discovered <i>actual</i> functional programming earlier and the state of the art might&#x27;ve been closer to F# than C#. So back to the original question, in this scenario, Java wouldn&#x27;t make it, because honestly, although Java is a decent language but F# and friends are way better.",1430625626

Interpreting the results, and picking the coding problem, are not easy tasks.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve certainly found myself in the position described by the story, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve never actually needed to find a job in my career (new opportunities have always come from people who already know me and my track record). You may (though I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it) get fewer bad &quot;hire&quot; decisions by doing a code interview like the one in the article, but you also get bad &quot;no-hire&quot; decisions.
