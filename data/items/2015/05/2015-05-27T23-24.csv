While yes, the actual events were very limited (I only got to go to a medal ceremony, for example), the whole city was <i>alive</i>. There were massive TVs all over the city, showing the games. There were celebration zones, with live streams during the days and big-name concerts and fireworks at night. There were the country and province pavilions, showcasing the best of Canada and the world. There were things to do literally all over the city for this two week period. And all this was completely free of charge, with access by anyone. The absolute best part was the excitement of it all. People across the country were united in their love for Canada, the streets were filled with people at all times, cheering on the athletes. It was an incredible sight.<p>So yes, while the actual events were hard to get to, there was more than enough for everyone to do, and it was, as OP put it, a massive party.

Hola never takes up valuable resources from these users, since it only uses a user as a proxy if that users&#x27; device is completely idle (meaning device is connected to electric power (not on battery), no mouse or keyboard activity is detected, and device is connected to the local network or Wifi (not on cellular)). This makes Hola the first VPN service without underlying operational costs. Although Hola doesn�t need to pay for bandwidth, we still need to pay the engineers who create, maintain and keep improving the free Hola service. Hola generates revenue by selling a commercial version of the Hola VPN service to businesses (through our Luminati brand). This is what allows us to keep Hola free for our users. Users who want to enjoy the Hola network without contributing their idle resources can do so by joining the Hola premium service for $5 per month (or $45 per year).&quot;",1432771062

The massive enterprise known as the Vatican only serves to promote a set of superstitions and delusions that have infected human brains for centuries.  That place needs to be shut down.  They need to return all the money they&#x27;ve stolen from the poor and the place needs to be turned into a museum of primitive thinking.<p>With regards to ridiculing them.  Tolerance is a delicate thing.<p>What if you had a million people still believing and promoting the &quot;fact&quot; that blood-letting and human sacrifice were necessary in order to cure disease and promote good crops?  And what if they pointed to a set of words chiseled out on some stones as being the command from their god to engage in human sacrifice?  And they demanded legal protection from our government?  And, of course, tax exemption?  And, of course, to be able to teach this to your kids and my kids in school?  And every politician had to swear that they believed in this horse-shit because they need those million votes?<p>What do you do then?  Do you embrace and tolerate them?  Or to you fight them at every corner, even ridicule them, in order to eradicate their influence form society?<p>Should a politician who says her or she believes in this shit be allowed to hold office?  Should a President swear on the chiseled tablets as a sign of entering into a covenant with the people?  Should a whole nation proclaim to be under the protection of these gods who want human sacrifice?<p>No, of course not.  And if you tolerate them. If we accept them.  If we allow them to even for a microsecond sit at the same table with scientists we fail to evolve as humans.<p>You have to laugh at them in order to shift them into an uncomfortable position where they&#x27;ll have to really question what they are saying.  Why don&#x27;t we, as adults, say we believe in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus?  Nobody has proven they don&#x27;t exist?  In fact, you can&#x27;t prove they don&#x27;t exist.  Yet anyone would be laughed out of a room if they proclaimed these kinds of beliefs.  And that would be the right reaction.<p>No, this is nonsense.  It isn&#x27;t the 1,500&#x27;s any more.  A creationist and their horse-shit have no place anywhere near scientific facts, schools and certainly nowhere related to an online search of the Theory of Evolution.  To allow such a thing is a disservice to humanity.<p>This needs to stop.  Let&#x27;s stop pretending it is OK to believe in flying horsemen, talking snakes, singing bushes, parting seas, getting help from a god on a test while on the other side of town a little kid is dead from cancer, etc., etc., etc.<p>I am not a militant atheist but I am really getting tired of the bullshit.  The constant barrage of nonsense being placed on a level plane with science isn&#x27;t sitting well with me.  None of this nonsense deserves any respect at all.  None of it.  They get rich of the poor and our governments give them special standing.  That&#x27;s irrational.  Absolutely irrational.<p>Nearly everyone on this planet today owes their lives to science.  Yet we don&#x27;t ridicule morons in funny hats who believe in singing bushes and supernatural beings.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem:  Politicians like to talk about economic disparity.  They do not talk about the real long term problem of intellectual disparity.  Fast forward to 100 years from now.  If things don&#x27;t change we will have a situation where there will be a huge gap between those educated in the sciences and those left in the dark through supernatural beliefs and the lack of education.<p>I know ignorant religious people who home-school their kids and teach them such nonsense as the earth being 5,000 years old.  They are so far behind already that they might as well be cave men with iPhones.  It&#x27;s sad, really.  They live their lives justifying everything that happens through divine intervention and intent.  They are absolutely and totally ignorant in the context of modern scientific knowledge and completely closed to learning or considering anything new.  For all they know the earth might as well be flat.  I can see a future where it won&#x27;t be rich vs. poor but ignorant religious vs. scientifically literate.  This disparity will cause cataclysmic clashes.  I mean, just take a look at some of these tribes in the middle east.  They ARE cave-men with iPhones.<p>No, you have to laugh and ridicule them.  In 2015 these ideologies do not deserve any respect whatsoever.  None.<p>Harsh?  Probably.<p>I have done this to people BTW.  In some cases they&#x27;ve cussed me out and in a some they have engaged me in conversation.  No, I am not an ass about it.  I simply smile and politely ask something like &quot;You don&#x27;t really believe that stuff, do you?&quot;.  Have I convinced anyone?  Don&#x27;t know, but I did make them think.  One of my favorite questions is:  &quot;Do you really believe in a singing bush?&quot;  and it goes from there.",1432770887

Such weapons have been proposed, but they&#x27;re not especially effective anyway, and that&#x27;s not how modern experimental military lasers are designed to work.<p>Weapons lasers are designed to focus as much power as possible into as small an area as possible in order to cause physical damage at the point of impact- blasting a hole in the thing, setting it on fire, etc. Heating the bulk of the target is a mere side-effect.<p>In that regime, anything less than 100% reflectivity is essentially pointless. Sure, it&#x27;ll delay penetration, but  not by any significant amount. Within a very tiny fraction of a second, the part of the laser energy that you do absorb in the target spot will be enough to destroy the reflective coating, and bring the full beam energy to bear. Unless your projectiles are expected to have flight times measured in milliseconds, the delay provided by a special low-absorption coating is utterly useless.<p>If you can prevent the enemy from dwelling on a particular spot, then things look much better. If you can  screw up their targeting quickly enough, maybe you can actually prevent damage to the reflective coating after all. Even if you can&#x27;t, maybe you can keep the laser occupied with constantly eating through fresh areas of reflective armor, never absorbing the beam&#x27;s full power. But at that point, it&#x27;s not the low-absorption coating that&#x27;s saving you- it&#x27;s your ability to screw up their targeting.",1432770770
9615208,comment,9614463,9614961,0,0,andyjdavis,,,">There are people who commute for an hour, and who select a place to live knowing they&#x27;ll have to commute for an hour, despite having options within 5-10 minutes. I can&#x27;t even begin to fathom why someone would do that, and waste 10 hours of their life every week for years.<p>I am from Perth, Australia and people voluntarily driving for upwards of 30 minutes each way is extremely common with 1 hour not being all that unusual so people will happily buy a home that is distant from where they work.<p>Although Perth isn&#x27;t huge in terms of population (~2 million) it is extremely spread out due to its very low population density. 310/km2 Vs 5354/km2 for London for example. Australian cities generally have a low density, Melbourne is 430/km2, but Perth is at the low end of the low end.<p>Most Perth people have never lived anywhere else so they grow up assuming that being in the car for 20-40 minutes to get anywhere is common and that a 1 hour drive to work isn&#x27;t particularly bad. At a company I worked at there was someone who had a 2 hour commute. That is very definitely at the very high end and he actually lived outside of the city and drove in every day but let that sink in a little. 4 hours a day in the car.<p>This is, in my opinion, part of the reason why Perth people who experience living elsewhere rarely return to live in Perth. Some return after some time elsewhere but typically they leave for good after another year or two. Once you have acclimatized to having a <20 minute commute, especially if its by public transport or walking, the notion of paying a bunch of money to buy a car so you can sit in traffic for 20-60 minute each way every day is profoundly unattractive.",1432770748
9615207,comment,9613554,9615096,0,0,mikekchar,,,"At one time I was in a physics program at university until I discovered that I couldn&#x27;t understand physics.  I changed to computer science ;-).  My experience, though, was that most people I talked to had only a cursory understanding of actual physics.  What they <i>really</i> understood was the math.<p>Like I said, I sucked pretty badly at physics but my impression is that people tend to jump back and forth between imagining the physics, modelling it in math, making predictions based on the math, imagining again what the physics would look like, ad infinitum.  So for complex problems, I don&#x27;t think anyone has a whole physics problem in their head at once and are reasoning about it at that level.  They just have pieces and use the math as a way of swapping parts of the problem in and out of their head (if that makes any sense).<p>I think that&#x27;s one of the biggest problems with popular descriptions of physics.  It doesn&#x27;t make any sense without the math, but average people don&#x27;t have the math background.  So the descriptions make absolutely no sense.  Often you get people who are interested in the physics (but without training) imagining all sorts of crazy things because they have built their understanding on these kinds of nonsense descriptions.<p>It&#x27;s been this way for quite a long time.  Newton had use new mathematical techniques (calculus) to understand things like the force of gravity.  Even if you go back to Archimedes, I wonder how much of his reasoning about density was based on modelling it with math and how much was based on intuition about the physical universe.",1432770716

Naturally the LILO config entry for Windows had the wrong partition number or something I don&#x27;t remember, and Windows wouldn&#x27;t start anymore.<p>Mandrake on the other hand had a jolly half-installed X11 windows system which failed to bootstrap itself, leaving me with a nice command line prompt (a good learning experience to say the least.) I think I screwed around with `vi` before my dad called in his friend who worked in software. (Said software friend tried editing LILO config before realizing Mandrake would start in read-only-mode by default (chrooting was something quite alien he didn&#x27;t work with Linux anyway)), and so he proceeded to use the default partition editor on an MS-DOS floppy disk. Lo and behold said partition editor only works with disks that are 32 GB or smaller. Ours was 40 GB. Partition table borked.<p>We eventually got it all back. Good experience.

Pretty horrible things happened in the name of communism and socialism and early tribal societies.<p>Just like how many horrible things have happened in capitalism. I&#x27;m not ignoring these things. Don&#x27;t put words in my mouth. I&#x27;m presenting a reasonable explanation as to why there is wealth inequality in colleges: It&#x27;s a feature of capitalism not exclusive to colleges. Let me make it more clear. I said the solution to this problem was either to switch to communism which only works in theory (and has been shown in most instances to be bad in practice) OR regress back to tribal like culture which is the only type of culture that has been show to have a relatively flat organizational structure in practice. Do either of these solutions sound appealing? No, They don&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s my point. There&#x27;s no clear answer to this, capitalism is the best thing we&#x27;ve got right now but it is not perfect.<p>>I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s special about capitalism that causes pyramids (if anything, it seems more decentralized than a lot of other options). Pyramids seem more like a feature of large groups of people.<p>This is not true. In nature when you look at early hunter-gatherers or tribes you see relatively flat structures with maybe one leader and everyone else being more or less equal.  It is like this because one human can only hold so much power over another. You can think of this in terms of playground politics; can one child dictate the fate and actions of all the other children consistently? You can have leaders in playgrounds but these leaders can&#x27;t tell all the children to start marching single file like the way leaders in north korea do it.<p>It is only at the dawn of civilization (or capitalism) do you see pyramid structures start to form. People in this age begin gaining huge, almost obscene amounts of unnatural power as lords, kings, queens and emperors and can command hundreds and thousands of people to build insane projects like great walls and huge pyramids.<p>How can one man hold so much power? Wealth. Once man gains the ability to save wealth you will get people who manage to store up obscene amounts of it and people who own a paltry amount. Now the rich man can pay the desperate poor man to do his bidding. In fact the rich man can employ thousands of poor people to do his bidding, but he&#x27;ll probably need to employ managers to handle the load. What does that organizational structure look like to you? A pyramid. Wealth, money and capitalism leads directly to pyramids.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t say that pyramids are a feature of capitalism. Pyramids are a feature of wealth inequality. Wealth inequality, in turn, is a feature of capitalism.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I think capitalism is all bad. Excessive wealth leads to the ability to efficiently command human capital to build boeing 747s, the subway systems and other projects that benefit society as a whole. Being rich also leads to a huge amount of leisure time that allows people to stop foraging for food and develop hobbies like math, chemistry and science... therefore indirectly leading to the modern technological civilization as we know it today.<p>Make no mistake, society as we know it is built on capitalism, but this does not justify wealth inequality.

I&#x27;m the cofounder of online therapy company iCouch and the number 1 problem I hear about among therapists: getting and retaining clients. Primary care doctors don&#x27;t have that problem. It isn&#x27;t because of lack of funding, at least not in the United States because nearly all health insurance plans cover some number of yearly visits to a mental health practitioner. The problem is that there is a certain percentage of the therapy/mental health profession that engages in unscientific quackery which diminishes the perceived value of the other percentage of professionals who practice science-based mental health care. There are licensed practitioners who are often little more than faith healers; there aren&#x27;t actually any standards of care for mental health. Of course there are license requirements, but there isn&#x27;t really an &quot;FDA approved&quot; method of therapy to treat depression; so there gets to be a lot of problems with clients actually NOT benefitting from a particular therapist.<p>It&#x27;s pretty much certain that if you went to a licensed family doctor with a sore throat that you&#x27;d get treatment that would likely cure the sore throat. If it were a bacterial infection (i.e. Strep,) then you&#x27;d be prescribed an appropriate anti-biotic. If it were viral, there&#x27;s be treatment for the symptoms and in a few days, the problem would be cured. If you went to a licensed therapist for anxiety treatment, there&#x27;s a likelihood that they&#x27;d attempt whatever &quot;method&quot; they&#x27;ve &quot;developed&quot; to &quot;treat&quot; the problem yet without any accountability in terms of if their approach actually is based on the scientific literature or it is was just based on some applied wishful thinking. It&#x27;s also interesting that you&#x27;ll have psychoanalysts spending YEARS with a client while a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist (CBT) often gets measurable results in a few sessions. Obviously every person is different, but how can a payer (insurance) justify spending years paying a psychoanalysts when CBT works (especially for things like anxiety disorders) [1].<p>I have psychoanalysts violently disagreeing about CBT effectiveness, but then again, if they admitted to the evidence supporting CBT for anxiety, then they&#x27;d cause a substantial problem with their own credibility and desire for a client to see them every week for years (such as in your typical Woody Allen film.)<p>The point is that there needs to be treatment protocols that are standardized within mental health (especially in the non-Psychiatric side of things.) Without standardized protocols, a client could be &quot;depressed&quot; as long as a therapist can convince them that they&#x27;re still depressed.<p>That&#x27;s a dark side of this business. I&#x27;m deep in this business with iCouch -- I&#x27;ve seen this stuff up close for over 5 years; in fact it was one of the reasons we started the company, was to try and bring some improvements to the field.

If you include .c files in .c files it will end up causing a lot of problems and start making includes order dependent (like how your code will break if you move #include &quot;structures.c&quot; down a few lines).<p>Generally you want a header file for each source file and put the stuff you want to share with other files in there (prototypes, typedefs, etc). For example, disk_utility.h would have prototypes for save_to_disk and read_from_disk and then instead of including disk_utility.c in your replay.c file you&#x27;d include disk_utility.h.<p>Without compiling the code I see a lot of things that are, at least, warnings.

UTF-16 did not exist until Unicode 2.0, which was the version of the standard that introduced surrogate code points. UCS-2 was the 16-bit encoding that predated it, and UTF-16 was designed as a replacement for UCS-2 in order to handle supplementary characters properly.<p>> <i>UTF-8 was similarly redefined to be ill-formed if it contains surrogate byte sequences.</i><p>Not really true either. UTF-8 became part of the Unicode standard with Unicode 2.0, and so incorporated surrogate code point handling. UTF-8 was originally created in 1992, long before Unicode 2.0, and at the time was based on UCS. I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s relevant to talk about UTF-8 prior to its inclusion in the Unicode standard, but even then, encoding the code point range D800-DFFF was not allowed, for the same reason it was actually not allowed in UCS-2, which is that this code point range was unallocated (it was in fact part of the Special Zone, which I am unable to find an actual definition for in the scanned dead-tree Unicode 1.0 book, but I haven&#x27;t read it cover-to-cover). The distinction is that it was not considered &quot;ill-formed&quot; to encode those code points, and so it was perfectly legal to receive UCS-2 that encoded those values, process it, and re-transmit it (as it&#x27;s legal to process and retransmit text streams that represent characters unknown to the process; the assumption is the process that originally encoded them understood the characters). So technically yes, UTF-8 changed from its original definition based on UCS to one that explicitly considered encoding D800-DFFF as ill-formed, but UTF-8 as it has existed in the Unicode Standard has always considered it ill-formed.<p>> <i>Unicode text was restricted to not contain any surrogate code point. (This was presumably deemed simpler that only restricting pairs.)</i><p>This is a bit of an odd parenthetical. Regardless of encoding, it&#x27;s never legal to emit a text stream that contains surrogate code points, as these points have been explicitly reserved for the use of UTF-16. The UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings explicitly consider attempts to encode these code points as ill-formed, but there&#x27;s no reason to ever allow it in the first place as it&#x27;s a violation of the Unicode conformance rules to do so. Because there is no process that can possibly have encoded those code points in the first place while conforming to the Unicode standard, there is no reason for any process to attempt to interpret those code points when consuming a Unicode encoding. Allowing them would just be a potential security hazard (which is the same rationale for treating non-shortest-form UTF-8 encodings as ill-formed). It has nothing to do with simplicity.",1432768480

But, having moved on and seen C#, Ruby/Rails, Objective-C, etc. Seeing how differently APIs have been implemented I have an appreciation for the creativity possible in API design.<p>But, there seems to be a balance, is the API of a single class copyrightable? No, probably not. Is the API of a large system like Java&#x27;s copyrightable, I really do think so.<p>Having said that, I disagree with the protections an API suddenly gains once we say I have a monopoly on its use and license. E.g. This verdict likely just made every emulator an act of copyright infringement. Does intel own the API on the x86 instruction API and can lock out AMD?",1432767640
