Then, in order for the legislation to pass, it has to be approved by the European Parliament (which is directly elected) and the European Council (representatives of the national governments).<p>What has happened here is the European Commission have scrapped legislation that was working its way through its internal mechanisms, before it was formally proposed and handed off to the Parliament.<p>The Commission holds enormous power, and has traditionally has been an apolitical civil service, but recently there has been a movement towards its leader being elected by the Parliament. But this has only happened a handful of times, and the President of the Commission has never been removed from his position by the Parliament. I&#x27;m not even sure if such a procedure exists.",1432551592

I use vagrant for all development now, so I thought that meant I could use Windows.   I tried setting up an environment that used MobaXterm, a newer version of git, rsync, vagrant, VirtualBox and Emacs.   That wasn&#x27;t much to ask, I thought -- every other Unix tool I needed could run inside the vagrant boxes.  However, I just couldn&#x27;t get everything to work together after days of fiddling.

9599472,comment,9596496,9598753,0,0,graycat,,,"While I don&#x27;t know the latest research
results on the question of P versus NP,
it&#x27;s long been easy to guess that
a <i>polynomial</i> algorithm with a high
degree polynomial, say, your million,
would on most real problem instances
be as much of a challenge as an <i>exponential</i>
algorithm.<p>But my post was not really about
your<p>&quot;way of proving P = NP&quot;.<p>Instead I was considering the statement
in the video that showing P = NP is 
important because it would let us
make progress on protein folding (for
curing cancer), scheduling, etc.
I object to that statement because
for a significant fraction of such
problem instances, including some
impressively large, we have a 
significantly good chance of getting
solutions now and do not have to
wait for more research on P versus NP.<p>My point, then, was, if someone has
some actual problems in protein folding,
scheduling, and other NP-complete 
problems, likely they do not have to
wait for an algorithm that shows
P = NP.  Instead there&#x27;s a significant
chance that current algorithms, software,
and computers can solve their problem
instances.<p>Again, NP-complete problems of size n clearly
are too challenging for &quot;current computers&quot;
for exact solutions to <i>worst case</i>
problems with large n.  Here note the <i>worst case</i>.
Instead, and as I illustrated, there
are instances of NP-complete problems,
e.g., 0-1 integer linear programming,
where it is quite routine to find
optimal solutions to real problem
instances with impressively large n.<p>Important names for such work include
G. Nemhauser, E. Johnson, R. Bixby.
That is, the field of operations
research has been attacking and solving
important, practical instances of 
problems in NP-complete for several
decades.<p>Again, if there are some important instances
of some NP-complete problems, then
don&#x27;t have to wait for P = NP and, instead,
should 
bring the problems forward now -- solutions
may be reasonably easy to find now.<p>That is, where the video clip was
essentially 
claiming that to solve problems
in protein folding, scheduling, etc.,
we have to wait for a proof showing
P = NP was wrong -- for optimal solutions to
worst case
instances of large
problems, we have to wait, but not
all practical instances are worst case,
and sometimes we are quite happy with
nearly optimal solutions.",1432551161

Ever since that time, I found that naming things is a big hindrance to evolving code from an experiment to a solution.

9599404,comment,9598527,9598527,0,0,astrobe_,,,"I first realized how hard is naming when I programmed in Forth. Amusingly, Forth is sort of a point-free type of language - everything happens on the stacks and there&#x27;s no such thing as local variables, so a good chunk of the &#x27;naming problem&#x27; goes away - but trying to squeeze a functionality in one or two lines can be difficult. The reason for this constrain is that I programmed mainly with a &quot;block editor&quot;, a limited kind of editor that only 16 lines of 64 characters at a time. This wasn&#x27;t an artificial constrain because I was working on a fully self-hosted hobby system, which had no file support (the [floppy] disk space was presented as a series of 1K blocks = 2 sectors = 80x16 bytes) and &quot;block editors&quot; are the easiest thing to implement in this case.<p>Despite the point-free nature of Forth, there&#x27;s still the problem of naming functions (&quot;words&quot; in Forth lingo) and global variables. Programming in Forth is an interesting exercise because you quickly see the relationship between how you factor your code and how you name your &quot;words&quot;. You discover by yourself many of the rules in the slides. But I find this is really the case when one uses the 64x16 block editor I mentioned.  Using standard files and editors removes a lot of the constrains, but they also allow more sloppy coding (which may be a good thing if you have something better to do; e.g. you just need to write a throwaway script to get the job done).<p>In my experience you can spend a lot of time (re)factoring and (re)naming things. Sometimes it&#x27;s valuable because e.g. it helps you understanding the problem, and sometimes you are just bikeshedding yourself.",1432549627

I didn&#x27;t expect this from Apple, but it actually does look good with the Windows font renderer here (Firefox, so I assume DirectWrite), down to at least 9px. The hinting could perhaps be better on a few letters but I expected none care taken whatsoever. Of course, this could be a lucky accident, not sure if Apple did this intentionally. The thin weights seem OK as well, something else that can not always be expected. Looks decent for general use unless Apple prevents that by licensing.<p>I never liked Helvetica Neue in user interfaces so I&#x27;m happy to soon (hopefully) see it gone from iOS.<p>Edit: OK, so it&#x27;s only to be used by either Apple or Apple apps.",1432548708

9599332,comment,9598261,9598613,0,0,gonvaled,,,"That is one way of seeing it.<p>Here is another way: global period of prosperity in which a world superpower has (momentarily?) solved the problem of maintaining its supremacy (mainly economic, but also military and political) by leeching the rest of the world using various mechanisms: dollar as reserve country, military occupation of resource rich countries - sometimes by tacit alliances with repressive regimes - international intellectual property agreements skewed to favor the home economy, rigged international financial markets ...<p>Which is fine, but here is the problem: it is not that America has chosen the &quot;peace-americana&quot;, it is that the &quot;peace-americana&quot; is working in its favor. As soon as it does not work anymore, the US will very willingly fight other major powers, in a race to the bottom.<p>All this, of course, discounting the fact that during the &quot;peace-americana&quot; the US has killed millions of people (most of whom are innocent bystanders), while at the same time suffering the loss of a couple of thousand people. Every person killed is a big loss, and that means the millions of people killed are a very big loss, even if you do not care.<p>So, what is the grudge we in the rest of the world have with the US? Speaking for myself, just the fact that you are not using the chance that this period of prosperity is giving the world to engage in a permanent and objective international state of affairs, which is not just a way for you to control us and maintain your supremacy.<p>You are just a bully, which is to be expected: everybody would do exactly the same thing in your situation. Just don&#x27;t try to sell it as something that it is not.<p>And let me tell you one more thing: even if it is in your short-term interest to act as you are doing, long-term it is just stupid. Instead of fostering collaboration you are creating enemies (Russia, China, some parts of south america, now even Europe); in the long run, your supremacy will be eroded and you will fall, like all empires fall. The question is if another empire will come, or an international cosmopolitan establishment will be created to regulate the relations among people on Earth (hopefully not country-based anymore). You could have lead this path, but my impression (based on the status of the world and particularly the US economy, as related to the upcoming powers) is that that chance has already passed.",1432548007
