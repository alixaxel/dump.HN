9481096,comment,9477747,9480588,0,0,glenweyl,,,"For a long time I thought this too.  But then Ken Arrow started working on QV and while he agrees that in spirit QV gets around the theorem, it does not to the letter.  The reason is that there can be multiple equilibria given income effects if you had a whole society governed by QV.  All equilibria would be pareto-efficient and any pareto-efficient outcome could be implemented by QV, just as in the market economy, but in the market economy as well there may be multiple equilibria with income effects.  This has little impact in a small vote in the short-term, but in the long-term taking everything into account, prices changing can impact effective budgets and lead to multiple equilibria.  As soon as there are multiple equilibria effectively the system is not transitive because different equilibria are simultaneously preferred and dispreffered by the social ranking to one another.  
But this does not stop us thinking that the market is a good system because of its efficiency properties.  So I think Arrow&#x27;s theorem has been misunderstood.",1430657722

This is much fairer, because the uniformed group will typically be easily swayed by advertising and manipulation to vote the other way, making groups with more uniformed people easily undermined even if there are some members that are informed and who could speak for this group&#x27;s interests.  This is a major problem in American politics: the poor often favor less redistribution than the rich do (again see Gillens)!

Regular people use the browser auto-translate now and are quite comfortable with it.<p>Even bigger question: will you be harming the auto-translators if you don&#x27;t make your site available in English?<p>Automatic translators are quite decent at the hundreds of English<->Rare-Languages combinations, but much worse at the thousands of Rare-Language<->Rare-Language combinations.

If you know them all, that tells me you have to hand an arsenal of techniques to bring to bear on a problem, and you care enough to have done considerable outside reading and preparation.  That&#x27;s a good sign.<p>Secondly, if there&#x27;s a problem you&#x27;ve not met before, what do you do?  Do you freeze?  Do you go thoughtful?  Do you ask questions to clarify?  Do you look to step around the problem?  Are you sufficiently confident in yourself to simply get to work, or are you worried that your inability will be seen as an excuse not to hire you?<p>Thirdly, as you start to work on it, what&#x27;s your intuition like?  What techniques do you bring to bear?  Do you assume there&#x27;s one, right, trick answer, or do you treat this as a challenge to be played with?<p>Finally, how do you react to contributions from others?  Do you welcome working together and relish discovering stuff, or do you want to work alone, seeing how you get on?<p>All of these have positive and negative aspects when weighed against a given possible job.  What I&#x27;m looking for is that balance between someone who brings new skills and knowledge to the team, and the ability to work with the team, and to have enough in common to be able to communicate effectively.  Some people love puzzles, some hate them.  Some are great at theoretical analyses, some aren&#x27;t.  Some people can devise or adapt algorithms, and some can&#x27;t.  A good team needs a balance, and asking these sorts of questions of people is part of finding out their strengths and weaknesses, to see how they&#x27;ll fit in a team.<p>Do you want my advice?<p>Work on your abilities.  Be professional in your personal development in whatever area you are interested in, as well as other related areas.  Read widely, work on projects, work with people, and expose yourself to technologies outside your comfort zone.  When faced with puzzles and problems like these, be yourself.  Ask what&#x27;s expected, and work with your interviewer in a professional manner - an interview should be a dialogue.  At the end of the interview ask yourself - do I want to work with these people?<p>If they don&#x27;t hire you for who you are and what you bring to the table then you would likely not be a good fit, and would likely not enjoy your work and/or the environment.  If they offer you the position, you&#x27;ve learned a bit about what they are like to work with, so you are in a position to decide if you want the job.<p>But this is not an ideal world, so you will need to decide what compromises you&#x27;re willing to make.",1430657037

You can read the results in details for the general guarantees, but a few observations about the scenario you describe.  First, doubling group size at worst increases by a factor of the square root of two the number of votes you can buy with the same amount of money.  To double the votes you buy you would have to increase aggregate expenditures by the square root of two as well.  Second, I disagree that these coalitions would be stable.  If you gave someone $35 million, why wouldn&#x27;t they just keep the full $35 million?  Under 1p1v there is no incentive to cheat on the coalition...you get to keep your money regardless.  Under QV there is a huge incentive to cheat on the coalition and it could be made even larger by giving bounties for ratting out to the police, which has been extremely effective in antitrust in breaking cartels.  In fact the situation is extremely analogous to antitrust.  Cartels do harm market performance, but I think few of us would, as a result of them, prefer rationing over markets.",1430656834

Malignancy detected at more advanced stages is unlikely to be more treatable than that detected through the usual course of events. Using an upper limit of normal of 2.5 μg/L, Fletcher (19) calculated that CEA has a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 87% in screening for Dukes’ A and B colorectal cancer. These findings, combined with the low prevalence of this malignancy in unselected populations, render the positive predictive value of CEA unacceptably low and thus of little value in screening healthy subjects. For the present, therefore, we must rely on fecal occult blood and endoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer (20).<p>What does 36% sensitivity and 87% specificity mean? Imagine that you test ten thousand 40-year olds and twenty-five of them do actually have colon cancer (this is more or less consistent with statistics telling that 0.23 of them will be diagnosed with colon cancer before turning 50). You will get a true positive result in 9 cases (out of 25) and a false positive in 1297 (out of 9975).

They have very few actual pages on their site, and they don&#x27;t change depending on who is making the request. If I request the site over HTTPS, anybody that is sniffing my traffic will know that I&#x27;m visiting that domain and thus can request the content themselves. The encryption here is not providing anything.<p>If you are sending/receiving personalized data, e.g. logins, search requests, etc., then you should be encrypting the requests. You would still be encrypting huge amounts of data for no reason, the CSS and static images used on the site are not being transmitted with or based on any personalized data, so any sniffer will already know that these resources would have been downloaded by you anyway (and I don&#x27;t care if an attacker sees the CSS of a page I&#x27;m looking at anyway).<p>Requesting these static resources over plain HTTP, but authenticated via hashes or signatures, doesn&#x27;t provide an attacker with any information they wouldn&#x27;t already have.<p>> No, I do not.

There are real-world problems that need solving before this can be made a reality. Just disabling non-TLS connections does not cut it.<p>I totally agree with this. However I think I come to a different conclusion.<p>TLS is usable precisely because of its insecurity that we have to trust so many CAs. The key problem with any encryption architecture is key distribution, more often than not the more secure the key distribution the less usable the end product is. Its (relatively) easy to get a TLS certificate for your domain that everyone else will trust, but precisely because its so easy makes TLS very vulnerable to malicious certificates.<p>For the most part TLS is fine, it offers a certain level of security, but is still vulnerable. I&#x27;m happy to rely on TLS when browsing google search, online shopping etc, however I&#x27;m not particularly comfortable with using it for online banking, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t trust it for secure person-person communication.<p>So instead of trying to fix TLS, I think we should have more choice for the different levels of security I desire:
 1. No personalised data is being transmitted either way => I only need to authenticate the remote content, not encrypt it.
 2. Personalized, but not particularly confidential information being transmitted, e.g. google search, shopping, logins for sites where its not the end of the world if they get stolen => TLS, there&#x27;s a chance stuff will get intercepted, but it is convenient.
 3. Highly confidential information is being transmitted => Some other protocol or cert distribution mechanism, e.g. for online banking I might only trust a certificate given to me directly by my bank IRL.",1430655730

Probably they can handle the complexities of a voting budget that compensates the losers too.<p>But for a broader electorate that doesn&#x27;t excel in performing stochastic optimisation problems, doesn&#x27;t have good intelligence to help them vote tactically, doesn&#x27;t know what future votes might be, the quadratic nature of the voting system doesn&#x27;t deal with the problem of budgeted and secret voting being a game of iterated prisoners&#x27; dilemma; it might even intensify the problems.<p>It&#x27;s not too difficult to devise a scenario in which it actually makes the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; problem worse: a minority of bigots wish very strongly to enact a law against a minority of regular targets. The disinterested majority wishes to avoid diluting their future voting power by participating, whilst the victimised minority wishes to hold back some of their voting power to avoid being disenfranchised when faced with conceivable future bullying initiatives[1]. In a secret ballot, the bigots can conceivably win if the groups are a similar size (even if they can subsequently reverse the decision)<p>[1]This is mitigated if the losers get their own votes back as compensation, but actually worsened if they get higher compensation, in which case optimum strategy in a iterated electoral battle is to win by the <i>narrowest possible margin</i>, whilst voting for something incredibly unpopular is a practical way to increase your future influence.",1430655573
