I don&#x27;t waste money on stupid stuff (and especially, I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> waste money on stupid stuff when I was younger).  I&#x27;ve never had cable.  I didn&#x27;t spend tons of money eating out or partying, back in my 20s when that was the thing to do.  I drove a crappy used car for over a decade.  Back when I rented, I rented a crappy old apartment without dedicated parking spaces; when I bought a place, I bought a crappy little place.<p>Meanwhile, I had a colleague earning more than me, who literally had no savings, nothing more than a few $20 bills in his pocket, and I&#x27;ve known plenty more young people in straits nearly as bad.  Sure, they drive nice cars, eat at fancy places and drink fancy drinks, live in swank apartments nicer than what you&#x27;d see on TV, wear nice clothes and nicer colognes, and so on and so forth—but they have no savings, or almost no savings!<p>You <i>can</i> trim your lifestyle, and you <i>can</i> save 20% of what you make.

Why the hell would a grocery store need a license and what for? I&#x27;m not asking for &quot;because the government says so&quot;, because the government says a lot of things that don&#x27;t actually make sense. Is there a good, <i>objective</i> reason for all businesses to have to be licensed and how would the license help?<p>> <i>Taxi licensing is special because of their special circumstance.</i><p>What does that mean? What are the special circumstances? It&#x27;s just people with cars and people who need to go places.<p>> <i>(a) &#x27;forget&#x27; about picking up people of a certain skin color</i><p>Suppose there was no regulation for taxis. Now suppose a big taxi company had emerged. Let&#x27;s call it &quot;Toober&quot;. Now Toober, just like most companies, wants to make as much money as possible.<p>Do you think people accusing its drivers of racism would be conducive to that goal, and if not, do you think Toober would do something about racist drivers?<p>What about the drivers? They want money too, right? So if there was a racist driver working for Toober, and he knew Toober doesn&#x27;t tolerate racism because it&#x27;s bad for their image and thus, bottom line, don&#x27;t you think the driver would refrain from behaving in a racist way so that he could keep his job?<p>> <i>(b) refuse fare to a certain district they don&#x27;t like</i><p>Don&#x27;t <i>like</i>? Because it somehow displeases them like Justin Bieber&#x27;s music displeases a lot of guys? What sense would it make for a taxi to leave money on the table because he finds a district distasteful?<p>> <i>(c) arbitrarily set fares depending on what they see as people&#x27;s willingness to pay--like say setting the fare for single women outside nightclubs to 3x the normal rate.</i><p>Again, imagine Toober getting complaints about discrimination. On the other hand, getting home safely from a night out is a more valuable service than just getting from Place A to B in less dangerous situation, so maybe it&#x27;s alright to charge a bit more.<p>Sure, three times the normal rate would be too much, but another taxi company would be free to offer a better rate, and people would take it.<p>Do you see why regulation is not necessary at all? Whenever the government says it&#x27;s doing something for your safety or for fairness, you can be 100% sure the results and real reasons are different.<p>The <i>real</i> reason why we have taxi regulations is to maintain a state-supported taxi-cartel.",1432352627

Rents, when fully occupied (not always the case, we see about a 5% vacancy rate) are $700 a month over all expenses, including debt service.<p>Plus, we put close to 20% down but get 100% of the depreciation.  End of the year: $7000 in our pockets, a legal tax loss of $800.  And that is assuming no change in value of the asset.

It lends itself well to translating into formal proofs, and it is a great testing bed for ideas.  Haskell has a certain beauty to it that sets it apart from other languages.  There is no perfect programming language, and Haskell has its weak points.  However, I find that it is great for prototyping and reference designs.  I can take advantage of its clarity and strong type system to build simulators for protocols, algorithms, services, and even operating systems.  I can then use these simulators as integration testbeds for building solid components in lower level languages.  Haskell also makes a great language for compiler writing and text processing.<p>I think that the language fills an important niche.

My wife and I are slowly accumulating properties that cash flow - They produce more in income than they require in expenses and debt service.<p>Likewise arbitrage in paper assets and commodities is another way to structure gains - Having your money work for you, also called investing, in the more traditional sense of the word.  I am currently studying Stock Options as a method for investing with insurance (hedging) and doing so with some leverage (buying a stock=1 to 1 - Buying an option is a ratio, like 1.50 to 100, depends on the option).<p>The biggest rewards come from starting a business that can be grown to be so successful that it gets to IPO stage (financial exit), or is able to continue without the founders, if they so choose (royalty/profit distributions).  That is the frequent path of the majority of contributors to HN, based on my reading.<p>But all of it requires significant knowledge, the equivalent of another job.

Let&#x27;s assume that the Supreme Court decides not to take the appeal, so the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that APIs are copyrightable stands.<p>What courts is this precedent for?<p>Generally, the way precedent works is that if appeals from court X go to court Y, then the decisions of court Y are precedent for court X. If court Z is not on the appeals path from X, then the decisions of court Z are not binding precedent for X.<p>For copyright cases, appeals normally do NOT go to the CAFC. They go the Courts of Appeal for the circuit in which the court appealed from resides. E.g., copyright cases from district courts in the 2nd Circuit go to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.<p>In general, that is the appeals path from the Federal district court. Copyright cases aren&#x27;t specifically singled out.<p>Oracle vs. Google was tried in the 9th Circuit. If it has just been a copyright case, the appeal would have went to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, it was also a patent case, and patent cases are singled out. They are explicitly diverted from the normal appeals path and go to the CAFC. If the case is also some other kind of case, such as a copyright case or an antitrust case, the CAFC is allowed to hear those aspects too.<p>So does this mean that if P sues D in the 9th circuit over copyright, with no patent issues or any other issues that would bring the appeal to the CAFC, then the district court would only use the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for precedent (which I believe disagrees with CAFC), and ignore CAFC&#x27;s Google vs. Oracle copyright ruling?<p>Even more confusing, suppose P sues D over copyright and patents in the 9th Circuit. The district court figures that the case, if appealed, will go to the CAFC, and so follows CAFC precedent for the copyright aspects. Now suppose after the court rules, neither party appeals the court&#x27;s decisions on any of the patent issues. The only appeal copyright issues. Does the case still go to CAFC? Or does it go the 9th Circuit? If it goes to the 9th Circuit, do they apply their own copyright precedent or CAFC precedent?",1432350607

9591850,comment,9591139,9591240,0,0,kaolinite,,,"Really? Honestly, I feel sorry for Google in a way. Apple was fashionably late to market, as they often are, and yet the mainstream press continues to ignore Google Wear and treat Apple Watch as if it came first. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re paying for a lot of this but Apple Watch is the first smart watch I&#x27;ve seen on the covers of fashion magazines, in articles on watch blogs and on the wrists of celebrities.<p>That said, I can&#x27;t say I blame them. The Apple Watch got so much stuff right and was so fantastically well designed (not just in terms of aesthetics but in terms of how it works). It isn&#x27;t just better than other watches in its price range, the build quality matches Swiss watches in the sub-$3000 range. The link bracelet, for example, is considerably better than some extremely high end watches.<p>I listened recently to a watch podcast where Ariel Adams of aBlogToWatch - a very popular watch enthusiast website - spoke about how he has trouble taking his Apple Watch off and that his traditional mechanical watch doesn&#x27;t have quite the same feel now. If Apple is convincing watch enthusiasts to wear it, they&#x27;re doing well. He also compared it to a Ressence watch (~$15,000) and said that, whilst the Ressence is different in many ways, the build quality and smoothness of the case was very close. This is significant and the Swiss low-end should definitely be worried. Version 1 of a product and they&#x27;re doing better than many traditional brands.<p>One of the reasons I feel that Apple Watch has been embraced by watch enthusiasts (although many still dislike it, it has been a much warmer greeting than I would have assumed) is that the Watch is so clearly horologically influenced, with things like calling the widgets on the dial &quot;complications&quot;, or the way the back of the watch has information about its materials and manufacture (&quot;316L Stainless Steel - Sapphire Crystal - 38mm case&quot;, etc - you wouldn&#x27;t see that on an iPhone). Apple clearly understands watches, and so they should: the team behind the watch are prolific collectors. Ive has worked with Jaeger LeCoultre, Phil Schiller is often seen wearing a Patek Philippe Nautilus (which, coincidentally, seems to have influenced the hands of the watch faces). Marc Newson co-founded Ikepod, a high end Swiss watch company, and the influences from Ikepod are clear. Bob Mansfield is known for his love of watches too, although I&#x27;m not sure what his preference is. This watch was made for regular people, of course, but it will also be worn by Apple execs. And they clearly made something that they knew could replace their Pateks.<p>Finally, you mention app support - all indications seem to show that Apple Watch is seeing more attention from major/important app developers. Luckily, now that the smart watch category has been validated, Android Wear should pick up too.<p>Let me also address your final points regarding specs of phones. Comparing the iPhone based on specs is missing the forest for the trees. The specs of an iPhone don&#x27;t matter, this isn&#x27;t a PC. What matters is how well it runs, how smooth scrolling is, whether there is lag, how good the camera is in low light, etc. There will always be Android phones with better specs in particular areas, but the iPhone is an overall great phone and that&#x27;s all that matters. Even if the iPhone had triple the specs of the best Android phone, would you get it? You don&#x27;t need to worry about specs and stats. (Also, your point about OS upgrades is flat out wrong - Android is well known to stop updating sooner).<p>Please don&#x27;t claim that down votes are due to &quot;fanboyism&quot;. It&#x27;s insulting. Whilst I disagree with some of your points, I&#x27;m not going to imply you&#x27;re basically a mad fan: I assume you have reasoning behind your thoughts, even if I don&#x27;t agree with it.<p>If you haven&#x27;t read the Hodinkee Apple Watch review, I recommend it: <a href=""http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review</a>",1432350413

I also ran Linux when the kernel was pre .2 etc (Redhat 1.0 was the first commercially linux product I remember.) I think I remember getting Redhat Linux on 10 floppy disks.<p>I was lucky enough to live in a geographic area where there were a few universities, and my father had access that allowed me accounts on several Unix workstations.<p>Again thanks for sharing this, this was a really nice read.",1432350164

I know what you mean about complex hierachies, but inheritence is a very, very dangerous tool; you either take the time to review the results, or you suffer the consequences.  That&#x27;s where the review by senior developers comes in.  You learn or you don&#x27;t.  Who would want to work with devs who don&#x27;t?",1432350103

The really good stuff in cities, those who know about it, we keep it a secret.<p>Edit: what I meant by this comment was to emphasize a key distinction between country bbq and city bbq that was neglected by the article: country bbq is by definition distant from the large bbq-loving population. So there may be equally good city bbq joints, but there are a number of (individual) parties in whose interest it is to keep them secret.",1432350039
