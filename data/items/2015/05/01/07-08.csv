9470063,comment,9466883,9468259,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> My favorite was a visiting professor from MGU (Moscow State University) teaching 5th graders how to translate Babylonian Cuneiform, including how to infer meaning of writing that no spoken reference exists for<p>I&#x27;m curious about that second point. Do you mean the same kind of vocabulary acquisition that people do in their own language all the time? (For example, a kid reading a book might learn some previously-unknown words that way, and everyone picks up spoken vocabulary by hearing it in use -- granted, picking up spoken vocabulary definitely doesn&#x27;t meet the standard of &quot;no spoken reference exists&quot;, but learning a word by its use in writing does meet that standard and is the same linguistic phenomenon.)<p>Do you mean translating a document in a foreign language without any idea how that writing system was pronounced? I&#x27;m not aware of <i>any</i> writings for which the following are both true:<p>1. We can understand the writing.<p>2. We don&#x27;t have any reference for what the pronunciation would have been.<p>Cuneiform was used to write several different languages, most prominently Akkadian, which is a Semitic language closely related to Arabic and Hebrew. That helped in translating it. I don&#x27;t know the language-family status of Sumerian, but it&#x27;s written the same way, which is obviously helpful in pronouncing it. There are some rarer languages also written in cuneiform; for them we have decent information on their pronunciation, but we still don&#x27;t really understand documents in those languages.<p>Old Chinese was written in a script carrying <i>no</i> phonetic information, and its original pronunciation is a major problem today. But it left us rime tables, and there are lots of spoken references in its many modern descendants. So for example, we&#x27;re pretty confident that 京, the second syllable of beijing/peking, originates as a velar (&quot;k&quot;) sound, and the palatal (&quot;j&quot;) sound of modern mandarin is an innovation.<p>Ancient Egyptian held off translators for a long time, until someone realized it could be translated by reference to Coptic, for which phonetic information was preserved. Our phonetic understanding of Egyptian hieorglyphs is good enough that we&#x27;ve translated the names of foreign countries as written down in ancient inscriptions.<p>Anyway, if that professor was talking about something in this second category, I&#x27;d love to hear more about it.",1430467086

9470041,comment,9469175,9469866,0,0,asiekierka,,,">Java was definitely one of the reasons the original Minecraft was bad though. It (along with bad architecture) was the reason behind the massive server footprint and why hosting minecraft servers is extremely expensive and completely unscalable.<p>No. It wasn&#x27;t Java.<p>The reasons are many, but here&#x27;s some: All world logic happens in a single thread (fixed in Minecraft 1.8, now there&#x27;s a thread per world). Entity lookups are very badly coded (mitigated, but not fixed by CoFHCore which explicitly excludes dropped items from the lookups). There are many bad coding decisions made throughout Minecraft (a nice amount of them is fixed by FastCraft, which optimizes Minecraft and reduces its RAM usage by ~300MB; OptiFine used to be good for the GPU but 1.7/1.8 integrated most of its fixes). Every neighboring block/tile entity access loads that neighboring chunk, then marks it as unused, then unloads it every 30 seconds (not a huge issue in MC itself unless you use a lot of pistons, but a massive issue for modded servers)<p>Etc, etc, etc. It is possible to scale Minecraft, however nowadays it is not possible to scale Minecraft without mods and at least a basic knowledge of how the engine works.<p>There was an experimental mod made by nallar in 2013 which dynamically ASM-patched Minecraft and every mod to make all world logic fully threaded in multiple worker threads, as well as a separate thread for chat; however, that was really hard to maintain in practice, especially as mods grew more and more complex.<p>A commonly used method is to run multiple instances of Minecraft servers and use a proxy glue server like BungeeCord to treat them as separate world on one server.",1430466542

9469997,comment,9469316,9469786,0,0,miratrix,,,"On the grid tied solar inverter front - the spec sheet says the battery voltage is 350~450 V, so we&#x27;re looking at 108 lithium ion cells (25 x 18650 cells?) at 400 VDC nominal.  This is quite different from typical lead acid battery pack voltage of 12, 24, or 48VDC that&#x27;s used for battery backup storage, so a lot of existing solar battery storage infrastructure may not even work...  this means that people may need to buy a whole new set of supporting hardware to integrate this into the existing solar systems instead of being able to update the software on existing hardware.<p>Lithium Ion also has quite a different (and much less forgiving!) charging cycle that requires much more monitoring of things like temperature, though I&#x27;d imagine a lot of that would be built-in as a safety mechanism directly into the Powerwall.<p>What I&#x27;ve heard is that National Electrical Code becomes much more stringent on battery systems greater than 48V, with the line drawn at 48V due to it being used widely in the phone landline system.

If you wan&#x27;t something like the index in Mercurial you have to specify which files you want to commit, or which to exclude, which IMHO is a lot more tedious and error prone. Then again I haven&#x27;t used Hg in a couple of years, could be they have something like the index now.<p>Rebase is a hack? Rebase copies a series of commits on top of an immutable history at a certain point in time. This allows you to deal with merges a single conflict at a time, instead of dealing with all the conflicts at once with a merge. It also allows you to avoid cluttering your history with useless merge-commits when just syncing with another repo.<p>Merges have their place. I use them whenever I merge branches, using --no-ff so I can attach a &quot;Fixes issue #77&quot; in the merge commit message. Of course, before I do that, I sync the branch I&#x27;m merging into, then rebase on top of that (to have a clean merge). I might also rebase --interactive to clean up the commits of my branch, so that the history is as easy to read as possible.<p>Comparing rebase to rollback is wrong. Git has rollback (or revert) as well, and it&#x27;s used for other usecases, like when reverting changes on a public branch (where rebase would fuck it up for everyone).<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but your comments make it sound like you don&#x27;t really understand Git.",1430465221

9469939,comment,9469201,9469348,0,0,eatmyshorts,,,"The production of wind and solar energy for the consumer is quickly approaching (or, depending on your tax regime, has already passed) the cost of traditional energy from the grid.  This is great, and we&#x27;re starting to see wind and solar become major forms of energy production.  The problem with both forms of energy is that the energy generally is not generated when it is consumed, so it must be stored.<p>The problem with storing electricity is it is expensive.  The cost of this lithium-based solution finally is cost-competitive with lead-acid.  Basically, when the Tesla&#x27;s Gigafactory is completed (their battery factory, being built near Reno, and expected to be finished in 2017) means that Tesla will be the lowest-cost provider of lithium batteries.  Unfortunately, the size of the factory also means that they will have enormous excess capacity.  Unless that capacity is utilized, their costs will eat away at their revenues.<p>This is their answer to this situation:  they have excess battery capacity, and costs that are about 1/2 that of their nearest competitor, and there is a growing need for energy storage.<p>The real target of this announcement, if you ask me, is ERCOT, the regulatory body governing the Texas power grid.  In general, Texas has enough power generation capacity for average load days.  Unfortunately, they are running out of power plants for peak power days.  Traditionally, these were natural gas-fired generators, while &quot;normal&quot; load was handled by hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear (because natural gas used to be more expensive than the others, and also because natural gas generators can be turned on and off over the course of minutes instead of hours or days, like the others).  However, as natural gas prices have dropped, most of these power plants that used to be used for reserve power have been reallocated towards baseline power--this is why Texas has enough baseline power generation capacity, but not enough peak power capacity.  ERCOT released a study late last year that indicated that it would be cost effective for ERCOT to deploy regional battery storage devices instead of building new power plants to handle these peak power periods.  According to financial estimates, ERCOT&#x27;s power demands will result in >$4 billion/year in revenue for Tesla.  Basically, it would appear that Tesla might end up making more revenue selling these solutions to power companies than they can selling cars to consumers.<p>All of this will lead to economies of scale, further driving down Tesla&#x27;s costs and entrenching their position as the lowest-cost provider of battery storage.  All of this also means that this battery becomes an attractive device for home use, as well.  Basically, this is what a lot of people are thinking about when they talk about a &quot;smart grid&quot; that can push power back on the grid during peak demand times.<p>Here&#x27;s a couple of articles about the ERCOT annoucement:\n<a href=""http://www.texastribune.org/2014/12/15/state-law-could-short-circuit-battery-breakthrough/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texastribune.org/2014/12/15/state-law-could-short...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060008712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060008712</a>",1430464554

As demand for SSL hosting goes up, gradually replacing plaintext hosting, the price will come down.<p>I actually expect the price of plaintext HTTP hosting to go <i>up</i> a bit; partly due to reduced demand, but also due to increased risk/liability. With SSL being the &quot;industry best practice&quot;, I expect at least a few bean counters will view the risk of private information leaks or hypothetical legal liability for enabling DDOS (similar to the &quot;attractive nuisance&quot; doctrine).<p>There will be a turbulent transition period, of course. As someone currently living at the poverty line, I have argued against the CA system many times. A SSL cert (and anual renewal) may be an insignificant cost to some people, but it is a real barrier when tha cost represents days/weeks of <i>food</i>. Unfortunately, none of this removes the <i>need</i> for encryption or the risks of plaintext. This is why I&#x27;m very excited about Let’s Encrypt; It might solve the cost problem, and it might avoid the StartSSL &quot;no second-source&quot; problem because it is a protocol first.<p>Internet use is only going up, so these transition costs are only going to go up.
