I can see the bad aspects of this, as well the good ones.<p>One of the main issues, in poor neighborhoods is the government of these places invest very little in them and typically the only governmental presence is the police, which is the last line of governmental assertion (via show of force), and provide little else to get the community going strong.  That is to say, there is little put into resources for &#x27;community building&#x27;, yes, some people in those communities are less cooperative than people of more affluent communities  --by cooperative I mean working together to improve and build on their vision.<p>In these cases, one can hardly fault the police for complaining that they feel the brunt of the frustration of a population while politicians politick and like Janus, speak from two mouths and their only policy to address issues is to send in the police to stabilize a place instead of engaging the community and establishing enhancement programs.",1430618187

9479449,comment,9432068,9434341,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I&#x27;m feeling silly today, so I&#x27;ll share my favourite tin-foil hat moment.  Consider a political system where only 2 or 3 parties have a reasonable chance to get a significant number of candidates elected (significant means enough to control the direction of policy).  Also consider a system where the parties themselves select which candidates that the general voter is allowed to vote for.<p>So in other words, in any given area there will be 2 or 3 candidates that have a decent chance of winning.  Those 2 or 3 candidates are selected by their parties to be allowed to run in that area.  Obviously <i>some</i> independents will get elected, but not enough to control government policy.<p>Now imagine a system where the people who run for their parties are selected by an internal vote inside the party.  If you are not a member of the party, you have no say in which candidates are allowed to run in the area that you vote in.  Which, of course, seems completely fair because why should outsiders determine which candidates a party runs?<p>Now imagine that these votes are <i>not</i> one vote per person, but rather vote-by-proxy.  In other words, if a member of the party does not wish to vote for candidate selection, they can, instead, assign a proxy to vote for them.  In practice, there will be certain very senior people in the party who have a very large number of proxy votes that they can vote with.  The average party member will be encourage to assign their proxy to experienced, trusted party leaders because actually attending a convention and voting yourself is a PITA.  Through political dealings, there will be big blocks of votes that can can sway the selection very easily.<p>Now imagine that you are some shadowy entity outside of the political system.  You have some money that you want to use to influence the political system.  Let&#x27;s say that you want to ensure that enough people sympathetic to your cause are elected (from whatever party) so that you can control public policy.  How much money would it cost?<p>Let&#x27;s say there are 3 parties with a realistic chance of controlling public policy.  You don&#x27;t need to bribe every official.  Instead you only need to bribe the people with many proxy votes.  Those people can insist that in exchange for promoting the candidate to run in an area, the candidate must &quot;tow the party line&quot; on these kinds of issues.<p>That way the majority of the candidates that realistically stand a chance of affecting public policy are on board with the shadowy entity.  The public never really gets a chance to vote on the issue because it has all been controlled at the candidate selection level.<p>Now imagine that you are a young, idealistic candidate that will refuse to make such a horrible deal just to get selected as a candidate.  Well, you won&#x27;t be selected as a candidate.  Every 4 years you will try and try and try and after 4 or 5 times you will realize that there is absolutely no way to be a candidate without playing ball with the party politics.  By the time you are 40 or 50, you&#x27;ve become realistic and even if you hate it, you will realize that you must compromise on some issues in order to push through the issues that are more important to you.<p>And so any &quot;seriously-regarded&quot; candidate is older, because nobody gets to even pay attention to you until you agree to compromise.  And even if you agree to compromise, it takes time before the people with the proxy votes trust that you will follow through.<p>Of course the above is complete fiction.  But, I have always thought about it this way: in computer security we feel that if an exploit exists, it is only a matter of time before it is used.  The above sounds like a nice little exploit.",1430618097

Mutex kind of implies that there&#x27;s the synchronization primitive and there&#x27;s the data, and both can be touched separately but it&#x27;s just an agreement that we touch the mutex first. However, network protocols usually just transfer updates to/from the data and then let the server do the synchronization and access pairing for each connection.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would make sense at all to run a &quot;mutex service&quot; on one server and asking clients to grab that mutex before accessing another &quot;data service&quot; which would obviously allow any data updates by anyone without any synchronization at all.<p>¹ or just multiple tasks, in general. Even a single-core machine needs mutexed access to shared data because several tasks could try to concurrently use that memory location and the scheduler could switch tasks at a critical point.

I find these outbursts of genuine surprise and bewilderment amusing, in the best possible way.<p>What I&#x27;m about to suggest is not meant to remedy or suggest alternate remedies to the workings of the criminal justice system as it currently operates.<p>I&#x27;m merely expressing amusement at the colossal unfamiliarity of most of the generally law-abiding public 
(Black, White, Hispanic or otherwise) at how poorly our system works, even with the best intentions of the law makers and policy wonks.<p>I can&#x27;t but find people who expect an uniform carriage of justice, across all wealth levels, across all demographics and in all instances of law-breaking, to be nothing short of, deranged.<p>Not so long ago, I held such similar delusions of equality and fairness, albeit not to the same degree as some here on HN.<p>I always knew there was more than a little truth to the adage that it is far better to be wealthy and guilty than poor and innocent, in America.<p>Any speck of doubt cleared up after I sat in a courtroom to witness the pre-trial consultations of a high profile defendant in SF. In a criminal case.<p>It was a farce, to put it mildly. Just the resources available to the prosecutor on one side and the defendant with his high powered legal team -- which came with their own personal scribe to document the exchanges in the court, a videographer and the partner of the law firm among others -- on the other side, settled the matter for me.<p>I don&#x27;t quite know if its standard courtroom protocol to call both the parties - the prosecutor and the defendant&#x27;s attorney - into recess to discuss matters in the judge&#x27;s quarters but I counted 7 such times they just left to talk behind closed doors.<p>I was floored at the deference with which the judge spoke to the defendant. The whole thing seemed like some closed door Congressional testimony with ranking members. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it although I&#x27;ve seen the inside of a courtroom in unrelated matters before. I&#x27;ve seen common folk arraigned before. This was something else.<p>And mind you this was in  proletariat-loving SF not some courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama or Angola, Louisiana. I don&#x27;t know what one should expect in those places.<p>Try it sometime.

I&#x27;m not sure this helps solve anything in NimES, but this can be really useful for meta-programming in general. For instance I&#x27;m using it to make an event system which generates efficient dispatch lists based on the types/procs defined. It&#x27;s designed for game logic, to both minimize boiler-plate and dynamic dispatch. Ie, invocation it&#x27;s type-specific and usually does not use function pointers per-instance, so smaller &#x27;events&#x27; can be inlined. Plus, instances are generic (decoupled from object inheritance), and often don&#x27;t require any header data. That combination should, in theory (still WIP), give devs a &#x27;universal&#x27; way to model a broad range of game objects from heavy single-instance types to lightweight projectiles and particles. Here&#x27;s an example for a little clarity:<p><pre><code>  # note: &#x27;impl&#x27;, &#x27;spawn&#x27;, and &#x27;invoke&#x27; are macros
  
  type
    Foo = object
      val: int
    
    Bar = object
      val: string
  
  impl Foo:
    proc update = echo &quot;Foo: &quot;, me.val
    proc render = echo &quot;Rendering Foo!&quot;
  
  impl Bar:
    proc update = echo &quot;Bar: &quot;, me.val
  
  spawn Foo(val:123)
  spawn Bar(val:&quot;abc&quot;)
  
  invoke update
  invoke render
  invoke blah
  
  # ouptput:
  #   Foo: 123
  #   Bar: abc
  #   Rendering Foo!
  #   Invoke Error: No event &#x27;blah&#x27; defined.

If you make the set of deciders smaller this starts to go away.  This is arguably the fundamental justification for representative rather than direct democracy.
There is a nice property we believe QV has that we (myself and Richard Zeckhauser) are working to prove which is that if you have representatives elected via QV and then those representatives use QV to vote you get efficiency in a hierarchical fashion.

9479323,comment,9478906,9478906,0,0,mikekchar,,,"When we do coding at our interviews we do ping-pong pair programming.  One of the things we want to see is if the person can deal with actually doing TDD.  Usually there are 2 of us and one candidate.  We explain the problem to the candidate and ask, &quot;Do you want to write the first test, or shall we?&quot;.  We&#x27;ve done the problem hundreds of times so we know a very, very simple first test that will lead forward.  This allows the candidate to &quot;warm up&quot; a bit before they have to start thinking hard about the problem.  Sometimes they hit the ground running and are keen to write the first test, which is also fine.<p>The idea is that we switch back and forth.  One of us writes a failing test, then the candidate writes the production code. The candidate then writes the next failing test and one of us writes the production code and the next failing test.  If the candidate gets stuck, we usually try to talk through the situation and if they are <i>really</i> stuck, one of us will offer to take over.<p>The candidate is allowed to look things up on the internet and even ask questions.  Often we will suggest things.  For instance, after the candidate writes some production code, we might say, &quot;That works well.  But how about refactoring it using inject,&quot; for example.<p>I often use a pomodoro timer set to 20 minutes.  We&#x27;ll do as much as we can in the first set.  After that first set we&#x27;ll ask the candidate how they think it is going.  We&#x27;ll offer some advice about technique and such.  If it was an absolute disaster (happened a couple of times), we&#x27;ll just leave it there and thank the person for their time.  Otherwise we&#x27;ll ask if they are up for another round.  Usually the first set is pretty bad because the person may never have done real TDD before, or may find the ping-pong awkward at first, or may be very nervous.  Talking about how they are feeling at the break usually helps and the second set is much, much better.<p>After the second set we&#x27;ll ask the candidate how they think they did.  I think this is important because if the candidate says, &quot;It went really well&quot; and it was actually awful, then we have a pretty good idea of their skill level.  If they say, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really happy with my performance, but I enjoyed the style of programming&quot;, then we will have to take into consideration a variety of different factors to see if we believe that the person can do better.  If the person says, &quot;I really didn&#x27;t like working that way&quot;, then we can rule them out as a candidate regardless of their skill level (also happened a few times unfortunately).<p>The feedback we&#x27;ve gotten from candidates on the process seems to indicate that they really enjoy this interview style.  I think it removes a lot of the spotlight from the person and allows them to relax a bit.  Especially having us come in and help out in sticky situations allows the candidate to get over stupid blind spots (like the converting between string and integer in the article).  So far, I think it has helped us spot potential in a few people that I&#x27;m sure we would have overlooked using a more standard, &quot;Here, solve this problem&quot; approach.<p>On the downside, there is still considerable room for improvement.  Language lawyers (know every detail about the programming language but are still poor programmers) can often look very, very good in this kind of test.  Similarly, inexperienced but very talented people can often be frustratingly mediocre because the unfamiliar method of development can hamper their style.  You need to be very aware of the amount that the person improves during the interview.<p>One final comment about this approach.  We have occasionally been in a situation where we said, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure how good this person is.  They seem like their skills are fine, but whether they will be really excellent, I don&#x27;t know.  However, it was <i>really</i> fun programming with them.&quot;  In those cases we have hired the person and never regretted it.",1430615679

Otherwise someone would have surely demonstrated it by now? If nothing else, such a system would need to evaluate effects of its outputs on its inputs over time (e.g. if I shoot a basketball, it takes seconds before it either goes in or doesn&#x27;t; if I plant a seed in the ground, months will pass before it sprouts -- or not, depending on conditions).

That we have this inner monologue which seems to run alongside our other senses but yet makes use of them (along with stored memories) suggests, at least to me, that some more complicated pathways are involved which link together these various &quot;component systems&quot; (senses, stored memories, emotional states, linguistic synthesis, etc.) beyond just the simple prediction/reward circuitry which I presume the &quot;seed AI&quot; would encapsulate.",1430615453
