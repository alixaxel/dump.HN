I love being incorrect, it&#x27;s always a good opportunity to learn.<p>Could you please show me a C program live-diagrammed like the following CPU: <a href=""http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/index.html</a><p>Since they are basically the same and I was just abstracting away what was convenient to me. Hey, if I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I think there&#x27;s a difference. The reason we can make a live diagram like that for CPUs is that they don&#x27;t care about the &quot;state&quot; they operate, and hence are immune from problems therefrom. C programs care about the state they operate (they take conditional jumps on expressions that might be null pointers) but CPUs don&#x27;t. Every branch test the CPU runs is for sure run over a register and for sure will either succeed or fail, there&#x27;s no third choice, no bottom, no chance of it going wrong.",1432954769

But it also means that the relationship has changed and your input is recognized as much more valuable, and therefore more likely to be heeded in regard to staffing. And by &quot;worst that can happen&quot; I mean that you will be paid two or three times as much as before.<p>On the other hand, if they turn your new offer down, you&#x27;ve essentially quit with no downside other than &quot;we just can&#x27;t afford it anymore.&quot; Not really even a burned bridge since they pulled the plug, not you.

That made it easy for the tools.<p>The cool thing is that tools such as Astree and SPARK can prove portions of your code immune to certain defects. Others can do this for concurrency problems.

If we as a society decide that universities should run their own justice systems, we must accept that it will cost a lot of money and result in some amount of injustice. If that means denying education to some that cannot afford it, that is a trade-off that we must acknowledge it or increase public funding of universities.",1432952357

I&#x27;d also note that these kinds of policies often have to start out with a hair trigger due to the fundamental asymmetry between the parties; the more powerful have many avenues to shut down the weak, so the weak need large-caliber cannon to take on systemic discrimination.<p>But when the systems begin to balance out -- not many universities maintain anti-feminist or pro-racist cultures, though I can name a few that <i>do</i> -- then those same powers are easily abused, simply because there <i>aren&#x27;t</i> significant targets to go after. So, minor figures, often on the same political side as the aggrieved, are attacked using laws that are the equivalent of using grapeshot to kill a goldfish.<p>Unfortunately, as you point out, it&#x27;s hard to reform those laws, because when you have people who want to repeal progress entirely, it&#x27;s hard to distinguish (and, practically, there might not be any difference) between &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;repeal.&quot;<p>But, seriously, young people.

You can easily extend prime factorization to rational numbers by allowing negative as well as nonnegative exponents for primes. The prime factorization for 6 (and any other rational) will still be unique.<p>If you instead decided to represent the factorization of a rational as a list of factors for the numerator and another list for the denominator, your factorizations would stop being unique... but the first way works just as well.",1432952126
