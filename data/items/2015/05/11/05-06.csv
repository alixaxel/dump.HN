9522973,story,,,279,219,Merkur,"Go Lang: Comments Are Not Directives",,"Go 1.4 starts to use comments as directives. I think that is a realy bad path to go on the long run. You see its beginnings in following 3 examples:<p># used to set a canonical import path for a package:\n//import &quot;foo&quot;<p># used to generate code:\n//go:generate bar<p># used to document the result of a example function:\n//Output: foo<p>Comments should not be directives. Comments are free form, they do not have a syntax (as demonstrated in the examples). Comments are for humans - programms should ignore them or threat them as - comments!<p>It is my optinion that if Go needs some kind of annotation, than there should be a new syntax for it.<p>I would propose that directives to the tool chain will be marked with<p>#TAG: DIRECTIVE<p>a tool would be able to register the TAG with the go build environment.

9522972,comment,9522467,9522467,0,0,ffn,,,"I like how the first three or so anti-patterns are in the exact opposite direction as the last three or so. The art of being a programmer is literally &quot;don&#x27;t waste time over-thinking things, but also don&#x27;t ship under-thought trash&quot;. For all our fixation on simplistic and ease of use, programming is actually incredibly difficult and way more art than science.<p>And it&#x27;s exactly this requirement of masterful manipulation of balance that makes me love this field so much and long to get better at it. Getting a handle on the artsy spirit of programming is really what separates the wheat from the chaff in terms of programmer skill. There is no formal programmer guild in real life, but if there was, and there was some sort of test a journey-man programmer must undergo in order to become a master programmer, it would be the test of being given a large project and then deciding correctly exactly how much technical debt to take on to be able to ship a product within a reasonable time-frame and yet have its internals not be complete unmanageable spaghetti.",1431323927

9522962,comment,9522467,9522764,0,0,DSMan195276,,,"I agree - Defining a &#x27;Stack&#x27; class is useful even if it&#x27;s just a wrapper over LinkedList, because stacks have an expected way to act, and while a LinkedList fits the bill it does more then a stack actually has to do. And with that, nothing says you have to implement a &#x27;Stack&#x27; with a LinkedList, it&#x27;s just an easy way to do it. By defining the &#x27;Stack&#x27; class, you could always go back and improve it to not use LinkedList and instead do it yourself.<p>That said, I do agree with the author that, in the context of a programming class, writing the &#x27;LabStack&#x27; class is absolutely useless because it teaches you nothing about actually using a linked-list to implement a stack, which I&#x27;m sure was the real intent of the assignment. The &#x27;LabStack&#x27; class is useful in the context of being used in a larger program, it&#x27;s not really useful for learning how to actually implement a stack because it just passes the implementation off to &#x27;LabStack&#x27;. (That said, because Java doesn&#x27;t support defining objects as value-types, using the &#x27;LabStack&#x27; interface adds an extra level of indirection you may want to avoid - You have to access &#x27;this.list&#x27; to get the LinkedList object, instead of just accessing it directly. This is more a fault of Java then anything else though.).<p>The note about programming class isn&#x27;t really relevant to programming as a whole though, which is where the disconnect happens.",1431323720

A belief is an attitude toward the likely truth of something. It isn&#x27;t possible to literally believe in guns or abortions, one can only have opinions regarding their proper usage. This is likely why OP finds political discussions irrational - he is investigating political &quot;beliefs&quot; and when it becomes a debate of Truth by believers rather a debate about the best policy for the context from people with varying perspectives and opinions then of course nothing can be conceded; beliefs are fixed by faith while opinions can vary considerably.",1431323666

Consider this little Ocaml program<p><pre><code>    let ( impure, pure ) =\n      let i = ref 0 in\n      let impure x = ( i := !i + 1; x + !i ) in\n      let pure x = (\n        i := !i + 1;\n        let res = !i + x in\n        i := !i - 1;\n        res - !i ) in\n      ( impure, pure );;\n</code></pre>\nwhich returns two functions called &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot;. Both are of type int -> int. The function &quot;pure&quot; is computing the successor function (let&#x27;s ignore corner cases), but using hidden state. The function &quot;impure&quot; is using the same hidden state, but is clearly impure.<p>Is it possible to  do the same in Haskell?

I notice sometimes when I closely listen to people like he&#x27;s talking about they just having a way of speaking that makes them seem more authoritative.<p>Kind of related to the Dunn-Kruger effect where you hear people talk about something who aren&#x27;t really that knowledgeable but have a confidence about it, while those further up the curve can sometimes have impostor syndrome and know they need to work on the delivery of the message.",1431321063
9522828,comment,9520145,9522165,0,0,burkaman,,,"Well that does look simple, but first of all, it doesn&#x27;t really revert a commit. It makes a new commit to cancel out the old one, or something. Not intuitive, unexpected results if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>But the situation I got into was when I did something stupid and just wanted to undo it. Let me go back to an hour ago before I screwed up my project. That&#x27;s not revert, it&#x27;s reset, but reset only reverts the commit history, you really want reset --hard. And of course you need to be pointing to the right place for this to work, and there are other ways for it to go wrong. It might be hard to imagine if you&#x27;re at all competent with Git, but trust me when I say you can get yourself into some very frustrating scenarios if you just Google &quot;undo push&quot; and blindly follow the instructions.<p>Here&#x27;s another simple scenario: I&#x27;m working on a bug, my friend fixes it first and pushes his version. I just want to pull his changes and throw away whatever I was working on. Ok, so I find this: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/force-git-to-overwrite-local-files-on-pull?rq=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1125968/force-git-to-over...</a><p>Look how many different methods there are. Look how many warnings of &quot;THIS WILL DELETE ALL UNTRACKED FILES&quot; there are. Why is this necessary? I could rant for a while longer, but this stuff is so incredibly unfriendly and frustrating to newcomers. I don&#x27;t want to think about this stuff, I just want to go back to the code.",1431321012

Plus the speaker will think you are a good listener.<p>Step 2. Don&#x27;t nod you head more than once per sentence when listening to other people. Too much head movement reflects insecurity and immaturity.<p>Step 3. Don&#x27;t rise your inflection at the end of a sentence.
