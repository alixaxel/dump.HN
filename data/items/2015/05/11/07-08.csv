9523281,comment,9522037,9523086,0,0,e12e,,,"> even mediocre equipment (probably with exception to the speakers) nowadays is able to reach astonishing linearity.<p>While we have much better cheap amps now than we used to, there&#x27;s still quite a bit more of noise in the bottom end. You make it sound like $10 of electronics would give great sound (assuming eg: flac audio source, dac and &quot;digital&quot;[1] amplifier). It&#x27;s not quite that simple. Feeding the whole thing from a battery power source is simple, cheap and can work to reduce the most common/obvious source of noise -- the AC mains (but is only practical for head-phone use).<p>As for measuring distortion -- it&#x27;s a little bit like with lossy image codecs: it doesn&#x27;t really matter what the numbers say, what matters is how we perceive it. In audio-mastering/studio production lossy-ness matters (because if you loose n% of the signal on every iteration, and you do 100s of iterations through the pipeline, the noise crowds out the signal). In testing, it helps guide the development and production (quality assurance).<p>But in the end, that&#x27;s just a guide. The trick, is to not buy into the placebo -- while at the same time recognizing a basic fact: the human brain is great at patterns, and filtering out noise. Listen to a badly tuned radio long enough, and you no longer hear the noise. Until someone walks in and adjust it to be on station again.<p>Listening to really crappy sound (eg: at least two generations old  embedded audio from laptops -- not sure about latest generation(s)) -- there&#x27;d be a ridiculous amount of noise. Couple it with cheap head-phones with eg, little or no bass -- and listen to music like that for a couple of months -- and you&#x27;ll be able to convince yourself that that&#x27;s just fine. Just like if you smeared a thin layer of vaseline on your computer screen and left it on there for months, you&#x27;d probably stop actively noticing it was there -- but if you wiped half you would instantly see the difference.<p>Then compare it to any low-end &quot;hi-fi&quot; set-up, and you&#x27;d be surprised how much clearer, and better most things sound. If not, stick with what you like.<p>It makes absolutely no sense to buy a more expensive setup than what you can tell the difference between. And even if you <i>can</i> buying the best at any price doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>And if you want to sit in a room and really <i>listen</i> to music/soundscapes -- be that classical music, pink floyd, jazz or anything else -- the room is just as important as the gear, as other&#x27;s have mentioned.<p>Oh, and if you want to get the most out of your setup - calibration is always good. One reason I prefer stereo is that it is comparatively simple. I&#x27;m sure that in <i>theory</i> one could develop a &quot;CalMan&quot;[2] for audio -- given that pretty much every source now is digital, one could probably set up a test track that allowed one to correct for many distortions (created by the system, the speakers, the room...) in real-time.<p>But I must confess, while I would love to calibrate my monitor to get more correct color -- I&#x27;m highly sceptical of the idea of programming my DAC to get &quot;more natural&quot; sound. But that&#x27;s probably the audioplacebo talking, not the rational mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://calman.spectracal.com/store/p71/CalMAN_RGB_with_SpectraCal_C3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calman.spectracal.com/store/p71/CalMAN_RGB_with_Spect...</a>",1431331062

9523268,comment,9522973,9522973,0,0,brandonbloom,,,"Comments are also not metadata!<p>CGO, for example, expects a comment immediately before a special import statement. A blank line between that comment and the import statement means that the comment is not attached to the import statement&#x27;s AST node, and so is ignored. This confused me a fair amount when I started with CGO.<p>Part of the problem with comment syntax is that it&#x27;s intentionally lexical and uniform. This simplicity means that you can easily obliterate the content of comments at any point in the input file stream via the tokenizer. However, Go instead has to bend over backwards in it&#x27;s compiler toolchain to preserve comments beyond the lexer: in the parser, AST, code generator, etc.<p>Compare to docstrings in SmallTalk/Python/Clojure, where they are actual parsed string literals. Also compare to C#, which has explicit and distinct syntax for comments, metadata, and compiler directives. Comments can be inserted more or less anywhere. Metadata only where it&#x27;s unambiguously attached to an AST node. And directives similarly to statements, unambiguously detached from other AST nodes.<p>With proper syntax for metadata, the CGO case would have been a compile time error about no AST node for the metadata to be attached to.<p>With proper syntax for directives, the //go:generate string-scanning bug would have never happened.<p>These syntaxes must be disjoint from comment syntax to eliminate the problems.",1431330699

There is a lot at stake here.<p>This is a response to a bigger paradigm shift that is the web and software as a service and Mobiles.<p>If you are on Windows XP and windows 7 rolls out, you have the option of upgrading, not upgrading or switching to a Mac (or similar).<p>Gmail versus outlook is another good example. With Outlook you would need to shell out big bucks and wait for the next major release. A three year release cycle has really got to suck for the team. If your team&#x27;s major feature X didn&#x27;t make it in the current release, you could very well end up waiting another three years. Gmail&#x27;s releases by contrast are liberating.<p>The Chrome browser versus IE is another glaringly obvious misstep. One doesn&#x27;t even care about version numbers anymore and releases indiscriminately while the other feels like an antiquated behemoth that rears it&#x27;s ugly head every few years and then goes back into hibernation for years. It&#x27;s a shame, really.<p>The mobile landscape has shifted to something similar. My upgrades on iOS come seamlessly and effortlessly. Apple can push whatever it wants down upgrade pipeline without costs.<p>For years desktop companies have relied on pushing the hardware limits to force users to upgrade their hardware, followed by the operating system and consequently all the software running atop that OS. It has been a tremendous boon for every Windows-based software company, almost guaranteeing fresh inflows every three years. So this is going to have an impact on the entire ecosystem.<p>From a developer&#x27;s perspective:<p>Software rewrites cause regression. Microsoft has been regressing all over the place, for years now, most prominently with their Windows releases. For anyone who doesn&#x27;t write software for a living, regression happens typically when you rewrite a piece of code and in doing so reintroduce old edge conditions or have to re-tweak all the features around it. Only after that does the new rewrite start paying dividends.<p>Continuous release cycles sidestep the regression issue to some extent by making the iterations smaller and the features less jarring for the users (Windows 7).<p>As a consumer:<p>I like the AppStore model because it doesn&#x27;t charge me for versions (I know that might note bode well for developers because lifetime revenue per app becomes fairly static. A good friend of mine is just completing a rewrite of his app and his entire existing user base will probably end up getting it for free. However, this is still the option of IAP, product SKUs or subscription models).",1431330054

It allows GET for state-modifying actions, which breaks assumptions that could be made by browsers, client libraries, caches, and proxies. Also, the &quot;success&quot; field seems fishy; a 200 response code is the usual HTTP way to indicate success.<p>* The API is not resource-oriented; the URLs &quot;shuffle&quot; and &quot;draw&quot; are verbs that describe the action to take. In a &quot;real&quot; REST API, URLs define conceptual resources (nouns), and you interact with the API by interacting with those resources.<p>* The API does not use hypermedia.<p>Hypermedia and HTTP compliance are discussed elsewhere in this thread, but I wonder if others have an opinion on the fact that the API isn&#x27;t resource-oriented.<p>This &quot;resource-oriented&quot; rule has always bugged me about REST APIs. My impression has been that REST advocates claim that pretty much every API can and should be implemented with a CRUD-like interface (where the entire API consists of performing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE on a conceptual set of resources), but it seems like that would be really awkward for this &quot;deck of cards&quot; use case.

Now I&#x27;m taking an optimization course and we use only Excel. However, I&#x27;m less confident in my Excel models than I ever was in my pandas-based models.<p>I feel like we&#x27;re stretching Excel further than it really should go because it hides a lot of complexity and doesn&#x27;t allow for easy testing.  Couple this with the fact there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a large open source movement around Excel models so fewer people can verify its correctness.<p>Here&#x27;s another a Reddit thread that inspired me to ask this question: http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/35esdl/inside_the_johns_hopkins_finance_class_thats/",1431327988

Conventional CNC machines are expensive because they have to a) do accurate positioning while b) subjected to the large deflection forces involved in conventional machining.
