I usually upload the text to my server and make it a big font on a dark background so I can read on any device anywhere (since it&#x27;s only text, even 2G internet suffices). Any laptop, desktop, tablet, smartphone or even a feature phone with GPRS internet works. And I can then link it to friends also if I want to show them something.<p>But of course a real book is a real book. I like holding it as much as anyone, but like a superb meal that takes 3 hours to prepare, it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle most of the time.<p>I should mention that I don&#x27;t really read non-fiction. It&#x27;s not in the question but most people here probably read a lot of technical stuff. I&#x27;ve never really worked that way (following tutorials or reading learning books when not required by school); instead I google what I want to know and learn the ins and outs by experimenting, taking from tutorials only the parts and pieces I need. Not sure how common this is, but it works for me.",1430643548

What exactly is the massive burden with HTTPS? The computational cost is tiny and will continue to become tinier, there are free cert providers like StartSSL and more coming soon, and the implementation is simple enough that anyone managing a server should be able to handle it easily.<p>The number of websites where I wouldn&#x27;t prefer encryption and identity authentication is around zero, and the number of websites where I&#x27;m okay with someone injecting arbitrary JavaScript is exactly zero. The time people spend making flawed &quot;if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear&quot; or &quot;crypto libraries/CAs are bad, scary, and hard to use&quot; arguments would be much better spent actually trying to improve those circumstances for the inevitable and necessary shift to HTTPS everywhere.",1430643517

Instead, use a macro to generate a bunch of run-time checks against a specific value. Eg:<p><pre><code>  var eventNames {.compileTime.} = newSeq[string]()\n  \n  proc defineEvent(name:static[string]) =\n    static:\n      eventNames.add(name)\n  \n  macro checkDefined(name): stmt =\n    # begin new statement\n    result = newStmtList().add quote do:\n      echo &quot;Checking for &#x27;&quot;, `name`, &quot;&#x27;&quot;\n    \n    # loop over every known event name and\n    # build a run-time &#x27;if&#x27; check for each one.\n    for n in eventNames:\n      result.add quote do:\n        if `n` == `name`:\n          echo &quot;Found it!&quot;\n  \n  \n  # add some events to compile-time list\n  defineEvent(&quot;foo&quot;)\n  defineEvent(&quot;bar&quot;)\n  \n  # define some runtime values\n  let eventName1 = &quot;foo&quot;\n  let eventName2 = &quot;blah&quot;\n  \n  # check runtime values againts compile-time list\n  checkDefined(eventName1)\n  checkDefined(eventName2)\n  \n  # output:\n  #   Checking for &#x27;foo&#x27;\n  #   Found it!\n  #   Checking for &#x27;blah&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nNote: This will inject a bunch of &#x27;if&#x27; statements for each call to &#x27;checkDefined&#x27;, which might bloat your code.. it&#x27;s probably better to make a macro which defines a proc, then just call that to check run-time values.. but I left those kinds of details out of this illustration for the sake of simplicity.",1430642191

It&#x27;s not the start of the universe that it&#x27;s revealing information about, but rather a perpetual cycle. The universe regurgitates, it does not begin or end.<p>The idea of a cyclical universe has been around for decades (I recall seeing a diagram about it as a child 20 years ago), there isn&#x27;t a mis-understanding of what the CMB reveals. It gives evidence about the creation of our _own_ observable universe, and the state of matter moments after the creation event of _our_ universe referred to as the big bang.<p>Ideas regarding our observable universe residing in higher dimensional spaces have been around for several decades under the name Brane Cosmology. In fact this interpretation of the CMB has been studied for evidence of a &quot;mother&quot; or pre-universe state [0]. After an initial round of statistically modelling and excitement, it was found with the current abilities of the WMAP satelitte that no evidence of a such a pre-universe was detectable [1]<p>My confusion in your position is that these models are absolutely not in contradiction of the big bang model, which explains _our_ universe (saying nothing of multiverses). There can be a lot of misunderstanding in the general public regarding science and pop science and words that have specific meaning (universe, multiverse) can be used incorrectly. It&#x27;s not fair to direct mis-appropriating terms against the scientific theories themselves.<p>> Compression, release, distribution, re-compression.<p>This isn&#x27;t true for our current universe at least, we are in a run away state of expansion, there will be no re-compression.<p>> That process is going to upset a lot of people that have bet their entire professional lives on it.<p>This is a gross exaggeration. Every cosmologist I&#x27;ve known is desperately searching for something different, unintuitive, completely unexpected and exciting.

I didn&#x27;t have the time required to make sense of the opaque presentation.  However, does appear sampling biases were likely since subjects were obtained from ADHD support groups, where attendees are likely not representative of the entire ADHD population.  Furthermore, it&#x27;s not clear what, if any, diagnostic processes were used to determine ADHD status, thus the sample probably a &quot;mixed bag&quot; and hard to know which populations conclusions apply to.<p>There is a major difference between vernacular usage of &quot;ADD&quot;, and the plight of seriously affected individuals that come to clinical attention.  As I apply the term, ADHD is not a minor or trivial condition, the data show it&#x27;s associated with increased health risks, comorbid psychiatric disorders, as well as worse outcomes in social and occupational achievement.<p>Certainly it&#x27;s worth pointing out that having ADHD does <i>not</i> mean lack of abilities or talents.  It&#x27;s always the goal to enable developing talents, including in the entrepreneurial realm. In reality, the problem is having ADHD is more likely than not to impede reaching that goal.<p>The science literature on ADHD has repeatedly shown decreased success in important quality-of-life arenas, e.g., greater rates of divorce, less educational achievement, higher rates of unemployment, poorer driving records.<p>OTOH when the right treatment is provided, ADHD individuals can have a better outcome.

9480437,comment,9479679,9480420,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>Worst of all there are several redundant syncs possible. &quot;iCloud backup&quot; on default config backs up the entire device, including your Camera Roll. &quot;My Photo Stream&quot; also uploads every picture as well ass &quot;iCloud Photo Library&quot;. This turns 5GB of pictures into 15GB.</i><p>That&#x27;s a combination of misleading and outright false. What&#x27;s misleading is you&#x27;re suggesting that iCloud Backup and Photo Stream are doing redundant work. While it&#x27;s true that both involve uploading your photos, Photo Stream only keeps the last 30 days (or 1000 photos), whereas iCloud Backup is a complete backup of everything. It <i>must</i> include your complete photo library, even the photos that are currently in Photo Stream, because there&#x27;s no guarantee that the photos will still be available in Photo Stream when you decide to restore.<p>And what&#x27;s completely wrong is your assertion that iCloud Photo Library is including redundant information yet again. This is wrong because if you enable iCloud Photo Library, then your iCloud Backup stops including the camera roll. If you have both iCloud Photo Library and Photo Stream enabled, I hope it only uploads the photo once, but I haven&#x27;t done any measurements.<p>So no, this does not &quot;turn 5GB of pictures into 15GB&quot;. It&#x27;s not even 10GB (1000 photos is significantly less than 5GB).",1430640071

Something like &quot;Loop trough list of someobject.&quot; It seems obvious but it does make it a lot easier to read back code later.<p>I have to respectfully disagree. This is really, really, REALLY BAD advice.<p>One should strive to write clean code with short functions, well-named variables and parameters, so that it&#x27;s easy to understand without redundant comments like &quot;loop trough (sic.) list...&quot;. Programming languages have looping constructs (e.g. for-statement). Therefore one does not need to write a comment that describes what a for-statement does.<p>Also, do not write comments that explain what a function does. Rather, name the function so that it is obvious from the name what it does. If the function does multiple things and name would be too long, split the function into logical subroutines and name them all properly.",1430640032
