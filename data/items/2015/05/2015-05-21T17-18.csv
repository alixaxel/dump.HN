9584327,comment,9581401,9583821,0,0,avmich,,,"> this class of activity privileges the concrete over the abstract<p>Agree, however here are other considerations.<p>Symbolic analysis won over words for tasks like x^2+10x=39 , so advantages like these are not absolute.<p>Math notation continue to evolve - e.g., APL language invention attempted strict inline notation. I&#x27;d say instead of written &quot;word&quot; a generic form of communications is free-form drawing - including schemas, diagrams, graphs, blueprints. Of course here we use pen and paper, and smart computers would be careful not to get in the way of what we can do &quot;with the speed of thought&quot;. E.g., the oscillator schema which Bret displayed and then analyzed had to be first created, and to &quot;record a thought&quot; scribbling on paper a shape of a transistor is likely faster than, say, dragging it from an electronic components library, which first has to be ready for that.<p>When you don&#x27;t know a symbolic method, you use specific numbers in specific examples, look into many examples and then generalize - moving to symbols. When you already know an appropriate symbolic method, you can switch gears and instead of &quot;specific&quot; numbers use &quot;specific&quot; symbolic manipulations.",1432231167
9584326,comment,9582980,9583285,0,0,DonPellegrino,,,"For those asking &quot;How the hell does OCaml not support multicore in 2015????&quot;, this is my reply, crossposted from /r/ocaml:<p>You can make OS level threads, but they can&#x27;t be both running at the same time due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). Then why are they even there you might ask? Because it allows you to do a blocking call on a thread and to keep executing other stuff in the main thread. Other languages that have a GIL (and the same restriction) are Javascript (including Node.js), Ruby and Python.<p>Now, IN PRACTICE, things are a bit different. You&#x27;re never gonna make your own thread to block on things. You&#x27;re gonna use Lwt to manage all your concurrency so you can do tons of blocking stuff at the same time and combine the tasks nicely without ending up in a Node.js-style &quot;callback hell&quot;.<p>But still, even with tons of concurrency, you don&#x27;t have parallelism. It&#x27;s all you need for 98% of your programs, but if you then need to do heavy number-crunching it won&#x27;t be enough. This is the exact same situation that happens in Node.js, Python, etc, except that OCaml is massively faster than those languages, so even some CPU-bound work is acceptable because OCaml is really performant.<p>Currently, there&#x27;s 2 options if you wanna do CPU-bound work: you can use ctypes to call C code easily (from Lwt_preemptive) and then release the lock from within C with caml_release_runtime_system(), so your C code will be truly parallel (and running in the thread pool automatically managed by Lwt_preemptive), and you can call caml_acquire_runtime_system() before returning the result back to OCaml to get the lock back and merge back with the normal code.<p>The second option is to do an oldschool fork() and communicate with message-passing. Or have a master that manages workers and communicates with ZMQ, HTTP, TCP, IPC, etc. Or use a library that does it all for you like parmap, Async Parallel, etc etc.<p>What this &quot;multicore support&quot; means is that you&#x27;ll be able to have threads in the same process that run in parallel because the GIL is going away. In practice it&#x27;ll probably be implemented directly into Lwt so you&#x27;ll be able to do something with Lwt_preemptive and just tell it to run some function in a separate thread and then use >>= to handle its result. It&#x27;s gonna be simpler than both options I described above.<p>Again, more technical information is available in my r/ocaml post",1432231165

9584321,comment,9582980,9584163,0,0,chubot,,,"Why not C or C++?  OCaml and Rust aren&#x27;t going to interface with Python nearly as well.<p>Also, it&#x27;s trivial to write multithreaded extensions in C or C++ (at least for data processing).  You just have to make sure to release the GIL.<p>IMO the trick is to just use the Python C API, and not use any wrappers like SWIG or ctypes.  The Python C API is a little odd but it is fairly explicit.  Also, it&#x27;s better to write plain functions rather than classes, but for data processing that is natural anyway.  If you need a class, do that part in Python.<p>Writing &quot;one way&quot; extension functions (that don&#x27;t call back into Python) is quite easy and can give you a huge performance boost.<p>I think people get hung up on Python extensions because they are using TWO unfamiliar languages -- the wrapper language, and C/C++.  But if you are just using one additional language, it&#x27;s not hard to figure out.",1432231067

I love the language a lot, but it is still too immature and low level for my current situation. I ended up using F# as the compromise, which has been amazing.<p>There are some areas where OCaml is more advanced than F# (functors, the codegen from the optimized compiler, lack of the msbuild barf sandwich, less hacky on non-Windows platforms), but there are also plenty of areas where F# is more advanced than OCaml (computation expressions, code interoperability, real 32 and 64 bit integers, agents, multicore runtime).<p>I would say that if OCaml was ideal for you except for the lack of parallelism, then you should definitely check out F# before you go all the way to Rust. Rust is awesome and for the right use case you should use it, but F# is a lot closer to OCaml than Rust is.",1432231056

9584309,comment,9582078,9583337,0,0,balabaster,,,"> Homesteading is a great way to work significantly harder for a lower standard of living.<p>I disagree with the lower standard of living. My standard of living hasn&#x27;t changed any. In fact my sense of well-being and satisfaction has increased dramatically. My peace of mind that I know where my food comes from, from beginning to end is immeasurable. I will agree that it <i>was</i> a bit of work to set up, sure, but most of it takes care of itself. It takes 60 seconds to collect the eggs each morning.<p>I also disagree with your labour for money purchasing better quality food. Most of the food you buy in the store and at restaurants is packed full of stuff that&#x27;s bad for you (look at the world&#x27;s obesity and allergy problems that are escalating every year).<p>Homesteading is not analogous to living in a cabin in the woods (contrary to common belief). You can live a modern life with modern amenities while growing/making your own food which is more satisfying and better for you. We <i>still</i> have running water, a flushing toilet, a dishwasher, washer, stove, TV, cable and broadband internet - and I still live within an hour&#x27;s commute of work and still buy clothes and other goods. Without having to buy all our produce/eggs, we free up a few grand a year for other projects/vacations/trips/excursions/events. So counter to your argument that it&#x27;s a lower standard of living, our standard of living has increased.<p>Of course, you can sit in a restaurant eating high fat food joining the rest of the sedentary obese population and call that &quot;a higher standard of living&quot; if you choose; or you can use your time at the gym or out running or doing other exercise to keep your calorie balance in check, to keep our bodies healthy which takes what? Half an hour, an hour a day? I used to be like this, living the high life, enjoying the luxuries, increasing the size of my pants and my hours of exercise as each year passed. I&#x27;m done with it. I spend less time doing physical activity homesteading, I&#x27;m eating more nutritious food and I&#x27;m losing weight.<p>The other plus is that knowing how to provide all that stuff for ourselves eases our burden on the rest of society having to provide it for us and when stuff goes wrong and there&#x27;s a run on the grocery stores and shelves are emptied, us and our neighbours barely notice the difference.",1432230949

9584305,comment,9581572,9582653,0,0,eastdakota,,,"It&#x27;s a hard problem. The challenge is the vast majority of the traffic we see across Tor is malicious. I don&#x27;t mean malicious in a normative/political sense (e.g., visiting a controversial site) I mean it in the sense that it is trying to harm the visited site (e.g., spam, SQL injection, etc.). Our customers sign up for us to protect them from these malicious visitors. Tor makes users individually anonymous -- which I think is extremely important for the health of the Internet -- but the challenge is that then means we have to fall back on less granular data when assessing a visitor&#x27;s reputation (e.g., an IP address). CAPTCHAs are an imperfect way of differentiating malicious and non-malicious users both coming from a space where we see a majority of attempted harmful requests. Agree it&#x27;s not perfect, but we haven&#x27;t yet come up with a way to respect anonymity, protect our customers from attacks, and not introduce some additional annoyance/friction to good users on shared networks with a large amount of malicious traffic like Tor.<p>To be clear, we don&#x27;t disfavor (or favor) Tor exit nodes. The reputation of their IPs is generated automatically, just like the reputation of a company&#x27;s VPN or your home router. People have suggested we provide our customers a way to whitelist all of Tor&#x27;s nodes. We could do that, but I worry it may have the opposite of the intended effect. The vast majority of our customers, if given the ability to apply a rule to the Tor network, would choose to blacklist it entirely. While not the HN crowd, most site owners see Tor as a source of their headaches (e.g., credit card fraud, spam, trolling, hacking attempts, etc.). I&#x27;m not sure how we can build a system to allow customers to identify a set of IPs to whitelist without also allowing them to blacklist those IPs. I&#x27;ve been the voice internally who has resisted providing a selector on Tor but, maybe counter intuitively, because I am worried about not further harming the network&#x27;s ability to allow users to surf the network anonymously.<p>All that said, I agree right now our solution is far from perfect. I believe long term we&#x27;ll always add a bit of friction to anonymous, shared networks but I think we can make it less painful/annoying. A number of very high profile individuals ranging from human rights activists to ACLU attorneys to even Edward Snowden and Julian Assange have personally asked me to, please!, make it better. A significant portion of our team is working to improve the experience for legitimate anonymized visitors without putting our customers at more risk. We&#x27;ve gotten incrementally better, but we&#x27;re far from perfect. If you have ideas on how we can be better while still offering the protection our customers hire us for, send them our way or, better yet, come work with us. This is a hard engineering and Internet policy problem that there isn&#x27;t a silver bullet solution for but that making progress on will have an enormously positive impact to millions of Internet users globally.",1432230908

<i>sigh</i>, VMS got the link between processes, threads, I/O and waitable events (specifically, the link between tying the completion of future I/O to subsequent computation) right from day one.  And by virtue of Cutler, therefore, so did NT, and thus, Windows.<p>UNIX did not.  The core concept of separating the work (computation to be done after an event occurs) from the worker[1] (the thread that performs the work) is absent; the manifestation of that is the lack of good, completion-oriented asynchronous I/O primitives.  Instead of being able to say to the kernel &quot;here, do this, then let me know when you&#x27;re done&quot;[2] and moving on to the next piece of work in the queue, you have to do the elaborate non-blocking multiplex dance for socket I/O, palm file I/O off onto a separate set of threads that can block (or do AIO) and generally manage all threading and concurrency primitives yourself.<p>It took me ten years of UNIX systems programming to suddenly grasp the elegance of the VMS/NT/Windows approach a few years ago.  It provides you with <i>everything</i> you need to optimally exploit all your cores for work that is both heavily compute bound <i>and</i> I/O bound.<p>It has been fascinating to see the difference in performance between Linux and Windows in practice with PyParallel when Windows kernel primitives are exploited properly:<p><a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/trent/pyparallel-pycon-2015-language-summit?slide=5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/trent/pyparallel-pycon-2015-language...</a>.<p>And more recently, with 10Gbe hardware at home:<p>Linux lwan (the top performer on Techempower Framework Benchmark):<p><pre><code>    [trent@zebra/ttypts/1(~s/wrk)%] time ./wrk --timeout 120 --latency -c 256 -t 12 -d 30 http://10.0.0.2:8080/plaintext

In the US we&#x27;re okay with rich not working, but we gouge them via property tax, sales tax, taxes on investment income and estate taxes. It&#x27;s not like having Paris Hilton working a full-time job would energize the US economy.<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much a rich person works. Their &quot;work&quot; is in no way equivalent in value to their extravagant wealth. That being said, I see no better alternative to capitalism. Wealth inequality is an unfortunate side effect that is just a fact of life: it&#x27;s unfair. What I don&#x27;t like is when people try to justify their wealth as if they deserved it.",1432230257
9584226,comment,9581186,9582126,0,0,kafkaesque,,,"> what is the usefulness of philosophy?<p>This is kind of the wrong question to ask, if I may say so.<p>Once you realise that everything that is not science is philosophy, philosophy doesn&#x27;t only become interesting, but essential to living a worthwhile life.<p>A Ph.D in the comments said s/he didn&#x27;t like teaching college philosophy, and I think this is partly to blame for what Philosophy (with uppercase P) has become--people interpret philosophy as that subject you take in school with archaic, primitive ideas. Every major philosopher has probably only one good idea, yet they&#x27;ve wasted thousands of words trying to explain it or find a solution. This is what students spend most of the time studying, so it becomes tiresome.<p>Philosophy is really critical thinking and understanding the various modes of logic/reasoning our brain chooses when acting consciously or subconsciously. Our lives are not one of pure deductive reasoning. However, you&#x27;d be surprised how many people (even scientists) use deductive reasoning. Once we understand that a brain holds different modes of reasoning at the same time, we learn to talk more openly, consider another point&#x27;s of view more carefully, and attack our differences less so readily. In turn, this creates a better society--one which is based on understanding why and how we do things. The only real enemy of contemporary philosophy is tradition. And there are certainly many of those still around. But listen to a theistic philosopher speak and observe how he acts. Then listen to a dogmatic cult preacher in his multi-millionaire dollar celebrity church or from a celebrity religion. Tell me which one you prefer.<p>Philosophy teaches us to be inquisitive but not naive. It softens our emotions when considering others&#x27; differences, because most of us hold views that neither science nor philosophy can explain. Yet, just like in science, pleasure does not come from knowing the answer, rather from searching for the enigma.<p>(Edited to clarify some ideas.)",1432230244

Like if they didn&#x27;t make it optional to verify the telephone number, what would easyDNS do then? From their post, I presume they would go insane, declare Holy war on the ICANN, and then start assaulting ICANN officers with the sharp edges of their ibook 12&quot;<p>They also complain that its a huge phishing opportunity because they must send mails with a link for people to click, but according to the ICANN spec they link to the actual requirement is[1]:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
[...] sending an email requiring an affirmative response through a  tool-based authentication method such as providing a unique code that must be returned in a manner designated by the Registrar
&quot;&quot;&quot;
So the mails looking very phish-y is entirely their their own choice, the spec does not mandate that the title is &quot;Look at these funny pictures, friend&quot; or anything.<p>Finally, they complain this will lead to a lot of big sites going down because they are forced to suspend domains if people don&#x27;t take certain action within a certain time (although they don&#x27;t clearly argue that the time is too short or something like that). But big sites already go down because the dns owner has been negligent with their interactions with their registrar, like failing to pay their fees for instance.<p>So this is not a new type of problem really, you actually already have good reason to read the mail from your registrar, who knew?

None of those risks fall on people actually doing the work - their future jobs are at risk, but they&#x27;ll have been paid for time and labor spent. They will have been compensated for their input, even if the company ultimately fails.<p>By comparison, the investor who invests capital has no guarantee of compensation for his input; he eats the risk inherent in the venture, in exchange for a return on his investment if it succeeds. If it fails, he is out of his input <i>and</i> has not received any compensation for it. That is a level of risk that many people can&#x27;t take.<p>Lenders, likewise, assume risk of default. It is not the act of having money which is rewarded - simply sitting on a large pile of cash doesn&#x27;t magically spawn more money. When money is lent to other people, the lender assumes the risk for the loss of that money - the beneficiary of the loan may not pay that money back. Interest charged is payment for assumption of that risk.<p>We&#x27;ve not yet even touched on the fundamental aspect of the capital economy - mutually-beneficial exchange. Those employees that work for the startup that ends up making the investor a ton of money? They&#x27;ve gotten jobs and compensation that they wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise.

(Admittedly, I&#x27;m mostly looking at /r/bitcoin, which is unusually euphoric even for Bitcoin advocates.) The drop from $500 to $400 to $300 was sudden and unexpected, the drop to $177 was sudden and unexpected.

It&#x27;ll be interesting when the mining reward halves in 2016. Just because it will cost more than 1 BTC to mine 1 BTC doesn&#x27;t hold the price up - look at any altcoin.<p>I don&#x27;t have a figure for the bottom over 2015-2017, but given the above I find $100 entirely plausible.

9584038,comment,9577581,9577581,0,0,ngrilly,,,"<i>A copy of the comment I posted on the author’s blog</i><p>I agree that generics are very useful when writing reusable libraries, but I disagree they are absolutely necessary when writing and maintaining software at large scale. At large scale, at some point, processes communicate with other processes on the same machine or over the network, and you have to marshal/unmarshal and type check at runtime.<p>Your example with the function isInt64InSlice is a good illustration of why the lack of generics is annoying at small scale, but it hardly shows why this is a problem at large scale.<p>PostgreSQL is an example of a complex piece of software, written in C, which doesn&#x27;t use generics and is still very readable and maintainable.<p>A few other technical points:<p>- &quot;Cannot add methods to types from a different package&quot;: Would you want something like extension methods in C#?<p>- &quot;Channels are slow&quot;: I&#x27;ve read there is some work going on to improve them. That said, you admit yourself that Go is still one the best option among the &quot;concurrent&quot; languages. Are you aware of another language with a similar mechanism builtin in the language or the library and that performs better on this matter?<p>- &quot;Accidental implementation of an interface&quot;: I agree this a problem in theory, but in practice it&#x27;s very rarely an issue. Have you been beaten by that often? Do you think the benefits of implicit implementation are not worth it?<p>- &quot;Cannot implement your own exceptions&quot;: Yes you can. You can pass some value to panic and retrieve it upper in the call stack with recover and decide what to do depending on the value. It&#x27;s not something Go developers do often, but there is some use of this technique in the standard library for example. It&#x27;s explained in &quot;Effective Go&quot;.<p>- &quot;Map returns a bool instead of an error&quot;: I don&#x27;t see the issue here. A lot of other languages do the same and return a default value and/or a boolean at false when you probe a map with a missing value.<p>- &quot;Adding an item to a closed channel panics&quot;: This is a programming error, like a division by zero or an out of bounds array access.<p>- &quot;Channels as iterators&quot;: Goroutines and channels are not designed to build iterators. They offer a general low-level mechanism for concurrency. How would you expect the goroutine to know that nobody is listening anymore and shutdown?<p>About the community, I would not call it &quot;stubborn&quot;. In my experience, it is generally helpful and very professional. But I agree that the topic of generics has become a taboo, which I regret. It looks like the core team wants to focus on improving the compiler, the runtime, the library, the tooling and the garbage collector, and because of that wants to keep the language stable in the meantime. I understand the frustration, but don&#x27;t you think their decision makes sense and is the best way to use the limited resources of the core team?<p>You wrote that &quot;a language can have considerable depth while still retaining its simplicity&quot;. What languages would you recommend that solve the flaws of Go while preserving its simplicity (in terms of user experience)? It&#x27;s a sincere question. I&#x27;d like to use such a language.<p>More generally, you ask how can we make developers more productive and how can we enable them to solve problems? That&#x27;s interesting because this is precisely the question Go tries to answer. Are you sure the answer lies in a more powerful programming language? What about the runtime, the tooling, the libraries?<p>The Go team thinks the answer lies in simplicity (light syntax, garbage collection, interfaces, composition over inheritance, builtin arrays/slices/maps), builtin concurrency (goroutines, channels), great tooling (speed of compilation, go test, gofmt, godoc), easy deployment (no virtual machine, static binary).<p>Do you think the answer lies in having type parametricity, algebraic data types, pattern matching, immutability, Hindley-Milner type inference, higher kinder types, etc.? I&#x27;m not saying they are not useful or desirable. I&#x27;m just saying that the low hanging fruits in terms of developer productivity may be elsewhere.",1432228678

Ocaml is pretty predictable -- you can look at code and have a pretty good idea of what kind of code the compiler is going to generate.<p>Haskell is a lot more opaque.  Between laziness and a more rigid type system, ghc can do some pretty crazy code transformations.
