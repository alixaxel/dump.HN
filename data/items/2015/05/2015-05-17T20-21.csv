And, if she didn&#x27;t die, then the hyperbole about the &quot;life sustaining nutrition&quot; was just bullshit. It goes to make me wonder just how necessary government handouts really are.<p>Also, she has emphysema and COPD -- what are the odds that was caused by smoking? How much money does smoking cost? $5 per day? How many years did this woman smoke? Has she quit smoking? Did she die from starvation? My point is that her being deaf isn&#x27;t a money-deserving disability. There are thousands of deaf people who aren&#x27;t on welfare. Her health problems would likely have been caused by years of smoking. Why should my tax dollars go to support someone who caused many of her own problems? If I bet my life savings on blackjack, should that make me eligible for government assistance? If I am an alcoholic, should I get a liver transplant?<p>So, unless she died from starvation, the algorithm worked. She shouldn&#x27;t be getting my money just because she has had a lifetime of bad decisions. As far as the bipolar, I could point to dozens of programs in almost every state that would provide her with free care for that.<p>As far as the other gent, the prospective gang member, do we have any evidence of harm caused by that algorithm?

Adding distance[1] between the point where a decision is made and where the consequences of that decision are realized make it harder for any feedback from those consequences to affect the person making the decision. This makes the decisions worse (from lack of information) <i>and</i> the implementation worse (error must be much larger before the feedback from that error reaches the decision maker).<p>You see this effect in many areas. An obvious example is the law enforcement mentioned the article (or military), where &quot;just following orders&quot; to the modern variant of &quot;just following an algorithm&quot; end up causing problems.<p>A more interesting example might be the existence of the derivatives market and the invention of increasingly-exotic financial instruments. A bank giving someone a loan has some fairly well-known possible behaviors, and is (probably) close enough to allow feedback between the parties for things like capitalism to work (if you don&#x27;t like the bank&#x27;s behavior, you let them know that isn&#x27;t acceptable by refinancing at a different bank). On the other hand, bad decisions bundled up and hidden in collateralized debt obligations sheltered these bad decisions until the problem blew up and introduced the world to the phrase &quot;too big to fail&quot;.<p>A very interesting discussion of this problem - focused on how this kind of distance relates to human <i>honesty</i> (and rationalization) - is this RSA Animate featuring Dan Ariely: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBmJay_qdNc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBmJay_qdNc</a><p>[1] measured in either number-of-hops or time",1431895577

It takes 2 seconds to recognize that that makes no sense.<p>By root I mean by changing one aspect of your life - you&#x27;ll see considerable results. There may be 2-3 root causes, maybe even FIVE!<p>Point is it&#x27;s not insurmountable. If you talk to people who were depressed and aren&#x27;t anymore, they won&#x27;t claim it was alchemy that fixed it. More likely, they&#x27;d attribute it to feeling empowered, rather than helpless and being a victim.<p>As a personal example - I know a lady who was deeply depressed, food disorder, alcohol problems, a lot of stuff.<p>Everybody was at a loss for what the fk to do about it. Then comes my friend who happens to really like her. Guess what, they&#x27;re engaged and she&#x27;s doing A LOOOOOT better.<p>Why? Because now instead of feeling like her life is over and that she&#x27;s worthless, she can see that what she wanted (family and kids and being loved) is not some unattainable dream. She got some professional help for her disorders and while it&#x27;s a long road ahead, she&#x27;s in a different place.<p>So while there&#x27;s many things left to unroot, ONE root of finding somebody who she can see a future with, is giving her the motivation to get better.<p>These are the kinds of stories that make a lot of sense - finding something to look forward to AND feeling like you can get there, along with some help in terms of logistics goes a long way.<p>I went off on a tangent there but I&#x27;m all for CBT or whatever other techniques. Point is - if you don&#x27;t have a conscious break-through of recognizing what the problem was and how you&#x27;re fixing it and WHY it&#x27;s working, you are still lost.

In the end banner and interstitial ads need to either get better or publishers need to find another revenue model (happening already). With the rise of programmatic and more layers between publishers and brands we’ll just get shittier ads with worse targeting. IMHO banner ads are a relic from the print era where publishers had monopolies of distribution (because of substantial distribution cost and cost of entry) and could get away with some holy split between editorial and advertising. I’m not saying the internet erases those boundaries, but the culture around this division is fading (see BuzzFeed). In the near future I see massive consolidation around native and data (scenario: why wouldn’t NYTimes or whoever be better off publishing under the BuzzFeed tech which is lightyears ahead and generates real revenue by sharing DATA with advertisers not a banner-sidebar/interstitial?).<p>Sorry, hijacking the conversation into a slightly different direction.

I needed the fastest possible embeddable scripting language and interpreter. When I say &quot;fastest possible&quot;, I mean for signal processing, so my application is different from the article at hand, which is about shell scripting rather than application-embedded scripting.<p>C / TCC was great, but TCC doesn&#x27;t attach much importance to final speed optimization. I had a working prototype but ended up scrubbing it for that reason.<p>C++ / Clang / LLVM has the best end speed and optimizer, and as the article points out, the language is looking better and better. However, as a library it&#x27;s pretty massive, difficult to embed, and compilation would probably be too slow for a REPL/JIT type of situation, though I haven&#x27;t tested this with a working prototype.<p>Lua / LuaJIT is what the project is currently using. Since this is HN, I guess I don&#x27;t need to say anything about how fast it is. However, my application (and many others, I suspect) would get a large performance improvement (I estimate 3x) if the compiler was capable of working with float32 operations and of optimizing them into vectorized SIMD instructions. This is why I&#x27;m currently looking at the next possibility:<p>Javascript. With the recent introduction of different float widths and SIMD in major Javascript JIT compilers, this option is starting to be the fastest possible (in my case). I&#x27;m planning to make a prototype to verify this, and I&#x27;m not too keen on joining the JS bandwagon, but if LuaJIT development continues to be basically halted, I&#x27;ll have to get with the times. What I need is at the bottom of an epic TODO list for LuaJIT [2] that hasn&#x27;t really moved for years. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s in a position to make a move on those LuaJIT open sponsorships, I really wish they would do it!

Universe has no mind so it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere and doesn&#x27;t give a shit about anytning.<p>But you <i>do</i> have mind, and so you can choose your purpose, to decide on what you value and then go after it.<p>Values are arbitrary. Well, the most basic ones are built into you(survival and reproduction, valuing food/safety/sex), but the kind of values humans speak of when they think about a &quot;purpose&quot; are mostly made up by them(making money, raising kids, pleasing god, being a good programmer, whatever).<p>So if you&#x27;re looking for &quot;purpose&quot; it&#x27;s not about finding it somewhere in the world, but more about deciding what you want out of life. I suggest you start by deciding and being clear on what kind of things you value. Once you know what you want out of life on the high/abstract level - you look for the more concrete examples and activities that move you towards achieving these values.<p>Here&#x27;s my example. What I want the most in life, in a very abstract sense, is &quot;being clever&quot;, so I am very motivated to do everything that moves me in that general direction. More specifically, I want to be great at thinking and creating things, coming up with ideas and understanding the world. This is something I want for the sake of itself, this is what makes life fun, I value these things &quot;just because&quot;. After thinking for a while, I figured that the best practical activities that move me in the direction of these values are Computer Science, building a startup, and writing comedy/fiction.<p>So at this point my abstract desire to &quot;be clever&quot; drives my motivation to &quot;learn programming&quot; or &quot;get good at writing comedy&quot;. And from there I can come up with goals and practical projects, which I am motivated to do because they move me further towards fulfilling my values in life.<p>I went through a period of depression and apathy, and thought a lot about how to figure out what I want. I&#x27;m still scared/depressed(for various reasons, mostly related to logistics in life), but now I have figured out how to &quot;find my passion&quot; and come up with goals that make me motivated and driven. So if what I wrote makes any sense or is in any way helpful, I&#x27;m happy to talk more on the topic, if you&#x27;re interested, maybe you could bounce ideas off of me, maybe that will help you out.

I have noticed that pretty much all of my caffeine consuming co-workers need to have their coffee before I can ask them anything mildly complex. That could just be ritualistic behavior (get into work, make coffee, don&#x27;t think about work until then), but could also be caffeine dependency.",1431893224

I tend to favor solutions that simultaneously solve those problems as well, along with many others.  However, if you primarily favor the SENS approach, then I certainly agree that hunger is a large-scale orthogonal problem that needs proportionally large attention.<p>Disease, on the other hand, is not a single problem, and does not have a single solution.  Any one individual disease is far smaller of a problem.  (Even cancer, though the research on SENS is will likely need to address that one anyway in the course of figuring out how to eliminate cell death without creating cancer.)",1431893121

It wasn&#x27;t until the referendum that this situation got the spotlight.<p>Nonetheless I think in general, as a UK citizen myself, that the British (ie UK citizens, the nomenclature gets convoluted!) consider the Union to be central to UK strength as a nation in terms of society and business and much else (education, sport, language, identity, history, position on the world stage, defence, ...).<p>Dissent grows though - once the Pandora&#x27;s Box of the West Lothian Question had been opened and it started to sink in, and we saw that many in Scotland wanted to ditch the rest of the UK and make a run with what they perceived to be vital resources, that I feel rather unsettled people.
