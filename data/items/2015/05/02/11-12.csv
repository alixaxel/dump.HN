9476745,comment,9476389,9476389,0,0,carld,,,"Similar experiences and I quit coffee ~ 6 months ago. I switched to cacao; initially ground cacao beans and settled on cacao powder. For ground beans, I tried Choffy and Crio Bru through a coffee maker and then a french press. I liked it but wanted a deeper cacao flavor, moving to powder. To drink cacao with powder, I fill my travel mug with water, pour the water into a single cup coffee maker (no grounds in the filter) and place 1 1/2 - 2 T of cacao powder (usually Viva Labs or TruVibe for criollo cacao) into the mug, which mixes with the dispensed hot water. The cacao provides a boost, in a different way than coffee, and health benefits. ",1430567904

What I didn&#x27;t say: transpiling is magic fairy dust for speed, and you don&#x27;t have to care about language semantics at all.<p>What I said: &quot;unless done badly&quot; (my words on the original comment), it&#x27;s fast, as it gives you a chance to emit straightfoward C code for most operations. Now, regarding your example:<p>First, HipHop is not transpiled to C. It&#x27;s a runtime with a JIT.<p>Second, what does &quot;HipHop not supporting the entirety of the PHP runtime&quot; has to do with anything?<p>I take it you mean that the fact they had to skip some parts of the runtime for increased speed, proves something related to what I wrote. But (besides the JIT thing) PHP is not greenfield like Nim. They have a runtime, and it has to work in a certain way. PHP wasn&#x27;t designed with transpiling in mind, and HipHop had to follow it closely as a design goal. I never said runtime decisions you have to mimic to be 100% compatible can&#x27;t slow you down.",1430567346

I like working out of cafes (I&#x27;m a nomad and working from my hostel room is drab too often a week), so I often resort to Hot Chocolate or a tea. Sometimes these are overpriced so I end up going with coffee, but I have about one cup every 2-3 months I would say.<p>If you find yourself having to drink coffee a lot outside of a cafe, it may not even be a caffeine addiction. I think for a lot of people it&#x27;s just the feel and action of a coffee cup, something to do with your hands when you&#x27;re stuck on that bug or waiting for your code to build/program to launch. I think a mug of hot water is great in these circumstances. Hot water is also great for digestion, keeps your mouth (and digestive tract) clean, is pretty much free, and keeps you warm just as well as anything else in a cold room.<p>It&#x27;s a habit I picked up because my mom used to make me drink a big glass of hot water after I had icecream growing up, and I continued to do that after cold foods even after leaving home.
