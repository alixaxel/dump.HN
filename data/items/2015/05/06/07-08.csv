9497144,comment,9494472,9494472,0,0,whybroke,,,"The thesis of the article makes two assumptions: \n1. that pay differences are due to merit and\n2. employees do not want a merit based system so if they discuss salaries they will intentionally dismantle that system<p>Both of these assumptions are in error. It is the job of every business man (and likely the instinct of every human) to buy value as cheaply as possible. Thus an employer will tend offer the lowest amount possible regardless of the employees productivity. We know this happens in practice because salary negotiation is at least as critical as technical skill.<p>Additional evidence is that changing jobs results in much higher wage increase than staying put, if wages were connected to skill this would not happen. Likewise fiscal desperation of the employee results in accepting lower wages but if salary is merit based, why were those lower wages were offered in the first place. And of course we know that race, gender, marital status, religion and age were or still are factors in salary.<p>The second assumption is also thoroughly untrue. Typical human behavior is to want compensation proportional to productivity and to live in a system that allows this. The contrary has words like &quot;dishonest&quot;, &quot;cheating&quot;, &quot;theft&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; associated with it and is almost universally socially deprecated. It is exactly why grinding in video games are is popular, it taps this very fundamental desire. Which desire is exactly not being met by work so players seek simulated work after hours.",1430898886

It&#x27;s not clear to me how that&#x27;s defined, nor what the US equivalent would be....<p>As for density of US cities, Cambridge is administratively a suburb of Boston, but has a population density of 6400/km^2.

Boston itself has a population density of 5100/km^2, which is less dense.<p>OK, so maybe Cambridge is weird.  But Somerville is right next to Cambridge and has a density of 7400/km^2.  Oh, and for economic interaction purposes, Cambridge and Somerville are a lot closer to downtown Boston than many parts of Boston proper.  Similar for Chelsea (6100/km^2).  Everett (4700/km^2) and Malden (4500/km^2) are up there too.<p>Other Boston suburbs are a bit less dense: Brookline is at 3300/km^2, Watertown at 3000/km^2, Arlington at 3200/km^2.  The interesting thing is to compare those to places like Chicago (4500/km^2) or Los Angeles (3100/km^2).  Those are cities that annexed their suburbs, unlike Boston, so if you just compare the &quot;city&quot; population you&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges.  Comparing the population of the &quot;densely zoned/settled area&quot; would be useful, but no one seems to publish that.  I assume it would be possible to get that information from census data, though...<p>Of course as long as we&#x27;re talking about cities that annexed various surrounding stuff, Houston is at 1300/km^2 and so is Dallas.  ;)  Which just goes to show that comparing &quot;city&quot; stuff is hard, because cities are just so different from each other.",1430898860

Doing the same across multiple servers, yes, then you want centralized logging.

9497107,comment,9493926,9495974,0,0,Animats,,,"No, film production is not &quot;agile&quot;.  On larger productions, it&#x27;s very much a waterfall process. Everything is planned and costed in advance.  There&#x27;s a thread on here by someone in the industry who describes the process.<p>As films became more effects-heavy, the process has become even more rigid.  As someone said of a Star Wars film, &quot;Three years of pre-production, six months of principal photography, three years of post-production&quot;.  Some directors, especially ones who came from the stage, have problems with this.  For a new stage production, actors are a debugging tool. The director and actors go into an empty theater with a bare stage and work through the script to see how it plays out. Scenes and musical numbers may be added, deleted, or rearranged during this process. There have been film directors who worked that way, including some of the greats.<p>That process doesn&#x27;t scale to modern blockbusters.  Film planning today looks more like classical cartoon planning - it starts with storyboards, and gradually details are filled in. Nowadays, there&#x27;s often a &quot;pre-visualization&quot; of the entire production[1], a videogame-quality cartoon with every shot that will be in the final product.  That&#x27;s done before actual production is green-lighted.  The link below, from a Paris film school, shows previz and production scenes from some well-known movies side by side.  Iron Man looks just like its previz shots, just with higher image quality. Even the camera angles match.<p>This is not &quot;agile&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHHMLyjrn4g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHHMLyjrn4g</a>",1430898249

A booming economy with good jobs, excellent educational opportunities for children, and a robust social safety net (funded by those high taxes) will attract hard-working people from developing countries to come and work to make your economy grow even more.<p>Both Canada and Australia could have used this tactic a long time ago, but unfortunately both of them are still too strict on skilled workers and trying too hard to attract millionaires. Guess what, those millionaires will not contribute a single penny to your economy besides the initial payment, whereas a thousand skilled workers will actually pay you millions of dollars in taxes every year.",1430896699
