9496003,comment,9492381,9495636,0,0,zastavka,,,"> 2013 Hack Reactor grad here. I had actually heard this about Dev Bootcamp before applying to HR, so I asked the HR founders during my interviews if they did this and they emphatically said no.<p>Huh, interesting. I knew DBC does that too but they seemed much more upfront about it in their ad copy (and in fact it was touted as a selling point). FWIW, a/A sounds similar to HR by how you describe it; they want everyone to succeed and will give you plenty of support but if you still aren&#x27;t pulling your weight you&#x27;ll get booted. There was a guy in our cohort who dropped right before final projects and they let him come back at the same point in the next cycle but they made an exception for him because he had personal reasons for dropping.<p>But yeah, besides that, great learning environment, everyone wants everyone else to do well, build cool shit and get good jobs. I&#x27;d recommend a/A in a heartbeat to anyone, with the caveat that you&#x27;ve done enough programming to know it&#x27;s something you enjoy doing. (But the amount of Ruby you have to learn to get through the admission process successfully is a pretty decent litmus test.)",1430873860

I&#x27;m likewise mystified why you think that&#x27;s not a useful requirement or a shortcoming (even a minor one -- you&#x27;re literally refusing to engage me on this) of your design.<p>In Rust, you can implement any DSL you could implement in C precisely as you would in C, using Rust&#x27;s macro system. You define a macro inline in your file, and then you can use it right there in your file. No separate module is necessary. Rust&#x27;s macro system is pretty much strictly more powerful than that of C, so anything you can do in C macros you can do just as easily in Rust.<p>When you want more powerful syntax extension features than what Rust&#x27;s macros—or the C preprocessor—could provide, <i>then</i> you reach for the compiler plugins.<p>When it comes to Scheme-like macros, where the language in its entirety can be used at compile time, that&#x27;s where the cross-compilation story makes things more interesting. Rust&#x27;s syntax extensions are just like Scheme macros in that the entire language is available to you. In Scheme, however, your compile-time and runtime environment can generally be considered to be one and the same, which makes cross-compiling issues a lot easier to deal with. Anything available at compile time is also available at runtime, so you can do things like write modules that export functions available in arbitrary phases. In Rust, because of things like cross-compilation, this is not true: your compile time and runtime environment can be totally incompatible. You can&#x27;t just write a helper function inline in your code and expect it to be usable both at compile time and at runtime, because its compilation environment (for example, the symbols it references) may or may not exist depending on the architecture.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m &quot;refusing to engage&quot;; I&#x27;m just saying that we considered everything you&#x27;re talking about already. The Schemers on the team had exactly your complaint :) But we tried to make a simple implementation that did what Scheme did and ran headfirst into the cross-compilation issue, pushing us toward a more limited approach. It&#x27;s quite possibly doable to implement syntax extensions in such a way as to allow for the full generality of the language at compile time while still supporting cross-compilation; SBCL can cross-compile itself, for example. But it&#x27;s a lot of work, and all of the Lisps and Schemes that can do something similar have a huge amount of infrastructure to allow them to do so. (Read the SBCL cross-compilation paper, for example.) Certainly no implementations of the main compiled languages I&#x27;m aware of allow the full generality of the language to be embedded within itself without some sort of module boundary: C++ and D compilers use an interpreter for a <i>subset</i> of the language to evaluate constexpr (and the reason why the full language is not supported is, essentially, exactly this). Given that Rust is hardly unambitious to begin with, I&#x27;m OK with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t solve this problem yet.",1430872900

Hence it seems likely that if strong AI is created it will follow this paradigm and therefore such a strong AI will care about nothing other than how to maximize its objective.  Such a strong AI would be nothing like a human mind so anthropomorphised thinking is of little use in reasoning about it.<p>2) Given a sufficiently powerful optimization algorithm (say, for example, if P == NP and an efficient algorithm for an NP hard problem were discovered) one can in fact imagine the above paradigm producing an incredibly powerful intelligence, one that could discover many sub-goals for its fundamental optimization objective which the creator of the fundamental objective could not foresee.  Further it could be exceedingly effective at achieving its sub-goals, much like modern chess programs are exceedingly effective at winning at chess, but in a far more general domain.<p>There are however reasons to doubt such a danger.<p>1) If P != NP then although it should in theory be possible to achieve roughly human equivalent AI, the sort of truly superhuman AI that some fear may not in fact be possible.  In other words it may be that if P != NP there is some limit to how powerful an intelligence can become due to the combinatorial explosion that occurs when one tries to expand the range of possibilities that are considered.<p>2) Even if no such limits exist there are probably ways to maintain control over even a superintelligent AI.  A powerful optimizer would be exceedingly good at finding solutions within its own model of the world but that is only part of what is needed to construct a super AI that actually interacts with the world.  You would also need a process for creating and updating the world model based on empirical data.  This type of architecture would probably give you several powerful levers for controlling the AI and you could always let the optimizer run on the world model to check on its behavior before allowing it to act on the real world.",1430871959

I still feel like I can&#x27;t call myself a developer, since I have a poor understanding of things like JSON and asynchronous stuff.<p>I had taken an intro course a while ago in college; it was on ANT assembly language and C. So I had some understanding of if/then loops and obscure things like pointers, but I had no understanding of web development and how to create something myself. I also had no knowledge of Javascript or CSS beforehand, and little understanding of HTML. I used Codeacademy to learn the basics, and of course the wonderland, Stack Overflow :)<p>My next goal is to learn how to create an app, but I haven&#x27;t found any good resources for that yet.<p>Let me know if you have any more questions!",1430871863

The client was using it as a paper goods storage surface.<p>I brought it home, repaired the power cord, and played.  It was so-so.  I then started researching, found a trove of data on restoring/repairing, learned to be careful of the back panel art as well as the right kind of wax for the playing surface, and much more.<p>I also found companies offering replacement rubber kits, as well as spare bulbs, springs, etc.  Armed with that and a repair manual, I went through the machine, taking all of the play field apart (after photos), waxed the play field surface, carefully cleaned the parts, put them all back together, replacing burnt bulbs, broken springs, and so on.  There was also a lot of cleaning of copper contact points, as well as removal of oxide from the solenoid shafts and housings (some 20 or 30 of them).<p>New rubber _completely_ changed the dynamics - What a blast!  The ball was suddenly flying around, sometimes even hitting the glass top.<p>It is all solenoids and relays, with one main motor that controls timing.  When the ball contacts a target, it has a conducting back surface that comes into contact with another vertical contact situated right behind each target - This completed circuit energizes a specific relay, &quot;saving&quot; the state that the target was hit for the next subsequent rotation of the controlling motor.  Without this &quot;save&quot; the target hitting occurs far too rapidly to be caught by the electro-mechanical machine to be scored.<p>The motor steps/rotates one step with each registered score (or multiple scores, again due to timing), with the appropriate &quot;score&quot; going to either a 10 point mechanical wheel or a 100 point wheel and each energized relay de-energized (re-armed, as it were).  The motor shaft also has several (6?) discs with raised tabs at strategic places on the edge that are &quot;read&quot; by micro-switch followers to control various parts of the scoring electronics.  The score wheel rims are labeled with the score digits, rotating like an older odometer (or gasoline pump display) with the current status (points, games remaining).<p>All the smaller targets hit also serve to rotate an axle that has some 20 or so copper wipers that may or may not come into contact with a random assortment of contacts laid out on a circuit board - This completes the circuit and lights up the next &quot;randomly&quot; lit target(s) (imagine your hand with fingers out-stretched rotating around the center of your palm with the tips of the fingers touching on a surface that may have contact points and you get the idea).<p>I also re-enabled the tilt-mechanism - A plumb-bob-type affair suspended within a conducting frame - Move the machine too much and another circuit is completed from the plumb-bob touching the frame, through to the tilt-circuit.<p>After all of that work, rather than fit an opaque back to the back box (the original was missing), I used a sheet of Plexiglas - You can see electricity arcing during operation with the room lights turned down.<p>Lots of fun, time to clean it again.",1430871857

Just no.<p>It was the Englightenment that made the end of slavery inevitable. For instance, it is written into the US Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal and have rights. That made it inevitable that the US would eventually outlaw slavery in its territory (i.e., as soon as it would be possible for the majority of the country to force the minority---and they did, at massive expensive of lives and material).<p>And it&#x27;s not like the idea that all men are created equal was originated by the US Founding Fathers---it wasn&#x27;t. It was part of the cultural mileiu at the time. It was a recent discovery. The United States was not responsible for the Enlightenment; it was a product of the Enlightenment.<p>So, your comment is incredibly ignorant and couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. You are trashing the very time period that ended slavery.<p>Ignore history and you will be doomed to repeat it. (The Germans and the Russians did just that---creating new forms of slavery.)<p>I&#x27;m not interested in arguing the rest of your points. The evidence is out there if you care to look and think.<p>edit: So, I think I was too harsh on you, dragonwriter. I don&#x27;t want you to think I&#x27;m a giant dickbag. Going to Hitler AND Stalin that quick is kind of crazy. I still think what I said, I just think I was being too aggressive.<p>Also, if people in Plato&#x27;s time thought every subsequent generation was worse, they were probably right---at some point, the populace was so degraded that they actually would listen and seriously consider that old bastard (Plato).

Kahre&#x27;s wife produced payroll sheets based on the cash amounts. However, employees were never issued W-2 or 1099 forms, for either the cash amounts or the gold coin amounts. Notably, any employees who opted to retain coins rather than sell them had the fair market value of the coin deducted from the &#x27;amount owed&#x27; in their payroll records. Generally they didn&#x27;t, so Kahre and his wife would keep recirculating the same gold coins over and over - withdrawing a bunch of cash from the bank, &#x27;paying&#x27; an employee with coins and then &#x27;buying&#x27; them back immediately with the cash, &#x27;paying&#x27; the next employee with the coins they had just &#x27;bought&#x27; and so on.<p>Kahre was doing this not only for his own business (a drywall/construction services company) but for a bunch of other businesses in his local area, for which he raked off $14 million in fees, but didn&#x27;t see fit to file any tax returns documenting this fact. All told, the total amount of unpaid taxes in the case amounted to about $57 million.<p>This wasn&#x27;t bright,it was fraudulent. there was plenty of notice that where the market value of an asset exceeded the face value (as of these coins) that the asset was taxable as property at the market value, going to back to well before the coins in question were issued. Kahre&#x27;s legal arguments depended heavily on the fact that the matter hadn&#x27;t been litigated in court before, even though similar matters had and even though there were clear rules promulgated by the IRS. On top of that, the actual mechanics of the payment operation made it screamingly obvious that the payments in gold were nothing more than a  sham, using workers&#x27; brief physical contact with the gold coins as justification for not filing taxes while operating a parallel system of buying and selling the same coins over and over as an excuse for getting regular old cash from the employer to the workers.<p>If you actually think schemes of this kind make sense then you are a gullible person and I strongly recommend you avoid investing on the basis of these beliefs.",1430871421
