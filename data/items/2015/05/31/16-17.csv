One thing this article doesn&#x27;t mention is how utterly Lexis Nexis used to dominate the industry. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entire law profession was entirely dependent on it, and it was massively profitable. And it was independent.<p>Lexis Nexis got started in the 1960s. They came up with their own proprietary format for storing and searching over legal briefs (most of the technology we have now, such as SQL databases, did not exist then). Their format started off as text files over which they could do regex, based on your search parameters, but then they ran into issues of storage and how should they show related items? (Graph databases were a long way in the future.)<p>They came up with a solution that would seem primitive to us now, but which was cutting edge in the 1960s, and so they became very successful.<p>Then they focused on hiring sales people to be sure that every law firm in the country was dependent on them. That was surely the right move in the 1960s, but they stopped developing innovative technology. They made no significant changes to their technology till after 2000, when they were clearly in trouble.<p>Just to repeat that, they went 40 years without making any significant changes to their technology. The lawyers and the salespeople were running the company and their attitude was something like &quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&quot; This is a reasonable attitude if you are in a mature, steady, unchanging field, but they weren&#x27;t.<p>They ignored the rise of SQL databases, but they could not avoid the Internet. Around 2001 they formed a committee to explore a possible switch to an XML storage format, and they explored RDF as a way of representing the poly-hierarchy that is natural in law. RDF tools were emerging that would allow them to do graph searches.<p>I am not sure what technology they eventually decided upon. I know they did eventually modernize their technology, but they were dragged to it by the Internet, they did not do it happily.<p>I have an admiration for the startup advice that Steve Blank gives, but when I think of companies like Lexis Nexis, I find myself doubting the line &quot;A startup is a temporary organization in search of a business model, it must eventually transition to an organization that is focused on executing a proven business model.&quot; My problem with that idea is that things change over time, and all business models eventually die, and most businesses die (Lexis Nexis was eventually bought) so all businesses should be thought of as &quot;a temporary organization in search of a business model&quot; -- the moment you stop searching is the moment you start to die.",1433091591

If so, what directions are open to me?<p>Perhaps I should briefly introduce myself - I am 19, finished with high school last year, did a gap year and will start with university in Germany this October, studying biology. (In Würzburg, with the aim of going into bioinformatics.) I am a hobby programmer, started with Java close on four years ago, and have since added Python, Common Lisp and a bit of C++. I can&#x27;t really judge how good I am as a programmer, but I am starting to contribute to open source (currently, the Bazaar VCS).<p>Like just about all students, I will want to earn a bit of money by the side to see me through university. (There are no tuition fees in Germany, but living expenses need to be paid for.) I would love to be able to do this with programming - getting paid for my hobby seems pretty cool. But I don&#x27;t know how realistic this is with my level of skill, and who would hire me just for the semester holidays - or can I go freelance?

COPPA affects all websites or services even if you don&#x27;t target them at children. All it requires is that children use the service and that you have knowledge of that fact somehow. Obviously, Notch cannot claim ignorance that children play Minecraft. Indeed, COPPA is extra-territorial so Notch theoretically has to worry about it anyway - though whether the third party server thing changes stuff is unclear (I&#x27;d hope it would but I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of confidence in US law enforcement in this regard).<p>Re: sex offenders.

I remember when I was a young teenager everyone used MSN Messenger, but the notion that Microsoft was responsible for every case of child grooming that happened through it hadn&#x27;t taken hold back then. This stuff comes about because governments want to outsource the cost of enforcing the law onto random third parties instead of doing it themselves. A neat way to create invisible taxes but ultimately harmful. If there are people doing bad things on public chat services, then the police should go onto there and try to catch them (and they do).

But ALL THREE pressures would be lower than air pressure on the ground.&quot;\nI think this is incorrect. Assuming the windows are sealed at ground level, the pressure between the panes would be slightly below ground level at altitude, due to flexion of both inner and outer panes; the pressure in the cabin is substantially lower than ground level; and outside pressure is the lowest of all. Thus the pressure between the two layers is the highest of the three compartments at altitude, subjecting both layers to considerable stresses with every pressurization/depressurization cycle.

I mean it made the comic book so much more worthwhile to read. Like little cherry topping on top of a great storyline and characters. This sort of &#x27;teasing&#x27; is so prevalent in kids and teens comic books. I mean there were even more crazy ones like Ranma we watched as kids.<p>When I read the same comic book in English, all those &#x27;no no not in America&#x27; type of scenes were removed or have gone thorough de-perversion.",1433088295

It goes &quot;through&quot; the bow&#x27;s wood[1] by having just the right  wavelength for this vibration mode that its nodes point it toward the target rather than letting the arrow project along a line tangent to the wood.<p>Does that analogy of the dynamic work?<p>[1] don&#x27;t know the technical term; best I could find was &quot;back&quot; or &quot;belly&quot;",1433088246
