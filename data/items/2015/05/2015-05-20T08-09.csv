But you&#x27;ll still get Java 7, despite the fact Java 8 was released in March 2014. Giving you cutting-edge TLS1.0 and CBC ciphers [1]. And least Java 7 looks good compared to Java 6 [2] which has no SNI support, a stack of weak ciphers, and only supports the most obscure ciphers. And I know some people who are still running Java 6 in production systems.<p>If you wait for every last Java 6 holdout before deploying a secure configuration, you&#x27;ll be waiting forever.

9575168,comment,9573902,9574389,0,0,david-given,,,"I discovered Ada 2012 last year, and ended up doing a chunky writeup on it: <a href=""http://cowlark.com/2014-04-27-ada/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cowlark.com/2014-04-27-ada/index.html</a><p>It&#x27;s a seriously nice language --- it feels like a mature, well-thought-out C++ without a lot of the craziness and ancient edge cases. There are moments of sheer brilliance: the pointer scoping semantics mean that it&#x27;s actually _syntactically invalid_ to leak pointers from an inner stack frame to an outer one. Its tasking and concurrency support is amazingly good. Having proper nested functions are amazing. The type system, while no Haskell, is easily good enough to say things like &#x27;bounded array of tagged unions with length not known at compile time&#x27;, with both compile and run-time error detection. And all this produces code that performs on a par with a modern C++ compiler!<p>Here&#x27;s a multithreaded Mandelbrot renderer what I wrote: <a href=""http://ideone.com/a1ky4l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideone.com/a1ky4l</a> Note that each thread is a scoped object nested inside a function, communicating with each other via strongly typed and named messages --- startup and shutdown synchronisation happens automatically...<p>That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t warts; the OO system is pretty painful, with some annoying hidden requirements (e.g. you have to define a class&#x27; methods adjacent to the class structure itself, otherwise the compiler gets confused; if this is a requirement there should be explicit syntax for it). Having case insensitive identifiers is a complete failure. Exceptions are just plain clunky. There are a number of syntactic weirdnesses where the language got expanded beyond the original syntax&#x27; ability to cope. But the big omission is that there&#x27;s no garbage collector, even though the language was obviously designed to have one. It would be so, so much nicer to write real code in if it had one.<p>Ada really deserves to be better known than it is.",1432112050

There&#x27;s absolutely nothing to suggest they&#x27;ll de-integrate moving forward.<p>The biggest problem after this is how much the GPU and CPU have to fight over main system memory, which really brings us to the end game of GPUs altogether.

Yes, it might be a bit old-style, but it works so beautifully you just enjoy it.

  Surface temperatures may reach a high of about 20 °C (293 K; 68 °F) at noon, at the equator, and a low of about −153 °C (120 K; −243 °F) at the poles.[22] 
  Actual temperature measurements at the Viking landers&#x27; site range from −17.2 °C (256.0 K; 1.0 °F) to −107 °C (166 K; −161 °F). 
  The warmest soil temperature estimated by the Viking Orbiter was 27 °C (300 K; 81 °F).[23]
