The people who do this for a living (employers, recruiters, etc.) are always going to know the rules and the social norms better than the ones that don&#x27;t (most employees).<p>I don&#x27;t really know what you mean by &quot;ridiculous&quot; in that situation, so it&#x27;s hard to draw any conclusions, but I will say that most good engineers are pretty bad at negotiation skills, and IMHO withdrawing an offer is quite an extreme move.",1431194368

From a type theory perspective, these internal properties and the implied permitted operations come close to type definitions. It&#x27;s a matter of perspective, then, when one is using the word &#x27;type&#x27; as defined by a particular language&#x27;s spec, or &#x27;type&#x27; as in programming language pragmatics / type theory POV. For the generalist programmer who knows more than one language, a broader concept of types is usually more useful.<p>Further, the spec uses these internal properties solely to define the semantics of the language, and they are not necessarily visible artifacts of any implementation.

Use maybe eight bit (or even four bit) numbers for the matrix entries, with the philosophy that the overall degree of freedom in the system is enough to make up for this local rigidity, while you gain a lot in terms of both storage space and evaluation time.<p>Along these lines, I saw a great demo of a robot a while ago which used 256 binary devices for movement.  Each of these devices is the diagonal of a quadrilateral; when the device is in it&#x27;s &#x27;on&#x27; state, the diagonal is long, and when it&#x27;s in the &#x27;off&#x27; state the diagonal is short.  Chain a lot of these together, and you can get pretty good accuracy aiming for specific points in a two-dimensional space.  The demo I saw was a three-dimensional version of the same concept, of course.<p>So likewise, we chain together lots of linear operations to build (say) a deep learning system.  The weight space is very high-dimensional, and the decision space is the much lower dimensional classification/regression problem: one probably needs a lot less than 64 bits of accuracy in the weight space to approximate a point in the decision space.",1431193935

Not sure I see the problem here though.<p><i>Do you even understand what socket activation is? It&#x27;s a marketing buzzword for an old and simple concept, and the systemd definition in particular conflates multiple use cases. See this commentary by Laurent Bercot: <a href=""https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-994548-postdays-0-post.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-994548-postdays-0-post...</a>. </i><p>Yup, I do. Interesting comments from Laurent Bercot, unlike you he sees that the idea has merit.<p>But a few things:<p>1. He&#x27;s claiming that Pottering claims to have invented the concept of a superserver, where it was invented in inetd. Small problem: Pottering openly states this in 2011, here: <a href=""http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activation.html</a> also he seems to be claiming that Pottering says he invented pre-opened file descriptors? Guy is being a bit of an idiot as Pottering never said this.<p>2. He&#x27;s complaining about a registry of predefined sockets in configure files. Seriously? That&#x27;s his big concern? You deploy a daemon that can do socket-activation and you can&#x27;t either create a configure file or include one with the package? Wake me up with a real argument, please.<p>3. He misses the point that socket activation means that you don&#x27;t have to predefine the service order, by using sockets the service will block till the other service starts. I guess my only concern (that I&#x27;ve just though of) is how systemd handles deadlock conditions, but that isn&#x27;t a stated concern about reliability by Bercot. Bercot&#x27;s main concerns are: 1. what happens if a dependent service hangs, and 2. What happens if it&#x27;s in the middle of a transaction.<p>I guess my response is: 1. Yes, it will block forever - but if your service was reliant on a serialised startup then I&#x27;m not sure what difference this makes: what happens if an earlier service hangs and dependent services can&#x27;t run until that service has started? That used to happen to me on RedHat 5 when I accidentally forgot to turn off my misconfigured NFS server :-) 2. If you are in the middle of a transaction then again, I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any worse than the scenario I just presented.<p><i>Those features could be part of a process manager or a process supervisor, not init(8) itself. init(8)&#x27;s duties are reaping orphaned processes and handling high-level global system state at best (like SAK, shutdown, halt, etc.)</i><p>init doesn&#x27;t reap orphaned processes, it reaps zombie processes.

Many of even the most core developers see it as a hobby.<p>Then, finding customers isn&#x27;t easy. It&#x27;s not just a matter of putting a &quot;Support And Consultancy For Sale&quot; sign on your webpage. You gotta have a nice website, and you have to go and convince people that their money is well spent. And you have to make sure you have the proper infrastructure to handle those requests.<p>And once you find customers, you have to figure out how to spend that money. As the root of all evil, it can lead to tensions between developers. What used to be just for fun is now a job. This may actually <i>demotivate</i> them. And they might now have to concentrate on tasks that pay instead of tasks that are merely fun. And they might resent how the money gets distributed.<p>All of these problems can be surmounted, of course, but it&#x27;s not at all easy, and it involves a set of skills most free hackers don&#x27;t have.

Residents and nonprofit advocacy groups organized to keep the big hotels out. The high rises were built, but in the aftermath of the fight, the city passed two crucial laws. First, the city made it illegal for owners to convert SROs into tourist hotels unless they also replaced the low-income units or paid into a fund for affordable housing. Second, it passed a zoning law lowering the height maximum in the Tenderloin from 30 stories to between 8 and 13.<p>These laws made it virtually impossible for developers to “Manhattanize” the Tenderloin. Meanwhile, the nonprofits, which had lobbied for the laws and led the fight to keep out the big hotels, themselves began to buy or lease buildings. These nonprofits, which include the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation (TNDC), the Tenderloin Housing Clinic (THC), and Mercy Housing, now own or lease more than 5,000 housing units in the Tenderloin. The city plays a critical role too: It has loaned the nonprofits money to acquire or rehab about 50 properties with 4,000 affordable units, and it holds or finances master leases on dozens of other such buildings. “The Tenderloin is the only place where the nonprofits own the housing,” says Field. “This protects the poor people in the neighborhood from changes in demographics.” It also gives the nonprofits a vested interest in keeping their clients from being dispersed.<p>[...]<p>Combine that with rent control, resistance to new, higher density development and an influx of high paying tech jobs, and San Francisco&#x27;s current situation makes a lot of sense...*<p>* To be fair, policies from the &#x27;80s that closed asylums and dumped mentally ill people onto the street contributed, but SF certainly seems to have worked to maximize the effect.",1431192472

Once you have a majority in the House, you are effectively in power until your term is up and you ask the Governor General to dissolve the house and hold an election.<p>Now if a party holds a minority government (the way parliamentary systems are meant to be), there can be a vote of non-confidence to oust the governing party. At that point, the governor general has to choose between allowing a coalition (if that is indeed what the other parties want) or hold another election.<p>Public opinion does not hold sway in these matters. Our current majority government (now branded The Harper Government) was elected with ~24% of eligible voters (40% of those who actually showed up to vote). Take a look at some of the Ekos [1] polls, our governing party does not have the majority of Canadian support. There is also no way to do a MP recall campaign at the federal level, some provinces provide this though, such as BC.<p>We very much need electoral reform in Canada. Our senate is too partisan (not to mention, appointed at the whims of the governing party) and first-past-the-post is a broken electoral system.

It&#x27;s completely different from the article and I understand your criticism, just mentioning it because the documentary addresses the reasons a lot of people actually use services like Ace Cash over banks.<p>Beyond that, there&#x27;s generally an information deficiency for poor people. I come from a low-income background but we always did really well because on both sides of my family there&#x27;s a long tradition of higher education. So forms concerning finances, taxes, housing, education etc, wasn&#x27;t a challenge.<p>But I can easily see how not everyone is aware of every single value offer by different banks, especially when so many of them have a history of hidden fees and when you&#x27;re going to places like ACE Cash for your payday loans anyway.<p>I mean hell my girlfriend for example, did her Masters&#x27;, bright girl, upper middle class white family... she&#x27;s missed out on about $8k the past few years because she wasn&#x27;t aware of all the tax rules. After I talked her through it she&#x27;s now netting an additional $1.5k per year. If she&#x27;d been poor, parents illiterate, didn&#x27;t know how to use the internet properly to find information, it&#x27;d be even worse. I mean I have educated friends who&#x27;re in their 50s and they just never use the internet to compare pricing or deals. If two banks offered him an account with minimum balances, and he had one before and got fines because he wasn&#x27;t able to keep a minimum balance, it&#x27;s entirely expected that he assumes all banks are like that and goes to ACE Cash.<p>I fully agree with you, doesn&#x27;t justify the crappy journalism. That&#x27;s his job, talk to people and verify their claims and report the story. Just trying to contextualise the experiences of people the journalist probably talked to, trying to explain why they&#x27;re not using banks.<p>And I think his point is still valid which is that some of the rioting, e.g. breaking into ACE Cash, might be linked to the predatory practices of ACE Cash that the middle class never has to deal with. Which isn&#x27;t cashing checks (his mistake), but rather shit like payday loans, where a poor person earns enough, but has crappy cash flow, and has the option of payday loans which have ridiculous 5000% or 7000% interest loans on the people that can least afford them. People who put up their car for collateral lose it. And you see people who borrow $300, and end up paying $400 in interest by the time they pay off the $300 principal, when these are the same people that had to take a loan to pay the rent to avoid becoming homeless and can&#x27;t afford that.

Design this way or that way, pick your trade offs, investigate gotchas, think about what this code will be like in 10 years (most stuff I write has a long life, I don&#x27;t do web stuff), trade off robust design with get it out the door, and so on. No biggie.<p>I get my challenges now with new domains - computer vision, computation, math, etc - stuff that requires reading research papers. It&#x27;s fun. There is always a universe of things you won&#x27;t know, you just need the humility to understand that, and I think by 30 or so most of us figure that out.

Activity is kind of a god object in the Android framework. It can loosely be defined as a screen in the app. Views for example always contain a reference to their parent activity.<p>-Make a screen rotation and persist that object.<p>-During the rotation, the Activity reaches the end of its lifecycle and a new one is created.<p>-The retained object keeps a reference to its Activity. It should be collectable by the GC by now but it is not possible because of this object holding a strong reference to it.  It does not stop here, the Activity almost certainly contains references to many other objects that similarly cannot be reclaimed.<p>It might not be very similar to the leaks encountered in c/c++ but it is very easy to create such issues in GC languages such as Java.",1431190956

If this is true, surely someone on HN has some additional color to add to the claim? Is there a search we can do somewhere to see court cases revolving around CFAA filed by Oracle?<p>(b) Oracle does not in fact need the CFAA to sue people for violation of its license agreements, which is the claim other stories make for why &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; is resisting this reform. &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Law&quot; does very little to change civil enforcement of terms of service agreements.<p>(c) In all stories about Aaron&#x27;s Law, I think it&#x27;s helpful to keep in mind that while the law was named in memory of Swartz, it is not in fact a particularly powerful reform to CFAA and probably would not have done much to help Swartz himself:<p>(1) It retains the damage-based sentence acceleration property that is the worst, most dangerous feature of CFAA, and entirely the reason Swartz wasn&#x27;t assured of probation even had he been convicted.<p>(2) It removes ToS violations from the scope of felony CFAA violations --- something that&#x27;s already happening in the federal courts, post <i>Nosal</i> and <i>Drew</i> --- but Swartz&#x27; felony charges were not over ToS violations.<p>(3) It doesn&#x27;t modify the Wire Fraud statutes which Swartz was charged under.<p>(4) The felony damage threshold post-<i>Aaron&#x27;s Law</i> is $5000 --- basically, the cost of two laptops, or 3 days IT consulting --- which virtually any charged computer crime easily clears.<p>You can reasonably believe any reform of CFAA is a good thing (I don&#x27;t: I think once you pass something like &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Law&quot;, you then declare victory and put the reform effort to sleep for a decade), but I still think it&#x27;s a good thing to remember how little this reform does to fix the real problem with CFAA.
