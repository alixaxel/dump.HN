informed), but after reading four of other papers from Jeremy Bailenson,
I can tell you this much; he tends to write in an easily readable and
approachable style, and gives solid support both through his own data
and prior research references.<p>The phase &quot;source monitoring&quot; is a term of the (academic) trade, and as
far as I know, it roughly means, being aware (monitoring) of how our
experiences are occurring and have occurred in the past (i.e. from
various sources). For example, did you read it in a book? Or read it in
an article? Or see it happen live?  Or see it in a movie? Or hear it
happen live? Or hear it told to you second-hand? Or are you remembering
it from a dream you had? Or ... The methods by which our experiences
occur has an impact on how they are perceived, and an impact on how they
are later remembered.<p>Though &quot;false memories&quot; sure seems like bad linkbait phrase to use in a
title, it&#x27;s also a term of the academic trade. It means you&#x27;re unable to
differentiate between memories of actual &quot;live&quot; experiences you&#x27;ve had
in real life, and memories of perceived or &quot;make believe&quot; experiences.<p>The paper cites previous work showing how children are more susceptible
to false memories in general than adults, and then goes on to show how
children are especially susceptible to false memories induced through
immersive virtual reality.<p>If I&#x27;m _really_ lucky, maybe someone from the Stanford Virtual Human
Interaction Lab (VHIL) will show up and correct me where I&#x27;m wrong, but

What&#x27;s left at the end of Part I of Form 8949 is the net short-term capital gain or loss. If there were no gains, then obviously the net would equal the total loss.
Long-term losses are applied to long-term gains. The result, at the end of Part II of Form 8949, is the net long-term capital gain or loss. Again, if you only have a loss, then the net is a negative number.
Next, you combine the short-term and long-term results on Schedule D. At this point, a loss in one section can offset a gain in the other section. For example, if you have a net short-term loss of $1,000 and a net long-term gain of $1,200, then you&#x27;ll pay tax on only $200.
If there&#x27;s still a loss, you can deduct up to $3,000 from other income.
If you had a really bad year and ended up with a net loss of more than $3,000, you can carry forward the leftover portion to next year&#x27;s taxes. The unused loss can be applied to next year&#x27;s gains, as well as up to $3,000 of earned income. A big loss can be used as a deduction indefinitely -- another important reason to keep good records.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-losses-can-help-cut-your-tax-bill.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-losses-can-hel...</a>",1438926046

Pinterest&#x27;s number for employees that have more than 2 years of service is 7 years.

Consult a CPA with experience in this. It should be simple for them.
